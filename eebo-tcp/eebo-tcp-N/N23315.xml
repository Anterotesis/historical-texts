            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following chriſtian experiences falling into my hands, I thought well to collect and put them into ſome order for the peruſal of others.</p>
            <p>She led an exemplary life, being watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over herſelf, and zealous for the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Truth; her mind was ſo much to its centre, and her attention ſo inward, that ſhe often drew others, by her awful ſitting, into ſilence in friends' families; and, as her cup overflowed, ſhe miniſtered to them as one having authority; ſo that it may be truly ſaid, ſhe was fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</p>
            <p>Ample accounts have been received of her ſervice both in England and America, in which the Lord was pleaſed to bleſs her labour and ſanctify it to many.</p>
            <p>She mourned for the obvious declenſion of our ſociety from its primitive ſimplicity
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030834_0003_0FE99F73D83E19B8"/>in manners and conduct; often declaring, that ere it ſhone again in its ancient beauty, the rubbiſh muſt be removed, that there muſt be a diviſion between the precious and the vile, thoſe who ſerved the Lord and thoſe who ſerved him not; but before this day come, greater degrees of darkneſs would prevail amongſt us as a people, and more of the night come upon us before the day of beauty and reformation would again revive in ſplendour. And, therefore, ſhe was fervently engaged that the faithful eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where might ſtand upon their watch, and diſcharge themſelves as watchmen and watchwomen upon the walls of Zion, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their armour on and their lights burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be able to diſcover, as well as oppoſe, the approach of the enemy.</p>
            <p>The latter part of her time ſhe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much bodily weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, which often rendered her unfit for travelling; theſe ſhe called viſitations of the mercy of God to her ſoul, in order to preſerve her to Himſelf, and ſtain the beauty and glory of this world in her view, that her affections might be weaned from
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030834_0004_0FE99F761BD7B750"/>terreſtrial objects, and fixed upon thoſe things that are above, permanent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during to all eternity.</p>
            <p>That the peruſal of the following expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences may be bleſſed, and that the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of this handmaid of the Lord may excite and encourage all to preſs into the path of ſelf-denial, the ſure way to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the reſt of the righteous, in which ſhe delighted, is, reader, the fervent deſire of</p>

            <head>SOME ACCOUNT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MARY NEALE, otherwiſe Peiſley, daughter of Peter and Rachel Peiſley, was born in the year 1717, at Ballymore in the county of Kildare, in Ireland, and educated in the ſociety of the people called Quakers; but a diſpoſition to keep company unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the croſs of Chriſt, let her from truth's ſimplicity in manners and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, whereof ſhe thus expreſſes herſelf:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I count it an infinite mercy and high favour, that the omnipotent God ſuffered not the thread of my life to be cut, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many years that I lived in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his holy will; and tho' often, by the operation of his grace, inwardly touched and convicted of my errors, and the veil ſo far rent from off my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to let me ſee that I ſtood on the brink of ruin, yet did I as often ſuffer the enemy and adverſary of my ſoul again to darken my underſtanding, and benumb my ſpiritual feeling; and the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030834_0006_0FE99F8062AABD98"/>tumultuous noiſes, pleaſures and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world ſtifled the intelligence of the ſtill ſmall voice, which would have directed me, ſaying, this is the way, walk in it. Our meeting alſo was favoured with a living and powerful miniſtry, which I often ſlighted; thus have I, with my hard and impenitent heart, ſtoned his prophets, and by my unbelief and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed ſpirit, perſecuted them that were ſent to declare and proclaim the glad tidings of the goſpel; to invite and call to thoſe who were in captivity, held by the chains of ſin, to come away to the glorious liberty of the Truth. I have to remember, as an inexpreſſible favour and mercy to my ſoul, that in the height of all my vanity and ſtupidity, I was not ſuffered to run into the groſs enormities of the world: I was kept from thoſe loud, crying, hardening, black crimes, which, had I run into, might ſo highly provoke my Creator, as to have cauſed him to ſay in his wrath, "Thou ſhalt not enter into my reſt."</p>
               <p>A ſhort time before my converſion I had a fall from my horſe, by which I was apparently in danger of having my neck disjointed, and a ſudden end put to my life; as ſoon as I aroſe on my feet and recovered my ſenſes, the Lord by his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030834_0007_0FE99F825FCE74C0"/>grace and good Spirit, ſhowed me clearly that I was not in a fit condition to meet him, the juſt and holy Judge of heaven and earth, and cauſed me ſolidly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the diſmal conſequence of being hurried off the ſtage of mortality in an unprepared ſtate, the impreſſion of which never left my mind till God, by his grace, had made me more fit for his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the glory of which be given to his everlaſting name.</p>
            </q>
            <p>About this time two friends in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of truth, appointed a meeting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of that in which ſhe reſided. Their awful, reverent ſitting before the Lord, waiting upon him for his preſence and aid, ſtruck her in an unuſual manner, raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her mind a fervent enquiry after the revelation of the Father, through his Son. She had often heard tell of the comforts of the holy Spirit, the inſtruction of the light that comes by Jeſus Chriſt, and the way of ſpiritual worſhip: but ſtill remained a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the true manner of ſeeking and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, in her own experience. She has expreſſed how deeply her mind was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, by the ſilent and humble waiting of the before-mentioned friends, and by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the univerſal principle of grace ſhed in her heart, that ſhe was arouſed to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030834_0008_0FE99F8406999340"/>enquire for herſelf; and as ſhe preſſed to wiſdom's gate her ſeeking mind was ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>During this diſpenſation of inward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, ſhe was helped forward to diligence by the miniſtry of ſome of the Lord's meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who ſpoke comfortably to her ſtate, and encouraged her in perſeverance and well-doing, ſpeaking prophetically, that the Lord would raiſe up in that meeting ſome that ſhould bear his name among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and be the meſſenger of peace and glad tidings to the people, if obedience and faithfulneſs to the heavenly manifeſtations were kept to.</p>
            <p>By an humble reſignation to the divine will to form the veſſel in what manner the heavenly potter pleaſed, the work went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proſperouſly, and ſhe appears to have been an inſtance of great fervency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votedneſs to whatever the divine influence dictated, watchful to hear the voice, and obedient to fulfil the command, tho' it was in giving up that which might be as a right hand or a right eye.</p>
            <p>Her entrance into the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry was about the beginning of the year 1744, near which time ſhe had unexpected domeſtic trials, which brought her very
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030834_0009_0FE99F859C9B8068"/>low in mind, from a ſenſe of the ſingularity of her ſituation, but her truſt being in the Lord, ſhe was eminently ſupported, and writes thus to a friend.</p>
            <q>I doubt not but thou art touched in ſome degree with a ſenſe of my deep and heavy afflictions, which are of various kinds; many are the probations which I have paſſed through and ſtill am under. I can by no means ſet forth the wiſe, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and merciful manner that my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and heavenly Father has dealt with me, by fortifying my mind beforehand, and likewiſe ſupporting and upholding me under my trials; was it not in the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſs of his wiſdom, and boundleſs mercy that he ſtained the beauty of this world in my eyes, wiped off the varniſh and gilding, and let me ſee before they were ſnatched from me, that they were but momentary, fading enjoyments, and the greateſt and beſt of them were but ſhort-lived bleſſings, and ſhadows that would vaniſh away? neither did his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs end there, for he likewiſe ſhowed me what was ſubſtance, a pearl of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable value, at the ſight of which my ſoul was ſo tranſported that I cried out in an extacy of joy, "Cauſe me, Lord, to poſſeſs this treaſure, and in lieu of it diveſt me of whatever ſeems good in thy
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030834_0010_0FE99F8D56396C30"/>ſight;" this was my covenant with the King of Kings.—So great was the goodneſs of my God, diſpenſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned in wiſdom, that he did not at that time reveal himſelf to me in ſo full a manner as he has ſince done; at a time when I moſt of all wanted it; in my deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plungings, he has cauſed my ſoul to taſte of joys and conſolations which I was before a ſtranger to; nor would I have preſumed to aſk for the favours of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and reſignation, and fortitude of mind, which he has undeſervedly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me, an unworthy creature.</q>
            <p>An opportunity preſented for her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the family of a friend, within the compaſs of Mountmelick meeting, of whoſe daughter ſhe had the care; in this ſtation ſhe continued for ſome time, until ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended herſelf thereby deprived, in ſome degree, of a full liberty to exerciſe the gift received, and to live to him alone that had quickened her anew in Chriſt Jeſus; at which time ſhe writes thus to a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <q>I am reſolved, by the bleſſed aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Iſrael's God, not to bury that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, which he has given me, in the earth, nor to quit the occupying of it for any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward occupation; better would it be for me to wander as the prophets formerly did—deſtitute, diſtreſſed, and naked,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030834_0011_0FE99F8F8F493158"/>than to ſell an unfading inheritance, for any proſpect of advantage here; for I am ſure to drudge for the ſuſtenance of the body, as do the beaſts, and to live for no nobler ends, than to eat, drink and ſleep: ſuch a life is not worth living for; not that I am againſt moderate, honeſt induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, for I am convinced it is good for both body and mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About this time a concern attended her mind, to viſit friends of the three provinces, which ſhe pretty generally performed in company with Elizabeth Tomey of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, in ſweet unity and concord. They met with low times and ſeaſons, deep bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of ſpirit, and travailed for and with the ſeed, and at times were ſet at liberty, in the authority and power of truth, to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto the various claſſes of the people. Of the quarterly meeting of Ulſter province held in Lurgan, ſhe gives the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: <q>We attended the meeting of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and elders, where we had cloſe work, but the power of the Lord upheld us above the fear of man. Next day had ſome encouragement to the faithful and well minded, but could not that day reach the libertine ſpirit, but waited for renewed ſtrength from the Lord, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage againſt the Goliaths, who defy the armies of the living God, The day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030834_0012_0FE99F914D88C090"/>being Firſt-day, we ſat in a low, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, depending ſtate, until the Lord gave the ſpirit of ſupplication, after which his power was ſet over all, and teſtimony borne to his name, and tranſgreſſors were ſhowed their errors in the demonſtration of the Lord's ſpirit and power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this journey ſhe went to reſide with a relation in Borris, from whence ſhe writes as follows: <q>I am at times concerned for the whole bulk of mankind, but in a more particular manner for my kindred according to the fleſh, and eſpecially thoſe who were my companions in my former vanities, as well knowing what the life I then led would have ended in, had not my God, in his infinite mercy, opened my eyes, and ſtopped my race to ruin; and though I was in the broad way that leads to deſtruction, yet was I innocent of, and free from, the groſs enormities that are in the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereof the enemy perſuaded me, that I was ſafe enough; but alas! I found I was living as without God in the world, in forgetfulneſs of him; a ſtranger and unregenerate; in ſhort, that I was an enemy to God, and under his juſt wrath and diſpleaſure; and now I may ſay, that I am jealous with a godly jealouſy, that thou art yet in that unregenerate ſtate and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030834_0013_0FE99F9645BFB9B8"/>condition: thou wilt ſay, perhaps, thou art not called to the ſame work that I have been called to, <hi>viz.</hi> the work of the miniſtry, and have no need to know what I have experienced. If this ſhould be ſuggeſted to thy mind, it is of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for if thou haſt not been called to bear a public teſtimony, thou haſt, I doubt not, been called to holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we are told, "no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Thou haſt the ſame pure, holy God to fear, the ſame ſubtil, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied enemy to war againſt, a ſoul as precious, and that muſt abide as long as mine, either in happineſs or miſery, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it behoves thee to be as ſtrict in thy life, and as holy in thy converſation, as any other, that ſo thou mayeſt be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to evil doers, and a praiſe and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager of them that do well. For I am ſure if we be lovers and true followers of Jeſus, we cannot take pleaſure in hearing his great name profaned, and taken in vain: and the company that are guilty of ſuch things we ſhould carefully avoid, as we would an infectious perſon.</q>

               <q>It is, I think, impoſſible to be frequent in ill company, without being ſomewhat leavened into the ſame ſpirit, except we keep a ſtrict watch, and have our minds armed with the pure armour of light and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030834_0014_0FE99F9C85C99528"/>righteouſneſs. This alone can make us proof againſt the fiery darts of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which inſenſibly pierce and wound the unwary ſoul. It is our intereſt and duty, all in our power, carefully to avoid temptations, for thoſe that we muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably meet with are enough for us poor, weak creatures, to grapple with. Take care of poiſoning thy mind with vain and idle books, for I know them, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be very pernicious; let thy lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hours be ſpent in retirement, and reading the holy ſcriptures, with other good books. Remember thou art the head of a family, and it behoves thee to have a ſuperadded care, for if thy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be not good, thou wilt have much to anſwer for. Watch over thy ſiſters in love, and be not an inſtrument of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil company in their way: there is an evil thou art guilty of that is viſible to more than me, and that is thy ſlighting and neglecting week-day meetings: If thou had appointed a day to meet any of thoſe ſtyled noblemen of the earth, and thou ſlighted and neglected the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for weeks, yea, months together, would it not be a great affront and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to them? yea, and I am perſuaded thou would not do it, for fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and is the King of Kings and Lord of heaven and earth, leſs noble,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030834_0015_0FE99F9E45F373E8"/>leſs diſcerning, when he is ſlighted and neglected? I obſerve thou haſt time and leiſure to ride many miles to ſports and diverſions, ſuch as hunting, horſe-racing, and other ſights; does not this ſhow thou art a lover of pleaſure more than a lover of God, ſuch as the apoſtle declares are dead while they live? Dear couſin, bear with my dealing thus plainly; I have no view in it, but the good of thy immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul, and the eaſe of my own mind, and I ſincerely wiſh that thou and I may be prepared for our great and final change.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>We have daily inſtances of young and ſtrong being ſnatched away in their bloom as with their bones full of marrow: and why may it not be our caſe? we cannot promiſe ourſelves one hour to come, the preſent time is only ours, and Oh! it is a diſmal conſequence to launch into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity unprepared, where the worm never dieth, nor is the fire quenched: If we are ſo fond of a few tranſitory pleaſures in this world, how can we bear to be ſhut out from eternal felicity, and doomed to everlaſting miſery? I beſeech thee ſolidly to conſider theſe things, and I pray the God of love and mercy to give thee a wiſe and underſtanding heart.</q>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030834_0016_0FE99F9FD6D67B38"/>About the 8th month 1747, ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mountmelick, to the houſe of her friend where ſhe before reſided. Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance here was for a few months, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time ſhe was attacked with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in her ſtomach, which occaſioned great weakneſs, and brought her very low. In a letter to a friend ſhe thus expreſſes herſelf: <q>I gratefully acknowledge thy unmerited kindneſs in the concern thou ſhoweſt for my health; I am ſenſible it is our indiſpenſible duty to endeavour to preſerve life and health, by all lawful means that Providence is pleaſed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; were it not ſo, I often think, that mine is not worth caring for; inſtead of being uſeful to any, I fear I ſhall be a burden to the creation, and miſs the end of my being; ſurely none whom he hath ſent into life, and viſited with his match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs love and kindneſs, is more weak and unworthy than I am; and were it ſo that he, by his divine power, was pleaſed to make uſe of me, in any good work, it was all his own, of and from him alone; I could have no part in it, but as paſſive clay in his hand; and bleſſed be his name, he is not limited, nor his power confined to any inſtruments; he that found me in a polluted ſtate, can raiſe up and ſanctify many more for his work and ſervice, and that he may in theſe dark and perilous
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030834_0017_0FE99FA362AEB150"/>days, is the travail of my afflicted ſoul.</q> During this diſpenſation ſhe wrote as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows to her brother, who had frequenty occaſioned much anxiety and diſquietude to her mind:
<floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>Dear brother, for ſo thou art by nature to me, would to God thou wert ſo in a two-fold ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or new creation in Chriſt, which far exceeds all the ties of affinity or conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, and will laſt beyond the grave, never, never to be diſſolved; may thou happily experience this, before time to thee here be no more, for which end Providence has, in matchleſs love and condeſcenſion, wonderfully prolonged thy days, amidſt imminent dangers and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: may this be deeply pondered and wiſely laid to heart by thee; otherwiſe it will add weight in the balance againſt thee, in the great and notable day of account, that haſtens on us both. Thou knoweſt, dear brother, it has often been my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern thus to remind and call thee to the important buſineſs of life, and thy ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of it has almoſt diſcouraged me from further attempts; this may perhaps be the laſt; and I do, with all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency my ſoul is capable of, joined with natural affection, earneſtly deſire it may have the wiſhed-for effect. I am in a very poor ſtate of health, and little hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man probability of my being reſtored.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030834_0018_0FE99FA98E3705D8"/>My diſorder is attended with acute pain, but bleſſed for ever be the name of my God; patience equivalent thereto has been adminiſtered. How it may be with me as to life or death I cannot ſay; but this is my greateſt conſolation, and ſuch a one as is beyond the power of my tongue to expreſs, or pen to ſet forth, <hi>viz.</hi> that I have not ſpent my health and ſtrength in the gratification of my paſſions, or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual appetites, but in ſome degree in the purſuit of that which now ſtands by me, and will go with me beyond time, a good conſcience towards God, whoſe love I feel to flow in my ſoul, in ſuch a manner as to admit of no doubt, that he is my friend, or, in other words, that he is in me, and I in him, and will be ſo to all eternity, if I forſake him not: Believe me, brother, when I tell thee, at a time when diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt vaniſh, at a ſeaſon when we are beſt capable of knowing ourſelves, and judging of all things in the cleareſt manner, when the miſts of the world are removed from before our eyes, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preſented to our view—at ſuch a time as this I may tell thee, I am not afraid to die; nor is the ſound of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and eternity frightful to my ears; no, I cannot look on death as a king of terrors, but as a welcome meſſenger, who comes with a happy releaſe from all my
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030834_0019_0FE99FABA0B513D0"/>trials, temptations, and afflictions, to ſummon me to an eternity of unmixed felicity, to that which I have moſt loved and delighted in for years paſt, though favoured with but a glimpſe and foretaſte of it, whilſt my ſoul is loaded with its companion, fleſh; but what will it be when the face of the Divinity will be for ever unveiled, faith turned into viſion, and the full fruition come to? Theſe are words of truth and ſoberneſs. I know there is a kingdom of heaven, becauſe I already feel it within me, Chriſt in me, as ſaid the apoſtle, the hope of glory; and becauſe he lives, I live alſo; not merely an animal life which muſt periſh; but a life hid with Chriſt in God. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a new creation in Chriſt it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to enjoy God, or, in the words of his ſon Chriſt Jeſus, ſee or enter the kingdom of heaven; had we not bodies taken from the earth it would be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we ſhould enjoy or live by the ſame; and if we have not a new birth begotten or formed of God in us, it is likewiſe impoſſible we ſhould live to or in him; more I might ſay to illuſtrate this import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant truth to thy underſtanding, if bodily ſtrength would admit, but unleſs thou centreſt down in true ſincerity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, to the pure light of Chriſt in thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by which alone what is to be known
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030834_0020_0FE99FAD805B3B78"/>of God is manifeſt in man, theſe things, with all the other truths of the goſpel, will for ever remain a myſtery to thee, as it has done to ages and generations, and the wiſe and prudent of this world; but is revealed unto the babes that are begotten and born of the incorruptible ſeed and word of God: I conclude thy affectionate ſiſter in the hope, and Oh! that I could ſay, fellowſhip of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

            <p>About this time ſhe felt a weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to viſit the churches in England; and having obtained the concurrence of her friends, accompanied by Elizabeth Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon, ſhe ſet forward from Mountmelick in the 7th month, 1748. They attended the province meeting held at Carlow, and went from thence to Baltibois, where they had a bleſſed helping meeting. The teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony went forth to thoſe of other ſocieties. They had a meeting at Timahoe, and went thence to Dublin, where they had refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comfortable meetings, the Lord's eternal truth being over all: "We were," ſhe expreſſes in a journal kept of this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <q>comforted one in another, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled renewedly to bleſs the name of the Lord. The 27th of 7mo. we took ſhip
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030834_0021_0FE99FAF9F685050"/>for Whitehaven, and landed there the 28th; the 30th went to Pardſhaw, where was held the quarterly meeting for Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland; the public meeting proved a glorious one, and was a time of ſolid worſhip: the teſtimony of truth was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted over all, and the everlaſting goſpel freely preached. After this meeting I had great conſolation of ſoul, and we ſpent the evening in company with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral friends, in agreeable, edifying conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in much freedom and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit. Next day, being the firſt of the week, we went to their general meeting at Cockermouth, the 3d to Whitehaven, low and depreſſed in ſpirit. Next day had a meeting there, in which I cleared myſelf; was led therein to ſet forth the call and qualification of a true goſpel miniſter; left it in peace of mind, but much ſpent in body with the ſervice thereof. The 5th had a meeting in Bronghton, where we were led to ſpeak cloſely to ſome who had been viſited in their young years, and were now grown lukewarm and indifferent. The 6th had a good meeting at Iſell, though ſmall. Next day were at Keſwick, the ſervice chiefly to thoſe not of our ſociety; had ſome cloſe things to deliver to thoſe that were. The 9th at Allonby, whither came many friends from other meetings, to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030834_0022_0FE99FB31BBE3028"/>whom truth was fully declared. From hence to Holme, where we had a ſilent meeting, and underſtood they ſeldom ſat free from diſturbers. The 10th had a low ſeaſon at Kirkbride, the 11th at Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the 12th at Wigton, which was large, but low as to the dominion of life; next day had a meeting at Moore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, things cloſe and hard to deliver; at Carliſle, we had a good open meeting, my mind being much enlarged amongſt them, yet felt a concern reſt with me to have another meeting in that city, which friends readily agreed to. The 15th had a meeting at Kirklington, which was large and ſatisfactory, and another at Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſle in the evening: in conſequence of the concern already mentioned, there came a great number of the town's folk; when I got there I found myſelf ſo weak in body and poor in ſpirit, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo unſettled in their minds, that I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feared I ſhould not be able to anſwer the ſervice of the meeting. I earneſtly deſired that the cauſe and teſtimony of truth might not ſuffer, let me ſuffer what I might; I had not ſat long, till I found a flow of doctrine open in my mind; I ſtood up in the fear of the Lord, and the people ſoon became quiet and ſolid; I was ſtrengthened beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and the meeting ended well;
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030834_0023_0FE99FB9C8BE1538"/>and bleſſed be the name of the Lord, I had great peace and ſatisfaction after it was over. Went hence to Scotby, and had a meeting; ſo to Ann Greenup's, and was at the monthly meeting in that quarter, where my mind was under much ſuffering; but as I waited, the power of truth aroſe, and I found eaſe and liberty of mind; was led in a very cloſe man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the ſeed had dominion, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of truth was over all. Went next day to Moſedale, and had a travailing ſeaſon in that meeting: thence to Terrill, and had a poor meeting there; thence to Iſaac Thompſon's, being very poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and low in mind. Next day, we reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſpending the day much in retirement, which proved very helpful to me; and as I waited on the Lord to have my ſpiritual ſtrength renewed, felt a concern to have a meeting with the inhabitants, and one in the afternoon at Penrith on Firſt-day. After I had well conſidered and weighed theſe things, the friend, with whom we lodged, ſaid; they were a people of no religion, which did not diſcourage me, for it immediately aroſe in my mind, that, they had the more need of help, and that, perhaps, they might more readily receive the truth, than thoſe who were more bigotted to ceremonies. We went to Penrith next morning; the friends
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030834_0024_0FE99FBB79493CC8"/>aſked me if I would have an afternoon meeting, I replied that, I could better tell at the concluſion of the firſt meeting. We went to meeting and it proved a good one, for truth had dominion and was over all; then I felt ſtrength to have an afternoon meeting appointed, which was large and to great ſatisfaction, ſome of the town's folks being at the forenoon meeting, and the town pretty large, the report ſpread and the people came till the houſe could hold no more, with conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; after this I ſpoke of the meeting which my mind was drawn to propoſe at Amenbridge, where a friend ſaid there had been none before; friends ſeemed willing, but knew of no place to hold it in, except the houſe where we lodged, which was large enough, and would have done well for the purpoſe, but the friend ſaid he could not admit of it, for fear of his landlord, who was a prieſt; I ſaid, I could not force their hearts nor houſes, but hoped, as I had laid it before them, I ſhould be made eaſy; and if not, I did not doubt that if I went to ſome of thoſe who profeſſed not with us, I ſhould be accommodated; he ſaid, there was a town a mile off, that he thought would anſwer better for a meeting, and that their town's people would go thither; I told him I dare not go in my own will to have meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030834_0025_0FE99FBF221A9F10"/>where I pleaſed, but where truth led me; he replied, if the folks of Penrith heard of the meeting, the ſtreets, much leſs the houſe, would not hold them; then, ſaid I, we may go to the fields. This, I believe, ſtirred him up—he went away, and in a ſhort time returned, and told me not to be uneaſy, I ſhould have a meeting; and accordingly it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to begin at 6 o'clock next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at another friend's houſe in the town, which proved quite too ſmall. They made all the room they could in two apartments and a hall, but many were at the windows who could not get in. We had a meeting at Strickland in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, which had before been appointed. When I came to ſee and ſit amongſt the people at Amenbridge, they ſeemed ſo ignorant of our manner of worſhip and principles, that my faith almoſt failed to doing any ſervice, or adminiſtering help to them. After ſome time of waiting for divine aid, I ſtood up, and they appeared to me as ſtill and attentive while I was ſpeaking, as ever I obſerved any aſſembly. I laboured amongſt them till my natural ſtrength failed, and after meeting was over, I had great inward peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Next day we waited for their monthly meeting at Aldſtone, and paid a viſit to a friend's family, where we had a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030834_0026_0FE99FC409DFF058"/>ſweet conſolatory opportunity; and ſame evening went towards Northumberland. The 25th we continued our journey, a very difficult and dangerous road; much of it mountainous, and though reckoned but 14 miles, it took from 9 in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till 6 in the evening, ſaye that we ſtopped a little to refreſh ourſelves: my mind was preſerved tranquil and eaſy. Next day we had a hard, laborious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but I was mercifully helped through, to the eaſe of my own mind, The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day went to Cornwood, where had a meeting. The 27th rode to Allen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, and the way being rough and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, it was dangerous. My compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was thrown from her horſe, and I ſeemed in imminent danger, the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrow, and a conſiderable precipice juſt by where my horſe ſtood, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrupted by my companion's fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was very uneaſy; but at length, through the merciful interpoſition of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, ſhe was taken up, very little hurt, and they got me ſafe off my horſe. We arrived wearied with fright and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. In a ſhort time friends got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we had a comfortable, good meeting, which amply made amends for all we went through. The 28th had a large meeting. My Spirit was under deep ſuffering before I went to it, and for ſome
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030834_0027_0FE99FC76E259170"/>time after but, through divine aid, I fully cleared myſelf. When I came to my lodging, I was under a baptiſm of ſpirit, and could not tell the cauſe. I examined myſelf, and brought things to the cloſeſt ſcrutiny, to know whether I had done or committed any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to truth, but could find no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. At dinner, I felt the ſpirit of ſupplication, which I gave way to, and found my mind free and eaſy. Next morning the 29th ſet out for Benfield; it was ſuch hard weather, friends would have had us ſtay, but as the meeting was appointed I could not be eaſy ſo to do. It blew ſuch a violent ſtorm, that it was with difficulty we could ſit our horſes, or they keep their feet, being ſeveral times blown out of the path. It was 14 miles over a black moor, where there was no ſhelter; our guides miſſed the way twice, once on the open moor. My companion, who was a young traveller, was diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, ſtopped ſeveral times, wept and ſaid, ſhe thought ſhe could hold it no longer. I encouraged her to hold out to the end, and told her, there was no abiding there. By the Lord's mercy, my mind was kept quiet and ſtill, and about 7 at night we got ſafe to our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where we had an hearty welcome. The meeting was appointed to begin at 9
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030834_0028_0FE99FC9935D4A68"/>next morning; it was ſmall, but greatly to my ſatisfaction. I was led in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to ſome perſon who was under a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to join in marriage with one of another ſociety, and likewiſe to declare that I had no outward information. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meeting, an elderly friend told me, that I had hit the mark to an hair's breadth, for there was a young man, whom he knew was under ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had been adviſed againſt it. Went that night to Newcaſtle, upon Tyne, 11 miles, ſtaid there ſeveral days, had a good meeting on 5th day, being 3d of 9th mo. though ſome ſtates hard to ſpeak to, there being ſome deiſtical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I believe, cheriſhed amongſt them; and ſo cloſe was the teſtimony, that they could ſcarcely bear to ſit. After this meeting, a friend told me I had ſpoken by revelation, but was ſo prudent as to ſay no more, as we were to ſtay until after the next Firſt-day, to equip ourſelves for continuing our journey. In the interim viſited the aged, who were confined with weakneſs. Firſt day truth eminently helped with its ancient beauty and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſpelling all miſts and clouds; a glorious time it was to the comfort and edification of the church; the afternoon meeting was very full of friends, and thoſe of other ſocieties. It proved to me
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030834_0029_0FE99FCE93A68098"/>a ſweet conſolating time; the ſpring of life being opened for my own help and furtherance in beſt things; but had not any thing to communicate to the people. The 6th went to Shields, and had a ſmall meeting. In the evening went to Sunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. The 7th had a meeting in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, to an increaſe of comfort, and praiſe to him that exalts his own teſtimony in the hearts of his children, and gives tongue and utterance to magnify his name and power: Had a refreſhing ſeaſon in the family where we lodged, the Lord breaking to us the bread of life for the nouriſhment of our ſouls, and after had an evening meeting appointed which was large and to good ſatisfaction. The 8th had a meeting at Shotton. The 9th at Durham, the 10th at Auckland, which was a good meeting, and I felt a concern to have another there in the afternoon, of which I acquainted the friend with whom we lodged; he pleaded many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes; I told him, I apprehended it was not the buſineſs of a miniſter to proceed contrary to the minds of friends, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally one ſo young as I; and that, as I had told my concern, I hoped I ſhould be eaſy; and, if not, I could but come back again. My mind was ſoon relieved of its burden; as the Lord my God knew my willingneſs to obey him, he required no
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030834_0030_0FE99FD1ED640690"/>impoſſibility of me. Next day went ſix miles to Raby, and had a large meeting there, ſeveral friends coming from divers places to meet us; but that ſpirit that obſtructs the ſpring of the miniſtry, was amongſt them, and made it hard to ſpeak; though, by Divine aſſiſtance, I was enabled to clear myſelf, and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with peace of mind. My compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſo ill that ſhe was detained from meeting two days. The 13th went to Lartington to meeting, and returned in the afternoon. Next day to Darlington, and had a meeting there the 15th; it ended well though hard in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The day following went to Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; had a full meeting, and came away in peace. The 17th had a meeting at Yarme; it was ſmall, ſeveral young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came from Stockton, and it proved upon the whole to good ſatisfaction. Next day was at a ſmall meeting, where ſat a pretty while in ſilence and a ſtate of mourning for the cauſe of truth. I eaſed my mind amongſt them, and came away in peace. The 21ſt had a meeting at Giſborough, and 23d at Mooreſome. The 24th was at the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meeting held at Caſtletown, where were many plain, honeſt, ſincere friends, and we were comforted in the Lord and in one another. Next evening at Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derweil
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030834_0031_0FE99FD4F36902C0"/>and Roxby. The 26th went to Whitby, and that evening had meeting with ſeveral friends who came to ſee us. Next day attended a large meeting; my ſpirit was under great ſuffering, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo until the afternoon, though I had delivered in the forenoon meeting, what appeared to be given me; but in the afternoon the power of truth was in dominion, and every oppoſite ſpirit made ſubject; things were ſpoken to cloſely and clearly, and Babylon threſhed as with a ſharp inſtrument, that ſhe could not get from under. Then was my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit made eaſy, and my ſoul rejoiced in the Lord, who is worthy, and prayer, praiſes, and thankſgiving, aſcended unto him that lives for ever. Had the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of ſeveral friends this evening, which was ſpent in, I hope, profitable conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. The 28th had a meeting at Sten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tondale. The friends in this quarter are but few, I think eight families compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meeting; it was with theſe few a memorable ſeaſon of humbling glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Came to Scarborough in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and next day had a large and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory meeting. In a friend's family where we ſpent the evening, had a reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, affecting ſeaſon, manifeſted by much brokenneſs of ſpirit. The 1ſt of 10th month had a meeting at Pickerington,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030834_0032_0FE99FD6FB435360"/>and the 2d at Kirkbymoorſide, which was large, and attended with the going forth of ſome ſeaſoning inſtruction. Went after meeting to John Richardſon's, a man near 84 years of age, very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſweetneſs and livelineſs of ſpirit; full of love, clear in his underſtanding, and his memory ſtrong. He ſat up till late with us, relating the wonderful deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord with him, which was truly edifying, and ſuch as I had never heard before. He was quite open with us, which I looked upon as a favour from the Lord; I wept much at parting with him, and when we took leave, he deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lord might bleſs us. Next day went to Malton. The day following had a large meeting, and paſſed through a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious exerciſe amongſt them. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening was ſpent to ſpiritual profit, in waiting for a renewal of ſtrength, and imparting ſome of the bread handed to my ſoul to others, whom I viſited in their families: left this place with peace of mind. The 6th was at a monthly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Bridlington: it was a ſeaſon of ſuffering, my mind very low after it; which cauſed an examination; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to accuſe myſelf of, was made eaſy. The 7th we were at Hornſea meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Lord's eternal power broke in upon us, to the comfort and refreshment
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030834_0033_0FE99FDA4BF67C18"/>of our ſouls, and it was a time of ſolemn worſhip. Next day we were at a meeting at Ouſtwick, to our great comfort, and ſolid refreſhment. The 9th at Eaſt-end. The 10th had an evening meeting at Hull, to profit and edification, through the aboundings of that life which enlightens and ſanctifies. The 11th went to Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a town where no friend lives, having felt a particular draft to have a meeting there; ſeveral friends from Hull attended, and the people flocked in until the houſe was near filled. I ſtood up and began to ſpeak; but people ruſhed in ſo, that I was under the neceſſity of ſtopping, until they were ſettled; I then proceeded, and a glorious meeting it was, the divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority of truth commanding ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence throughout the multitude. Next day we went to viſit a few at Skitby that were lately convinced, with whom we had a good meeting, and ſome open, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble converſation. The 13th we went to Northcave, friends from ſeveral parts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent came thither: which made the meeting large, but not open and lively; we had hard labour, yet ended pretty well. The 14th had a meeting at How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, there were but few friends, and ſome of the town's people, who being in the Iſhmaelitiſh, mocking ſpirit, the true ſeed did not reign amongſt them. The 15th
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030834_0034_0FE99FE00F867108"/>were at Ratcliff. The 16th at Thorn. The 17th at Braithwaite, and the 18th again at Thorn. Theſe meetings were generally ſmall, and low as to the life of religion, which cauſed laborious work to get down to the ſeed, ſo as to miniſter to the ſtates of the people. The 20th had a meeting at Beltoft, which proved ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; ſome who were not of our ſociety at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that were very ſolid and attentive; ſome were tendered, and ſeveral came in the evening, with a deſire of having a meeting with us; but feeling no concern for it, I could not encourage it. 22d viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meeting of Blyth, in Notingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, which began at two o'clock, I was led very cloſely in it, had to remind them of the practice of our elders; and told them, if they would ſearch from whence that cuſtom of deferring meetings until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, had its origin, they would find it was not in the truth. It ended well, in the ſweet conſolating love of the Lord my God. The friend we lodged with, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at meeting, but engaged in his ſhop, I had ſome cloſe diſcourſe with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his duty to God; at firſt he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put it off, but was brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce with what I ſaid. Next day had a ſmall, but good meeting at Wamſworth; had a looſe, libertine ſpirit to ſpeak to; which the authority of truth helped me
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030834_0035_0FE99FE2473127F0"/>through with, to the enlargement of peace in my own boſom, and the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that power, which, when it rules, cauſes the righteous to rejoice. The 25th being Firſt-day, was at Pontefract meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſeemed very weak and dwarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, as to the life of religion; their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due liberty in externals, manifeſting that their dwellings were not with the humble ſeed, that crucifies to the world, and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes its beauty. Had little to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, yet felt a revival of light and ſtrength to my own ſtate. I had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to have a meeting with thoſe not of our ſociety, a great number attended, many of whom were light and vain, but while I was exerciſed in ſpeaking, they were moſtly quiet and attentive, and I hope the opportunity was to edification. The 26th had a meeting at Selby, which was but ſmall. That evening went to York, and attended the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which began at 5 o'clock, it was a ſeaſon of travail and exerciſe to a living remnant. Next morning, at 9, the meeting of miniſters and elders began, when the baptizing power of the Lord was witneſſed by the faithful, and, through the ſucceeding meetings, help was graciouſly afforded, and the church was edified.</q>

            <p>The following letter was written to a friend from Bradford, in Yorkſhire, 2d of the 11th month, 1748.</p>
            <q>
               <p>A few days ago thy acceptable letter reached me at the city of York, which I read with a mixture of ſatisfaction and ſorrow: ſatisfaction to find, that thou ſtill retaineſt thy love to the eternal excellency; and ſorrow, that the powers of darkneſs ſhould ſtill ſo far prevail, as to cauſe ſuch ſtruggles of ſoul, and ſore conflicts of ſpirit, as thou ſpeakeſt of: but I have not the leaſt doubt of thy deliverance, and firmly believe thy God will magnify and exalt his own divine power in thy ſoul; and make bare his holy arm for thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by revealing it in thee, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing preſerver in every needful time. This I write not altogether from myſelf, nor the impulſe of friendſhip and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; it is from a degree of that aſſurance and confidence, which truth has at this juncture communicated. It is reaſonable
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030834_0037_0FE99FE6B6A768C8"/>to think by thy complaint, the time of thy releaſe is at hand; it was ſo with Iſrael when they were to be brought out of that dark land; their taſk-maſters were harder, and their burdens made heavier; for, I believe, there has no temptation befallen thee, but what has been witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thy brethren who have trodden the ſame ſteps, even through the region and ſhadow of death; by the gates of hell, yea, out of the belly of hell have ſome called as Jonah did, and He heard them. His righteous ear is not grown heavy that he cannot hear, but for the ſighing of the poor, and groaning of the needy ſoul, he will yet ariſe; and then it is that all our enemies are ſcattered; one enabled to chaſe a thouſand, and two to put ten thouſand to flight. Though, it muſt be confeſſed, it is a day of darkneſs, famine and diſtreſs, yea, thick darkneſs, that may be felt; yet bleſſed be the name of our God, he is as a Goſhen to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, giving them light in their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſetting a mark upon them that ſigh and mourn for the abominations of the people. Thou ſeemeſt willing to give me an idea of thy ſpiritual ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by an outward repreſentation; but I think I may ſay, I have both ſeen and felt it, by ſinking down below all that is of the creature, to the pure humble ſeed of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030834_0038_0FE99FEAAA09F298"/>life; where the viſions of light are ſeen, and the voice of the great oracle heard, diſtinct from any other. Here have I found thee preſent, in him that is omnipreſent, and tenderly ſympathized with thy ſoul, according to my ſmall meaſure. In this do I deſire to have our friendſhip renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fellowſhip kept ſteadfaſt, which is with the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>I take kind thy ſeaſonable warning to watchfulneſs, which I ſurely ſtand in need of, in this time that drowſineſs and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual lethargy have generally infected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Thou wilt, perhaps, like to hear an account of my ſpiritual progreſs, and travel Zion-wards, and of the ſtates of the churches here, ſo far as my ſight can reach; and I may ſay, it has been a real grief and affliction to my mind, to ſee the deſolation, darkneſs, and inſenſibility that generally prevail; having been made to go mourning on my way, with this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in my ſoul, Lord, to whom haſt thou ſent me? where ſhall I find thy flock and family upon earth? for I ſee very few who like even to hear or ſpeak of thee; and, ſurely, if thy love had the pre-eminence, out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth would ſpeak, or, at leaſt, the ſoul love to wait in ſilence for thy divine appearance. But alas!
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030834_0039_0FE99FED9DC9A028"/>many ſeem to have nothing further to enquire about, than whence we came? whither we go? our names, or if we be married? to which I often anſwer, I hope I have been honourably eſpouſed to one huſband, but they are quite ignorant of him whom my ſoul loveth, and of my meaning. Yet although it be thus, there is a living remnant in this part of the world, but under great ſuffering and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, with which I have been made deeply to ſympathize, and have greatly admired the Lord's goodneſs and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending love; his forbearance and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a diſobedient and gainſaying peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not willing that they ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p>As to my own particular, I find the truth of that ſaying, that "they who preach the goſpel, live by it," in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe; and though the Lord has been pleaſed at times to cauſe his candle to ſhine upon my head, and clothe me with his royal robes, yet I often witneſs a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entirely emptied, ſtripped, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute almoſt of daily bread, and have had, as Mordecai, to go down and ſit at the king's gate; all which I ſee is for my good; for when a ciſtern is let dry, the earthy ſediment is diſcovered; a fit time for cleanſing it, that ſo the water may flow from it with greater purity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030834_0040_0FE99FF13793DFF0"/>I ſtrive to learn that great leſſon, of being content in all ſtates, and may ſay to the praiſe and honour of my kind maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he hath (ſince I have given up the ſame to ſerve him) cauſed his peace to flow in my ſoul as a river, whoſe current is not long to be controlled by all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which can be laid in its way. Bleſſed for ever be his holy name, he has afforded me ſtrength to diſcharge myſelf faithfully, wherever my lot has been caſt, both publicly and privately; ſo that I have no condemnation on that account, nor have I repented leaving all to anſwer his holy requirings, but humbly thank him, that he enabled me ſo to do; and were crowns and diadems laid at my feet, I would not give his approbation for them.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude I would ſay, beware of Eſau's crime; it was when his ſoul was ready to faint, he deſpiſed his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; when he had been eagerly purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething he delighted in, he came to this unwiſe concluſion, "Behold I am at the point to die, and what profit ſhall this birthright do me?" He wanted pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſolid reflection, and afterwards had bitterly to repent when too late. Had he not reſigned it, none could have taken it from him; neither can all the powers
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030834_0041_0FE99FF2C7212E18"/>of darkneſs from thee, if thou reſolve to keep it; this muſt be done, by cleaving to the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and all thy ſtrength, which that thou mayeſt be enabled to do is my fervent prayer.</p>
               <p>As I quietly rode along, the Lord was pleaſed in mercy, to break in upon my mind, by his living preſence and power, and it became the language of my ſoul, "Speak, Lord, and thy ſervant will hear." After which many things were divinely opened to me, wherein I greatly rejoiced, and was thankful to the Lord my God: I then found a ſudden, but gentle rebuke, and heard as it were a voice, that ſaid in the ſecret of my ſoul, "the diſpenſations thou moſt delighteſt in, are leaſt pleaſing to me, and not ſo beneficial to thy ſoul, as that pure poverty of ſpirit, brokenneſs and contrition of heart, which brings into humility of mind, and the reaſon why this is ſo little deſired, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant to the creature, is, that it can have no part therein, but is wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and ſet at naught; can diſcover no beauty or excellency in it; and for this cauſe it is, that I will in no wiſe deſpiſe the offering of a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite ſpirit, as it is moſt pure and without mixture of the creature. For, whether
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030834_0042_0FE99FF5B55342A8"/>there be prophecies, divine openings or revelation, conſolations, joying or rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Holy Ghoſt, gifts of healing or tongue of utterance, in all theſe ſelf can rejoice, and have a ſhare, being obvious to it, and bringing it honour." Then ſaid I, "Lord diſpenſe to me what is moſt pleaſing to thee, and beſt for my ſoul, ſo long as my weak faith and patience can endure, and when I am ready to faint, give me a little of the wine, well refined on the lees, that my ſoul may rejoice in thee, the God of my ſalvation."</p>
            </q>
            <p>From London ſhe wrote to a friend after this manner:</p>
            <q>There are many hindering things to obſtruct us in our journey; enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and enemies without, with the general luke-warmneſs and indifferency about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that prevails among the profeſſors of chriſtianity, of all ſects and denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſo far as I ſee, their example, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of inciting to zeal, for the cauſe of God and the purſuit of virtue and piety, their deadneſs, dryneſs, carnality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, are in great danger of leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the ſame ſpirit. I find occaſion for a ſtrict and conſtant watch, with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer to the God of my life, for help, ſtrength, and deliverance from the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030834_0043_0FE99FFAE40C1A88"/>fleſh, the world, and ſatan, which war againſt my ſoul. And I bleſs his great and glorious name, in that he ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, by the inſhining of his divine light, to keep me ſenſible of my weakneſs, frailty, and manifold infirmities; and the need I have of looking ſteadily to my holy head, and of the help of my fellow mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the myſtical body. I have often deſired, when ſcarce able to pray or breathe for myſelf, that he might be pleaſed to hear, and have regard to their good deſires for my preſervation, and I think I have often witneſſed the benefit of the help of their ſpirits. I have been through the north, ſouth, eaſt, and weſt of this nation, at the meetings generally, great and ſmall; there now remain ſeveral of the mid-land counties, which I believe will take me up moſt of this ſummer; and then I hope to ſee my native land in peace, which will be matter of comfort to me, for a large ſhare of ſuffering has fallen to my lot in this land: but none of thoſe things move me, neither count I my life dear, in compariſon, that I win Chriſt, the hope of glory: yea, I have rejoiced to be found worthy to ſuffer for his ſake, knowing it is ſuch that ſhall reign with him. Surely of all perils by ſea and land, there are none ſo hard to bear, as that of falſe brethren, which I
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030834_0044_0FE99FFC858A6948"/>have not been exempt from: but through all, am preſerved in peace of mind, and reſtored to a far better ſtate of bodily health, than I once expected; for which great bleſſings, with all other unmerited favours, I humbly deſire to be made and kept truly thankful.</q>
            <p>The following was written to two friends in the miniſtry.</p>
            <q>Many things have occurred, to hinder my writing to you ſooner, not that I have any thing material to communicate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my own particular, which I hope you are not altogether ſtrangers to; if I may boldly lay claim to a part in the myſtical body, whereof Chriſt is the head; members of which, I fully believe you are, and doubtleſs have had a feeling in ſpirit of a weak member ſuffering, though far remote in body, yet preſent in him that is omnipreſent. For I may truly ſay of late, it has been a time of deep trial to my poor ſoul, its beloved having withdrawn as behind the curtain; and not only ſo, but ſuffered the accuſer of the brethren, to caſt ſome of his moſt fiery darts at me, and roar upon me like a lion; yet was the Lord's good ſpirit lifted up as a ſtandard in the moſt needful time. I humbly hope, it was for the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030834_0045_0FE99FFFDA38F788"/>refining of my faith and fitting for further ſervice, becauſe we can never ſo effectually or certainly ſpeak of the wiles of ſatan, and God's deliverance from them, as when we have ſeen them in ourſelves. If I know my own heart, I am truly willing to be emptied as from veſſel to veſſel, that ſo I may have no lees or dregs to ſettle on. I do not complain of the Lord's dealings with me, but rejoice that I am counted worthy, in ſome meaſure, to ſuffer, and deſire I may be humbly thankful, that he is uſing means, ſuch as comport with his infinite wiſdom, for my preſervation from the epidemical diſorders which abound in the viſible churches, profeſſing godlineſs. I travelled a week in the county of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk in ſilence, was at ſix appointed meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and had not ſtrength to open my mouth in any of them; a path, I am ready to think, more will be called into, if rightly ſubject to the divine will, for the church in many places groans under a dead, lifeleſs miniſtry.</q>
            <p>She wrote the following letter to a friend in the miniſtry, who was inſtrumental, in the Lord's hands, to impart ſuch help and counſel, as had a tendency to awaken her when in the ſleep of carnal eaſe and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:030834_0046_0FE9A0066E9E0948"/>Such a jealouſy as poſſeſſed the mind of the eminent apoſtle, concerning the believers in his day, hath laid hold of me concerning thee; which was, leſt he that beguiled Eve, ſhould beguile thee, from the ſmplicity that is in the truth. As I was this day in my ſolitary retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it was brought into my thoughts, to write thee a few lines, and I reaſoned thus with myſelf. What ſhall I, who am a poor weak child, ſay to one who was in Chriſt before me, and inſtrumental in the great hand, to beget me in the truth; I likewiſe remembered, the apoſtle tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in birth for his little children, made mention of them day and night in his prayers, wrote them excellent epiſtles, and eſpecially to his ſon Timothy, who was engaged in the weighty work of the miniſtry. What excellent fatherly inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does he give him, but none from the ſon to the father. Where is thine to me in this the day of my great trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe? Ah! where is that which ſhould come upon thee daily, the care of all the churches, or at leaſt the heritages of thy God? I wiſh no other care may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded itſelf in the room thereof, which may have cauſed thee to fall aſleep, in this lukewarm, backſliding, degenerate age. Be arouzed, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, thy ſoul's and the church's. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030834_0047_0FE9A00826339A20"/>what thou art doing with theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent talents, which the Lord has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy truſt. If thou ſhould ceaſe to uſe them to the honour of his name, thoſe who are as the ſtones of the ſtreet, will cry out againſt thee, and I, if I keep my place, will be a witneſs to the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of that gift, thou haſt received. Do not again become a ſlave to the world. Conſider the dignity of thy high and holy calling, which is no leſs than that of a king's ſon, to be an heir with God, and co-heir with Chriſt. Suffer not a ſenſual, worldly tincture, to pervert thy taſte, from that fountain of life, which thy ſoul had once ſo quick a reliſh for, and thirſted after, even as the hunted hart does after the water brooks. Bear with my freedom and jealouſy, which proceeds from the univerſal love of God, that wiſhes well to all. I would not have thee think I write from prejudice of mind (thou knoweſt there is no cauſe for that) nor yet from information. No, I never heard one word againſt thee ſince I left you. I ſhould be pleaſed to hear from thee, how it fares with thee, for I long to hear of thy proſperity in the truth, which would be a great comfort to my poor ſoul, that oft goes mourning as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the porch and the altar, for the deſolation of ſpiritual Jeruſalem. Let us

            <p>The following letter was to a relation.</p>
            <q>The one thing needful is only worth our care and conſtant purſuit; and ſurely there are many impediments and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances in this dangerous, deluding world, that are often ready to turn us out of that narrow path which leads to life: This has my ſoul experienced, by being drawn aſide through unwatchfulneſs, and the prevalence of temptations, and I have found it hard work to return into the right path. I have many times thought a ſoul rightly influenced and affected with the love of God, is like the needle touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the load-ſtone, that which ever way it be turned, reſts not nor ſettles, till it comes to its true centre, that is, while it retains the virtue of the load-ſtone. Thus it is with the ſoul that has been quickened and renewed, by that efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power, which has been extended to draw our ſouls from earth to heaven; for certain it is, they have a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſink into the earth, or earthly

He ſees nothing in us, pure, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or lovely, but as his own work of grace is ſuffered to be carried on, that ſo Chriſt may be made of God to us, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification, and redemption; and to do all in our power to facilitate and help forward this great and glorious work, is the important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our lives.</q>
            <p>The following letter was written to a friend in the miniſtry.</p>
            <q>Since we parted thou haſt been ſo much in my thoughts, with ſtrong deſires for thy preſervation and growth in the ever bleſſed truth, that I could not avoid

And ah! ſaith my ſoul, may no other concern whatſoever, eraſe the remembrance of it from our minds, ſo as to hinder us from preferring it before our chiefeſt joy. This is what will make for our peace here, and eternal ſalvation hereafter, which it is our buſineſs and intereſt to purſue, with the utmoſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance our frail nature is capable of, ſeeing our adverſary goes about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour; and not only ſo, but as a ſubtle ſerpent, working in a myſtery of darkneſs, by which he has drawn down to the earth, many bright ſtars, cauſing them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the glory, honour, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of this wicked world, inſtead of the precious faith delivered to the ſaints, which powerfully works by love, to the purifying of the ſoul, and making them pure and holy, as he that hath called them is holy. Oh! may my ſoul fear always, leſt I, or any of my dear brethren and ſiſters in the truth, ſhould fall ſhort of an admittance in the great and notable day that draws near apace. When I conſider the very few bright, ſhining examples that this age affords, who have diſintereſtedly
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030834_0051_0FE9A1D86FFAE5E0"/>devoted themſelves to the ſervice of truth, and been kept unſpotted of the world, having on the white linen which is the righteouſneſs of ſaints, my fears are aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and my cries to the God of my life increaſed, not only for my own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but that of his heritage in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. In a peculiar manner am I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for thoſe whom he hath called to the weighty work of the miniſtry, that the eyes of our ſouls may be kept ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to the honour of God, as that we may miniſter ſuitably, from the divine ſpirit, to the ſtates and conditions of the people, without partiality, or reſpect to perſons, for in this caſe (as ſaith the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) if we have reſpect for perſons, we commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>h. In order to avoid this hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, dangerous crime, we had need to take notice of the wiſe caution frequently mentioned in the writings of our worthy elders and faithful miniſters, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this latter day; not to be taken by the affectionate part with any, leſt it ſhould prevent ſeeing rightly the ſituation of the lowly ſeed of immortal life, and hinder miniſtering ſuitably to it, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter life and ſtrength to that which ſhould be ſlain, famiſhed and brought to the death of the croſs. Oh! may we fulfil our miniſtry ſo as to be pure from the blood of all men, in the tremendous

            <p>A letter written to two friends ſhe was nearly united to in ſpirit, runs thus:</p>
            <q>I received your acceptable letter at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and would have anſwered it ere now, but for want of leiſure, and ſometimes a fit frame of mind, being many times deeply bowed, and dipped into ſuffering with, and for, my fellow members, and the ſeed of God, which lies loaded and oppreſſed in the minds of very many, even the profeſſors of the bleſſed truth, as a cart under ſheaves; this makes the true miniſters of Chriſt go heavily mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their way, often ſtrewing their tears in ſolitary places, for the ſlain of the daughter of this people; yea, for his ſake we are killed all the day long, and accounted as ſheep to the ſlaughter; and ſurely, of all perils we meet with by ſea and land, there are none ſo dangerous or hard to bear, as by falſe brethern: ſuch are they who have loſt the ſpirit and power of godlineſs, but retain the form, being cloathed with a phariſaical righteouſneſs, they, as our Saviour ſaid, ſit in Moſes's ſeat; what they bid, we may do, but their
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030834_0053_0FE9A1E1A32A9BF8"/>example is to be ſhunned: inſtead of coming up in their footſteps, we may juſtly cry, my ſoul come not into their ſecret; unto their aſſembly mine honour, be not thou united, for their ſteps tend to the chambers of death, and their ways to the gates of deſtruction. Oh! the great loſs we that are young have, for want of ſteady elders, to go before us, who might take us by the hand with this amiable language, "follow us, as we follow Chriſt." As this is the lot of our day, we muſt ſtrive to keep to our great Pilot, who is the alone ſafe conductor of his followers, through all the ſtorms, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and dangers that attend this pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage and vale of tears. Though he may ſometimes ſuffer us to walk by faith and not by ſight, yet, as our eye is ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily looking unto him, he will be found near at hand to help and direct, whoſe holy life (while in that prepared body) remains to be, an unerring pattern, he, in whom there was no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth, who was a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief. Alas! how hard a leſſon is this to our corrupt nature, poor, frail, wealk crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! ah! what need we have of bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mercy, and the mediation of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, compaſſionate Saviour, an holy high prieſt, that was tempted in all points, as
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030834_0054_0FE9A1E395B217A8"/>we are, and well knows how to ſuccour all the tempted; whoſe care is caſt upon him, the government of whoſe hearts is upon his ſhoulders, who have ſurrendered their wills to his. Theſe, and only theſe, are made truly free from the thraldom of ſin and death: know an overcoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the world and the devil, the only conqueſt worth our labour and conſtant purſuit. May we ever keep ſo near that holy, animating ſeraph, love, as that we may witneſs it, to fill us with a generous indifferency to earthly and tranſitory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that ſo we may in reality, count all things here, as loſs and droſs, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of that excellent treaſure, which we have in our earthen veſſels to the efficacy of which has at times given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>She mentions, <q>At the city of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge had a meeting with a few profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, the number about 5, in which place was greatly favoured in my mind with the living preſence of God, in whoſe light I ſaw, and was made to believe, that there would be a people raiſed up in that place
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030834_0055_0FE9A1E545FC5940"/>who ſhould ſtand for the honour of his name, and to be valiant for truth on earth. This I was led to declare to the few preſent, though at this time, a place noted for contrary fruits. At Burford had a large and precious evening meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though in the early part it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuffering time, there being divers prieſts, juſtices of the peace, ſo called, and rude people in whom the prince of the air had dominion; but the Lord, whoſe power is above every power, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his own arm and made it bare, for the help of his depending children, who have none in heaven but him, nor in the whole earth in compariſon of him. His teſtimony was ſet over the heads of tranſgre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>rs, and evil ſpirits were made ſubject to his power, everlaſting praiſes be given to his excellent name! At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place where I had a meeting, the profeſſors of Truth had heard of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent at ſeveral meetings, and were afraid of the croſs and reproach of men ſo took me a back way to the meeting for fear (as I apprehended) their neighbours that were not of our ſociety ſhould ſee us, and come there, yet Providence ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, that a large number came to the afternoon meeting, to whom Truth was declared in the wiſdom and demonſtration
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030834_0056_0FE9A1EAA7FC7340"/>of the ſpirit of God, after which I had to ſpeak cloſely to the profeſſors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the latter part of this journey, I was ſeized with a violent intermitting fever, which illneſs detained me ſeveral weeks, and cauſed me to travel in great bodily weakneſs, yet the Lord was graciouſly pleaſed at times to ſtrengthen me for the ſervice he had called me to, beyond my own and others expectation. I waited near a month for a paſſage, which ſeemed tedious to me, ſome of the time at a public houſe at Parkgate, deſtitute of friends or acquaintance, but dared not repine at the will of Providence. In this journey I rode about five thouſand miles, and attended five hundred and twenty-five meetings. I landed at Dublin the 9th month, 1750, being about two years and nine months abſent; had the company of My eſteemed friend, Samuel Fothergill. We had a rough, but ſwift paſſage, and were in danger of driving upon the Welch coaſt, but the Lord was our preſerver. my friends rejoiced to ſee me, as I did them, ſome were concerned at the ſtate of my viſibly impaired health. In this city I felt great weakneſs of body and mind, being ſtripped, emptied and tried as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the great Judge, by whom I was willing to be examined, and to bring my
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030834_0057_0FE9A1EC380998A8"/>deeds to his divine light, where my own weakneſs and manifold infirmities, might be more fully manifeſted; it was ſeveral days before I was able to go out to meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Though my life was deſpaired of by ſeveral, when I repaired to my father's cottage, where all the wants of nature were fully ſupplied, that which would gratify the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh and pride of life, much excluded, I mended in my health faſter than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and contrary to the opinion of divers, who were againſt my coming, fearing the journey would be too much for me, and the accommodation not ſuitable to my weak condition; but I bleſs the name of my God, who never ſuffered me to want any good thing, ſince my firſt knowledge of him. I had great peace in coming to my aged father, who much deſired my company: invitations I had to ſtations of great affluence; but denied them, and found the Lord my God deſerts not the poor and mean of this world, but viſits them in their lonely ſituations and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble retirements before him. This I am a witneſs of, for he was often with my ſpirit in this time of weakneſs; ſpeaking peace and comfort to my ſoul, that could not live without him. One day in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as I rode to meeting, being much better in health, his living word ran
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030834_0058_0FE9A1EE48890F00"/>ſweetly through my mind, thus, "For this purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, to ſhow forth in thee my power of preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mercy;" which greatly rejoiced my ſoul, and cauſed me to praiſe his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name (who is everlaſtingly worthy) for all his mercies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She kept pretty much at home during her weak ſtate of health, and about this time, wrote to a friend:</p>
            <q>By the mercy of Providence, I am now much recovered, ah! ſaith my ſoul, may I anſwer the end for which I am continued longer among dreams and ſhadows, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with deceit, ah! what ſoul that rightly knew its true centre, would deſire to continue here longer than till it had performed the will of Him that ſent it into life. This is a ſtate of infirmity and dependency, environed by the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, potent, unwearied enemies, which loudly calls for the greateſt vigilance, fear, humility and watchfulneſs, that our nature is capable of; let us, therefore, ſink down in our minds, to the lowly, humble ſeed of everlaſting renown, where the viſions of life and light are ſeen, and the voice of the great Oracle heard, diſtinct from every other ſound, in the ſilence of all fleſh, freed from the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030834_0059_0FE9A1F1D5F21290"/>noiſe of archers, where none can make us afraid.</q>
            <p>In another letter ſhe ſays:</p>
            <q>I often wonder why the Lord and his people, ſhould ſhow ſo much regard to a poor and unworthy creature, who am the leaſt and laſt of his family, if meet to be eſteemed of that happy number. My ſoul ſinks low under the weight of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to him, to whom I can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake no returns, but of his own begetting; who meaſures not his mercies by our merit, for then would they be a ſcanty portion; but they are proportioned to his matchleſs love and kindneſs.</q>
            <p>The ſummer following ſhe accompanied Catherine Payton, who came to this nation on a religious viſit, finding a draft to join her to Munſter and Ulſter. She ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on this journey in the 5th month, 1751, and they joined as companions at Waterford. They had many meetings amongſt thoſe of other ſocieties. They viſited the town's people of Sligo, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, and felt much ſatisfaction; ſhe thought they were well worth viſiting, and ſaid there ſeemed much more openneſs to declare the truth amongſt thoſe of other ſocieties, than amongſt them that go under
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030834_0060_0FE9A1F4D89EF698"/>our name. After this journey, ſhe ſtaid moſt of the winter with her father.</p>
            <p>To a friend ſhe wrote as follows:</p>
            <q>I ſalute thee in that love, which nearly united our ſpirits at our firſt ſeeing each other; yea, before I beheld thee with my natural eyes, a prayer was begotten in my ſoul, that thou might be made an inſtrument of good to me, which peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have cauſe to believe, was heard and excepted by the great I am. For thou waſt dipped into a ſenſe of my ſtate, and ſympathy with me, by which thou waſt made the meſſenger of glad tidings and conſolation to my diſtreſſed ſpirit, and reſolutions have been formed (which I truſt, by the favour of heaven, will be ſupported) to practice greater degrees of mortification and ſelf denial than I have yet done; for I ſee great occaſion for it. I write not this to exalt the creature or flatter my friend, but to magnify that grace, by which thou art, what thou art; and to contribute my mite to the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of thy hands in the way of well doing, as I believe the ſtrongeſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have need of it; but, perhaps, I only judge by myſelf, who am at times ready to faint in my mind, from a fear that I ſhall never be made a conqueror
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030834_0061_0FE9A1FCB6494338"/>over thoſe potent enemies which oppoſe my happineſs. I have compared my mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirit to a kind of immaterial fire, that is continually catching at, or faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, ſomething celeſtial or terreſtrial, and whichever it centres in, it may juſtly be called an inhabitant of; as natural a tendency it has to fix on earthly objects, that are continually aſſailing it, conveyed thereto by the organs of my ſenſes, as iron caſt into the water, has to ſink; which my ſoul is ready to do, when I wait not carefully for the renewing of that power, by which we are tranſlated from the kingdom of darkneſs, to that of light. But ſo frequent and painful are the operations of the ſword of the ſpirit, when it comes to ſever my ſoul from the ſpirit of the world, and to divide aſunder between the joints and the marrow, that it makes we weary of this embodied ſtate of imperfection, wherein I am torn as between two, heaven and earth, ſo that I often long to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt. Though this deſire ſeems to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it ſomething laudable, inaſmuch as it ſhows my union with the eternal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, to be ſtronger than all the ties of nature, yet I am ready to fear, that in part, this longing takes its riſe from ſelf-love, which would lead me to ſeek an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from pain and trials before I had
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030834_0062_0FE9A1FE6C03AB70"/>filled up in my body, that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind of the ſufferings of Chriſt: I hope it is excuſeable, as our holy pattern has ſet us the example; when about to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſufferings, he prayed earneſtly, that, if it were poſſible, the cup might paſs from him; but came to this noble reſult, which all his followers, that are ſo in reality, muſt be brought to, <hi>viz.</hi> "Not my will, but thine be done." What could be grievous, that he did not ſuffer? Rejoice, O my ſoul, then in thy tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and count it all joy, when thou falleſt into divers temptations for the trial of thy faith in Chriſt.</q>
            <p>The following advice was communicated by letter, to a young man, then under the baptizing power of truth.</p>
            <q>There is one caution that has dwelt for ſometime on my ſpirit to give thee, in pure love and good will, that is, that thou may be particularly nice in the choice of thy friends, now in thy ſetting out in a new and ſpiritual life, which is a point of great wiſdom; take ſpecial care of being too readily taken with ſtrangers, and of giving thy ſentiments in word or writing of perſons or things, not well known. This thou wilt find, when duly conſidered, to be a hint of ſingular ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030834_0063_0FE9A200310099F8"/>Wait for the freedom and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, before thou entereſt into converſe or familiarity with any, though it may be on religious ſubjects, for there are many more talkers of the truth, than walkers in it. This thou wilt find (as I have done) to tend greatly to the health and well-being of thy precious ſoul; for there is a ſet of mortals, whoſe very breath diffuſes poiſon and infection to the mind; their throats are as an open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, the poiſon of aſps is under their tongues, they flatter with their lips; I might enlarge on this ſubject, but a watch-word is enough.</q>
            <p>She wrote to another of her friends thus:</p>
            <q>It is not forgetfulneſs of my near and dear friends, that makes me ſlow in my anſwers to them, nor yet, becauſe I have not a ſingular pleaſure in hearing from them; their converſe by letter or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is, next to the divine good in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the greateſt ſatisfaction in this life; but thou knoweſt, that even all of this kind muſt be through him, who is the ſource of all good, and can command the clouds, that they ſhall or ſhall not rain; he can ſtop both the upper and the nether ſprings, and cauſe a famine in the land, and who ſhall ſay, what doeſt thou?
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030834_0064_0FE9A201F9B3B2B0"/>It is the Lord that worketh in and for his people, and who ſhall let or hinder him, from doing it his own way, and after the manner that he ſees beſt? He is about to try his people every way, even as he did Iſrael of old, by famine, captivity, and ſore diſtreſſes, becauſe of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their hearts and ſtiffneſs of their necks, refuſing to return to him, who had done ſuch great things for them and their fathers. This is the caſe, my friend, of people in this our day, who are gone into captivity, and refuſe to return at the command of the Lord, who has long waited, and loudly called, immediately and inſtrumentally, to them to return. And for this reaſon a little remnant, who, like David, prefer Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem above the chiefeſt joy, have hung their harps as upon the willows, and dare not ſing the ſongs of Sion, neither can they in a ſtrange land, for ſuch as deſire it from them; who are of the number of thoſe that ſpoil them, and yet require of them a ſong or mirth. May all do as Daniel did, in their private chambers, ſet their faces towards Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, oftener than the morning, and not be afraid to ſuffer for the law of their God. It has been my lot, ſince my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from England, to be much ſhut up as to word and doctrine, and to ſit in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030834_0065_0FE9A20B14D7EC18"/>great emptineſs and poverty of ſpirit, amongſt a people big with expectation of words, and too much departed from the light and life of the pure word in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And of late ſince this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been diſappointed, and their hopes fruſtrated, the Lord has often made uſe of me in his hand, as a ſharp threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtrument, and put ſuch words in my mouth for them, as they could hardly bear; ſo that on all ſides, the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is greatly deſpiſed and rejected, by the high and lofty profeſſors, and phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical righteous, who can ſpeak their own words, and work their own works; and indeed I am well content ſo to be, and expect no better treatment, than our bleſſed Lord and his diſciples have met with in all ages; we are not greater than our Maſter, if they perſecuted him they will alſo perſecute us. I only wiſh we may be found building on the ſame foundation, and then the gates of hell will not prevail againſt us.</q>
            <p>She writes thus to a perſon under religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impreſſions, whom ſhe was made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to help:</p>
            <q>Does it not behove me to ſtudy thy preſervation, as I am unavoidably led in the wiſdom of truth to do? It was for
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030834_0066_0FE9A20CD38279F0"/>this end that I was choſen of the Lord at this time for thy friend, I ſee it clearly, and feel it perfectly, thou art to tread the ſame dangerous ſteps that I have had to ſtumble over, with this advantage, that ſhe who has gone the road before thee, is made willing to lend thee her hand, and to point out the ſnares and traps that lie in the way. And now it is in my heart to give thee a ſhort account of my own experience in the work of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. When my ſoul was firſt thereby awakened to a life of righteouſneſs; I ſaw ſuch beauty and excellency in the truth and the followers of it, that I thought no temptation would ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon me to turn aſide in the leaſt degree from what I knew to be my duty and intereſt in the truth (not in the world, which I ſaw clearly lay in wickedneſs) and all my paſſions ſeemed ſo ſubjected and engroſſed in admiration and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the one great and good object, and his wonderful works in me and the whole creation, that I ſeemed to have no life in, nor reliſh for, any other employ. Nor could I hear with pleaſure any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe that did not ſavour more or leſs of the ſpirit of truth, and even ſuch as did, I delighted more in the feeling ſenſe of it in my own heart, than the hearing of it from any mortal. And to hear any ſpeak
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030834_0067_0FE9A20EA10F0728"/>of it, that were not in the life and power of it, was the greateſt pain to my ſpirit that it could be tried with. All the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of men ſeemed fooliſhneſs to me without this, and it is really ſo in the ſight of God and all good men. Alas! this ſtate laſted not long till my trials came on apace, and all my fortitude was proved; nor will I, or dare I, aſcribe my preſervation to my own watchfulneſs, ſtability, prudence, or wiſdom; no, it muſt be for ever attributed to the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye of the Shepherd of Iſrael, who ſleeps not by day nor ſlumbers by night. The enemy of my happineſs ſtrove to draw me from the true light, and ſet me upon acting by imitation, rather than the ſenſe and judgment of the truth in myſelf; and here ſelf began to plead what need is there for me to be more mortified in this, or that particular, than others of my fellow labourers, that are greater miniſters, and have ſeen farther into the liberty which truth allows of, they being perſons of far greater abilities than I, and ſome other weak perſons who make ſcruples of ſmall matters? and what is there in this, that, or the other trifle of dreſs or behaviour? Thus did the enemy work as in a myſtery, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my poor, proud heart, that liked well this doctrine of his, and would
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030834_0068_0FE9A21293533078"/>have reaſoned the ſecret, gentle dictates of truth out of my mind; not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the enemy was leading me to imitate the weakneſſes of my fellow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and overlook their virtues; thus did he ſtrive in another ſhape and form to open that eye in me, which had been ſhut to all the glory of the world, in every kind and degree of it; all this and much more, did the implacable enemy of my peace whiſper in the ear of my ſoul, and cauſed his agents to ſpeak to my outward ear; yea, even ſome of the Lord's ſervants, who were taken by the affectionate part, would have perſuaded me from the croſs, as Peter would have done his Lord, when he ſaid, "Far be thoſe things from thee," but what was his reply, "Get thee behind me, ſatan, thou ſavoureſt not the things that be of God, but thoſe that be of men." Nor is there any mortal, that rightly and truly ſavours the things of God, longer than they are under the immediate influence of his own divine grace, and that in a greater or ſmaller degree as they partake of it; let us therefore caſt this part in all the diſciples, behind our backs, and look to him with a ſingle eye, that was never overcome in battle. He it was, who let me ſee, that no mortal could be a perfect pattern to me, in all things; and that he
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030834_0069_0FE9A219EFBA6628"/>would lead me in a manner, different from moſt others, both as to my gift and conduct, and though the manner in which truth led me, was often miſconſtrued, and wrongfully cenſured, as the object of pride, ſingularity, temper, &amp;c. my God knew it was in obedience to him, and refined love and charity to my fellow mortals, which would not, nor dare not, draw the hearts of the people from their true King, as Abſalom did, who periſhed for the ſame; and thoſe innocent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in converſe and behaviour, which I ſaw uſed by others of my ſex and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whom I preferred before myſelf, were to me forbidden, though they might be to them lawful, and for what I know allowable; eſpecially towards the other ſex, I found it my duty to act with the utmoſt caution; if I found no danger on my ſide, yet ſaw it needful to conſult the good of thoſe with whom I converſed: and had I not been obedient in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſure I ſhould not have been preſerve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> till this time, to have been thy friend in the truth, as I am this day. My own affections and the affections of others, would long ſince have ſtolen me out of his hands, who has an abſolute right to diſpoſe of my body and ſpirit, which are his. Such was the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the general love and eſteem that
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030834_0070_0FE9A21BEA42F070"/>I met with for a time, which naturally drew my mind, and the prevalency of the love of God, which powerfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted my ſoul towards himſelf from all fading objects, that between theſe two powers, my mind was, at times, in that poſition that Abſalom's body was, when he hung in a dying condition in the boughs of a tree, as between heaven and earth, ſcarce knowing which power would have me; but as there was a faithful obedience to the voice of the true ſhepherd, I found the power of Saul grow weaker, and that of David ſtronger.</q>
            <p>About this time ſhe wrote thus to a friend:</p>
            <q>Though I am poor, low, diſtreſſed, and afflicted, having more need to be miniſtered unto, than to miniſter to any, yet as thou haſt repeatedly deſired to hear from me by word or writing, I now feel a ſecret draft to let thee know a little how it fares with me, though the ſource or cauſe of my ſorrow muſt for ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from all mortals, and penned within the narrow conſines of this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled breaſt, ſave when admitted to pour out its complaints in the boſom of my never failing friend and bleſſed redeemer, all other counſellors are denied; may he condeſcend to direct my ſteps in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030834_0071_0FE9A21DA0E347F0"/>and then all will be well. Let it ſuffice to ſay that I have juſt been in ſilent and ſolid retirement, conſidering my awful calling, and comparing my life to that of the captain of my ſalvation, who was made perfect through ſuffering, and ſhall I dare to ſay my life has ſome faint reſemblance to his? yea, ſurely, as well indeed it may who am called to be his miniſter. He was a man of ſorrow and acquainted with grief. So am I a woman of a ſorrowful ſpirit, that have moved my lips in prayer, when my tongue could not ſet forth the anguiſh of my ſoul, pouring it forth in broken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, ſighs, and groans, not for riches, honour, name, or fame, nor yet a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, earthly love, or a firſt born ſon after the fleſh; but, Oh! for divine wiſdom, heavenly inſtructions and ability, to bring forth fruits of righteouſneſs to the praiſe and honour of him who has called me to glory and virtue. Was my Lord deſpiſed and rejected of men? So am I. Hannah like, I have been miſunderſtood even by the high prieſt, but not by the great one of our profeſſion, who knows and regards his own, gently whiſpering in the ears of their ſouls, "Fear not worm, Jacob I am with thee," &amp;c. My Lord was betrayed: ſo have I been by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed diſciple. He was left alone in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030834_0072_0FE9A22145C0B7A0"/>agonies, none to aid him, or to make his complaint to, but the Father alone. So have I. Let me not longer dwell on this copious ſubject, than I find the ſtrength of his love to comfort my mind, and then I might for ever dwell on it, and find new wonders in it. O the length, the breadth and the unfathomable depth of it. I obſerve thy complaints of poverty, which was no incitement in me to do the ſame, had it not been my ſtate, and I thought it might not be diſcourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee, to know that thou ſhares the ſame lot with thy brethren and ſiſters. Seekeſt thou great things for thyſelf? Seek them not, for the Lord has ſaid, that he would bring evil upon all fleſh, but if we have that promiſe which was given to Barach, "thy life ſhall be given thee for a prey whereſoever thou goeſt," may this be our happy experience to ſave our ſpiritual lives, this ſeems to be the ultimate of my wiſh, expectation, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, in this calamitous day and time we live in, as to religion. The prieſts, the Lord's miniſters, mourn, the virgin daughters of Sion are in bitterneſs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Barach, "the Lord has added grief to my ſorrow." Well let me not dwell longer on this theme, but hope for beauty for aſhes, the oil of joy for mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the garments of praiſe for the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030834_0073_0FE9A227C30020A0"/>ſpirit of heavineſs, how does this holy anchor keep my troubled ſoul from foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the quickſands of deſpair.</q>
            <p>A concern, which at times for years, had reſted on her mind, to pay a religious viſit to the churches in America, appears about this time to have impreſſed her with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional weight, the baptiſms ſhe paſſed through to fit her for this work, ſhe thus deſcribes:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Lord was pleaſed to bring me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly low, both in mind and body, the latter ſo much ſo, that my life was deſpaired of by myſelf and others; and ſuch was my exerciſe of mind and pain of body, that life ſeemed a burden, yea, I was ready often to wiſh my body diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved that I might be with Chriſt. Yet, when death looked me in the face, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by that which alone can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſupportable to human nature, <hi>viz.</hi> an inconteſtible evidence of eternal reſt to my immortal ſpirit, it appeared to me a gloomy proſpect, and the cauſe of its being ſo I believe was, that my time was not yet come.</p>
               <p>For I knew not that I had wilfully offended the divine Being, that ſhould cauſe him to withdraw his life-giving pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030834_0074_0FE9A229D9ED0A08"/>and ſuffer my mind to be clothed with a thick cloud of darkneſs. During this time of trial and deep exerciſe of body and mind, the Lord my God was pleaſed to extend his mighty arm of power, and reduce my ſpirit to a calm, ſo as to make his holy voice intelligible to my weary, diſtreſſed ſoul, and to inform me that he would raiſe me from that low and dark ſtate, and cauſe me, in his love, to viſit the churches in America the next year. And although this ſeemed to claſh with my temporal intereſt, as well as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination, there was at the ſame time when I heard the call, an entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation wrought in my mind, ſo that I could ſay indeed and in truth, "Thy will be done in all things," which was to me a confirmation that the thing was of the Lord, verifying that ſaying of David, when addreſſing the Almighty, "In the day of thy power, thy people ſhall be willing," and ſuch was the prevalency of it, that it removed thoſe things which had been like mountains in my way, and cauſed them to be caſt into the ſea of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>This journey had been before me, by diſtant views, from a ſhort time after my receiving a gift in the miniſtry. There were many difficulties ſeemingly inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030834_0075_0FE9A22BB1FD0710"/>in my way, which the Lord in his own time was pleaſed to remove; ſo that I may ſay of a truth, I was brought through the furnace of affliction to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this journey.</p>

            <p>She correſponded with her friend Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Payton, who felt a like concern to viſit the churches in America, and great was the ſympathy they had with each other. She left home the 22d of the 3d month 1753, attended the quarterly meeting at Edender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and went thence to Dublin, where ſhe met with conſiderable trials by oppoſing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, of which ſhe ſays, ſhe had a precious ſight, and thus writes:</p>
            <q>
               <p>I felt the power of darkneſs at work ſo as grievouſly to oppreſs my ſpirit, but by degrees it was caſt down, and the pure light prevailed. The deſign of the enemy was to prevent my intended jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by raiſing contention, which, bleſſed be the name of God, he was not able to do. I left Dublin in the 5th month, in love and unity with my friends, and good deſires for my enemies, if any ſuch I had, and landed at Liverpool, got ſafe to London. After attending the yearly meeting at London, I went to the yearly meetings of Colcheſter, Bury, Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and Norwich: all which were
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030834_0076_0FE9A22F4C095838"/>attended with a good degree of the life and power of truth, and an honeſt labour for the good of the people. Before my leaving Ireland, I had a ſight of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in South Carolina, being the port for me to land at, which continued until I returned to London, when I loſt ſight of it; which made me willingly conclude I might go with ſome friends I was nearly united to, for Philadelphia, and went on board ſome veſſels bound for that port, but could not ſee my way in any of them. On more deeply centring to the root of life, in humble reſignation to the divine will, I found it my duty to continue ſome weeks at London, and not being clear of that city, was, I believe, the cauſe of my not ſeeing my way clear to Charleſton, I therefore concluded to ſtay the Lord's time, and when I found my ſpirit clear, took my paſſage with my dear companion, Catherine Payton, for that port. Before my leaving London, I had a large and comfortable farewell-meeting at the Peel, for which my ſoul, with many more, had renewed cauſe to bleſs and praiſe the name of the Lord; ſeveral friends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied us from London to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, where we took ſhipping and landed at Charleſton. We had a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage, ſave hard weather towards the latter part of the voyage; but by the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030834_0077_0FE9A23148D9FDC0"/>infinite mercy of Almighty God, were preſerved from any terror or amazement, and our health continued beyond expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſave the ſickneſs occaſioned by the ſea and heat. We had meetings on board every Firſt-day, when ability of body and the weather would permit, which the paſſengers and ſhip's crew attended, to whom the way of life and ſalvation was declared; but many of their hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, the word had not that entrance, which could have been deſired.</p>
               <p>In Charleſton the diſcipline was quite let fall, and I found it my duty to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to revive it. Herein I met with open oppoſition and evil treatment, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from one of my own countrymen, who was of a libertine ſpirit, and had been under the cenſure of friends in his native land. But the Lord was pleaſed to manifeſt his ſpirit, ſo that he could not fruſtrate our endeavours. In this province we met with many difficulties both of body and mind, the former by long journeys, in a very thinly inhabited country, through unbeaten paths in the woods, dangerous creeks and ſwamps, with wild and venemous creatures around us, and with ſuch food and lodging as we had never been accuſtomed to; yet
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030834_0078_0FE9A23957A74088"/>the Lord our God was pleaſed to make it up to us by his comfortable preſence and good ſpirit, and to afford us the bleſſing of health, at a time when the greateſt part of the inhabitants ſuffered deeply with fevers and agues. For which unmerited mercy, my ſoul at this time bows, in humble thankſgiving, and returns him the praiſe of his works, who is everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly worthy.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The following is a part of a letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her uncle:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>It has dwelt on my heart for ſome days, to give thee a ſhort hiſtory of a long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and firſt may acquaint thee that through the matchleſs mercy of a never failing God, to his poor depending chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we have been preſerved in a good degree of health, at a time when moſt faces gathered paleneſs through indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body. I do not remember that we have been in a houſe or family ſince we left Charleſton, but one or more were ill of a fever or ague, ſo that it ſeems like an univerſal contagion which has overſpread the inhabitants of this quarter. We came hither from Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, taking no meetings in the way, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the families where we lodged, the diſtance being 150 miles, through woods
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030834_0079_0FE9A23B97D3DA80"/>and ſwamps, where our lives ſeemed in jeopardy every hour, yet through mercy our minds were ſo ſupported above fear, as to go on with a good degree of cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ſpirit, truſting in that holy arm of power, which has hitherto wrought deliverance for us. I have ſat down by a brook in the woods, eat my Indian-corn bread, and drank water out of a calabaſh, with more content and peace of mind than many who were ſerved in plate, &amp;c. and at night have ſlept contentedly in my riding clothes, on a bed hard enough to make my bones ach, and the houſe ſo open on every ſide as to admit plenty of light and air. I have compared my paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age through theſe woods, to my pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age through the world, and indeed in ſome things it bears a juſt reſemblance; the path we rode through was exceeding narrow, and ſometimes ſo cloſed as not to ſee a footſtep before me, caught by boughs on one hand and buſhes on the other, obliged to ſtoop very low, leſt my head ſhould be hurt or eyes pulled out: this I compare to the entangling things of the preſent world, which are ready to catch the affections on every ſide and blind the eyes of the ſoul; my clothes are a little ragged by theſe pulls, but through care not quite torn off. Oh! ſaith my ſoul, may it not be wholly ſtripped of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030834_0080_0FE9A243180133E0"/>white robe which is the righteouſneſs of ſaints; for ſurely I have never been in more danger than now; the ſenſe of which leads me earneſtly to deſire, that I may have a place in the remembrance of thoſe, whoſe prayers aſcend with accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the throne of grace. I have not given the foregoing account of my bodily hardſhip, by way of complaint or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, no, when I conſider how much more, very many much better than I have ſuffered for the cauſe of religion, and eſpecially the good Shepherd who laid down his life for his ſheep, every cauſe of complaint is removed, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering that the diſciple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord. Yea, it is cauſe of rejoicing to my ſoul, when I can find my feet in the footſteps of the tribulated flocks, who trod this narrow path, and tried way to eternal bleſſedneſs. In this way of life I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from many dangerous temptations, which eaſe and ſupineneſs are inlets to. On my hard bed, I am free from the fault of waſting too much of my time in a ſtate of death and inactivity. At my plain meals, I am freed from many of the temptations and evils, which attend high and voluptuous living; and am often made to remember that excellent advice of a great apoſtle to his ſon in the faith,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030834_0081_0FE9A244A64B3900"/>"Endure hardneſs, as a good ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt." And ſurely ſuch as are ſent out to war before the face of their enemies, may expect it in an eſpecial manner. But what, above all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations reconciles me to every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Providence, is, the ſight and ſenſe which truth gives me of my own unworthineſs, of the leaſt of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies I receive, either ſpiritual or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; for indeed I ſee myſelf to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly weak, and capable of ſo little ſervice, as not to merit the meaneſt food that is ſet before me, yet have never been ſuffered to doubt, but that I am in my place, in coming here.—I think very long to hear from my friends and family, having been of late a little toſſed, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the night by dreams about my father's family and ſome others; whether it be the work of the enemy to perplex my mind, or a foreſight of the worſt of trials (except the loſs of the favour of heaven) I cannot tell: but when I am aſſiſted to look beyond this tranſitory ſcene of uncertainty, I can welcome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and rejoice in ſuch adverſities, as have the leaſt tendency to draw my mind nearer unto God; which I know muſt be by being weaned and redeemed from earth and earthly ſatisfactions. Alas! while I carry about with me this frail ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030834_0082_0FE9A24656E51198"/>its affections and deſires will bend towards its original duſt, when from under the immediate influence of that holy power, which alone can redeem it from the thraldom of ſin and ſatan. What need then have I and all who have been made partakers of the powers of the world to come, humbly, diligently, and chaſtely to wait for the enlightening and enlivening incomes thereof to our ſouls, that ſo we may go on to perfection.</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto paſſed over our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in Charleſton. It ſeems like a city of refuge for the disjointed members of our ſociety, where they may walk in the ſight of their own eyes, and the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own hearts, without being accountable to any for their conduct, and yet be called by the name of Quaker, to take away their reproach. We lodged at the houſe of one who had married out of the ſociety, which we went to with fear and reluctance, having firſt tried all means to avoid it. Here we were greatly ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, but I think we were providentially caſt there for his wife's ſake, who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der convincement, a tender hearted, good natured woman, and exceedingly kind to us, and he well eſteemed for a fair repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table trader. He received us with much civility and hoſpitality, which yet did not
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030834_0083_0FE9A24A26365D28"/>blind our eyes, or prevent our telling him the truth; I have gone ſo far as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, that I was aſhamed to walk the ſtreets with one under our name, who deviated ſo much from our principles as he did, which he always took well, and would acknowledge his faults. We were often viſited by thoſe of other ſocieties, and had much kindneſs ſhowed by them. We had freedom to make a few viſits amongſt them, and had ſervice for our maſter in ſome of their families. We likewiſe paid a religious viſit to every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily profeſſing with us, in that place, and had very cloſe work, but with the moſt authority of any ſervice we have entered on; and by this and ſuch like labour, I underſtand we have driven ſeveral from the meeting, who could not bear ſound doctrine, though ever ſo private. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any ſound members added by our labour, muſt at preſent be left: however that be, I ſay, amen to theſe leaving the profeſſion, whoſe lives and conduct are a ſcandal to it; and I wiſh to be made more and more inſtrumental, in the hand of my God, for diviſion in the ſociety, between the precious and the vile: let me as a creature ſuffer what I may, by evil report and falſe brethren, which I have had, and ſtill expect a large ſhare of, in the way my maſter leads me;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030834_0084_0FE9A24BB367A330"/>for of a truth it was his ſpirit, if ever I knew it, and not my own, that led me to this cloſe work. One appeared in open oppoſition, at a meeting appointed for conference, in order to take ſteps for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving the diſcipline amongſt them; he attacked me in particular, but I had then little to ſay to him, and what I did ſay was in great mildneſs; he aroſe in a violent paſſion and left the room; ſince which we have ſeen no more of him at meeting or elſewhere.</p>

            <p>Her account thus continues:</p>
            <q>
               <p>At Nuce in North Carolina, we had a large and comfortable meeting, in which I thought it might be truly ſaid the Lord's power was over all, and that even deviliſh ſpirits were made ſubject to that power, by which we were aſſiſted to ſpeak. In this province likewiſe, we met with abundant hardſhips and ſufferings of body, as we were drawn in the love of God, to viſit many of the back inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, where I ſuppoſe, no European had ever been on the like errand: by lodging in the woods in cold froſty weather, on damp grounds with bad firing, I got a rheumatic pain in my jaws and head, by which I ſuffered much, and often loſt my
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030834_0085_0FE9A253F153EA18"/>reſt after had travelling; yet through it all, the Lord was pleaſed to ſupport my ſpirit in a good degree of cheerfulneſs, without murmuring or repining, though my weak conſtitution often deeply felt the effects of thoſe bodily hardſhips; yet by the goodneſs and healing virtue of the Lord, I was often made to forget my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily infirmities, and to ſee and feel that His ſtrength was made perfect in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Between Pedee and New-garden, where is a large tract of country, we rode two days and an half, and lay two nights in the woods, without being under the roof of a houſe. In theſe parts I ſeemed to have a hope that truth might yet ſpread, becauſe many of the people ſhowed a love and eſteem for friends, and a diſlike to the prieſts. We were often kindly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, according to their ability, at the houſes of theſe not of our ſociety, though ſometimes at our firſt entrance they would look ſtrangely at us, becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the lawfulneſs of women's preaching, having never heard any: thus did we paſs for a ſign and wonder; ſome would ſay, when invited to meeting, that we were women who ran from our own country for ſome ill act, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſupernatural power of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030834_0086_0FE9A255B41BA150"/>love, which had influenced our hearts, nor the rules and diſcipline of friends. Through divine favour I have not heard of any of them who went away diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from meeting; may the praiſe of all the Lord's works be rendered to himſelf, who alone is worthy. In the upper part of this province (North Carolina) there is a large body of prefeſſors, and I hope ſome valuable friends, but too many I fear (yea, I think I ſenſibly felt) are truſting in a profeſſion, without a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the living virtue of truth. We were at their quarterly meeting, which was large; but the power of truth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what low, at leaſt in me, who ſuffered much under a looſe unſanctified ſpirit. My companion had the chief ſervice in the public meetings, and was led, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to ſpeak pretty much to the ſtate of the ſociety: my chief labour was in the meeting of miniſters and elders, in which we endeavoured to ſtrive for ſome regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the diſcipline, particularly that they might have their meetings for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſelect, and not ſet open for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they were then in the practice of. The weighty part of friends joined us, and ſeemed to conclude they would ſtrive for an amendment. I alſo propoſed their holding a meeting for the elders to confer in, before the miniſters joined
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030834_0087_0FE9A257D3F7CD18"/>them, in order to their hearing a more full and perfect account of the ſtate of the miniſtry in each meeting, and to have them both held before the quarterly meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This was agreed to, and the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended in a feeling ſenſe of divine love, which makes true unity and concord amongſt brethren, for which my ſoul was thankful. I laboured with conſiderable openneſs at ſeveral of the particular meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, before the quarterly meeting; my companion being gone on a viſit, ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of theſe parts as far as Bath-town. In this journey ſhe had the trial of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a woman friend, who accompanied her from Perquimans, removed by death; her remains were brought to her huſband and children in eleven days from the time ſhe left home, being then well to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. We attended at her funeral, which was on the whole ſolid and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, though ſomewhat interrupted by one who, as he thought, would preach the burial ſermon. From thence we paſſed to Virginia, and found things in the ſouth ſide exceedingly weak and low, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings very ſmall, and in many places the diſcipline ſadly let fall; friends were very kind and hoſpitable, but from the poor ſeaſons we had in ſpirit, their hoſpitality ſometimes loſt its true reliſh; yet there is a ſeed in theſe parts, with whom my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030834_0088_0FE9A25B23A1C3E0"/>had true unity. We ſpent near two months in this colony, in much inward ſuffering, and under ſome bodily hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, their way of living differing from what we had been accuſtomed to. One thing which friends here, as well as in North Carolina, Maryland and ſome other parts of America, were in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, gave us conſiderable pain, and we apprehended was in part the cauſe of truth's not proſpering amongſt them, as otherwiſe it would, that is, buying and keeping of ſlaves, which we could not reconcile with the golden rule of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto all men as we would they ſhould do unto us.</p>
               <p>At Weſt-river, Maryland, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to write an epiſtle to the yearly meeting to be held at Curles in Virginia, which had been on my mind for ſome time; my companion united therewith, and ſubſcribed here name to ſaid epiſtle, which was as follows:

                           <salute>DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>In a good degree of that univerſal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, enlarging love which drew us from our native land and near enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make you a religious viſit, do we at this time tenderly ſalute you, and hereby inform you (as we have done ſome of you heretofore verbally) that our hearts have been pained, on account of the ſtate of the church in your colony. And though we cannot accuſe ourſelves of withholding any thing from you, either in public or private, which was given us to deliver, we apprehend it our duty to ſtir up in your remembrance, ſome truths already known, and we hope weightily felt by ſome of you.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, we recommend to your ſolid conſideration, when ſolemnly aſſembled, the exceeding low ſtate of the miniſtry and dicipline, in moſt, if not all the monthly meetings in your colony. Sink down to the pure gift of God in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Aſk of Him with a ſincere deſire to be informed, Lord, what is the cauſe that we flee before our enemies, and are taken captive by them? for thus we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is with ſome, whether they are ſenſible of it or not, and as this is the caſe, we hope and believe, the Lord will let
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030834_0090_0FE9A26402DDA868"/>ſome of you ſee and feel, that the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has not been on his ſide, and that he has not forſaken his people, but they him; and will alſo give power to amend your ways and your doings. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, we dare not ſuppoſe (let our ſpirits be cloathed with ever ſo much Chriſtian charity) that all who have been called, and even initiated into the true church, have ſtood faithful, and kept a ſingle eye to the glory of God; no, no, if that had been the caſe, what a bright, ſhining people would you have been ere this day; yea, as a city ſet upon a hill, whoſe light would have diffuſed itſelf to thoſe who were without, and have cauſed many to flock to our Zion for reſt and ſafety, as doves to the windows; and not as birds of prey, to tear and devour, as is now too much the caſe, many we fear coming in among you with unſanctified ſpirits; <hi>i. e.</hi> to make a profeſſion of the truth, which is now eaſy, without a poſſeſſion or ſure inheritance in it, in which increaſe of number, ſome have ſeemed to glory, when in truth they have but increaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs in the church, by adding chaff inſtead of the ſolid, weighty wheat, which alone will be gathered into the Lord's garner; but the chaff of all kinds, will be burnt with unquenchable fire. Where then will theſe light, chaffy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:030834_0091_0FE9A26591ABCDC0"/>profeſſors appear, or what will they add to you, except it be an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance and clog to the ſmall handful of ſolid friends amongſt you, who, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are too much oppreſſed and borne down; yea, lie as hid and buried, under this light, windy ſpirit. Ariſe, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, in the name and power of your God, and exert yourſelves in his pure wiſdom and ſtrength, for his cauſe and truth on earth. Victory is on the Lord's ſide, and will be your's, if you faithfully follow him in the way of his requirings, not fearing the faces of men, but ſtrictly regarding the ſtill, ſmall voice and gentle motions of the bleſſed ſpirit of truth. As this is the caſe, one ſhall chaſe a thouſand of theſe light, frothy ſpirits, and two put ten thouſand to flight, though ye may, yea, muſt be little and low in your own eyes. And we earneſtly deſire, that ſuch as have been called to, and in ſome meaſure qualified for, the work of the Lord, and through a deſire of ſome kind or other, of filthy lucre, of which there are many, are become formal, blind, and unfaithful, may repent, and do their firſt works, ſeeing from whence they are fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, leſt the Lord come to them quickly, and remove ſuch candleſtick out of its place, whoſe candles are already put out by the baneful breath of the ſpirit of this
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030834_0092_0FE9A2689BB58D38"/>world; with which they have univerſally mingled, and in which they are held cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Ariſe from this ſtate, if poſſible, and ſhake yourſelves from the duſt of the earth, with which ſome of you are laden as with thick clay; but if you are ſo benumbed, hardened, and ſtupified, through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, that this cannot be, yet ceaſe at leaſt, to pervert the right way of the Lord, by meddling in things with which you have no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, putting yourſelves forth in the miniſtry or diſcipline, when Chriſt the true ſhepherd, has not put you forth therein. Remember what befel him who ſtretched forth a hand to the ark, even when it tottered and ſeemed in danger of falling; the ſame event will happen to the ſpiritual lives of all thoſe, who continue for a ſeries of time, to mock and deceive themſelves and people with a ſound of words without life or power, which however found in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and well connected, are but as a dead letter, which kills inſtead of quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the ſoul. Let this certain, ſelf-evident truth be weightily conſidered by you, <hi>viz.</hi> that nothing but life and light, ſhould move to act in the church of Chriſt; not pity for the people, nor inclination to gratify their longing deſire after words, nor any other human paſſion or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030834_0093_0FE9A26E82E3AB78"/>ſhould move us thus to tempt the Lord, and take his holy name in vain, in the worſt ſenſe of the expreſſion, for which as do ſo, he has declared he will not hold them guiltleſs. And dear friends, we apprehend that a great part of the weakneſs and unfruitfulneſs, which appears in the miniſtry amongſt you, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from want of a right, ſound diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, eſtabliſhed and conducted in the wiſdom of truth, which diſcipline is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly not only as a wall of defence againſt the encroachments of many dangerous enemies, but as a hedge to ſhelter from the various baneful blaſts, deſtructive to young and tender plants, which ſhould be ſheltered as well as watered, pruned and dug about, by wiſe, judicious elders and fathers and mothers in the church. But alas! how do the few of thoſe who are on the right foundation, ſtand as alone, expoſed to the darts of their enemies, and piercing blaſts from every ſide, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pruned, unadviſed in a great degree; can ſuch be expected to bring forth plentiful crops of full, ripe, well flavoured fruit? nay, rather the ſavour of the wild grape is to be feared, becauſe the trees are left in a great meaſure without cultivation. Now as the hedge is thus ſadly taken away, and the wall greatly broken down, we are ſenſible the reparation muſt be by
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030834_0094_0FE9A2B1436B6978"/>gradual ſteps; yea, by laying a ſingle ſtone at a time, and planting a tender twig. And thoſe who are engaged in this neceſſary work, will find as Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah did, before he went to repair the walls of Jeruſalem, ſadneſs of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ere they can entreat the Almighty for liberty to engage in the work. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of a heart truly touched with love and zeal for the good of the church of Chriſt, can adopt this language, "Here am I, ſend me," or "qualify me and let me go." May it be yours, Oh! ye beloved, tender plants of the Lord's right hand planting, and when it is, ſtifle it not, but go on in the ſtrength of the Lord, not ſaying, "Here am I, and I will go in the ſtrength of my own ſpirit, will, or wiſdom." No, we give our teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for our Lord and maſter, that theſe forward, unſavory ſpirits, will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the people, nor bring glory to God. But you who are of the former rank, though you may meet with many diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, as Nehemiah did, yet if ye truſt in the Lord with all your hearts, and ſingly eye his light in yourſelves, not conferring with fleſh and blood, nor ſeeking your own honour, but the honour of him that ſent you into life, it is our teſtimony to you for encouragement, that the Lord will bleſs his work in your hands,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030834_0095_0FE9A2702C3C8DF0"/>and richly reward you for it, though you may have a long and painful travail, and ſometimes as in the night ſeaſon, before you come at the right place for building; and when you come there, you will find much rubbiſh to be removed.</p>
                        <p>This we apprehend muſt be the firſt work before our ſtone can be properly laid on the right foundation, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have all unſanctified ſpirits, both of your own and other ſocieties, excluded the privilege of ſitting in your meetings for buſineſs; otherwiſe we believe it will be building with the rubbiſh, which will never ſtand to the honour of God and the good of his people.</p>
                        <p>Our minds are ſo ſenſibly affected with the pernicious tendency of that evil cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, of ſuffering your meetings for the diſcipline of the church to be thus mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we cannot help adviſing (believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the mind of truth) that you uſe your chriſtian endeavours for an alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, by making a minute againſt this diſorderly practice, and ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the putting of it in force in the ſeveral monthly meetings throughout the colony, for which you have authority from the univerſal practice of friends where the diſcipline is rightly conducted,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030834_0096_0FE9A271C03E12A0"/>as well as from the original inſtitution of ſuch meetings.</p>
                        <p>And now having in a good degree eaſed our ſpirits of what ſeemed to reſt upon them, on your account, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in that love which ſeeks the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and good of the heritage of God, with ſaying, be ſober, be vigilant and of one mind, and deſiring the God of peace may be with you, in this your annual aſſembly, we remain your friends in the truth.</p>

               <p>At this meeting of friends at Weſt-river, we were falſely accuſed of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from outward information, when in truth it was from the opening of the word of life; this we were frequently ſuſpected of, and charged with, by unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who knew not the intelligence of the ſpirit, though they made profeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>We paſſed through the weſtern ſide of Maryland called Saſſifrax bay, and took meetings in our way; but after we entered Pennſylvania, had no openneſs to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030834_0097_0FE9A274B00BE188"/>appoint meetings in that province, the Jerſeys or Long Iſland, except one, but paſſed on in a pretty direct line, falling in with ſome meetings as they came in courſe till we got to Rhode Iſland, the day before the yearly meeting which was held at Newport, it was large and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a good degree of divine power, peace and concord. At this meeting we found our minds engaged to labour for ſome regulation in the diſcipline, which was ſadly out of order, in particular that unwiſe practice of having meetings for that purpoſe, mixed with the world's people, and ſuch as were proper ſubjects to have it exerciſed upon, which ſeemed to be the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken. We prevailed ſo far as to have a minute made againſt it, and ſent to the ſeveral quarterly and monthly meetings, as the reſult of the yearly meeting, which gave us an opportunity as we fell in with them, to ſtrengthen friends in having their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſelect. It was remarkable that we fell in with ſo many of them in the courſe of our labour and ſervice: I write this for my own inſtruction and that of others, as an incitement to follow the leading of truth and the way it points out to us, though the cauſe may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear, and indeed on all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts I have ſeen it beſt ſo to do. One
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030834_0098_0FE9A27B154A5910"/>mark of providential care, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in this journey, is, I think, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remembrance; when at New York ſome friends of that city, and others, ſeemed inclined that we ſhould go by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Newport, in a ſloop that was to ſail next day; accordingly we went to view the veſſel, and found her very ſmall and inconvenient, having no cabin that we could well ſit, ſtand or lie in; they ſeemed to think we might make our paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in 24 or at moſt 48 hours; we ſat down quietly in her, to feel if there was freedom in the truth for us to go, a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I like to be found in on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in which time, and before I went it appeared to me, that if we ſailed in her, we ſhould meet with greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than if we went by land to South-hold, and thence to Newport by water. I told friends that I had more freedom to go by land, and they readily agreed to it. The veſſel ſailed from New York as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, we went as propoſed, and had ſome meetings to good ſatisfaction, amongſt the Preſbyterians at and near South-hold, and fell in with a ſmall meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of friends in the way, having alſo ſome ſeaſoning opportunities among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, wherein the divine preſence was manifeſted to our mutual comfort. We waited ſome days at South-hold for a fair
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030834_0099_0FE9A27CABEA08F0"/>wind, went on board and landed the ſame evening: the ſloop which it was intended we ſhould go in, arrived only the ſame day, being 8 days on her paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>At Philadelphia the 23d of the 5th mo. I received the ſorrowful tidings of the death of my dear and tender father, who departed this life in much peace and quietude of ſpirit, on the 23d of the 2d month laſt, according to the account I received from thoſe who were preſent; he having been favoured with his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a ſenſe of his change. This was of a truth ſore and hard to bear. I have great cauſe to bleſs and praiſe his great name, who ſupported me beyond my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation or deſert under this trial, as well as prepared my mind for it, by a foreſight of it, both ſleeping and waking. I ſaw, in a dream, my father in the agonies of death, and in the time of his illneſs, day after day, felt ſuch a ſympathy of ſoul as is not eaſily expreſſed, and after that ſuch a ſtop in my mind, from thinking of or writing to him, as convinced me that he was gone, the account of which I fully expected.</p>
               <p>We attended a quarterly meeting at Hampton in New England, where we
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030834_0100_0FE9A27E437C3258"/>had to teſtify againſt an unruly ſeparate ſpirit, though we had not ſeen or heard of it outwardly, as I declared to them; nothing to convince us of it but the ſpirit of truth, they would not believe, though high pretenders to revelation. They abundantly convinced us before the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly meeting was over of our being right, for ſuch was their outrage, that they uſed the utmoſt of their power to prevent us from ſpeaking in the meeting, to eaſe our minds, by noiſes both within and without the houſe; but truth gave us the victory and ſet our ſpirits over them.</p>
               <p>After we had ſpent ſome time in this quarter, and viſited friends generally, eaſtward of Boſton, as far as North Yarmouth, on my return I found my mind ſecretly drawn towards a ſeparate people, at Hampton in New England, but as it was a ſervice likely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with more than common diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, I waited to have a more clear ſign and ſtronger evidence of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which the Lord was pleaſed to give me in his own time; he knew the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my heart and that I had no will to diſobey him. We paſſed the place 14 miles, before I received ſuch a ſatisfactory evidence, as I had wiſhed for, in which I believe there was wiſdom, as ſome friends
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030834_0101_0FE9A27FCEB6E438"/>might perhaps have judged me, as being too forward on entering on a ſervice of ſuch weight and difficulty. At Newberry, where were friends from ſeveral meetings, I found my mind ſo ſtrongly drawn, and with ſuch weight towards this people, as rendered me quite unfit for any other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it ſeeming impoſſible for me to think of any thing elſe in that meeting, except laying my concern before friends there; which I was fully perſuaded, was what truth pointed out to me. Accordingly at the cloſe of the meeting, I requeſted the moſt ſolid, concerned friends to ſtay, when I told them how it had been with me; they readily agreed to my going, and divers gave up to accompany us. My companion at firſt ſeemed affrighted about going, and wept conſiderably, I left her quite at liberty to ſtay or go, and in the morning ſhe found her way open and had good ſervice. They received us with much ſeeming kindneſs, particularly one who appeared to be like the head of them, and was the perſon whom I chiefly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee: He ſpoke many fair words to us before the meeting, and told us that he looked upon it as a favour from the Lord, that we were ſent to them; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meeting, when I came to tell him my mind freely, and deliver the meſſage which I had to him, he ſoon changed and
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030834_0102_0FE9A2878BDDFE90"/>treated me roughly: declaring that I would not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nd mercy with the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I repented of my proceedings againſt him and them, at the quarterly meeting at Hampton. We had a ſeaſonable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to eaſe our minds, in which our maſter was with us, by his ſpirit and power, and I was made ſenſible that there was in that place, a people ſincere in their ſearches and endeavours after religion, which the Lord regarded, though under many deluſions and miſtakes. In this quarter (New England) cloſe and hard work fell to our lots, amongſt thoſe who called themſelves of our ſociety, which was difficult to be accompliſhed, becauſe many thought themſelves whole, while in reality they needed a phyſician, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting an unlawful familiarity with the world. Unbounded curioſity in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, cauſed meetings to be thronged, that in hot weather it was exceeding hard to ſit them, and much more trying to ſpeak in them; but he who ſearches the hearts of all, and knows their intentions, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe wrong ſpirits, by cloſing our mouths in ſilence one meeting after another; which greatly diſpleaſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and drew upon us great reproach, lies and ſlander, all which we were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to bear patiently, and rejoice in, for our Maſter's ſake. We were led to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030834_0103_0FE9A289539F3950"/>to ſeparate thoſe under our name from others, and at times ſome of the ruling members from the reſt, to whom we had very cloſe things to offer, feeling that the declenſion which ſo glaringly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the ſociety, had reached many of their borders. This ſeemed a very hard taſk to get accompliſhed becauſe of their being ſo connected in marriage, &amp;c. and the diſcipline being ſo ſadly let fall, they knew not who were, or who were not proper members.</p>
               <p>In ſome places we had to viſit particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar families, before we could caſt off our burdens, as in Boſton; where I was led to find out ſome hidden works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the workers whereof ought to be cut off from the name and ſociety of friends, in order to clear it and them from the ſcandal they brought on it; one young man in particular, with whom we had to treat on his being likely to marry with one of another ſociety. It aroſe in my heart while we talked with him, that he was deeply tinctured with deiſm, a diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the ſcriptures, the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh, and his ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by his ſpirit; I told him my opinion of him which he acknowledged to be true, and ſpoke in defence of it; I told him the ground whence his unbelief
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030834_0104_0FE9A28AE22539E8"/>ſprung, <hi>viz.</hi> leaning to his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and departing from the light, which alone can convince of God and godlineſs. I left ſome parts of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try not quite clear in my ſpirit, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a weight, and particularly Newport, I was given up in my mind to return to it, but could not then find my way open. I was adviſed by a friend to leave it for the preſent; I did ſo, and travelled under great exerciſe of ſpirit through Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, but without condemnation. At Oblong I had a ſight that my dear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion C. P. and I were to ſeparate, for the work's ſake, I had been at times much ſtraitened in my ſervice by preferring her and her gift, for I was greatly afraid and jealous over my own heart, leſt ſelf ſhould have any part in our ſeparation, from a deſire of appearing greater than with a companion; another thing which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me with conſiderable weight, was her youth, and the many dangers that might attend if not rightly ſuited with a companion. Theſe and many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, would I believe have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, had not the Lord laid his hand upon me, in a remarkable manner, on this wiſe. My mind was ſtripped of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for ſervice, and deeply bowed to the centre of all ſtrength for inſtruction, in which ſtate I had a deſire given me to be
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030834_0105_0FE9A2B4644DF200"/>at Philadelphia, and to go thither pretty direct without appointing many meetings: accordingly I deſired that not more than two meetings, which lay in the way, might be appointed, but my companion and ſome other friends, encouraged the appointing more.

                  <p>Thy acceptable letter, perhaps, might have been acknowledged ſooner, had I not a hope or expectation of ſeeing thee ere now; hope did I ſay? alas! I ſhould have none, but doing and ſuffering the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030834_0106_0FE9A28E0D18C0B0"/>will of God; all others ſeem forbidden, and are through divine favour, pretty much reſtrained. My ſtay being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in this country, has been altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unexpected to myſelf, and I have been held in ſuch uncertainty for ſome months paſt, as not to be able to give my friends any information reſpecting future move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I have ſtood as a ſoldier waiting for the word of command, to march wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever my holy leader may be pleaſed to direct; and may ſay to the praiſe of his great name, that he is not an hard maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but good and bountiful every way; for though I have (as recited) been kept as a day-ſervant in a kind of undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined ſtate in regard to our ſtay, yet may ſay of a truth, that I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ever to have had ſuch a degree of ſteady peace, and holy, unmixed qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude of mind, ſo long together, amidſt many cloſe, deep trials and exerciſes in religious duties, ſome of ſuch a nature as I had not been tried with before, and which required the utmoſt fortitude, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and patience. There is here the old phariſaical ſpirit, which I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had to war with, and it ſeems to love me no better than uſual. I ſhall now proceed to give thee a narrative of the manner of my ſtay, which to do, I muſt begin with an unlooked-for proſpect
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030834_0107_0FE9A294884E9258"/>ſet before me the ſummer after our land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hath rarely, if ever, wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. How it may be, I cannot at preſent foreſee: but this I know, that it has proved as ballaſt to my mind, with reſpect to going homewards this fall, as alſo a means to ſeparate me and my dear companion, which I believe was in the wiſdom of truth. It was preſented before laſt fall, with a draft to this city, ſo that I was ready to conclude I muſt have gone before my viſit to this continent was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I mean to one or more of the Weſt-India iſlands, but after waiting ſome weeks in this city, wrapped as in a thick cloud, as to any light which way I ſhould turn, whether home or elſewhere; (for to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point meetings any where on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent I dared not till the light went before me, having attended ſome that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly appointed without my directions, till I was become as a ſign and wonder to myſelf and others) my way opened to finiſh my journey on this continent ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from my former companion, which I was aſſiſted to perform with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſatisfaction to myſelf, and, I hope ſome little edification to the churches. In the latter part of this journey, it pleaſed my good maſter, to bring me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt ſevere baptiſm and crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I ever knew in the courſe of
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030834_0108_0FE9A29622360A98"/>my religious experience, partly on my own account, and on the account of ſome, to whom I had been made a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and inſtrumental to help into the way of life and ſalvation, who, looking at the creature more than the Creator, who is worthy for ever, became entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, as a lamb caught in a thicket; it was then that I felt the depth, and true meaning of that emphatical ſaying of the holy apoſtle, "my little children, for whom I travail in birth till Chriſt be formed in you." And Oh! the pangs and throes, the ſighs and groans, which a mother in Iſrael has to paſs through and put up, it is ſomething like the ſuffering which the captain of our ſalvation paſſed through, in bringing many ſons and daughters to glory; it is with the utmoſt reverence and fear that I make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, between him and his miniſters, who are to fill up in their bodies that which is behind of his ſufferings. But I ſeemed to myſelf, and was as one nailed to the croſs, day and night, for weeks together, with this deſire or prayer fixed in my heart: "Let me not come down from the croſs, till the glorious deſign be fully accompliſhed, that ſo thy will may be done by me, in me, and upon me, in time and in eternity:" and truly the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was not removed until this became
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030834_0109_0FE9A297C0946830"/>the happy ſituation of my mind, that to live or die, to be in health or ſickneſs, in proſperity or adverſity, in Europe or America, in France or Spain, to paſs through good or evil report, in the will of God, ſeemed juſt the ſame to me. I write not theſe things boaſtingly, but to the glory of God. Thou and others know what I am by nature, that in me (that is, in my fleſh) dwells no good thing. This was the neceſſary preparative for the fore-named ſtate of peaceful ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of conſcience, in a ſituation to which nature is above all things moſt averſe, to wit, daily dependence and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, being indebted or obligated to others for ſupport, having nothing that it can call its own, ſave weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and this is that glorious myſtery, and ſeeming contradiction, which the holy apoſtle ſpeaks of, in having nothing, and yet poſſeſſing all things. In this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of mind I entered this city, having looked round me every way, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to turn as I might be drawn by the power of matchleſs love, and hoped from the looſeneſs which I then felt from all parts of this continent, that I might be permitted to return home with my brother (who I had heard was in town, and likely to ſail ſoon) even if my companion could not go with me: but it was with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030834_0110_0FE9A2995076CC48"/>that I might probably return to this country if life was ſpared, and I knew not how ſoon. On coming hither, found that my brother was gone, and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion not clear of this continent, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to wait for her a few weeks, or if it might be, months, ſhe expreſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common concern at the thoughts of being left behind. During the time I waited for her, ſome friends propoſed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me in viſiting part of the families of friends in this city, a ſervice which had divers times been preſented to my mind in the courſe of my journey, yea, before I left London, and when the propoſal was made, I found a perfect freedom to to join with it, it being with the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the monthly meeting, little ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing I ſhould be held to it in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have been; but it is a ſervice which the Lord hath been pleaſed to bleſs in a remarkable manner. I have been in 160 families, and attended ſix meetings every week whilſt in town, as health permits, beſides viſiting the ſick and afflicted, and taking ſome excurſions to the country. My companion when ſhe came to town, being ſometimes poorly in health, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded but ſlowly; we now go together, having tired moſt of our companions, beſides a couple of men friends, who go to ſhow us the doors, and be witneſs to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030834_0111_0FE9A2A0EF3E48B8"/>our labours; there are nearly as many yet to viſit, as I have been with. Whether I ſhall go this winter, or ever, to any of the iſlands mentioned, is at preſent hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from me; but had not the proſpect afreſh opened after I had been here ſome time, I think I dare not have admitted the thoughts of ſtaying this winter; but have been bleſſed with ſeeing, yea, have been made inſtrumental to help back ſome of the before mentioned lambs to the fold, one in particular, in this city, who I hope may be made a ſerviceable inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>I have now given up expectation of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my native land before the ſpring; at which time I hope to have the company of our beloved friend Samuel Fothergill, on ſhip board. He is now in this city, alſo John Churchman and divers other friends, on the affairs of the ſociety. It is a difficult time to friends in thoſe parts, who are concerned to keep up their Chriſtian teſtimony againſt wars and bloodſhed: and eſpecially to ſuch as are concerned in ſtate affairs. I have had my health better than common in this city, for which bleſſing, with all others, that I am an unworthy partaker of, I deſire to be humbly thankful.</p>

                  <p>Without the leaſt deſign to leſſen pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental authority, or filial obedience, ſo far as they are either lawful or expedient, I would remark to thee, that divers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of this age have bent their thoughts and deſires too much to earth, to have a clear, diſtinct diſcerning of the times and ſeaſons in a ſpiritual ſenſe, and the ſacred purpoſes of him whoſe wiſdom is unſearchable, and his ways paſt finding out, by all the penetration of finite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, uninfluenced by his own eternal light, and even then we ſee and know but in part whilſt here, but ſome of us have believed and ſeen in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of light, that the day of goſpel light which has dawned, will riſe higher and higher; notwithſtanding that ſome clouds may at times intercept its beauty and brightneſs, as hath been ſorrowfully the caſe amongſt us as a people who have been highly favoured. And though I have not the leaſt deſign to derogate from the real worth of thoſe honourable ſons of the morning, who were made inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in a great degree to break down the partition wall, which carnal, ſelfiſh man had erected between the people and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030834_0113_0FE9A2A49DD730D0"/>the Sun of righteouſneſs, I am not afraid to ſay, and give it under my hand, that it was and is the deſign of God that his people in future ages ſhould carry on the reformation even further than they did; and notwithſtanding that a night of apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy has come over us, as a people (as day and night ſucceed each other in their ſeaſon and God keeps his covenant with both) I am of the judgment that that day has begun to dawn, in which the Sun of righteouſneſs will riſe higher and with greater luſtre than heretofore, and if thoſe who are called of God to be the ſons of this morning, look back to the night, and to them who have ſlept and been drunken in the night, by ſipping of the golden cup of abomination, as even to the latter day, they will fruſtrate the deſigns of Providence reſpecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though not reſpecting his own work, for it is his ſacred determination to be glorious in heaven and glorified on earth, though thoſe who would be called his Iſrael be not gathered. And I am of the faith that when the goſpel has been firſt preached to them, as it is meet it ſhould, that ſuch as neglect to embrace it, will be left, and the feet of the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers turned another way, even to the highways and hedges with a power of compulſive love which will prevail on the halt, the maimed and the blind, to come
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030834_0114_0FE9A2A7CB82CAE8"/>to the marriage of the King's Son, and by coming they ſhall be made ſtrong, beautiful, and lively, and not look back to thoſe things that are behind, but preſs forward towards the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt, following no men's example further than they follow him, and what if I ſay in the faith which is given me, that God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to carry ſome of this generation in theſe parts of the world, higher and further in righteouſneſs than their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were carried, even ſuch as were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in their day, and therefore let them take heed that they limit not the Holy One of Iſrael, nor circumſcribe the leadings of his bleſſed unerring Spirit, by looking too much at the example of others; for this has been a means of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the gradual progreſſion of many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious well-begun reformations; inſtead of going forward, they have looked back, and even ſunk below the ſtandard of the firſt reformers, and ſuch as will be the firſt happy inſtruments to labour for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in this degenerate age, muſt differ in their trials from the ſons of the former morning, and will find them to be of a more ſevere and piercing kind; theirs were from the world, and ſuch as they might juſtly expect from them (though not exempt from falſe brethren) our will chiefly ariſe from thoſe under the ſame

                  <p>And now in regard to the matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by thee, I ſhall anſwer briefly, that I am of the judgment that if thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſingle and upright in thy mind from all the falſe biaſſes of nature and intereſt of things, ſtopping thine ear to fallacious reaſonings, thou wilt find it more ſafe to ſuffer with the people of God, than to enter on or undertake doubtful things.</p>

            <p>After her return from America ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the national meeting in the 11 mo. 1756, and returned a lively account of her journey. In the 2d mo. following ſhe laid her intentions of marriage, with Samuel Neale, before the monthly meeting of Mountmelick, to which ſhe belonged, after which ſhe found a concern to join in a viſit to the familes of friends throughout that monthly meeting. When ſhe had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſervice ſhe returned home, and on the 17th of 3d mo. 1757, was married to our aforeſaid friend in the meeting of Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath.

And though ſhe did not expreſs herſelf in words, yet there was a language in the ſound, which fully manifeſted, that ſhe triumphed over death, hell, and the grave, for ſhe longed to be diſſolved, intreating the Lord to give her a releaſe, if it was conſiſtent with his holy will.</p>
            <p>About half an hour before her removal, her pain being taken away, ſhe ſaid, "I praiſe thy name, O my God, for this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour." After which ſhe quietly departed, like one falling into a ſweet ſleep.</p>
