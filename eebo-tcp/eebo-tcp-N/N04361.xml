            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ALTHO' Human Learning is not eſteemed an eſſential Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the Society of which the Author of the enſuing ſmall Treatiſe became a Member and Miniſter, yet inaſmuch as it is eſteemed ſo by ſome of other Chriſtian Societies, the ſaid Treatiſe may be better accepted of ſuch, when they are acquainted that he was a Scholar, which to ſhew, pleaſe to obſerve, that <q>He was one trained up to Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005393_0003_101732DE76DEB508"/>and had ſtudied diligently in the Univerſity, and tho' he was but young then, yet of pious Converſation, diſliked many Ceremonies and Cuſtoms in the Schools. When he had finiſhed his Courſe there, he was ordain'd a Prieſt of the Church of England, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain great Man took him to be his Chaplain; and afterwards he got a Living at <hi>Lydd,</hi> worth about <hi>two Hundred</hi> Pounds a Year. But after having been thus employ'd ſome time, he came to ſee that <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi> was an human Inſtitution, and to <hi>preach</hi> for Wages unlawful.—And becoming in time more and more uneaſy to go on in Acting what was burthenſom to his Conſcience, he reſolved to deſiſt from his Miniſtry, and ſo he went to the Biſhop and delivered up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that he had received from him to preach; and caſting himſelf upon God's Providence, he took a Farm and turn'd Graſier, by which Means he maintained his Wife and Children

            <head>Sect. 1.</head>
            <p>OUR Teſtimony, and that Truth to which we bear Teſtimony, who by thoſe to whom Woe is, foraſmuch as they tremble not at the Word of God, are ſcornfully ſtiled <hi>Quakers,</hi> is no different Thing, nor another, but plainly one and altogether-the ſame, which all the Holy Men and Prophets of God have held forth, as alſo CHRIST himſelf and all his Apoſtles and Miniſters, as many as have ſpoken as they were moved of God from the beginning of the World to this very Day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For even as they (whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony who even few or none either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or received) ſo we, who are of her Children, of all and only whom Wiſdom is juſtified, give Teſtimony to Wiſdom itſelf, not the Wiſdom of this World, nor of the Princes of this World,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005393_0007_101732E313803BB8"/>who come to nought, but to that hidden Wiſdom, which none of the Princes of this World knew (for had they known, they would not crucify the Lord of Glory) The <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> is a Myſtery, even the Light of the Lord God and JESUS CHRIST, who are Light, <hi>and in whom is no Darkneſs at all;</hi> yea to that glorious <hi>Light</hi> that is now ariſing to <hi>enlighten</hi> that Holy City <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> where now there is to be no more Night, into <hi>which nothing ſhall in any wiſe enter that defileth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning which <hi>Light</hi> CHRIST himſelf ſaid to <hi>Paul,</hi> being now truly Converted to it, which he perſecuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, through the blindneſs of his Mind, <hi>I now ſend thee to the Nations, to open their Eyes and turn them from Darkneſs to Light, from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of Sins, and Inheritance among them which are ſanctified by Faith that is in me.</hi> Acts, 26.17, 18.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Neither was this the Buſineſs and Miniſtry which <hi>Paul</hi> only receiv'd of God, that he might fulfil it; but <hi>John</hi> alſo teſtifies, that this was the Meſſage
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005393_0008_101733188CFEE780"/>which he, together with the reſt of CHRIST'S Miniſters, had received from CHRIST himſelf, to declare, which was alſo from the Beginning, not any new Thing, (however it might ſeem new, as being clouded till the Darkneſs was paſt, and the true Light ſhined again out of the Darkneſs that ſometime clouded it) but the old Thing, which was from the Beginning, namely, <hi>That God is Light, and in him is no Darkneſs at all, and that if we ſay we have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, and walk in Darkneſs, we lye and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have mutual Fellowſhip with him, and the Blood of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>his Son, cleanſeth us from all Sin,</hi> 1 John 1.5, 6, 7. Moreover, that <hi>who ſaith he is in the Light and hateth his Brother, is in Darkneſs even until now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Concerning which <hi>Light of God,</hi> of which the Scripture every were ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and from which enlightning the Penmen thereof, the Scripture itſelf was given forth, which alſo was, which alſo ſhined in the Heart of Man long before
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005393_0009_101732E775DFDAD8"/>the Scriptures were; we, together with the Scripture and the Writers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, do teſtify this ſelf ſame Thing, namely, That a certain Meaſure, certain Beams were of old, and now are given of God, in the Conſcience of every of them, to the Sons of Men, who altho' God made them after his own Image, upright and blameleſs, have yet ſought out to themſelves both various and vain Inventions, and corrupted their Ways and erred: And as to any help they can have from themſelves, are in a Manner wholy periſned from the true God, and <hi>from the Knowledge of him, whom truly to know is Life eternal,</hi> and from all Communion with him, to ſhine in their dark Hearts as a Light in a Dark Place, and to bring them back through the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of their evil Deeds, Words, and Thoughts, and of that whole Chaos of Confuſion and Corruption that came in by the Fall, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation this Light will bring on all that take good heed to it and through the Mortification of that old Man and Body, as well of Death as Sin, with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005393_0010_1017331D1F6DDE30"/>all its earthly Members; and in a Word, of all whatever in Man is contrary to the Image and Will of God, and turn them back unto God, unto that <hi>primitive State</hi> of <hi>Purity, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,</hi> from which they departed to worſhip Images in their own Imagination, to know and to worſhip the true God, who is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> truly <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> with which Worſhip only the Lord is worſhipped according to his Will; and laſtly, to enjoy ſuch ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Peace and Communion with him, as none are by any Means poſſible (as is aforeſaid) capable of, while they are alienated from him by the <hi>Darkneſs of Iniquity,</hi> and while they remain in their <hi>Tranſgreſſion incorrigible</hi> and <hi>unconverted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Rom. 3, 6, 9, 19. <hi>For both Jew and Gentiles</hi> (as it is written) <hi>are concluded all under Sin, there is not one Righteous, no not one; there is none that underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, there is none that ſeeketh after God, they are all gone out of the Way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that doeth Good, no not one; their Throat is an open Sepulchre, with their Tongues
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005393_0011_101732E900307258"/>they have uttered Deceit, the Poyſon of Aſps is under their Lips, their Mouth is full of Curſing and Bitterneſs, their Feet is ſwift to ſhed Blood, Waſting and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is in their Way, and the Way of Peace they have not known, there is no Fear of God before their Eyes. So that every Mouth is ſtopped and the whole World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty before God, for all have ſinned and fallen ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. This is the State of all Mankind ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the <hi>Fall</hi> from the <hi>Light</hi> into the <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> among whom even all of whatſoever Sex, Nation, Language, Condition or Age (at leaſt that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſcern between Good and Evil) I ſay, all may ſay within themſelves, We are loſt, we are gone down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the utmoſt Darkneſs, into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Damnation from God: Neither is there any other way to Life exhibited, but by JESUS CHRIST the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> by ſome Meaſure of <hi>Light</hi> at leaſt ſhining from himſelf, <hi>enlightning</hi> (as it's ſaid) <hi>every Man that comes into the World, ſhining in Darkneſs,</hi> in the dark Conſciences of Men, <hi>though the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005393_0012_101733201C9327B0"/>Darkneſs comprehended it not.</hi> Holding by the Hand alſo, and as it were leading by the Hand thoſe that being enſnared in Chains of Darkneſs, and thruſt down into the Pit, do not wink with their Eyes, to the further blinding of them, but according to the Council of Chriſt himſelf, believe in the <hi>Light</hi> whilſt they have it, that they may become Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Light: For I am the Light of the World,</hi> (ſaith <hi>CHRIST</hi>) <hi>he that followeth me ſhall not walk in Darkneſs, but ſhall have the Light of Life;</hi> alſo, <hi>I am come a Light into the World, that whoſoever believeth in me may not remain in Darkneſs,</hi> John 12.46, &amp;c. <hi>I came not to damn the World, but to ſave the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. In this Manner therefore is CHRIST the <hi>Salvation of the World,</hi> as he is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> deſtroying the Works of the Devil, who hath wrought in the Darkneſs to the ſetting up of a <hi>Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom to himſelf</hi> in the Hearts of Men, and redeeming Men from the Power of the Prince of the Darkneſs of this World unto God, who
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005393_0013_101732EBF5675B30"/>is <hi>Light,</hi> and to ſee <hi>Light,</hi> even the <hi>Light of Life</hi> in his <hi>Light, Pſalm</hi> 18.28, 29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. In like manner doth the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> affirm <hi>CHRIST to be given of God for a Covenant to the People for a Light to the Nations, to open the blind Eyes, and to bring out of Priſon them that ſit in Darkneſs, even the Blind, which have Eyes and ſee not,</hi> Iſa. 42.6, &amp;c. And after him <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifyeth, that <hi>Chriſt was ſet as a Light to the Nations, that he might be the Lords Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.

            <p n="10">10. In as much therefore as CHRIST is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> he is the <hi>Saviour of the World,</hi> and ſo far only are men ſaved by him as they believe in him, who is the <hi>Light,</hi> and in that <hi>Light</hi> where with he doth <hi>enlighten</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man, in his own Conſcience, and
