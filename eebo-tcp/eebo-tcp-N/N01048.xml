            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I have this Book of <hi>G W.</hi> by me, to ſhew to all that doubt of the truth of it; in which Book <hi>G. W.</hi> indeed ſpeaks highly of what they call their ſpiritual Blood of their Chriſt or Light within. But [as you ſee before] he rejects the human Blood of Chriſt. <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſays, Chriſt in the Male and Female is the ſeed, and the ſeed Chriſt — And the Blood of the ſeed cleanſeth from ſin, <hi>Gr. Miſtery</hi> pag. 299, 281. And this ſeed <hi>W. P.</hi> denys to be the Perſon born of the Virgin, but ſays, 'tis a principle of Light in man [as you ſee before] ſo that 'tis this imagined inward Blood and not the human Blood, that <hi>C. P.</hi> alſo means; by which he deceives the unwary Reader: Therefore he ought to make publick ſatisfaction for offering both by a lye and Jeſuitical meaning thus to betray the ignorant and ſimple hearted into this blaſphemous notion of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to <hi>C. A's</hi> denying the <hi>imagined God above the Sars,</hi> C. P. ſays, <hi>They have diſowned both the paſſage and the Author.</hi> But this alſo is a piece of <hi>Fox-Craft;</hi> for they do not diſown the ſame Doctrine, (as you ſee before) <hi>W. B.</hi> aſſerts the very ſame Doctrine, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> own and Juſtify. They did indeed diſown the ſaid <hi>Atkins</hi> after he was hanged for fellony, and I never heard they diſowned him before; for they owned him after he had lain with <hi>Simons</hi> his Maid in <hi>Norwich</hi> Goal, becauſe he confeſt the fact; for he continued a travelling Preacher afterwards. But this <hi>Bomb-Searcher</hi> would make his Reader believe that they diſown'd <hi>Atkins</hi> becauſe of that doctrine; which is deceit, and ſtill confirms <hi>F. B's</hi> Charge, That the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Writers and Preachers make it their whole buſineſs to deceive.</p>
               <p>Now, before we come to the Charges in the <hi>Bomb,</hi> I take notice, the <hi>Quakers</hi> in pag. 6. of the Preface, confeſs, That if we can prove thoſe Charges, they own themſelves neither fit for Religious nor Civil Societies. Tho' this be a meer vaunt, a ſham, and they intend it for nothing elſe but Mockery; yet they are hereby manifeſtly Self-Judged and Self-Condemn'd; for they know that not only theſe, but many more as erronious Charges has been often proved upon them, ſo as that they never dare venture to refer the cauſe between them and their Adverſaries to indifferent men.</p>
               <p>He enters, pag. 14. upon the firſt charge of their Contempt of the holy Scriptures, which is fully proved in the Quotations, page 2, 3 for though I have not now the books by me that calls them Beaſtly Ware, an Idol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet to call faith in the hiſtory of Chriſts Manifeſtation (<hi>viz.</hi> the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) a deadly Poiſon, as <hi>W P.</hi> does; This I take to be as great a contempt as can be put upon the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>But here <hi>C P.</hi> to defend or excuſe their Rage againſt the Scriptures, ſays That <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid that a Prieſt ſaid, that the Letter of the Scripture is God. But I cannot think that the <hi>Quakers</hi> heartily believe that this is not a lye of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d Lye, yet they know we cannot diſprove it, becauſe <hi>Fox</hi> quotes no mans Book for it.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that ſome mad man or other had ſaid the letter of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is God, does this juſtify <hi>Fox</hi> in calling them Serpents Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet call his own Writings The Word of God? Friend <hi>Caleb</hi> ſeems here to be got into a vein of Jeſting or Comical diſſemulation; for he would have it, that 'tis only the Ink and Paper, the Letter that they quarrel at, as if their own Books were not made of Paper and Letter as well as the Bible. But <hi>Fox</hi> ſays, <hi>Feeding upon the Letter, which is Death, which feeds you Serpents, Dogs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have ſhewed in this years Almanack from matter of fact, that they ſtill hold the ſame Opinion of the ſcriptures, even while with the next breath they will ſay, they believe them of divine Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their blaſphemous denyal of the holy Trinity is plain pag. 2, 3. whereby the <hi>Quakers</hi> excluded themſelves from being Proteſtant Diſſenters; They can have no benefit of the Act of toleration that denys the Trinity of three Perſons in the God-head, as it is declared in the 39 Articles [which every true <hi>Quaker</hi> does deny] And this the laſt page of that Law expreſly declares.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they deny <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be Chriſt the Son of God, this is proud by almoſt every Quotation on that head at pag. 3. And yet this <hi>Bomb-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ercher</hi> has the impudence to ſay, this is an abominable, a notorious falſhood and brings long quotations to prove the contrary. But here lies a Snake in the Graſs, as I ſhall diſcover anon, and that there is need of large railing, to hide their vile Opinion on this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Their neglect and contempt of the Ordinances is ſhewed but ſhort in pag. 3. becauſe their practice proves it without Quotations. But if they are not content with this, they may look in <hi>News out of the North,</hi> pag 4. where <hi>Fox</hi> calls Baptiſm and Chriſts Ordinance, the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain.</hi> And pag. 14. what the Apoſtles calls the Table and Cup of the Lord, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. <hi>Fox</hi> calls, The Table of Devils, and Cup of Devils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That they undervalue the Sufferings of Chriſt, by affirming, their own Sufferings to be greater and more unjuſt. This is plainly ſaid at pag. 3 and is not denyed, but excuſed by this <hi>Bomb-S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> Charge being proved in the firſt, I'll ſay no more of it, ſeeing he is ſilent in it.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe Charges in the <hi>Bomb</hi> are breifly, yet fully proved by the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before, Notwithſtanding the great noiſy long Preachments and railing in the <hi>Bomb-Searcher</hi> to drive his Reader from the Scent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall now for confirmation, enlarge a little upon their denyal of Chriſt, and their Arts to hide their monſtrous Notion of him.</p>

They own a Perſonal Chriſt, and a man Chriſt without them, but mean it only of what they call the Light within all men, which they ſay it without them alſo of <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> in pag. 97. of his anſwer to <hi>G. Keiths Nar.</hi> is as plain in this as any of them. Chriſt was truly man (ſays he) before he appeared in the outward Body, and that not only in his People, but out of or without them alſo; How long before? Even from the beginning (ſays he) ſo <hi>W. P.</hi> denys that Perſon born of a Virgin to be the ſeed promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. But ſays, 'tis a principle of Light in the heart, (as you ſee before.) Thus the <hi>Quakers</hi> Chriſt was a Man not only before he was made of a Woman, but even before any woman in the world was made. This is new doctrine, and is their foundation Error, whereon they build all the reſt, and whoever will take the pains to read <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Great Miſtery,</hi> pag. 246, 249, 205, 211. will there ſee that nothing will ſerve him but for the Light within to be whole Chriſt, God and Man, Fleſh, Body, Blood and Bones, and denys that Chriſt has any Body that is abſent from his People, and is now in the Preſence of his Father in Heaven without them; where he alſo holds, That it was God the Father that was born of the Virgin, or took human Nature.</p>
               <p>I have this <hi>Great Myſtry</hi> by me, and would gladly ſhew it to all who doubt of the truth of theſe Things.</p>
               <p>Now to diſcover the Snake aforeſaid, you muſt note, the <hi>Quakers</hi> have many times been urged and provoked to let the world know whether they believe in a Chriſt without them, now in haven, and whether they believe Chriſt is now and forever to come really a Man, in true and proper humane Nature without all other men? But they would never anſwer, Yea, to theſe Queries; but go round about 'em, and on every ſide, and ſeem to confeſs all, and much more, and yet mean nothing but to deceive. Thus this <hi>Bomb-Searcher,</hi> pag. 27. of the laſt part of his Book, to the firſt Query [<hi>Do you believe in a Chriſt without you,</hi> &amp;c?] ſays, if we mean that Chriſt is in heaven without us, as to his outward perſonal perſence, and in us by his ſpiritual appearance, it is their faith, as well as ours.</p>
               <p>Now obſerve, the deceit of theſe ſincere <hi>Quakers.</hi> The Query is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe Chriſt is in heaven without them (tho' even this they do not believe, but in their meaning aforeſaid) But the Query is, Do you believe IN a Chriſt without you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> believe to be ſaved by a Chriſt without you) This was the Query, and here it is that he deceives his unwary Reader, by hiding his head in a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e, like a Woodcock, and thinks no body ſees him; he might have ſpared his long preachments of Quotations (full of ſuch deceit as this) that he there brings from their Books to prove that they can ſay, Yea to thoſe Queries, as well as we; for only theſe three ſimple Letters
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001248_0009_0FB18B5D264706C8"/>
                  <hi>YEA,</hi> honeſtly expreſt, would have done it, without all this. O but then they are ſenſible it would have given the lye to their former Doctrine before quoted, which they ſay, is their faith ſtill, <hi>viz.</hi> That faith in Chriſt without m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n is contrary to the Apoſtles doctrine. And that the outward Chriſt is not the proper Son of God. And That Chriſt without is the falſe Chriſt. And that they are Reprobates that ſay they are ſaved by Chriſt without them. And much more to the ſame tune, which they muſt diſown if ever they come to own Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But in ſhort; their Diſobedience to the Commands and Ordinances of the outward Chriſt is ſufficient, without Quotations to prove that they deny him. For they cannot ſhew wherein they obey ſo much as one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, any more then the <hi>Jews</hi> do, who alſo deny him.</p>
               <p>Nay, I could ſhew wherein the <hi>Jews</hi> own more of Chriſt then the <hi>Quakers</hi> own; for the <hi>Quakers</hi> would make nothing of Chriſt but moral virtues. <hi>What is Chriſt</hi> (ſays <hi>W Penn</hi>) <hi>but Meekneſs, Juſtice, Mercy, Patience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> pag. 119. where alſo he declares moral men to be Chriſtians; and you ſee before, he calls it a deadly Poiſon to make any diſtinction between Chriſtian and Moral. Thus the <hi>Quakers</hi> are forced upon this ſhift to allow moral heathens, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> to be <hi>Chaiſtians,</hi> becauſe they have no other way in the world to prove themſelves Chriſtians; there is only this difference, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> are the better, as being more free from deceit, becauſe they make no pretence to Chriſtianity, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> do.</p>
               <p>But how ſtrange is their deluſion, who cannot ſee that at this rate there was no need at all of the holy Apoſtles being ſent to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> to preach the Goſpel of Peace and Salvation by Chriſt crucifyed. Nor indeed could there be any need of Chriſts coming, and being crucifyed. But the <hi>Quakers</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001248_0010_0FB18B5EAAEA5018"/>the Law and outward Powers; But here, having the power in their own hands, they are bold with it; and as if they would bid defiance to the Law, as well as to Chriſtianity, they direct (pag. 76) where 'tis publickly to be ſeen at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and recommend it to be read by ſober perſons; wherefore to ſhew further of the arts uſed by theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> for the diſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> I alſo recommend to every conſiderate Reader what here followes, truly quoted out of that Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> pag. 16, 20, 21, 22 He begins, pag. 16. thus; <q>The vulgar Doctrine of Satisfaction, dependent on the ſecond perſon of the imagined Trinity, Refuted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> Then he goes on ſome pages to refute it, and brings his reaſons to prove that Jeſus Chriſt did not make ſatisfaction to God for our ſins. And in pag. 20. he calls this following an Abſurdity, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <q>That the Finite and Impotent Creature is more capable of extending mercy &amp; forgiveneſs than the Infinite &amp; Omnipotent Creator — For admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting God to be a Creditor (ſays he) or he to whom the Debt ſhould be paid, and Chriſt he that pays it on the behalf of man, the Debtor, the Queſtion will ariſe, Whether he paid the debt, as God, or Man, or both?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not as God,</hi> (ſays he.)</p>
            <p n="2">II. <q>Becauſe if Chriſt pays the debt as God, then, the Father and Spirit being God, they alſo pay the debt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not as man</hi> (ſays he.)</p>
            <p n="3">III. <q>The Juſtice offending being infinite, his ſatisfaction ought to bear a proportion therewith, which Jeſus Chriſt, as Man, could never pay, he being FINITE, and from a finite cauſe, could not proceed an infinite effect; for ſo man may be ſaid to bring forth God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not as God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <q>For where two Mediums or Middle Propoſitions are ſingly inconſtent with the nature of the end for which they were at firſt propounded, their Conjunction does rather augment, than leſſen the difficulty of its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. <q>But Admitting one of theſe three Mediums poſſible for the payment of an infinite debt, yet pray obſerve, the moſt unworthy and ridiculous conſequences that will attend the impoſſibility of Gods pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>doning ſinners without a ſatisfaction.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <q>Since Chriſt could not pay what was not his own [debt] it follows, that in the payment of his own, the caſe ſtill remains equally greivous, ſince the debt is not hereby abſolved or forgiven, but transferred only, and by conſequence we are no better provided for ſalvation then before, owing that now to the Son which was once owing to the Father.</q> Thus <hi>William Penn,</hi> with much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001248_0011_0FB18B61620BA708"/>Now I deſire to obſerve three things from the Quotation <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ſee he denys that Chriſt either did or could pay our Debt, or make ſatisfaction to God for mans ſin; which is horrible to think on; Yea, he argues expreſly againſt any ſort of Satisfaction made by Chriſt for our ſins, as a thing Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and Non-ſence, as every reader may ſee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In pag. 62. I find this <hi>Bomb-Searcher</hi> puffing out a bag of wind at me (as his term is) for adding the word [<hi>Debt</hi>] to <hi>W. P</hi>'s laſt Paragraph between the Crotchets. But it being nine years ſince I wrote that Book, he mentions, I know not whether I added the word or took it ſo from another impreſſion, of <hi>W. P's</hi> however, now I own I have added it, and here offer to ſtand or fall by the Judgment of all good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whether I have done ill therein, or not; yea, let any <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhew, if he can, wherein it alters the ſence of the paſſage. I ſay, it does not: 'tis as blaſphemous without it, as with it; So all to whom I have ſhewed it, ſay that <hi>W. Ps</hi> words bear the ſame ſenſe either with or without that word [<hi>Debt</hi>] 'Tis only more plain with the wore <hi>Debt,</hi> to mean capacities. For 'tis nothing elſe but the <hi>Debt</hi> of our ſins that <hi>W. P.</hi> there treats on. And Chriſt did pay a <hi>Debt</hi> that was not his own, but ours, otherwiſe we had periſhed eternally: This is <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> contrary to <hi>W.Ps.</hi> Anti-chriſtian Notion, <hi>That Chriſt could not pay what was not his own.</hi> And I would deſire the <hi>Quakers</hi> to tell in their next print, What it was that Chriſt was to pay, or did pay, of his own, as <hi>W. P.</hi> there words it (ſeeing he denys that he paid any thing for us) and why they were ſo civil as not to ſay a word to that other agreeable paſſage which I quoted from <hi>R. Huberthorns</hi> works, pag. 20. where he affirms, <hi>Chriſt was capable of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> This they thought was eaſieſt anſwered by ſilence. But pray tell us, what had Chriſt to repent of, or what did Chriſt owe to God of his own? And whether theſe ſayings do not ſmell too rank of blaſphemy with good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> though by deceitful Arts you may hide it from your Followers:</p>
            <p>But tho' <hi>C. P.</hi> ſpends ſeveral pages to Banter me for adding this word [<hi>Debt</hi>] yet within 4 pages he himſelf is guilty of the ſame thing, <hi>viz.</hi> of adding words to a paſſage of <hi>W. Ps</hi> and that to alter the ſence too, as I ſhall ſhew next page hereafter.</p>

                  </gap> W. P's, No, neither Expreſly nor Implicity, nor ſo much as Conſequentially. Note,</hi> Theſe are his words; therefore I intreat the Reader to look back to page 10. where Finite Impotent Creature is expreſly and in pag. 10. line 25 he affirms the ſame implicitly and conſequentially, and in part expreſly too, in theſe words, <hi>Which JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST as Man, could never pay, he BEING FINITE. Note,</hi> here he implies that Chriſt was too weak, too Impotent to make infinite ſatisfaction, he being Finite; And a man that is Finite, is conſequentially a Creature. Now ſince it appears that <hi>W. P.</hi> does ſay it <hi>Implicitly</hi> and <hi>Conſequentially</hi> and [at leaſt] in part <hi>Expreſly too;</hi> and yet <hi>C. P.</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001248_0012_0FB18B636C27C5A0"/>
denys it to be ſaid any of theſe three ways, he ought therefore to make Publick ſatisfaction for this wretched Abuſe, this double falſhood, eſpecially ſeeing I have more then once in print offered to make this very Paſſage as the touch ſtone of Tryal between his writings and mine, that if 4 or 6 indifferent men Judge it to be as he ſays, I would burn my Books, or what elſe thoſe men ſhould aſſign me to do. But if they found it as I ſay, he ſhould do the like. This, I ſay, I have offered, but could never bring him to it. And yet is he ſo ſhameleſs, as ſtill to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſert the ſame thing againſt me, and call on me for ſatisfaction for abuſing <hi>W. Pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I come to pag. 66. where I find <hi>C. P.</hi> guilty of the ſame thing whereof he accuſeth me but juſt before, <hi>viz.</hi> he adds a word to that Paſſage of <hi>W. P.</hi> before quoted in <hi>Quaker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſm a New Nick,</hi> pag. 6. for he makes it run thus, <hi>Faith in the Hiſtory of Chriſts outward Manifeſtation</hi> [Chriſtianity] <hi>has been a deadly poiſon, &amp;c.</hi> The word [<hi>Chriſtianity</hi>] he adds, and ſays it ſhould be ſo by the Table of Errata, which made me look into that Table, but there is no ſuch direction there, as all may ſee, who have that book: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is falſhood and deceit, ſuch as his Friend <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſeems to be aſhamed to act; for I look upon <hi>G W.</hi> to have twice the wit of <hi>C P.</hi> for deceit, yet he in his Book, <hi>Truth and Innocency,</hi> pag. 54. vindicates this Paſſage of <hi>W. P.</hi> as it is, without adding the word [<hi>Chriſtanity</hi>] he was more honeſt then this <hi>Bomb-Searcher,</hi> for he found no need of it. But <hi>C. P.</hi> goes on till he alſo thruſts in the word [<hi>only</hi>] and now 'tis prety handſomly dreſt, and runs thus, <hi>Making faith</hi> [only] <hi>in the hiſtory of Chriſt</hi> [Chriſtanity] <hi>has been a deadly poiſon.</hi> And now, forſooth, <hi>W. P.</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> are fit company, and both of a mind. W. P. <hi>is not without good Company</hi> (ſays he) <hi>for he has</hi> Paul <hi>on his ſide.</hi> And to prove that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays the ſame with <hi>W. P.</hi> he quotes <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 8. and 8.13. Your faith hath been ſpoken of throughout the world; If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye; but if ye mortify the deeds of the body by the Spirit, ye ſhall live. Behold! are not his Wits got again into his Mill-Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? for are theſe words of St.<hi>Paul</hi> any thing like that doctrine of <hi>W P?</hi> O miſerable ſhift! to defend their vile ſtuff, rather then confeſs and repent!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> he calls on me for ſatisfaction, becauſe the word [<hi>Debt</hi>] was added, as aforeſaid, though between Crotchets, only to make the paſſage more intelligible to mean readers. But let him give ſatisfaction for adding thoſe words on purpoſe to alter <hi>W. P</hi>'s ſence, tho' he has miſt of his purpoſe; for let him take it as he has mended it, yet the making faith [<hi>only</hi>] in the hiſtory of Chriſt [<hi>Chriſtanity</hi>] cannot be a deadly poiſon; I am ſure no true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> dare ſay it.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>Bomb-Searcher</hi> is Jack on both ſides, for as here he adds words, ſo I find (in pag. 8. of the laſt part of his book) he takes words out of a paſſage of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> where G. F. ſays, <hi>He that hath the ſame Spirit that raiſed Jeſus from the dead, is equal with God.</hi> Now Friend <hi>Caleb</hi> is for leaving out the words [<hi>he that hath</hi>] ſo then it runs thus, <hi>The ſame ſpirit that raiſed Jeſus, is equal
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001248_0013_0FB18B64C4274738"/>
with God,</hi> which is all one as to ſay, God is equal to God. This he makes to the ſize of <hi>G. F's</hi> Divinity, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach the Chriſtan World, that God was equal to God.</p>
            <p>Well, ſeeing <hi>C. P.</hi> has ſo good a hand at mincing and mending blaſphemy, there is juſt ſuch another piece of work for him to mend of the ſame <hi>G. F</hi>'s 'tis in the laſt quotation. page 4. upon that Text, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father is. And</hi> [ſays <hi>Fox</hi>] <hi>as he is, ſo are WE, and that which is perfect as he is perfect, is in Equality,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis but taking off the firſt ſix words [<hi>as he is, ſo are we</hi>] and then it will run thus [That which is perfect as he is, is in Equality,] <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo 'tis as cleaverly mended as that before, and is juſt as good ſenſe. Or if he be diſpoſed to make his Reader merry by mending it any other way, we will not only hear him, but alſo help him to more ſuch Jobs of work, which by that time he has finiſhed, we hope to ſee the <hi>Quakers</hi> proud imagination of a ſinleſs perfection and Equality with God to tumble down a pace</p>
            <p>In pag 72. I find he is ſtill waſhing the Blackemore white, <hi>viz</hi> he would clear the <hi>Quakers</hi> from that vile Contempt of the holy Bible, in a Paſſage brought againſt it by <hi>Joſ. Coal, viz.</hi> 
               <q>How deplorable a thing is it (ſays he) to ſee ſuch hypocritical intruders (<hi>viz.</hi> Proteſtant Miniſters) ſtand in a Pulpet with ſuch a brazen faced Book as is their unjuſt corrupt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Bible in their hands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> here <hi>J. C.</hi> in the firſt place (and then the other <hi>Quakers</hi> who again reprinted it ſince <hi>J C's</hi> death) joyns with the moſt prophane Papiſt thus to blaſpheme our Bible. For in page 40. <hi>Coal</hi> declares poſitive, That it does not concern him to anſwer it. No, he brings it as an Arrow from the Papiſts Quiver, and ſhoots it at the Bible, and then leaves it to the Proteſtants to think what they pleaſe of it. And yet they would ſeem now to be aſhamed of it, but will not blame their Prophet <hi>J. C.</hi> and the other <hi>Quakers</hi> for ſeveral times Printing it againſt our Miniſters and the Bible, which ſtill ſhews they only deſign to deceive.</p>
            <p>I Now come to the laſt part of his Book, being his Reply to the <hi>Myſtery of Fox-Craft,</hi> and find in page 6. that he ſays, <hi>G. Fox</hi> did not aſſume to himſelf the compiling of that Book called, <hi>The Battledoor</hi> of the interpretation of about thirty Languages, but that it was <hi>J. Stubs</hi> and <hi>B. Furley</hi> that put <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Name to the ſeveral pages of that Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> this ſtill confirms &amp; diſcovers it to be a Cheat put upon the World; for elſe why ſhould another man put his Name to what he is not the Author of, nor does not underſtand? Thus it comes out by little and little; for it being found out that <hi>Fox</hi> had not the gift of Tongues, as the poor <hi>Quakers</hi> to my certain knowledge (I for one) were made to believe; he is therefore forced to this half confeſſion, that tho' <hi>Fox</hi> did it not, yet that it was done however by the Quakers, <hi>i. e. Stubs</hi> and <hi>Furley.</hi> But this is alſo a cheat or lye, for they hired a <hi>Jew</hi> to do the greateſt part of it, or procure it to be done, and gave him eighty Pounds in Money for his pains, and there was alſo
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001248_0014_0FB18B66336AEB08"/>
twelve bottles of Wine given over and above to make the <hi>Jew</hi> and his aſſociates drink. And here the <hi>Fox</hi> is found out in his ſilly craft in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Wiſdom and Learning of the world, and yet deceitfully made uſe of it to raiſe his own fame.</p>
            <p>In page 14. he finds a real fault in my Book the date of the year of the diſpute of <hi>G. F</hi> is printed 1699 inſtead of 1659. ſo in my this years Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack <hi>John Benn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <q>In the ſame page he brings on the Oath of Abjuration, by which the <hi>Quakers</hi> of the Council and Aſſembly of <hi>New-Jerſey</hi> engaged to Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi> to defend the Queen and her Succeſſors to the utmoſt of their power againſt all their Enemies, and that as <hi>defend</hi> is commonly underſtood too; and yet, at the ſame time declared they could neither fight nor pay towards it, <hi>i. e.</hi> neither do it in P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rſon nor Eſtate.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now I deſired him to tell me how the <hi>Quakers</hi> could do this, and promiſed him a reward if he could tell me; But I find it has driven him into a Net. He ſays, page 15. he is no way obliged to tell me how. No, he is not obliged; Why? becauſe he nor all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in the world have not art enough to do it. And thus they are confounded, being ſelf condemned.</p>
            <p>And whereas I had ſhewed how binding and poſitive the Act of Abjuration was made, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> had made a Proviſo to make it all void, therefore he argues that they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) do in that no more then is common for Kings and Parliments, to do [No, they have done no more] For he ſays, Kings, Paliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often in their Laws, after poſitive commandings, make perticular Proviſo's for mitigating, <hi>&amp;c. Note,</hi> Here they muſt ſet themſelves up tantamount with Kings and Parliaments, and becauſe the Queen and Parliament had made no Proviſo in that Law, therefore the <hi>Quakers</hi> may do it. Why? becauſe 'tis common for Kings, &amp;c. to do it. This ſhews the height of the ſphere wherein theſe Saints imagine themſelves to move, even to be Controulers of the Laws of Kings and Parliaments, at leaſt here they wou'd be, and this they have declared to be their Right and Heirſhip, as I have elſe where ſhewed.</p>
            <p>His inſinuating, That I have broke my Oath, as a Councillor, in publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and that the Governour is concern'd to take notice of me. That is, my printing how the <hi>Quakers</hi> had taken this Abjuration Oath, which was done in the face of Country and Coffee-Houſe News the ſame week, he would have to be a breaking my Oath as a Councillor. This only bewrayes the perſecuting ſpirit; it will ſhew its grining Teeth ſometimes. I pray God keep them from having power to bite me as they did poor <hi>Banks,</hi> one of their Oppoſers, who they catcht carrying his goods on horſes through <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and caſt him into <hi>Philadelphia</hi> Priſon, and took his Goods from him, even his whole eſtate.</p>
            <p>Next, comes on their Reply to what I aſſerted, how ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> near <hi>Burlington</hi> took up arms on a report that a party of <hi>French</hi> were near. And they bring long certificates &amp; denying the matter, as if they were

            <p>In pag. 21. he begins to muſter up a troop of falſhoods againſt me, every one of which returns upon his own head.

the year is thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is his method throughout, as if he were poſſeſt with the Spirit of <hi>Baal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I had told him how he copyed after the <hi>London Quakers,</hi> in his anſwers to me; Therefore that he may make a Book of ſomething, he writes ſeveral pages to ſhew that I have alſo copyed after the Author of the <hi>Snake, G. K. &amp;c.</hi> Alas for him! have I not told him, that I cannot do better than to follow the example of good men. But for a <hi>Quaker</hi> to copy after other men is <hi>Conjuration,</hi> by their own doctrine; for <hi>G. F</hi> in <hi>Saul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Errand,</hi> pag. 7. ſays, <hi>What is not ſpoken from the mouth of God, is Conjuration.</hi> Therefore if he had no where copyed after others (as I would ſhew he has, if it would edify) yet he is ſtill as much a Conjurer, if all he has written be not immediately from the mouth of God; and that it is not, I have ſufficiently ſhewed, unleſs from the mouth of the God of lyes. And thus this Conjurer imploys his time to ſet up a man of ſtraw, that he may have ſomething to fight againſt</p>
            <p>In the Margent of the <hi>Miſtry of Fox-Craft,</hi> pag. 4 there is a touch of the uncleanneſs of their Preachers; therefore to be even with us, he tell me, pag. 21. that if it was their way, they could alſo calumniate ſome Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men among us for Miſcarriages (and then inſtances <hi>Rode-Iſland</hi> Miniſter) But thanks his God, that has taught them otherways. Behold, the deceipt, the confuſion of this; for here even with the ſame breath he throws a ſecret calumny on <hi>Rode-Iſland</hi> Miniſter, and yet ſays, 'tis not their way, their God has taught them otherways. This ſhews what ſort of a God it is that has taught them, even the God of lyes</p>
            <p>But by the way, let me tell theſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> That the Clergy and <hi>Quaker</hi>-Preachers are under different Circumſtances: The Clergy know themſelves (and ALL men) to be frail ſinners, often drawn by Temptations into ſin, and therefore find a continual need of praying to God for Pardon, upon Repentance. But this the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Preachers diſclaim, they are two proud. <hi>W. Penn</hi> mocks at our Liturgy for having a confeſſion of ſin in it. And you ſee before that <hi>G. F.</hi> calls it the doctrine of Devils to acknowledge a being in a warfare while we be on earth; Nay, he declares, That they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) are Perfect in Equality with God (as you ſee before) This is a deſperate and deplorable ſtate for poor mortals to be poſſeſt with: 'Tis the height of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifers Pride. Therefore 'tis upon this account, that we ſometimes expoſe their failings, to ſhew them their ſins; for there is no other way to humble them. But if they would come down upon the level with other mortals, to own themſelves ſinners, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8, 9. and pray for pardon; I ſhould then think it a great evil to expoſe the private failings of any of them.</p>
            <p>But as to his thanking God that has taught them otherways than to

            <head>Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>THe learned <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> whoſe Apology the <hi>Quakers</hi> have reviſed, amended and re-printed in great Numbers (and given of them to the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> about eight or ten Thouſand) as their Standard, inſtead of the Works of their FOX-Apoſtle, which I hear they have let fall, after they were upon the Stocks, as if they would (to ſave whole their Infallibility, ſilently ſlip by the groſſeſt of their Blaſphemy and Non-ſence, and ſhape it up in a more artificial Trim, as the Proverb ſays, <hi>Older and Wiſer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet, I muſt here let them know, that their learned <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Writings afford us ſufficient Proof of the Impoſſibility of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> to <hi>Christianity.</hi> The Author of the <hi>Snake, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 183, 185. of his ſecond, <hi>Defence,</hi> gives us a notable Inſtance about his confounding <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Sanctification,</hi> making them both to be one, and performed within men; whereas <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> makes them to be different things: <hi>Justification</hi> being wrought by Chriſt in his own Perſon, wholly without us, and but once performed; but <hi>Sanctification</hi> is the Work of Chriſt by his holy Spirit in our hearts, and daily to be renewed.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here give you another Inſtance from the ſaid <hi>R. B</hi>'s Works, and wou'd have the <hi>Quakers</hi> try their Wits to ſee if they can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>R. B.</hi> pag. 895. of his Works, affirms, <q>That the Hiſtorical Faith and Knowledge of Chriſt, is not commonly given to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or to be expected by them, or any others, by the Spirit, but by the Scriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in contradiction to this, p. 48. he affirms, <q>That the Spirit teaches every true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> whatſoever is needful for him to know. — By this Light of God [in the heart] all true knowledge in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things is revealed. <hi>Prop.</hi> X.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then back again, pag. 95, 96. he affirms, <q>That the Hiſtorical knowledge or outward profeſſion of Chriſt is abſolutly neceſſary to be believed, where God affords the Opportunity of knowing it; — Yea (ſays he) it were a damnable Unbelief not to believe it, when declared.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:001248_0019_0FB18B6F32876CC0"/>Now the firſt and laſt of theſe three Quotations, are <hi>Chriſtan,</hi> and the middlemoſt is <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which together runs thus;</p>
            <p>'Tis Damnable Unbelief not to believe the hiſtory of Chriſt, where it may be known.</p>
            <p>This hiſtorical belief is not given to men by the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>And yet, The ſpirit teaches all true knowledge, and whatever is needful.</p>
            <p>This needs no comment, I could ſhew ſeveral ſuch like Contradictions and Confuſion in <hi>R. B's</hi> endeavours to mix <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> with <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> juſt as Coyners of bad Money, mix it with ſome good Money, to make the bad paſs current unſuſpected.</p>
            <p>There is an inſtance in page 170 of his <hi>Apology,</hi> That ſhews his accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in Quaker-Pride. He there calls the Apoſtles of our Lord and Saviour by the name of <hi>outward Apoſtles:</hi> This is to intimate, that they (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) are inward Apoſtles, and they always prefer the inward above the outward; for as it ſufficed for the Apoſtles and Elders to fall down and worſhip before the Throne; ſo G. F. ſays, The <hi>Quakers</hi> are UPON the Throne (as in the Quotations before.) Thus while they Banter others for Pride in wearing Lace and Ribands, they themſelves are poſſeſt with the moſt abhorrent Pride of Lucifer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Behold a monſtrous claſh of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> between <hi>R. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> The one calls it a <hi>Damnable <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> not to believe the hiſtory of Chriſt, and the other calls it, <hi>A deadly Poiſon</hi> to believe it.</p>
            <p>But their Books are ſo full of ſuch confuſed ſtuff, it would be almoſt endleſs work to collect it. Therefore I and others who by the mercy of God have eſcaped out of this City of confuſion, <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> cannot forbear calling others after us; ſome have done it late, even at the point of death, as <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of Mr.<hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
