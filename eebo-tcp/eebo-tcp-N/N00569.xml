            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is likely that we have here found one of those Admirable <hi>Echo's</hi> which then passed between those Illustrious Personages: I pray, Let all of <hi>that age</hi> attend unto it.</p>
            <p>Our Text is a Demonstration of the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That the Word of God shows the way to our <hi>Happiness.</hi> 'Tis Demonstrated by this; That this Word Enjoyns and Effects our <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.</hi> And this is here proved, with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>a Fortiori</hi>;

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:000698_0007_0FA9A73F88B8C9C0"/>
People have <hi>much,</hi> yea, <hi>most</hi> of <hi>Sinfulness</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them. It is also supposed, That <hi>Young</hi> People should be sensible of their Defilement. It is further supposed, That the Defilement of <hi>Young</hi> People is Curable. But it is thereupon Enquired, What shall be done for the Redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our Disorders<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and which demands for yet more of your Observation, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably a <hi>Young</hi> man that here made this Enquiry</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have an <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Quest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</hi> That is, <hi>By Taking heed thereto according to thy VVord.</hi> In this <hi>Answer,</hi> we see, <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Medicine</hi> to be apply'd. That is, The <hi>VVord</hi> of God; whereby is meant, the <hi>Revelation</hi> which God has given of His Mind and Will unto us. We see, <hi>Next,</hi> the <hi>Manner</hi> of applying it. That is, <hi>By taking heed</hi>; which imports a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Labour of Soul to <hi>Conform</hi> unto what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our God has therein required of us.</p>
            <p>I confess, That I want a further <hi>Commentary</hi> upon this Text; but that is a <hi>Practical</hi> one; and I must come to YOU, my <hi>Young</hi> People, for it. It is to YOU, that I come this Day; and it is with this All concerning <hi>Doctrine</hi> that I come.</p>
            <p>It is the High <hi>Interest,</hi> and it should be the Great <hi>Study</hi> of YOUNG People, to <hi>TAKE HEED,</hi> that Their <hi>WAY</hi> may be <hi>Cleansed,</hi> according to Gods <hi>WORD.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000698_0008_0FA9A74485F89080"/>There are two <hi>Propositions</hi> which I must Entreat my <hi>Young</hi> Folks, to Consider in the Fear of God. Believe it, Sirs;</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <head>PROPOSITION I.</head>
               <p>There is a woful <hi>Uncleanness</hi> with which the <hi>VVay</hi> of <hi>All</hi> People, and especially of <hi>young</hi> People, too often is contaminated. Our <hi>way</hi> is the <hi>course</hi> of our Actions; the <hi>course</hi> of our Thoughts, our Words, our Deeds. That this <hi>VVay</hi> in <hi>young</hi> People, should be <hi>unclean,</hi> is not so great a matter of <hi>Wonder,</hi> as it is of <hi>Sorrow</hi>; for the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>young</hi> People is <hi>Unclean.</hi> The youngest of us all, have cause to say, as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.2, 5. <hi>Oh cleanse me from my sin, for I was shapen in Iniquity.</hi> But we may rather ask, what is that <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> which usually cleaves to our way? Now, to that I Reply shortly, SIN is that <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness!</hi> The most vile Thing in the World, is not so odious unto <hi>Us,</hi> as all SIN is unto our <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Of Purer Eyes than to behold that Evil.</hi> Those <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, which never mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd any thing, do still represent, every <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of His Law,</hi> as the vilest <hi>Filthiness.</hi> 'Tis possible, Young People, that when you do some <hi>Sinful</hi> Thing, they seem <hi>Comely</hi> or <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> things unto you; But I pray, Remember, They are all the most <hi>Filthy</hi> Things imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Rash <hi>Youths,</hi> you touch what is infinitely worse then the foulest <hi>Pitch,</hi> when you meddle with them. Now there is a double <hi>Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> whereto our <hi>Wayes</hi> are liable; there is the <hi>Sin</hi> of <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> and there is the <hi>Uncleanness</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First; Sometimes <hi>Uncleanness</hi> is taken in a stricter Sense, for the SIN OF UNCLEAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS; and there are few <hi>Young</hi> People so strict in their <hi>Wayes,</hi> as to be altogether free from that <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> The Luxuriant Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perances, which Violate the <hi>Seventh</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Decalogue, are distinguished by the Name of UNCLEANNESS, because of a singular <hi>Loathsomness</hi> in those Enormities. But it is a rare thing for Young People duely to <hi>Loath</hi> all those Impieties: Oh! how rare a thing is it for Young People, <hi>truly</hi> to say after the Blessed <hi>Ezekiel, Ah Lord<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> My Soul ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The King of <hi>Israel</hi> saw once a wretched person Ensna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Ruines of <hi>Uncleanness</hi>; but whom

did he see? VVe are told in Prov. 7.7. <hi>I discerned among the Youths, a Young Man void of Understanding. Young</hi> People, have in them the most of <hi>Tinder</hi> for the Temptations of the <hi>Unclean Spirit</hi>; and oftentimes that <hi>Spirit</hi> is hideously and hellishly inflaming of them. Hence 'tis, that if Young People are kept from <hi>Further Pollutions,</hi> yet they frequently plunge themselves into most horrible <hi>Self-pollutions</hi>; 'tis by <hi>them,</hi> that these woful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Onan</hi> do Sacrifice the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lood of their Souls unto <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> unto <hi>Priapus,</hi> unto the Devil. Famous is the Story of the Young <hi>Nicaetas,</hi> who, being sollicited unto the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of his <hi>Chastity,</hi> with Circumstances, which he feared he should not otherwis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how seldom does the Resolution of <hi>Young</hi> People, against all <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> prove so obstinate? how sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom do they Look upon every Glance of <hi>Uncleanness,</hi> with Resentments like those of <hi>Joseph, How shall I do thts VVickedness, and Sin against God!</hi> But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Sometimes <hi>Uncleanness</hi> is taken in a larger sense, for the UNCLEANNESS OF SIN; and in that sense also the <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Young</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:000698_0011_0FA9A74874E703B8"/>
people are liable to very much <hi>Uncleanness.</hi> There is an <hi>Uncleanness</hi> in all Iniquity; <hi>Original Sin</hi> is a deadly <hi>Leprosy,</hi> and all the out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it are but so many <hi>Putrifying Sores.</hi> Now <hi>Young</hi> people, may upon this very account with peculiar Lamentations, lay their Hands upon their Lips, and cry out, <hi>Unclean!

               <p>For Answer; <hi>Young People,</hi> 'Tis the MEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DING of your <hi>Way,</hi> that is to be the <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of your <hi>Way.</hi> The <hi>Purification</hi> of your Way, is to be by the <hi>Reformation</hi> of what is amiss in your way. The <hi>Cleansing</hi> of your way, has those two things belonging thereunto; in 2 Cor. 7.1. First, <hi>Let us cleanse our selves from all Filthiness of Flesh and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>; and Secondly, <hi>Let us perfect Holiness in the Fear of God.</hi> The Way of Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is <hi>Cleansed,</hi> Firstly, When they <hi>Repent</hi> what is <hi>Ill.</hi> It is prescribed, in Prov. 28.13 <hi>He that Confesseth and Forsaketh shall find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> When you do with a bitter Sorrow of Soul, Acknowledge and Abandon all that is amiss in your Wayes, you then have that <hi>Mercy</hi> of <hi>Cleansed Wayes.</hi> But the Way of Young People is further <hi>Cleansed,</hi> when they <hi>Practise</hi> what is <hi>Good.</hi> It is Expressed, in <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. <hi>I Exercise my self to have always a Conscience void of Offence towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man.</hi> We have <hi>Cleansed Wayes,</hi> when we are <hi>Conscientious</hi> in all our Wayes; and when we have nothing <hi>Offensive,</hi> nothing Provoking, nothing Injurious in them. In short, Young People are to <hi>Forsake</hi> that Way, which the Preacher calls, <hi>The way of

their own Heart</hi>; and they are to <hi>Follow</hi> that way which the Prophet calls, <hi>The good way, Leading unto Rest.</hi> It is by doing so, that our <hi>way,</hi> is <hi>cleansed</hi> before the Lord. But now,</p>

               </p>
               <p>For Answer; <hi>Many ways.</hi> But, <hi>Thus</hi> especially.</p>
               <p>First, The <hi>Word</hi> of God, is the GLASS, which gives Young People, to see the <hi>Uncleanness</hi> of their Wayes. It is said, in <hi>James</hi> 1.23. <hi>The Hearer of the Word, is like to a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his Natural Face in a Glass.</hi> Young People do often visit the <hi>Glass</hi>; but, Look here, is a most Impartial and most Heavenly <hi>Glass</hi> for you; This <hi>Book</hi> is that <hi>Glass.</hi> If you will fairly set your selves before the <hi>Commandments</hi> in this Book; and Examine your selves upon every one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or, <hi>How far have I Committed what is in this Law forbidden?</hi> You'l then see the manifold <hi>Uncleanness</hi> of your Wayes, in order to the Removal of that <hi>Uncleanness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The <hi>Word</hi> of God is the RULE, which tells Young People, how to get off the <hi>Uncleanness</hi> of their Wayes. This is the <hi>Rule</hi> of proceeding, in that Business, in <hi>Isai.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Wash ye, Make you clean, put away the

Alas, my Young Folks will not present themselves unto the Lord, until they become as <hi>Blind</hi> and as <hi>Lame,</hi> as those <hi>Jebusite Idols,</hi> which were <hi>Hated by the Soul of the David.</hi> But Let me debate this Point a little with you. You will be <hi>Religious,</hi> when <hi>Old Age</hi> comes to tread Hard upon you. Will you so? That is, you will do no <hi>Good things</hi> till you come to your <hi>Evil Dayes</hi>! You will never <hi>Look</hi> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, until your <hi>Eyes</hi> cannot see without Glasses! You will never <hi>Hear</hi> the Voice of God, until your <hi>Ears</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as Deaf as a Beetle!

And Why Then? That is, When Legions

of <hi>Devils</hi> Commissioned by a Neglected and Offended God are about you, throwing the <hi>Chains</hi> of Eternal Darkness, over you, you'l then think of escaping from them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> You will then first fall to <hi>Serving of God,</hi> which cannot be done without <hi>Fervour of Spirit,</hi> when all the <hi>Spirits</hi> you have left you will not be enough to Grapple with the pains of your <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies!

But I'l suppose, that God may Allow you such a long <hi>Space to Repent</hi> as you allot upon. I am nevertheless to tell you, That a <hi>Late</hi> Repentance, is very seldom a <hi>True</hi> Repentance. We have a Daily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of this, in those Multitudes of Wretches, who while they lye, as they think, a <hi>Dying,</hi> do bitterly bewail all their <hi>Divellism,</hi> and yet recovering, they play the <hi>Devil,</hi> as much as ever they did before! We have the Report of such a Repentance, in those Terms, Psal. 78.34.36. <hi>When He slew them, then they sought Him; and they returned and Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Early after God. Nevertheless they did Flatter Him with their Mouth, and they Lyed unto him,

And yet I must freely say it, Of those pretended Penitents, that have been Reprieved and Pardoned, I can't Remember <hi>Two,</hi> but what have afterwards Proved Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of Wickedness. Thus <hi>Deceitful</hi> uses to be that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which counts it <hi>Early</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be <hi>Seeking</hi> of God, when men find the Almighty God <hi>slaying</hi> of them! Yea, But I have another Check for your Young People's Dilatory Phrenzy; and that is <hi>this.</hi> How do you know, <hi>Young People,</hi> but that an <hi>Early</hi> and a <hi>Sudden</hi> Death, may overtake you! We Read of some, in Job 36.14. <hi>They dy in Youth.</hi> Pray, mind, the next time you step into the Burying-<hi>Place,</hi> whether you can see no <hi>Graves</hi> there, that are shorter than yourselves?

I advise you, to observe the scope of <hi>Satan</hi> in this Temptation; which is to Rob God of the Glory of His <hi>Grace.</hi> Wherefore Do not <hi>Conceal</hi> it; neither do you <hi>Reason</hi> with the Divel about it. When these thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, tho' you are to be <hi>Humbled,</hi> and pray for pardon; yet you are not to be <hi>Dejected.</hi> But labour to <hi>Cross</hi> them with <hi>good thoughts,</hi> just contrary to them. Make Conscience of the Duties which God requires in order to your <hi>Victory</hi>; patiently submit unto the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting Hand of God; but be Thankful it is

no worse; and be willing to stay <hi>Gods Time</hi> for Deliverance.

                           <p>Shall I allow of any <hi>One sin,</hi> seeing that the <hi>Least sin</hi> allow'd, will prove my Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Damnation? <hi>Far be it!</hi> Either I must be the Death of <hi>sin,</hi> or <hi>sin</hi> will be my Death, to Eternity.</p>

                           <p>Happy are the Children of the Servants of God; who meet with a <hi>Blessing</hi> from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Good <hi>Man</hi> they meet! For my Fathers Sake, I have had many a <hi>Blessing</hi>; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instructions and Directions, from men of Great Worth. But that which most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially took place with me, was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Mr. â€” Who asking my <hi>Age,</hi> I told him, <hi>It was Twelve Years</hi>; and he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon said, The Example of <hi>Josiah,</hi> would intimate, that it was <hi>High Time,</hi> and that God Expected it at Least Four Years ago, that I should set my self to <hi>Pray</hi> unto Him, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my self, by the <hi>Vowes</hi> of my Soul to Seek and Serve Him. He brought many <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples</hi> to quicken me, and <hi>Scriptures</hi> to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage me, and Laid the matter before me in a solemn manner. I now began to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my self what a miserable Wretch I was, who had never <hi>Pray'd</hi> but Three or Four Times in my Life: and now I did not know how to go about it. But being also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sabbath Day at Night, after Repetition, pressed unto the same Duty by my Cousin <hi>Avery,</hi> with whom I dwelt: for it was his Custome, at those times, to warn all his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with Renewed Arguments, unto their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, pleading that if we hearkened not, his
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:000698_0088_0FA9ABA309E101C8"/>
                              <hi>Warning</hi> would be a <hi>Witness</hi> against us,; and he told us, that if we knew not how to Pray, we should Go to God, and He would help us; all this wrought upon me, so that I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to beg the Help of God: which doing, I quickly found my self able, not only to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my <hi>Desires</hi> unto Him, but to Maintain such a pleasant <hi>Communion</hi> with Him, that nothing could prevent my Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening <hi>Prayers</hi>; and in time, my Delight in it was such, that I Excited <hi>Others</hi> unto the Like; and I perswaded <hi>one other</hi> to Joyn with me, and tast the sweetness of it; and seeing, <hi>he</hi> was so easily drawn from his <hi>Play</hi> to that Duty, I was yet the more Encouraged to continue, and plead with God, His Promise of answering, <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> that <hi>Gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Name.</hi> But in Time, being mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by our <hi>Play-mates,</hi> we were watched and discovered; and so being often interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we found out <hi>New-places</hi>; but at last, we could come together, but once a Day; and that in the <hi>Evening.</hi> I found then, that God did many times assist me greatly, in my secret Duties; and it was sweet unto me, to Go to God: for many times, in my <hi>Evening-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> I thought it hard to break off; I thought I could Pray all night, <hi>Without Ceasing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But after this, yielding to the Temptations of the <hi>Devil,</hi> I grew Dull, and Listless, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:000698_0089_0FA9ABA4C8F19CA0"/>
could scarce shed a <hi>Tear</hi> in the Duty, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, but as a <hi>Task</hi> or <hi>Stint</hi>; and still growing more and more Slothful, at last God visited me by <hi>Sickness,</hi> and brought me <hi>Low,</hi> and made me a little more careful for a Time: but I returned unto my former Sins again, and my Prayers were very Rare and Cold. God had withdrawn His Assisting and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing <hi>Spirit</hi> from me; and <hi>Satan</hi> came, and found me, not as our Saviour, in Joh. 14.30. without <hi>Matter</hi> for his <hi>Temptations</hi> to fasten on; but rather as in Mat. 12.44. <hi>Empty, Swept, and Garnished</hi>; tho' <hi>full</hi> of vain Thoughts; ready to Entertain him. My <hi>Goodness</hi> was as the <hi>Morning Cloud</hi> and the <hi>Early Dew,</hi> soon <hi>passing away</hi>; and as in Job 17.11. <hi>My Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were broken off, even the Thoughts of my Heart.</hi> I had had Good Intents, and Designs, made <hi>Vowes</hi> to Serve God; but then I was, as in Rev. 2.4. <hi>Fallen from my First Love.</hi> I was sometimes indeed something Awakened by a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and would just at such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, Seek God; but for the most part, the <hi>Word</hi> of God was with me, <hi>As the Seed Sown by the Highway-side.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>At last, my <hi>Father</hi>; being visited with Sickness, and thinking himself, not likely to live, he called his Family together, and told us; That he was not like to continue long among us; and therefore he was willing to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:000698_0090_0FA9ABA5EAD9C5B8"/>
give us <hi>Counsil,</hi> How to walk, when he should be gone from us. He Exhorted us, to <hi>Peace</hi> with, and <hi>Love</hi> to one another; He told us, <hi>There were evil times a coming, from which he should be taken away, tho' we should Live to see them:</hi> He therefore advised us, to go unto God, and Plead our <hi>Covenant,</hi> citing that place in Act. 2.39. <hi>for the Promise is to you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call</hi>; and that in Heb 3.12. <hi>Take Heed, Lest there be in any of you an Evil Heart of Unbelief in De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parting from the Living God</hi>: and many other Scriptures, with much other Counsel; stirring us up to the Duty of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and promising his <hi>Prayer</hi> for us, as long as he had any Breath; which in part he performed by then praying with us. Three Weeks after this; namely, on <hi>April</hi> 21. 1687. We were Called Early in the Morning, to see our Dear Father going out of the World; who now again told us, That <hi>He was going from the Evil Dayes that were a coming,</hi> and still warned us to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, not to Forget the Wayes of God. So he continued Speaking, doubtless Praying for <hi>Us,</hi> Longer than we could understand; and so <hi>He Dyed.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>This</hi> was very grievous to me: Now my chief <hi>Soul Friend</hi> in this World was gone: I thought my only way was to Go to God, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:000698_0091_0FA9ABA680982D08"/>
Enquire the Cause of this Affliction; for I feared lest it might be in a way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against <hi>me,</hi> for my not hearkening to the Word from <hi>Him</hi>: and sad Conclusions I was ready to draw concerning my self. I was now <hi>Young,</hi> (not much exceeding <hi>Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years</hi>) and my Counseller, and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher, and he who used to Breathe out his Soul before God, with such fervour for me, was gone; which proved most unhappy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for <hi>me</hi>! For my subtile Adversary the Devil, knowing my Corrupt Nature, suited it with such <hi>Temptations,</hi> as were most Likely to take place. I not only Left off <hi>Constancy</hi> in my Duties, but Readily Entertained <hi>Idle Discourse,</hi> yea, I was too often an <hi>Abetter</hi> thereof; putting the <hi>Evil Day</hi> far away, and depending on a <hi>Too Morrow,</hi> for to do my Soul work in; and giving my self too much up unto the Pleasures of this World.</p>
                           <p>But in Time, calling to mind a Sermon, which was Preached by Mr. <hi>Brown,</hi> from that place, <hi>Boast not of a To Morrow; I</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, it was Dangerous to <hi>Delay</hi>; for Gods Pleasure was, I saw, to Remove <hi>Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> as well as <hi>Elder</hi> Ones. But I feared that God had now indeed withdrawn Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from me, and said concerning me, as in Isa. 5.5. <hi>Why should you be stricken any more? Ye will Revolt more and more.</hi> So I begg'd
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:000698_0092_0FA9ABA73392FCD8"/>
of God, either to <hi>Draw</hi> me by his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or <hi>Drive</hi> me by Afflictions. I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so stirred up, by many Sermons of Mr. <hi>Danforths,</hi> to seek unto God, in my <hi>Youth,</hi> and give Him the <hi>Flower</hi> of my Age. And I Joyned my self to some <hi>Young men,</hi> who met at my House, every Sabbath-Evening, to Pray one with and for another. I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times made many <hi>Vowes</hi> of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Obedience, but still I forgat them, and neglected to Watch my Wayes. At last, God by Providences Diminished my Outward Estate, and Refused to Bless the World unto me. And in <hi>February,</hi> 1690. I was visited by Lameness, and forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to break up House keeping; whence all I had, came to Decay. Now! saw I had done wickedly; for which the Lord had (<hi>I</hi> fear'd) turn'd His Face against me, even for that <hi>I</hi> had not kept close to Him; as, <hi>The Face of the Lord is against them that do Evil.</hi> But yet notwithstanding, it was almost a Twelve month, before <hi>I</hi> had the Sense which I ought to have, of my Afflictions, and the Causes of them. And now, God has helped me to Consider, what should be the Sins, for which He did now Afflict me. I feared, Gods withdrawing of Himself, was not <hi>Probational,</hi> as it was to <hi>Job</hi>: but <hi>Paenal,</hi> for my Spiritual Sloth, as with the <hi>Spouse,</hi>
                              <pb n="92" facs="unknown:000698_0093_0FA9ABA7FA117698"/>
who in Cant. 5.2. was called to Open unto her <hi>Love,</hi> which she deny'd; and then she sought Him, but <hi>He was Gone</hi>; and when she called Him, He would not answer. This I feared to be my Misery; because I had neglected to hearken to the Motions of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> contrary to Gods Command, in 1 Thes. 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> I have also Committed some Sins, for which the Spirit checked me; and I have hearkened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Satanical Delusions, rather than the Spirits Motions. Thus I hearkened unto my <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and Left my <hi>Friend</hi>; and so Grieved the <hi>Spirit,</hi> contrary to that Command, in Eph. 4.30. and this I did with Reiterated Acts, vntil I did like them, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.14. <hi>They Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled and Vexed the Spirit.</hi> All these things I knew, were contrary to what I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in: Therefore sometimes I was start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with that place, in Heb. 10.26. <hi>If they Sin wilfully, after they have Received the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, there remains no more Sacrifice for Sin.</hi> But I Read that in Mr. <hi>Loves</hi> Works that satisfied me,; I was not fallen into the <hi>Unpardonable Sin.</hi> I hoped, I could say with <hi>Paul, That I hated what I did.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But yet my Comforts Ebbing and Flowing, these places came to my sight, 1 Pet. 3.12 Rev. 21.8. 2 Tim. 2:12. 1 Cor. 6.22. John 8.34. John 3.18. Some of which, for a time
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000698_0094_0FA9ABA8B6F25478"/>
Discouraged me, others Excited me to Duty: But I found in me, an unaptness to it.</p>
                           <p>I was yet Afflicted. But Reading Mr. <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> Works, I was advised, to view and plead the <hi>Promises</hi> of God. Whereupon I Studied so to do; and comforted my self with Heb. 12.8. <hi>If ye be without Chastening, then are ye Bastards and not Sons</hi>; and with the 6th and 7th Verses of that Chapter; and many other places, according to the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I was under. But I was afraid Lest I should deceive my self into Hell; wherefore I begg'd of God, that He would meet me in this <hi>Furnace</hi> of Affliction; and Purge me from my Dross, and shew me the Cause of his Controversy, and help me to cast away all Sin, and guide me rightly to Apply His Promises.</p>
                           <p>Soon after this, I was put in mind of my Duty, of <hi>Joining to the Church.</hi> I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>â€¢</desc>
                              </gap>een minded of it before; but now I was tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced, that it was my Duty. So, after I had made Search into, <hi>The Order of Churches,</hi> I sought unto God, that He would make way for my being of <hi>One:</hi> which he did; and soon after that, I came to <hi>Braintree,</hi> putting my self into the Doctors Hands.</p>
                           <p>After <hi>I</hi> had been <hi>Lame,</hi> something more than two Years, I was Confined unto my
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:000698_0095_0FA9ABA9DC195C00"/>
Chamber, by a <hi>Consumption</hi>; and People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to speak unto me, of Death. It seemed comfortable unto me, to hear of <hi>Death,</hi> for I had been for a long time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively desirous of it; because my heart was so ready to be drawn into sin; and because of the great Danger, my soul was in thereby. But I began again, to enquire of my self, <hi>Why it was, that I was not now afraid of death</hi>? When it was a Terror to so many Good men. I continually examined my Heart, and begg'd of God that I might not be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                           <p>After this, a good Old Father, being at Prayer for me, pray'd that I might be <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> and made Serviceable unto God. I then thought, I had not done well to desire <hi>Death</hi>; for sure, it was the Duty of One, who had had an Heart so sinful above all other Hearts, earnestly to Desire <hi>Life,</hi> that they might be as Extraordinary in the Service of God. I was then <hi>Willing to Live,</hi> and I considered, that God could Keep me from the Power of all my Spiritual Adversaries.</p>
                           <p>But my Distemper growing, there was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Hope of my Life. I then began to be constant in seeking, whether my Courage was well grounded; and once studying on this thing, I looked about, and saw a <hi>Bible</hi> at my Elbow. I opened it, and Lit upon
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:000698_0096_0FA9ABABD46BD438"/>
Rom. 5 3, 4, 5. and I thought, I could say, I had Experienced it. After this, many other Comfortable <hi>Evidences</hi> came to my mind; as, The Certainty that there was a Change in me from what I had been; my <hi>Love to the Brethren,</hi> so that if I had only heard of a man Eminently Good, I had immediately a Love to him, tho' I never saw him. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence, and all that my weak Hand is now able to Write, is, I am sure <hi>Sin</hi> is a <hi>Burden</hi> to me, and God has promised <hi>Rest</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such, if they come unto Him.</p>
                           <p>It is uncertain, How Long I may Ly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing by this Illness: therefore I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Write something to Comfort me, by Looking on it. The Lord Write the rest in my Heart!</p>

Sickness presently carried them off. But before their Going out, they Wrote some Affectionate <hi>Addresses,</hi> unto the Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their Acquaintance, of which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, there are some fallen into my Hands. From only <hi>Two</hi> of these, I shall now Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe only a <hi>few</hi> Passages, which I hope will be considered, not only by the Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of those Towns, whereto these belonged, but also, by the rest of our Generation.</p>
               <p>The first of these hopeful Young men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed unto the Town of <hi>Weymouth</hi>; and his Name was <hi>Nash.</hi> He Left behind him, in the Hands of his Young Friends, a Large Paper, of <hi>Admonitions,</hi> wherein One might perceive what Impressions had been made upon his Young Soul, by the Ministry of that Able, Faithful, Painful, and Excellent Person, who is at this Time, the <hi>Burning and Shining Light,</hi> in that Plantation. Out of that Paper, I have Transcribed the following passages.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>In the first place, I do acknowledge my self to be unworthy, even to take the Name of the Great and Blessed God, into my mouth; and much more to do any Service for Him. Yet <hi>I</hi> know, it is my Duty to do what Good I can, in such an Extraordinary Time as this is.</p>
                  <p>We have been going away from the Lord our God; which doth plainly appear by His
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:000698_0098_0FA9ABAF1C08AA90"/>
Dispensations towards us. Would the Great and Blessed God, have sent His <hi>Judgments</hi> down upon our Heads, thus one time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, if we had not provoked Him by our Sins in Departing from Him.? Hag. 1.5. <hi>Now therefore, thus saith the Lord of Hosts, Consider your Wayes.</hi> But God hath also been calling of us to Turn, by the Voice of His Servants in the Ministry. Oh the many solemn Warnings, we have had in Time past, by the Servants of Christ, especially upon <hi>Election Dayes,</hi> whereby we have been called upon to Repent and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and have been told wherein we should Reform!</p>
                  <p>Now, notwithstanding all that God hath hath done in a way of Judgment, yea, and is yet doing, we have cause to hope, that God is saying, to <hi>New-England,</hi> as to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> of Old, <hi>How shall I give Thee up?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If now we compare Gods <hi>Works</hi> with his <hi>Word,</hi> we shall certainly find, that we have <hi>Something to do,</hi> and that God is calling for some <hi>extraordinary thing</hi> from us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we should every one as we are able, be putting forward, and Labouring in this Great Work of REFORMATION.</p>
                  <p>Let us Look into the Word of God, and enquire there; and consider, <hi>Firstly</hi> whether
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:000698_0099_0FA9A71628468818"/>
there be not a Breach of <hi>Covenant,</hi> between us, and Our God; and that by a great neglect of Duty, in <hi>Parents</hi> towards their <hi>Children,</hi> in their not labouring to Train them up for God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We may Consider, Whether we have not provoked our Lord Jesus Christ exceedingly to Anger against us, by our <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteousness</hi> and <hi>Worldliness,</hi> which is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> We seem to be Laying out the greatest part, if not all our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> in and about the Things of this Life; and so we have been <hi>Exchanging our God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We may also Consider, Whether we have not provoked our Lord Jesus Christ exceedingly to Anger against us, by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Carriages one towards another; by giving one another just occasions of <hi>Offence.</hi> And for <hi>Church-Members,</hi> that have given themselves up unto the Lord Jesus Christ, to Walk with Him; their Scandalous Lives cause a Reproach to be cast upon Christ, His Church, and the Christian Religion. Also instead of <hi>Provoking one another to Love and Good Works,</hi> we have been provoking one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to Evil, and to Sin; and instead of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> one another, as we are Commanded, there is <hi>Hating</hi> one another, and <hi>Envyings,</hi> and <hi>Backbitings,</hi> all which are directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Command of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="unknown:000698_0100_0FA9A716ED7FB098"/>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We may also Consider, Whether we have not provoked the Lord to Anger, by the neglect of so great and profitable a Duty as, <hi>Secret Prayer.</hi> It is a Duty, whereby we may freely and fully pour out our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to God, which we cannot so freely do before others; and it is a Duty, that Christ has Commanded us to perform, in Math. 6.6. and Eph. 6.18. but it is to be feared, that <hi>many,</hi> if not <hi>the most</hi> of Visible <hi>Church Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> do neglect it, or at Least, are not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in it. But I wonder, (saith Mr. <hi>Increase Mather,</hi> in his Sermon) <hi>how such Men and Women can think, that they belong to God, or that they have a Real Interest in Heaven, who can find in their Hearts to Live without Secret Prayer</hi>!</p>
                  <p>Yet Again, We may Consider farther, for our Humiliation, Whether or no, we may not be some Hindrance to the Work of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> by our <hi>Bad Examples</hi>; for many do give <hi>Bad Examples</hi> upon several Accounts. If Children and Young Persons, do see Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Masters, <hi>Sleep</hi> at the Meeting, they'l think, they may do so too; and we are all generally too apt to follow <hi>Bad Examples.</hi> And, tho' our Fore-fathers had a Design to Labour the <hi>Conversion of the Heathen,</hi> yet how many be there now, who Teach them to Sin, and so are an Hindrance to the Work of Christ among them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="unknown:000698_0101_0FA9A717AAD78F50"/>
We may Consider, whether there has been any thorough <hi>Reformation,</hi> since there was a <hi>Synod-Book</hi> put forth, wherein God did no doubt declare the very Evils, whereby He was provoked.</p>
                  <p>Oh! That we may therefore Set to it, in Good Earnest, that we may <hi>Pour out our Souls</hi> before God, in secret places, that He may be pleased to <hi>Pour out His Spirit,</hi> and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace, upon <hi>New-England,</hi> and upon His Churches here, and upon the Rising Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
               </q>
               <p>The other of those Young Men, belonged unto the Town of <hi>Dorchester</hi>; and his Name was <hi>Wykes.</hi> A little before his Decease, he wrote a Paper full of Affectionate and Broken Hearted Expressions, wherein he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Young Folks of his Acquaintance, with Urgent Entreaties that they would mind such Lessons of <hi>Religion,</hi> as their Faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor had so often pressed upon them. The most of what he writ, I shall Omit, as more proper to be Confined unto the <hi>Manuscript</hi>; but I shall Transcribe some of the more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Passages,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Tho' I am now in the Dust, and am Numbred with the Dead; yet here is my mind, while I were Alive; and that is, That you would take Warning by me, and prepare for <hi>Death,</hi> while you have <hi>Time,</hi> while your <hi>Golden Season Lasts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:000698_0102_0FA9A7198E6C9C98"/>
We read in Rom. 13.11. <hi>Now 'tis High Time to Awake out of Sleep.</hi> Why should we Ly still, when Hell flames are kindling upon us? Why should we stay in this our Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we may be in the clear Sun-shine? and why will we Love Darkness rather than Light? Surely, 'Tis because <hi>Our Deeds are Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>How Delightful it is, unto Sinners, to do the <hi>Devils Drudgery</hi>! They will break whole Nights Sleep, but they will accomplish it; it is so delightful unto them, that they are never weary of it; it is a Race that is <hi>Down Hill,</hi> I think I may say, <hi>Down to Hell</hi>; they are in the way, and if they keep on, they will quickly be there; it may be, before they are aware of it.</p>
                  <p>I can safely say it, it is the mind of my Heart; I could freely give all the World<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nay, Ten Thousand Worlds, had I them; could I Recal the Time that I have mispent; those Rich Opportunities that I have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>The Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> are enough to Rend an Heart of Stone. The Thoughts of going out of the World, and beholding mans Face no more, are dismal indeed; to think to go down to the Pit of Silence, and into the Grave of Rest! Yet, these things are but a meer <hi>Shadow,</hi> to what shall be, when
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000698_0103_0FA9A71A84807F10"/>
God shall say, <hi>Depart from Me, Ye Cursed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Everlasting Fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have taken Pleasure in <hi>Merry Meetings,</hi> and <hi>Company Keeping</hi>; and now, I would, give all the World, that I could undo these things. Now I begin to see the miserable Estate that I am in; and I would give all the World that I could do any good unto <hi>You,</hi> that I could any ways Awaken you. For my part, I will Turn and Seek the Lord, and I would have <hi>you</hi> do the same. <hi>I</hi> will now return, and will not Walk in those Ways any Longer. If <hi>you</hi> continue in Sin, you shall Reap the Fruit of it, in the Pit of Hell, where Hot Fiery Coals will be your Bed, where Dismal Fire-brands shall be your Pillow, and Flames shall be your Coveri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A little while ago, I thought I heard a continual <hi>Voice,</hi> as it were, say, <hi>Come, ye Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Enter into my Kingdom, that I may Execute Vengeance on the Ungodly.</hi> God is now about to do these things; if nothing else do shew it, it would be plain enough, by this <hi>Sign; To see all the World in such a Confusion and Uproar.</hi> And you that dare put God off, till, <hi>To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> when you see <hi>These Things,</hi> do you think that when you have disposed of all your pure <hi>Grain,</hi> God will accept your <hi>Chaff</hi>?</p>

               <p>Sect. 1. LIttle more than Thirteen years Old, was JOHN CLAP of <hi>Scituate,</hi> when He Dy'd; but it might very Truly be said of him, <hi>That while he was yet Young, he began to seek after the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> From his very Infancy he discovered a Singular Delight in the Holy Scripture, whereby he was made <hi>Wise unto Salvation</hi>; and he also made him self yet further Amiable, by his <hi>Obedience</hi> to his Parents, and his <hi>Courtesy</hi> to all his Neighbours. As he grew up, he signalized his Concern for Eternity, not only by his diligent attendance upon both Publick and Private <hi>Catechising,</hi> but also by the like attendance on the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> of the Word, which he would Ponder and Apply, and confer about, with much Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul, and <hi>Pray</hi> for the Good effect thereof upon his own Soul.

ever after he began to speak Reasonably, he would both affectionately regard the <hi>Family-Prayers,</hi> and likewise, both Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, with a most unwearied constancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend himself by his own <hi>Prayers</hi> unto the Mercies of God.</p>
               <p>Sect. 2.

               <p>It was also Observed and Admired, that when he was abroad at the Publick Worship, in the time of his Weakness, he would <hi>stand</hi> the whole time of the Long exercises, and be so affectionately attentive, that one might see every Sentence uttered in those Exercises, make some impression upon him.

Being now asked, <hi>Whether the Thoughts of Dying Troubled him not</hi>? He replyed, <hi>No, Death is no Terror to me, because Christ has taken away my Sin, which is the Sting of Death.</hi> But being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Whether he was willing to Live?</hi> he answered, I <hi>am willing to submit unto the Will of God; but if God have appointed me to Life, I desire</hi> I <hi>may Live to His Glory.</hi> And being asked, Whether God had put out of Doubt, his Interest in a

But just before his Death, his Teeth were opened; when he would often say, <hi>Oh! how precious is the Blood of Christ, it is worth more than a Thousand Worlds</hi>! and often pray, <hi>Come, Lord Jesus, Come quickly</hi>! and at Last, he gave up himself to God, in those words, <hi>Lord Jesus Receive my Spirit.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his Mother to turn his <hi>Face unto the Wall</hi>; whereupon she said, <hi>John, Dost thou now Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> Hezekiah's <hi>Turning his Face unto the Wall?</hi> he said, <hi>Yes, I do Remember it:</hi> and as she Turned him in her Arms, he so quietly breathed his Soul into the Arms of his Blessed Saviour.</p>
