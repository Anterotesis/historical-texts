            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <q>
               <bibl>LUKE xv. from the 11th Verſe to the End.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, that <hi>it is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave poor Sinners.</hi> Our dear Redeemer had no other End in coming from Heaven to us, but to place poor Sinners in Heaven again: He led a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſecuted Life, and died an ignominious Death, for our Sake. As this was the End of his Coming, ſo it was the End of his Preaching: He was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſounding the glad Tydings of Salvation to poor convinced Sinners, giving all Encouragement from their Miſery, and at the ſame Time denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wrath againſt thoſe who truſted in themſelves that they were Righteous, and would not come out of themſelves, and lay hold on his Righteouſneſs. For this Purpoſe the bleſſed JESUS put forth many inſtructing Parables; no leſs than three in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of which the Words read are taken.</p>
            <p>Methinks of all the Parables that JESUS ever put forth, that which I have now choſen as the Subject of your preſent Meditation, if it be lawful to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ſpiritual Things with ſpiritual, excels other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables <hi>as one Star differs from another in Glory.</hi> I think it would be an Impeachment on your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſhould think I were acting contrary to Charity, eſpecially in your Country, where I hope you are better acquainted with your Bibles than ſome others are, than to think you need to be informed to what Parable the Text belongs: It belongs to that Soul-comforting,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005089_0003_1016A349BB469F20"/>
Soul-reviving Parable of the Prodigal Son, wherein the LORD JESUS CHRIST diſplays the Compaſſion of GOD to poor returning Sinners, in the moſt lively Colours. I pray GOD by his Holy SPIRIT, may write it upon the Table of all your Hearts.</p>
            <p>I intend, then, at this Time to make ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon the whole Parable, and then ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with an Exhortation to you all to come to the dear REDEEMER. And I pray GOD that Joy may be in Heaven this Afternoon over ſome of you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and coming home to GOD.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, To make ſome Remarks on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable itſelf. I begin at the 11th Verſe. <hi>And he ſaid,</hi> JESUS ſaid, <hi>A certain Man had two Sons.</hi> By <hi>two Sons</hi> you are here to underſtand two different Characters: The <hi>Publicans,</hi> who feeling their Miſery were willing to lay hold on CHRIST; and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing carping <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who truſting in themſelves that they were righteous, deſpiſed the Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, deſpiſed others, crying out with the ſelf-conceited Hypocrites, <hi>Come not near me, for I am holier than you.</hi> I ſhall firſt touch at the younger Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The younger ſaid to his Father, Father give me the Portion of Goods that falleth to me.</hi> We may ſuppoſe his Father was a holy pious Man; one that had taken up <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s Reſolution; Whatever others might do, <hi>as for him and his Houſe, they would ſerve the LORD.</hi> We may ſuppoſe he kept up Family-Religion, took Care to breed up his Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD: But his younger Son, like ſome of our young Gentlemen, could not bear ſo much Reſtraint upon him, by an
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005089_0004_1016A34C76BDEA80"/>
old doting enthuſiaſtick Father; he could not bear to have Religion always talk'd of in the Family; he thought his Father righteous over-much; impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of religious Reſtraints; he deſires to be left to his own Heart Luſts; and therefore ſaid to his Father, <hi>Give me the Portion of Goods that falleth to me.</hi> My dear Friends, this is the Temper of all of us by Nature; we deal thus with our heavenly Father: Tho' God impoſeth nothing upon us but what is really perfective of our Nature; tho' God bids us abſtain from nothing but what would hurt us; yet we look upon God as a hard rigorous Task-Maſter. If we were left to our own Choice, we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to leave us to our ſelves: The Language of our Hearts by Nature is, <hi>Lord, depart from us, we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Law:</hi> The Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our Hearts is, Father, Leave us to our ſelves. But, my dear Friends, you cannot put up a better Petition, if ye have a Mind to be happy, than this; Lord, however thou deal with us, leave us not to our own Choice. What this young Man ſaid, we all ſay.</p>
            <p>We may ſuppoſe it troubled the Father to have ſuch a wicked Child; however, hoping that the Prodigal might yet be reclaimed, and mend his Life, the Father gave him what he deſired; <hi>and ſo divided unto him his Living.</hi> You ſee what we ſhall do, if God Almighty leave us to our own Hearts Luſts; for we are told in the 13th Verſe, <hi>That not many Days after the younger Son gathered all together, and went into a far Country, and ſpent his Subſtance with riotous living. Not many Days after,</hi> it's taken parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Notice of, for he was impatient of Reſtraint, every Day was a Year while he was in his Father's
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005089_0005_1016A34E05579D60"/>
Houſe; he would have went away immediately, but he ſtaid ſometime to get a proper Equipage, ſuitable to the Quality of the Son of ſuch a Father. Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Days after <hi>he gathered all together,</hi> leaves nothing behind, that he might be out of his Father's Reach. <hi>He took his Journey into a far Country,</hi> It's remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the way of Sin is down the Hill, when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſin, ye know not where ye will ſtop, you will go into a far Country, far from God; he was afraid if he ſtaid longer at home, he would have his Father checking him, therefore he gets out of his hearing. This repreſents the Heart of a Sinner, he finds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions now and then coming upon him, &amp; ſo would drink and whore, and go on in Sin, on purpoſe to ſtifle his Convictions. <hi>He went into a far Country,</hi> and ſee what follows, <hi>he waſted his Subſtance with riotous living.</hi> One would have thought he would have ſtop'd before his Goods were all waſted: But my dear Friends, there is ſuch an Infatuation in Sin, there is ſuch a ſtrong Propenſity to Sin in our Heart, that without the almighty Power of God give a ſtop to our Will, tho' we know the End of Sin will be Damnation, yet we will Sin on, tho' we ſhould be damned. This was the Caſe of the young Prodigal. When his Subſtance was waſting, one would have thought he would have ſtop'd before all was gone: But ſee how God hedged up his Way.</p>
            <p>In the 14th Verſe we are told <hi>When he had ſpent all, there aroſe a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in want.</hi> Here God was now bringing a Reſtraint in order to bring him home. There was not only a Famine, but an extraordinary Famine; and then the Prodigal began to be in want. One would have thought that he ſhould have begun to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005089_0006_1016A352628F6980"/>
think of coming home: But we ſhall never come to Chriſt, till we think we muſt be damned without Chriſt: Chriſt is beholden to none of us for coming to him. The Prodigal was in Want, but we do not hear of his beginning to think of coming Home. When People have ſome few Convictions floating upon the Surface of their Hearts, they begin to ſee the Evil of Sin; but their Goodneſs is like a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cloud that paſſeth away, till Convictions faſten upon their Soul, and they ſee themſelves loſt. The Prodigal ſees himſelf in Want, but he would not come home, ſo long as he can ſhift for himſelf: therefore we are told,</p>
            <p>In the 15. Ver. <hi>He went and joined himſelf to a Citizen, and he ſent him into the Feilds to feed Swine.</hi> Are there any young Prodigals here that are ſpending their Patrimony in riotous Living; ſee what this will bring them to. A Man that lives within Bounds, he may have none of theſe dreadful Things to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with, that theſe poor Souls have, that are carried away Captive by the Devil. I know it by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Here a young Man finely equipped, with a fine Fortune, ſee what he is reduced to; was that proper Company for him? <hi>He joined himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, and he ſent him into the Field to feed Swine:</hi> And here he would have been contented to remain, if he could have been kept from Hunger.</p>
            <p>We are told in the 16. Ver. <hi>He would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did eat, but no Man gave unto him.</hi> O what will Prodigality bring People to. The wiſe Man ſays, <hi>By Means of a whoriſh Woman, a Man is brought to a Piece of Bread.</hi> Here, he that was uſed to variety of Diſhes, cloathed in Purple and fine Linnen, ſee him now ſitting with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005089_0007_1016A2DD21542678"/>
the Swine, envying the very Beaſts the Husks on which they were feeding. He only wanted the Husks, he would be content to be kept from ſtarving, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out going home. <hi>But no Man gave unto him,</hi> ſo much as the Husks. This plainly ſhews, when we are coming to Jeſus Chriſt, how GOD Almighty will make all Ways of eſcaping good for nothing, till we come Home to CHRIST. Now this young Man might think all theſe Things were againſt him; but all theſe Things were intended for him, to bring him home to CHRIST. So a poor Sinner that is hedged in on every Side, will think, all is gone; but God is hedging up his Way. Here the poor Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal is ſitting with the Swine: methinks I ſee him. What muſt he do? He is brought to an Extremity; and this was God's Opportunity.</p>
            <p>Ver. 17. <hi>When he came to himſelf.</hi> This is very remarkable. Pray, was the Prodigal beſide himſelf? Before, he looked on his Father as a mad Man; as I believe Thouſands now look upon the Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST, as Fools, Enthuſiaſts, and mad Men. Thus this young Prodigal looked upon his Father. But the Father was the wiſe Man, and the Prodigal a Fool. You that now mock and ſcoff at the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and join with your helliſh Companions, you will be made to cry out, We, not they, were Fools; how are they numbred among the Children of GOD. O may God bring you to your ſelves. Here the Prodigal comes to himſelf. The Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Pride, did overcome him. But when God brings you to Death, when God diſrobes you of all you have, then you will begin to ſee what a damnable Condition your Souls are in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005089_0008_10166726C853CA48"/>Here ſays he, <hi>How many hired Servants of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with Hunger,</hi> He not only wanted Bread, and began to be in Want; but <hi>I periſh,</hi> if I ſtay here, <hi>with Hunger.</hi> You will never come to CHRIST, till you ſee your ſelves periſhing without him. <hi>I periſh with Hunger.</hi> Now the Prodigal begins to conſider the dreadful Condition he is in; but if he ſtops here, he will not come home: However, he makes Reſolutions; and therefore we are told</p>
            <p>In the 18th Ver. after he had conſidered his wretched State, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and ſay to him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, &amp;c.</hi> He ſaw himſelf ready to periſh: O that ſome might give me Husks, that I may be kept from going home. Well, but he muſt go home. Well, ſays he, <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my Father.</hi> It's remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, tho' he had uſed his Father ſo ill, he calls him his Father: He had often tried his Father; who had often born with him: It broke in upon his Soul. Who knows but my Father may bear with me yet? I am ſtarving here. What will he ſay? Will he plead Merit? No, he will aggravate what he has done, <hi>I will ſay, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee.</hi> This is remarkable: He had ſinned againſt his Neighbour; he had ſinned againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but what grieves him moſt is, that he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt his Father, againſt Heaven; for whatever Harm we have done to our Neighbour or our ſelves, it ultimately ſtrikes againſt God himſelf. It grieves him that he has offended his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Make me as one of thy hired ſervants.</hi> Some ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this laſt Clauſe was the Relict of Self-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005089_0009_101667511470C5D8"/>
in the young Man's Heart. Thinks he, I will go home to my Father; I will ask Pardon for my Sin, but I will not be intirely beholden to him for my Living: I will Work a little for it; I will do ſomething for my Bread. O but a Soul muſt be brought low, before it is brought out of Self. This Self, you cannot tell how ſecretly it works; how much of Self is in the beſt Saints. He was not willing to accept a Pardon as a free Gift: no, ſays he, I will Work for it. We would fain have ſome Hand in our Salvation. Others ſuppoſe it was the Reſult of Humility in him: <hi>Make me as one of thy hired Servants:</hi> Deal with me as thou wilt; only let me come home unto thee: for a poor convinced Sinner will ſay, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> He would rather be a Door-keeper in the Houſe of God than dwell in Tents of Wickedneſs. Well, when the Prodigal's Convictions began to faſten, he ſaid he would ariſe; and we ſhall find that he actually did ariſe in the 21. Verſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And he aroſe and came to his Father.</hi> But who can tell how many bitter Throws this poor Man felt? What Convictions, what Convulſions his Soul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, during his returning home. Sinners, you are going away from God, you are wandering into a far Country; but you will have many bitter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions before you come again to JESUS CHRIST. He aroſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is ſaid, he was gone into a far Country; and we may ſuppoſe was ſometime a coming home. Methinks, I ſee the poor Creature quite deſtitute, quite helpleſs; without Cloaths on his Back, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Shoes, ſtinking, filthy all over. Methinks, I ſee him walking ſlowly on: for Sin takes off our Chariot Wheels, and makes us drive heavily. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005089_0010_1016A2ADA695C308"/>
I ſee the poor Creature in great Perplexity before he came to his Father's Houſe. Sometimes Unbelief works; it can never be that my Father will forgive ſuch a Wretch as I am. His old Sins ſtare him in the Face; his Ingratitude ſtares him: My Father hath forgiven me often, but he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgive me again. Methinks, I ſee him ſtepping back, and weeping. When we look upon God as our Enemy, that very Look makes us fly from him. We ſhall never come to God, till we look upon him as our Friend. But then, thinks he, if I do not go, I ſhall certainly periſh: But who knows but my Father will receive me. Then, methinks, I ſee him ſtep up again; but then Pride of Heart ariſes; What, ſhall I ſtoop before my Father's Servants? Can I humble my ſelf before my Father's Gate; it's better to periſh here. As many a Sinner when under Convictions, and has not got a Senſe of Pardon, would rather be damned than come to JESUS CHRIST. But at laſt, well thinks he, I will go, it is better to do the meaneſt thing with Shame; than to periſh here: at laſt he gets up, and has many a weary Look, many a Fear, many a Laſh of a ſelf-condemned Conſcience: At laſt he comes to the Gate of his Father's Houſe, <hi>He aroſe and came to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> fearing and trembling leſt his Father would not look upon him. But ſee the Heart of God to poor dejected ſelf-condemned Sinners; ſee the Love of God to poor repenting Sinners; we are told, <hi>When he was yet a great Way off, his Father ſaw him &amp; had Compaſſion on him, and ran, &amp; fell on his Neck &amp; kiſſed him.</hi> I believe never was ſo much Affection expreſſed in ſo few Words. <hi>When he was yet a great Way off:</hi> Perhaps the Father was praying in the Field, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005089_0011_1016A2B0572A4088"/>
as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that his Prodigal might come home, putting up a Prayer to God, <hi>O that</hi> Iſhmael <hi>might live before thee.</hi> And perhaps when he was praying, he turns his Head, and ſees his young Prodigal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home. The Prodigal does not advance any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Unbelief kept him back; I dare not approach him any more: Like a poor Sinner convinced of Sin, he dares not lay hold on Chriſt, tho' God bids him. Here the Father turning his Head, ſees a poor Creature quite diſfigured, without Cloaths or Shoes: He won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders who it is: He looks again, &amp; at laſt ſays, There are ſome Features of my Child. God can ſee all his Elect, tho' they are weltring in their Blood. One would have thought, when he ſaw him, he would immediately go to the Houſe, and bid the Dogs bark at him, and command the filthy Wretch to be gone to his Whores, and where he had ſpent his Subſtance in riotous Living. No, inſtead of that, <hi>when he ſaw him he had Compaſſion on him</hi>; his Bowels yearned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; his Heart was ready to diſſolve within him, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when we are told his Bowels yern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward his Brethren. Old as he was, <hi>he ran,</hi> he ſaw his Prodigal unwilling to come; O thinks he, I will run and meet him. And when a poor Sinner is made willing to come, when he is about to come, God will ſend his Spirit to fetch him home. <hi>He ran to him</hi>:One would have thought he would ſay, Go waſh thy ſelf, and then I will kiſs thee: No, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ran,</hi> and in an Extaſy of Love <hi>fell on his Neck</hi>; he threw himſelf on his Neck, filthy as it was; he ſpeaks not one Word, but ſhews his Love; his Actions ſpeaks for him; with open Arms he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his filthy Son: Welcome, my Child, welcome home! There is not one Word of Reflection. No,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005089_0012_1016A2B1DDD1E170"/>
when you come to God, he will blot out all your Tranſgreſſions, he will freely forgive your Sins, and your Iniquities he will remember no more. Well, one would think the Prodigal ſhould have forgot his Purpoſe, My Father hath forgiven me, I need ſay no more. But where-ever God comes in a ſaving Way to a poor Sinner, he is filled with ſuch a ſenſe of his Sin, that tho' God forgive him, he cannot forgive himſelf.</p>
            <p>Here the Prodigal ſays in the 21ſt Verſe, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> This ſhows us that we muſt confeſs Sin, even after we know that our Sins are forgiven: That is ſweet Humility, that reſults from a Senſe of God's Love. I appeal to you that know CHRIST, if it is not the ſweeteſt Hours with you, after ye have received Manifeſtations from God, a breathing of God in your Soul; you feel your Souls melting, diſſolving in Love, and throwing your ſelves at the Foot of ſovereign Grace, Why me Lord, why me? And the more God pours in upon you, the more lowly ye are in your own Eyes. O that is a ſweet Time, when the Soul is laid low, and diſſolved with a Senſe of God's Love. Methinks, I ſee the Prodigal amazed that the Father ſhould have thus embraced him. Says he, <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son:</hi> How is it that thou doſt kiſs me? O what ſweet Expreſſions, what ſweet Fellowſhip is there between Jeſus Chriſt, and a precious Soul, when Chriſt is viſiting that Soul with his Love! He would have went on, and ſaid, <hi>Make me as one of thy hired Servants</hi>; but the Father would not let him go on with his Confeſſion, and therefore we are told,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005089_0013_1016A2B36719CFB8"/>In the 22d. Verſe. <hi>Then he ſaid to his Servants,</hi> in the plural Number, not to one Servant, but to all of them, to ſhow the haſte he was in to help his poor Son, make haſte to welcome my dear Child home. <hi>The Father ſaid to his Servants.</hi>—One would have thought he ſhould have ſaid, Go make this Prodigal be gone, no, but <hi>bring forth the beſt Robe, and put it on him, and put a Ring on his Hand and Shoes on his Feet.—Bring forth the beſt Robe.</hi>The Prodigal was willing to be like a hired Servant, any Thing would be good enough for him. No, he muſt have a Robe, not only a Robe, but the beſt Robe, the Robe which his Father wore on high Days, the beſt Robe in all the Houſe was not too good for him tho' ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Child. The Father might have told him, ſee what thou haſt loſt by thy Prodigality; no, but ſays he, Fetch the beſt Robe: and it muſt not only be fetcht out, but <hi>put upon him.</hi> Not only ſo, but he muſt <hi>put a Ring on his Hand,</hi> to diſtinguiſh his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It appears he had no Shoes on his Feet, and the Father cannot bear that, then ſays he, <hi>Fetch out Shoes, and put them on his Feet,</hi>to ſhow how glad he was, and that nothing was too dear for him, ſays he, <hi>Bring hither the fatted Calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what are you to underſtand by this beſt Robe? It is the Robe of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, it is a Robe weaved by the Hand of Chriſt, a Robe that could not be purchaſed without Chriſt ſhed his precious Heart-Blood. If you ſee that you are naked, that you are undone, poor, miſerable, blind, helpleſs Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, God will put his Robe upon your naked Soul, God will apply Chriſt's Righteouſneſs to your Heart, ſo that you ſhall be made to ſay, <hi>The Lord is my Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>

Did the Father put a <hi>Ring</hi> upon this young Man's Hand? So God ſhall Seal you for his, by his Spirit, till the Day of Redemption; God ſhall put his Spirit into your Heart, and by this ſhall all Men know that you are God's Children, Sons and Daughters of the Lord Almighty. Did the Father put <hi>Shoes</hi> upon this young Man's Feet? So ſhall your Feet be ſhod with the Preparation of the Goſpel of Peace. Did the Father kill the <hi>fatted Calf?</hi> Did the Prodigal feed upon this fatted Calf? So ſhall God feed your Soul with a hidden Life, a divine Life, a Joy that Strangers intermeddle not with. You ſhall feel God in your Heart, you ſhall feel Chriſt in your Soul. Did the <hi>Servants make merry?</hi> were they glad? So ſhall God the Father communicate the News of your Converſion to the Angels above, and there will be Joy in Heaven over your repenting and coming to Jeſus Chriſt. O methinks I ſee theſe bleſſed Spirits flying round the Congregation, tuning their Harps, and longing as the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks, to ſing an Anthem at your Converſion. Methinks I ſee them longing to aſcend the heavenly Ladder, and join the heavenly Quire, ſaying, ſome precious Souls were dead, but God hath made them alive; they were loſt to God, loſt to Jeſus Chriſt; but God hath breathed into them the Breath of Life, and they are now become living Souls. O may God grant that this may be the Angels Song this Afternoon concerning ſome of you. I believe God intends to come among you this Day; I believe Jeſus Chriſt intends to bring ſome of you home. O that there may be a whole Congregation coming together. There is enough in Chriſt for you all.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005089_0015_1016A2B9F40E0108"/>I muſt touch a little upon the <hi>elder Brother,</hi> and return to the younger Brother, for I do not love his Character.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, all ſhould have rejoyced at the Prodigal's coming home: But what can pleaſe a ſelf-righteous Perſon? God himſelf cannot pleaſe him. We are told <hi>his elder Brother was in the Field, and as he came and drew nigh to the Houſe, he heard Muſick and Dancing.</hi> Before I go forward, give me Leave to tell you who (becauſe Muſick and Dancing is mentioned) may think it lawful to dance and have Balls.— But my dear Friends, ſuch Things are as much contrary to the Goſpel of Chriſt, as Light is to Darkneſs. And whatever you may think, if God ever touch your Heart, and make you new Creatures, you will be ſick of theſe Things; you will no more be preſent at a Ball or Aſſembly, than you will thruſt your Head into the Fire. I ſpeak this by Experience. No one hath been a greater Sinner that Way, than that poor Creature that is now preaching the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt to you. Many a precious Hour and Night have I ſpent this Way, and thought it no Harm, as you may do: I went to the Sacrament, I kept Faſts before the Sacrament; I thought it no Harm to go to dancing for all that. But my dear Friends, take Warning, it hath coſt me many a Tear, many a gloomy Hour to reflect upon the many precious Hours I have ſpent this Way, and I am amazed that God did not ſend me to Hell. Take Warning by me, it coſt me many a bitter Hour, as it will coſt you if ever you come to God. You may put off Convictions now; but when Death takes hold of your Soul, you will ſee Things in another Light; you will be amazed to think that you ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005089_0016_1016A2BBA3CEE2A8"/>
be deceiving your own Souls. Take Heed of theſe Things, they will eat out the Vitals of Religion, and if theſe Things be encouraged in <hi>Scotland,</hi> they will eat out Religion.</p>

               <hi>He called one of his Father's Servants, and asked what theſe Things meant. And he ſaid unto him, Thy Brother is come, and thy Father hath killed the fatted Calf, becauſe he hath received him ſafe and ſound.</hi> It's remarkable what the Servant ſaid, <hi>Thy Father hath received him ſafe and ſound.</hi> Why, was the Prodigal ſafe and ſound? He was naked, no Cloaths upon his Back, no Shoes upon his Feet. It is becauſe when we come to God, when he views us in the Holineſs of Jeſus Chriſt, he looks upon us as tho' we had never ſinned at all; we are <hi>ſafe and ſound,</hi> having on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. One would have thought he would have gone in and rejoyced over his Brother. No, <hi>he was angry and would not go in.</hi> So the Phariſees were angry with Jeſus Chriſt for converſing with Sinners. <hi>Therefore,</hi> we are told, <hi>his Father went out, and intreated him.</hi> How does God bear with the Perverſeneſs of ſelf-righteous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners! <hi>But he anſwering, ſaid to his Father, Lo!</hi> He introduces what he had to ſay with a <hi>Lo!</hi> for we love to magnify every Thing we do. <hi>Lo, theſe many Years do I ſerve thee:</hi> We love to make the moſt of what we do; <hi>theſe many Years</hi>; he aggravates every Thing he did, and leſſens every Thing God did. Obſerve how often he brings in the little Word, <hi>I; neither tranſgreſſed</hi> I <hi>at any Time thy Commandments; and yet thou never gaveſt me a Kid to make merry with my Friends.</hi> See how he finds Fault with his Father! A ſelf-righteous Perſon finds Fault with every Thing that God does. <hi>Neither tranſgreſſed I at any Time
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005089_0017_1016A2BEC524D948"/>
thy Commandments.</hi> This ſhews the Fooliſhneſs of thoſe that boaſt of their own Righteouſneſs. He was juſt doing now like the Phariſee, <hi>I thank God, I am no unjuſt Perſon.</hi> When he was boaſting that he was not unjuſt, he was committing the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Action in the World; to judge a poor Publican, was not that unjuſt? See how he reflects upon his Father and his Brother, <hi>But as ſoon as this thy Son</hi>; he would not own him to be his Brother; <hi>thy Son</hi>; I will not call him my Brother; <hi>which hath devoured thy Living with Harlots:</hi> See how he magnifies it; he caſts Reflections on the young Man who was caſting Reflections enough upon himſelf; but he magnifies them all. <hi>Thou haſt killed for him,</hi> an ungrateful, wicked, wanton Prodigal, <hi>the fatted Calf.</hi> But ſee the Forbearance of God, <hi>He ſaid unto him, Son, all I have is thine</hi>; — for even ſelf-righteous Perſons ſhall have a Share. Whatever Difference there may be between us and others, there is no Difference by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we have all ſinned and fallen ſhort of the Glory of God. We ſhould never ſee a poor Drunkard, but we ſhould ſay, there is my Picture, if God leave me to my ſelf. <hi>This</hi> is therefore <hi>thy Brother that is come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told you I would return to the <hi>younger Brother</hi> again. I fear there are too many of us angry at Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters for preaching free Grace, and inviting Souls to Jeſus Chriſt. But my Friends, my Prayer to God is, that this Parable may be fulfilled in your Heart. I hope God intends to do Good to your Souls this Afternoon. Are there none of you that feel your ſelves damned? We are all loſt, eſtranged from God by Nature, legally dead, and have no more Power to come to God of our ſelves, than the Bones you are ſitting over have Power to come out

of the Grave. The great Queſtion is, which of you feel your Inability to ſave your ſelves? We have all been Prodigals; God put a Stock into our firſt Parents Hand, who ſpent that; we are all Bankrupts, and ſhall be undone without the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Which of you, or how many of you can ſay, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father</hi>; I will ariſe and go to my offended God; <hi>and I will ſay to him, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Do you find powerful Convictions faſten upon you? Do you find your own Blindneſs and Darkneſs? Are you bewailing And weeping over the Miſeries of a corrupt Nature? Come then, do not fear. The Devil will ſtrike in, and will tell you, God will not accept of you, the Day of Grace is over. But behold how God's Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els yern over you. God ſees you when you are yet a great Way off: he ſaw you from Eternity; he had Compaſſion on you; he ſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to work out a Righteouſneſs for you. Be you what you will, be you who you will, as many of you that fear you are damned; as many as are willing to accept of Salvation by a crucified Jeſus; God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably more willing to receive you than you are to receive him. For Jeſus Chriſt's Sake do not ſtay, come in your Filth, damned as you are; God will give you Kiſſes of Love, God will embrace you in the Arms of his Mercy.
