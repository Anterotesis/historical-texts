            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>1 Epiſtle of PETER, CHAP. v. VERSE 6.</bibl>
               <q>Humble yourſelves therefore, under the mighty hand of <hi>GOD,</hi> that he may exalt you in due time.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WITHOUT ſtaying to conſider theſe words in their primary reference, as pointed out in the context, I ſhall proceed to diſcourſe upon them, agreable to the occaſion of the preſent day, as I apprehend they will furniſh ſuitable matter therefor.</p>
            <p>GOD that created the univerſe, has ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the head of it, and undertaken to manage and controul it, as ſeemeth good in his ſight. Univerſal empire and dominion of right belongs to him, and to none other: Nor is any other being at all equal to it, for the power of all other beings is finite, but the power of God is infinite, and ſuch a power is abſolutely neceſſary in order to univerſal government. This is a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which reaſon alone clearly dictates, and it is abundantly held forth in the ſacred inſpired writings.</p>
            <p>As to this lower world, the divine majeſty is to be conſidered as the prime efficient in all events that take place. What ever may be ſaid
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013388_0005_0F90EE5AAFDFC490"/>
of the undeſireable operation of the luſts and corruptions of men, their pride, malice, envy, avarice, &amp;c. as productive of uncomfortable events; what ever may be ſaid of inſtrumental and ſecondary cauſes, yet the mighty hand of God is firſtly to be eyed and acknowledged. It is a clear dictate of reaſon and ſcripture that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happens, particularly in this lower world, to individuals, or to ſocieties, greater or leſs; but it is by God's permiſſion and providence, and the events that take place, are very various. And conſidering the moral obligations that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are under to God, it certainly becomes them to conduct towards him agreable to thoſe diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations that he viſits them with.</p>
            <p>THE words of our text, leads us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of an important duty under calamitous events.—<hi>Humble yourſelves &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY lead us alſo to a conſideration of the happy effect, and conſequence of complying with this duty—<hi>That he may exalt</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>FIRST, We may conſider the duty here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined under calamitous events. <hi>Humble</hi> &amp;c. This phraſe here. <hi>The mighty hand of God,</hi> under which men are called to <hi>humble themſelves</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of diſpenſations and events, in divine providence, that are diſtreſſing, grievous and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous. Sometimes indeed it is expreſſive of Gods favourable diſpenſations, as when Moſes tells the people of Iſrael, that the Lord their God brought them out of Egypt, <hi>through a mighty hand,</hi> and, <hi>by a ſtretched out arm.</hi> Deut. iv. 34. God kindly interpoſed for them, and diſplayed his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013388_0006_0F90F4A66ED188E0"/>
almighty power for their deliverance. And ſo other places might be mentioned: But here in our text, as I juſt ſaid, <hi>the mighty hand of God,</hi> is expreſſive of calamitous events. Otherwiſe there would be no propriety in the apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, for men to <hi>humble themſelves</hi> under it. Favourable diſpenſations of God, call rather for gladneſs and rejoicing before him, than humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</p>
            <p>I would therefore go on and ſay, that the great governor of the world is various in his diſpenſations, not only towards individuals, but towards communities. At times many great and public bleſſings are enjoyed, the ſame in kind which Moſes ſpeaks of to Iſrael, and encourages them to expect from the good providence of God, if they approved themſelves an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent people. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii, 3d. &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the city, and bleſſed ſhalt thou be in the field. Bleſſed ſhall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increaſe of thy kine and the flocks of thy ſheep. Bleſſed ſhall be thy baſket and thy ſtore &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT tho' they are ſometimes made to rejoice under the ſmiles of divine providence, yet by and by the ſcene is changed: Their ſituation and circumſtances are quite the reverſe. Wars, famines, peſtilences ſucceed, or come in the room of peace health and plenty. And great fears, diſtreſſes and perplexities neceſſarily attend ſuch calamitous events. And ſometimes after long enjoyment of civil and religious liberties and privileges, a people are bro't into great embaraſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013388_0007_0F90F4A7B88C3A10"/>
and diſtreſſes. And their public affairs, their civil and ſacred privileges, their trade and buſineſs and occupations, wear a dark and gloomy aſpect, ſo that they know not what to do, or how to extricate themſelves. Such are the changes and alterations that are made in kingdoms, nations and provinces, in the courſe of Gods providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial government. And in the language of our text, in all this is <hi>the mighty hand of God.</hi> His powerful hand it is that brings on theſe diſtreſſes and calamities. Thus as it is in the book of <hi>Job.</hi> xii. 23. <hi>He increaſeth the nations and deſtroyeth them, he enlargeth the nations and ſtraiteneth them again.</hi> That of the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied here, chap. xxv. 30. &amp;c. <hi>The Lord ſhall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation, he ſhall mightily roar upon his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhall give a ſhout as they that tread the grapes againſt all the inhabitants of the earth. A noiſe ſhall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controverſy with the nations</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In a word here. All good and evil, public as well as perſonal, is principally to be attributed to the governing providence of God moſt high, who performeth all things. This is the doctrine of the bible. <hi>I form the light,</hi> ſays God, <hi>and create darkneſs, I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi> Iſai. xlv. 7.</p>
            <p>AND in all public diſtreſſes and calamities, it is evident the Lord hath a controverſy with that people among whom they happen. This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the paſſage I juſt mentioned from the prophet <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> So alſo is it in that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and the ground of his controverſy is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013388_0008_0F90F4A82F6E3640"/>
therein mentioned, <hi>Hoſea</hi> chap. 4. from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Iſrael, for the Lord hath a controverſy with the inhabitants of the land, becauſe there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By ſwearing and lying and killing and ſtealing and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when the ſcripture ſpeaks of God's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a controverſy with a people; it naturally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that he is diſpleaſed and angry with them. A controverſy between man and man, ſuppoſes that they are at odds with each other, that there is ſome ground or cauſe of uneaſineſs and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and hence they are wont to take methods to decide it, each aiming to make his part good, or to gain the aſcendancy, that ſo he may have it in his power to curb and chaſtiſe his antagoniſt. This is no ground for controverſy, when an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire harmony and good agreement ſubſiſts. So that, as I juſt ſaid, God's having a controverſy with a people, ſuppoſes his anger and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt them. Accordingly when his mighty hand is lifted up, when he viſits them with thoſe evils and calamities we have mentioned at this time, it is an undoubted evidence that he is wroth with them, calamities are ſo many tokens of his anger. This is very frequently expreſſed in ſcripture. I ſhall only mention that of the prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. ix. 11, 12. <hi>Therefore the Lord ſhall ſet up the adverſaries of Rezin againſt him, and join his enemies together. The</hi> Syrians <hi>before, and the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>behind, and they ſhall devour Iſrael
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013388_0009_0F909502C92A92A8"/>
with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the queſtion is, what is it that excites the anger of God, and cauſes him to manifeſt it in calamitous diſpenſations? I anſwer in general it is on account of their wickedneſs and rebellion againſt him. If a people were univerſally or very generally a virtuous, religious, obedient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is not to be tho't that the righteous and holy God, who loves goodneſs and righteouſneſs, would have any controverſy with them, that he would bring any evils and calamities upon them, but would be their conſtant friend, guardian and protector. When therefore he contends with them and greatly diſtreſſes them, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their iniquities and rebellions have provoked him to do ſo. All this may be fairly argued not only from the holy ſcripture, but from his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as the moral governor of the world. Mankind in all ages even unto the preſent, muſt take to themſelves the blame of all the evils, diſtreſſes and calamities that have befallen them.</p>
            <p>THEY muſt do ſo beſure, if they don't confine their views to inſtrumental and ſecondary cauſes, but regard almighty God, as the great firſt cauſe of all events. And no one who exerciſes a rational, ſober tho't, but muſt be led thus to conſider him. They muſt be led to acknowledge his hand in all calamities, and to conſider the moral ground or reaſon of them; namely, their diſobedience and rebellion againſt him.</p>
            <p>AND in this view of things, ariſes the duty

            <p>THIS may be conſidered as an exhortation to <hi>repentance</hi> when the diſpenſations of the great governor of the world are diſtreſſing and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this they went on audaciouſly and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in their iniquities and rebellions, as tho' they could carry the day againſt him, and be an over match for him. <hi>Every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was this to comply with God's expectations concerning them? No verily, but quite the reverſe. From the paſſage I juſt mentioned, it is plain that he expected that they would repent of all thoſe evils and tranſgreſſions which had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his frowns.</p>

THOSE things that go to conſtitute true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, are here ſet forth in general terms, abſtaining from every vice and immorality, and practiſing thoſe things that are pious, virtuous, juſt and righteous.</p>
            <p>REPENTANCE however, I would obſerve, is not to be conſidered, as conſiſting merely in an external reformation of manners, there muſt certainly in the firſt place be an inward good diſpoſition. And indeed it is not likely that there will be an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reformation of manners, in the want of ſuch an inward good diſpoſition. It is not to be expected that there will be good fruit, unleſs the tree be good, to allude to our Saviours manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> chap. vii.</p>
            <p>AND accordingly, the terms and phraſes made uſe of in ſcripture to expreſs repentance, plainly ſhow that there is ſomething more in it than what is external; that it conſiſts alſo in that which is inward. Accordingly, it is ſometimes expreſſed by <hi>a broken and contrite heart,</hi> by <hi>ſorrowing</hi> and mourning, which is internal, ſo alſo by men's <hi>humbling</hi> themſelves, as in our text.</p>
            <p>WE have obſerved that when the mighty hand of God is lifted up, or when diſtreſſing calamitous events come upon a people, through the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling providence of God, it is for the wickedneſs and rebellion of a people againſt his holy Majeſty.</p>
            <p>THE procuring cauſe, therefore, of ſuch events is that which calls for repentance, and that from all orders, ranks and characters of perſons. Public diſtreſſes and calamities are undoubtedly to be looked upon as tokens of the righteous anger of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013388_0013_0F9095044C52ADA8"/>
the Majeſty of heaven: who is diſhonoured, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted and vilely and ſhamefully treated by the impieties and wickedneſſes that are prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And this is reaſon ſufficient for univerſal mourning a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d humiliation before God.</p>
            <p>THE Majeſty of heaven moſt certainly deſerves other ſort of treatment than this. The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his nature demand the higheſt eſteem, veneration and ſubjection from his whole intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent offspring. And ſo does the paternal relation he ſtands in to them. When his being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſtruck at, when he is inſulted and abuſed, as moſt certainly is the caſe, when many and heinous vices are riſe in a community is it to be tho't ſtrange, that his anger is excited, and that he manifeſts it by inflicting ſore evils upon them, bringing on days of darkneſs perplexity and diſtreſs; eſpecially when for a long time he has exerciſed his patience and forbearance towards them, and cauſed them to ſee much good and outward proſperity? Can it, I ſay, be tho't ſtrange that his offended majeſty ſhould lift up his hand againſt them and make them know feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what an evil and bitter thing it is that they have departed from the Lord their God, and that his fear has not been with them?</p>
            <p>Favourable diſpenſations of his providence, not having had a kindly effect, their becoming a willing, obedient people, he ſees it fit to diſtreſs them in his anger—to lift up his mighty hand againſt them—to viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod and their iniquities with ſtripes. And yet ſuch tokens of his anger are ſometimes diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fail of producing proper effects.</p>

THE prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preſents us with all this in one view, chap. xvi. 10. 11. <hi>Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; in the land of uprightneſs will he deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and will not behold the majeſty of the Lord. Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY receive many mercies (as one notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it) from God, he cauſeth his ſun to ſhine &amp; his rain to fall upon them, nay, he proſpers them, and into their hands he brings plentifully; they eſcape many of the ſtrokes of God's judgments, which others leſs wicked then they, have been cut off by—and yet all is in vain, they will not learn righteouſneſs, will not be led to repentance by the goodneſs of God. God lifts up his hand but they take no notice of it—<hi>they will not ſee,</hi> ſhut their eyes againſt the cleareſt conviction of guilt and wrath, aſcribe that to chance, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fate, which is manifeſtly a divine rebuke, who regard not the threatning ſymptoms of their own ruin, but cry peace to themſelves, when the righteous God is waging war with them.</p>
            <p>How unjuſt, how unreaſonable a conduct was this under the diſpenſations of heaven?</p>
            <p>MOST certainly it becomes a people to <hi>ſee,</hi> to take notice of the hand of God, when it is lifted up, to regard the work of the Lord, and the operation of his hand. And how are they to ſee and regard it? Why, by humbling themſelves, and learning and practiſing righteouſneſs. This is the end propoſed by him, in lifting up his hand againſt them. This is what he juſtly expects on their part.</p>

IT is certainly neceſſary in this day of darkneſs, perplexity and diſtreſs, thro' the mighty hand of God lifted up againſt us, that there be great ſearching of heart; a ſerious and thorough en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the grounds of God's controverſy with us; what have been the evils and abominations that have incenſed the divine anger againſt us. This certainly is the main thing, and not merely look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at inſtruments and ſecond cauſes. For let theſe be what they will, yet (as was ſaid before) God Almighty, is the firſt cauſe, and ought to be regarded as ſuch. It becomes us to be deeply humbled before him, for the many and heinous evils in the midſt of us which have procured the tokens of his anger and diſpleaſure. We can't be properly humbled under divine rebukes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we are humbled for the caurſe of them, the moral cauſe I mean. And to be thus humbled, neceſſarily ſuppoſes that we have ſome juſt and right ſenſe of the badneſs the vileneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of the cauſe; or in other words, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> we have a juſt ſenſe of the vileneſs and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of ſin or moral evil, as it is againſt God, as it counteracts his authority, as it is down-right rebellion againſt his crown and dignity, deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of all regularity and order in the moral ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, naturally adapted to throw all things into confuſion, to the diſhonour of God, and thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deſigns of all his grand operations in the kingdom of providence and of grace. To be humbled before God under his mighty hand, ſuppoſes that we have a juſt and thorough ſenſe, of all this. And ſo alſo the iniquity in all its
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013388_0016_0F90F4AAEDFB1A58"/>
forms is moſt vile and baſe ingratitude againſt the divine being, who is the ſourſe of all good and felicity to communities as well as individuals, and upon whoſe powerful care and protection they abſolutely are dependant for every future good. Such humiliation taking its riſe from the conſiderations mentioned, carries in the idea of it, true genuine ſorr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> and mourning before God, grieved that we have acted ſo vile, ſo baſe, ſo irrational and unworthy a part: And at the ſame time ſolicitous to obtain forgiveneſs from him, applying earneſtly, importunately and perſevering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his throne of grace, for the obtainment of it, not for our ſakes, but for his own name's ſake, and for the ſake of his Son Jeſus, the great media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and reconciler.</p>
            <p>AND in cloſe connexion with all this, and indeed as the natural reſult of all, there will be firm and hearty reſolutions, through the divine aids, to abandon all thoſe vicious practices that have been habitually indulged: That they will no more indulge to prophaneneſs, intemperance, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſtealing, making and propagating falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, wounding the character of their neighbours, over-reaching, defrauding, ſabbath-breaking, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to parents, deſpiſing dignities, idling away their time to the neglecting their proper buſineſs, and making proper proviſion for their families and dependants, needleſsly ſpending their time and money in public houſes. And ſo I might mention other enormities. If we are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under the mighty hand of God, we ſhall ceaſe from all theſe evils, which have occaſioned his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013388_0017_0F90950CDFDE9D78"/>
lifting it up againſt us. And we ſhall heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ourſelves to the practice of the oppoſite virtues. We ſhall practiſe upon the ſacred rules laid down in the Bible: Be ſober and temperate in all things, be chaſte, be juſt, honeſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; treat the characters and reputation of others with tenderneſs, and as true citizens of Zion, not take up a reproach againſt our neighbours. Children will obey their parents in the Lord, ſervants be obedient to their maſters in all things, not purloining, but uſing all fidelity, regarding the holy ſabbath and making a buſineſs of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſacred exerciſes thereof in God's ſanctuary, maintaining family religion, ſtatedly by offering up to God, morning and evening, the ſacrifices of prayer and praiſe, rendering honor to whom honor is due. Submitting to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, as the apoſtle exhorts, and leading quiet and peaceable lives in all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honeſty. If we are truely humbled under the mighty hand of God, ſuch will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of manners among us, as the natural conſequence of it. And if there is not ſuch a reformation, we can't be ſaid to be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God's mighty hand, nor may we expect to be exalted.

            <p>It is natural to deſire to be freed from evil and calamities, to be extricated out of public difficulties. And men are won't to be full of ſchemes and contrivances and moſt vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they may be ſo. But as there are ſuch a variety of circumſtances and events, that muſt concur in carrying them into execution, and as there are many circumſtances unforeſeen and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of, ſo they ſometimes prove abortive. Men of the greateſt penetration and ſagacity have failed in their expectations and purſuits. In evil, and calamitous times, it is no doubt duty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013388_0019_0F90950DFB8E42F8"/>
and endeavour after deliverance, and plain incumbent duty ought to be done. But then, neither individuals nor collective bodies of men can command the event. This is beyond their power, it is very plain from the manner of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in our text, that tho' it is our duty to humble ourſelves under God's mighty hand, yet the event is wholly with God, and that he will take his own way and time in cauſing it to take place. That <hi>he</hi> may exalt you, when? You deſire help and deliverance immediately, you think it beſt that it ſhould be had without any delay. But if you are exalted or delivered, not only muſt God bring it about but he will take his own time for it. <hi>In due time,</hi> the time the infinite wiſdom ſees fitteſt and beſt.</p>

               </gap>hem, ſo he is never backward to appear for their help and deliverance when they ſuitably and reverendly acknowledge him. As there is a moral cauſe for evils and calamities, which I have mentioned this day, even the ſins and tranſgreſſions of a people, ſo upon the foundation of reaſon and ſcripture the removal of them may only be expected when this cauſe is removed. Or as we may thus expreſs it. As the immoralities and vices of a people, cauſes God to lift up his mighty hand againſt them, and they are brought into great diſtreſs and perplexity, ſo as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>righteouſneſs exalteth a nation</hi> or people, repentance and reformation, and the practice of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013388_0020_0F90950ECD5521B8"/>
univerſal righteouſneſs, is the moſt likely method to take in order to their being exalted, delivered from evils and reſtored to a ſtate of eaſe, tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and public happineſs. Yea, it is repreſented in ſcripture, that repentance and reformation, is the way to keep off divine calamities, ſuch as a land lies expoſed to, &amp; which ſeems to be haſtening on, and to be continued in a proſperous &amp; happy ſtate. And ſo on the other hand, the impenitence &amp; indulged moral evils, were preventive of the good &amp; felicity, which God thought to confer upon it. Hence we have that of the prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> xviii. 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil: I will repent of the evil I thought to do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And at what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>IF, when it ſeems as tho' God's mighty hand, was juſt ready to fall upon them, to diſtreſs them, &amp; ven ruin &amp; deſtroy them, if the nation or people take the alarm, (as one obſerves) &amp; repent of their ſins, and reform their lives, turn every one from his evil way, and return to God, God will graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly accept them, will not proceed in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, will return in mercy to them, and tho' he cannot change his mind, he will change his way, ſo as that it may be ſaid, he repents him of the evil he ſaid he would do to them. Thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

in the time of the Judges, when the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people were penitent people, ſtill God raiſed them up Saviours, and when they turned to God, their affairs preſently took a new turn. And ſo if a nation or people whom God has loaded with benefits, do evil in his ſight, and obey not his voice, if it loſe its virtue, and become debauch'd and prophane, if religion grow into contempt, and vice get to be faſhionable, and ſo be kept in countenance and reputation, and there be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral decay of ſerious godlineſs among them, then God will turn his hand againſt them, will pluck up what he was planting, and pull down what he was building. What favours were further deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhall be withheld. That God hurried Iſrael back into the wilderneſs, when he had brought them within ſight of Canaan. Sin defeats Gods kind intentions concerning a people, baffles their pleaſing expectations from him. It ruins their comforts, prolongs their grievances, brings them into ſtraits, and retards their deliverance. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lix. 1, 2. <hi>Behold the Lord's hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot ſave: Neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</hi>

And accordingly it ſo happened <hi>God aw their works, that they turned rom their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Jonah iii, laſt verſe.</p>
            <p>AND I would juſt obſerve here, that we ſhall find for the moſt part beſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, that the faſts that were obſerved under the old teſtament, were ſo on account of evils impending, or brought on, through the righteouſanger of God for the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedneſſes and immoralities in one place and in another.</p>
            <p>THUS it was as to the faſt at Nineveh, we juſt made mention of. And thus it was as to the faſt obſerved in the days of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 36, 9. <hi>And it came to paſs in the fifth year of</hi> Jehoiakim <hi>&amp;c. That they proclaimed a faſt before the Lord to all the people in Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE occaſion of that day of faſting we have in the 6, &amp; 7. verſes. And ſo I might mention other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is plain from the inſtances mention'd, that they did not faſt for ſtrife or debate, or to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs, they did not do ſo from any ſiniſter views and deſigns, but they did ſo from the ſenſe of the anger of God that was out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, for the evils and abominations they had committed in his ſight. And this it is, ſuch a ſenſe of things as this, that only can give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013388_0023_0F909515C3604DB8"/>
to the obſervance of ſuch days now as well as formerly. And when days of faſting are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved after ſuch a manner it is a token for good, that God has favours in ſtore for the people.</p>
            <p>WE have obſerved that God has ſometimes averted impending evils, ſuch as a ſinful people have been imminently expoſed to, and had the utmoſt reaſon to expect, when they have repented and returned to him, as was the caſe with Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh. And it may from hence be fairly argued, that he is ready to remove evils and calamities, which are already felt, when God beholds them humbled under his mighty hand, repenting and returning to him. The great end of public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and calamities, is the repentance and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the nation and land who are viſited with them. And when this end is anſwered, may it not be expected that God will return to them in ways of favour and kindneſs, that he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do them good with all his heart, to ſmile upon them in all their intereſts and concerns, and make them a proſperous happy people. As pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic vices tend to draw down public calamities, ſo public vices and prevailing goodneſs tends to procure public bleſſings. So that to humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the mighty hand of God, is the moſt likely method to be exalted in due time, the time that infinite wiſdom thinks beſt: The all-wiſe God knows better when to appear for the help of a humbled, penitent, reformed people, and to extricate them out of their troubles and perplexities, than they can preſcribe to him. And when they have complied with his requirements
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013388_0024_0F909516ECB25648"/>
it is their wiſdom and their duty humbly to refer events to him, to order them out when and as he ſees fitteſt and beſt. To be in the hands of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom moſt certainly is to be in the beſt hands.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add here, what Moſes in God's name ſays to the people of Iſrael, after pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a variety of bleſſings upon them, upon their approving themſelves an obedient people. <hi>Deut.</hi> xxviii. from the 9th verſe, to the 14. <hi>The Lord ſhall eſtabliſh thee an holy people unto himſelf, if thou ſhall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. And all the people of the earth ſhall ſee that thou art called by the name of the Lord, and they ſhall be afraid of thee. And the Lord ſhall make thee plenteous in goods. The Lord ſhall open unto thee his good treaſure, the heavens to give the rain unto thy land in his ſeaſon, and to bleſs all the work of thine hand: And thou ſhalt lend unto many nations, and thou ſhalt not borrow. And the Lord ſhall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou ſhalt be above only and thou ſhalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I will no further enlarge here, but ſhall offer ſome things with plainneſs, and I truſt with ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, relative to the occaſion of the day, and agreable to the ſubject I have been diſcourſing upon. It is I ſuppoſe univerſally acknowledged to be a day of great public diſtreſs and difficulty, ſo as that we know not well what to do, nor how to extricate ourſelves.</p>

LET what will have been the inſtrumental or ſecondary cauſes, yet I truſt, you have all of you this ſenſe of things, that the great Governour of the world, in his over-ruling providence, has brought about ſuch a ſtate of things among us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or why do we appear before God in his houſe this day, to ſpread our caſe before him, and to ſupplicate the kind interpoſitions of his providence towards us? Is not the language of this day's ſolemnity this, that we look upon it, that the mighty hand of God is lifted up againſt us? That he has a controverſy with us? That we lie under his frowns and diſpleaſure? If we have not ſuch a ſenſe of matters as this, it would be trifling with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine majeſty, and indeed be a mockery of him, to come before him this day, in this manner. And as it is written, <hi>God will not be mocked.</hi> I ſhould be loth to entertain an opinion of any one who has deſired that ſuch a day might be obſerved, that it was from a party-ſpirit, but would charitably hope, that it was to do honour to the great Governour of the world, religiouſly to acknowledge him as ſuper-intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing human affairs, and accordingly to ſupplicate the gracious and powerful interpoſitions of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to relieve us from all our difficulties and diſtreſſes. And in this view of the caſe, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we are humbled under the mighty hand of God, and the ſolemnities of this day are followed with an univerſal repentance and reformation, we may hope that <hi>in due time</hi> God will exalt us, that he will relieve us of all our burdens and difficulties, and reſtore us to a ſtate of proſperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013388_0026_0F909517C77CD308"/>
Nor unleſs this is the caſe with us, may we upon any good and ſolid grounds, expect this. For as ſin is a reproach to a people, ſo it has a tendency, both naturally, and morally, to deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruin.</p>
            <p>As to religion, that, which is pure and undefiled before God and the Father, perhaps there has been as great a proportion of this in New-England, as in any part of the chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>THE fathers of this land were actuated from this noble principle in forſaking their native country, and their many near and dear connexions and fair inheritances, and enterpriſing the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this howling wilderneſs. Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in its true glory and luſtre, in the early times of this country. There was a great regard to the holy ſcriptures, a great regard to the holy ſabbaths and public worſhip: And they would go great diſtances willingly and chearfully, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be deprived of ſuch precious advantages and privileges. There was a great regard to family worſhip, inſtruction and government, there was much of kindneſs, brotherly-love and charity in thoſe puritanic times. And prophane curſing and ſwearing was a rare thing indeed, and many enormities and vicious practices, which have greatly obtained in modern times, were ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known among them. I don't mean to repreſent that generation as abſolutely perfect, for this is incompatible to the preſent ſtate. Nevertheleſs they were very generally, a very excellent ſet of men. And their names and their memories, as they have been, ſo will be in future generations
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013388_0027_0F9095188E41BFF0"/>
fragrant as the precious ointment. And the holy and righteous God own'd and honour'd them accordingly. That righteouſneſs, which was ſo conſpicuous among them, greatly exalted them. God was with them and for them, and who then could be againſt them? Verily none, and ſo it appeared, for by a variety of remarkable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of his providence, God drove out the heathen before them, prepared room for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they proſpered and increaſed under the ſmiles of heaven, and laid a broad foundation for thoſe that come after them to build upon. And a grand and noble ſuperſtructure has been raiſed upon it, as we ſee at this day: And particularly ſince the concluſion of the laſt war, in which the country of <hi>Canada,</hi> that was ſo long a ſcourge to us, ſince, I ſay, that country has been ſubjected to the Britiſh empire, what a ſurpriſing ſpread and increaſe has there been to the Engliſh terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories!</p>
            <p>THE primitive, religious conſtitution of this country was very excellent, and under the ſmiles and bleſſing of the God of grace, has been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly affectual to ſubſerve the ends of vital piety, and godlineſs, and the purpoſes of redeeming grace. We have had excellent means of liberal education, through the pious care of our anceſtors, our churches have greatly multiplied, and perhaps as great a proportion of able learned pious and faithful miniſters of the goſpel, as any part of the chriſtian world can boaſt of. And ſuch I doubt not they are at preſent, however lightly eſteemed of by ſome, and however ſome may be diſpoſed to diſtreſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013388_0028_0F909519700A4760"/>
them and reduce them to penurious circumſtances, to the great hindrance of the goſpel, as well as damage to the common-wealth. For however regardleſs many may be of the goſpel and the ſpiritual and everlaſting bleſſings of it, yet it ſeems to be the general opinion that the chriſtian miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is an excellent inſtitution, conſidered only in a civil and political light. And I would juſt ſay further here; that if it was wholly ſuppreſſed and baniſhed the land, we ſhould be in a ſituation not far ſuperior to that of the aboriginal natives.</p>
            <p>WE have had an excellent civil conſtitution, good and wholſome laws, the due execution of which, have produced the moſt ſalutary, and beneficial effects. At preſent, this people are thrown into great diſtreſs and perplexity thro' the operation of certain <hi>acts</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> legiſlature, impoſing duties and taxes upon them, which, if the right it claims ſhould be granted, yet muſt be looked upon by all, as contrary to the principles of ſound policy, conſidering the intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parent ſtate and the Colonies, and the vaſt commercial intereſt maintained between them to their mutual benefit and advantage.</p>
            <p>VERY ſad is the preſent ſituation of our <hi>capital town,</hi> blocked up by a powerful ſquadron, to the cramping it's navigation and commerce, and to the impoveriſhment and diſtreſs of multitudes. And this diſtreſs that has befallen it, muſt have it's influence upon the whole community. If the <hi>head</hi> ſuffers, the <hi>members</hi> muſt in many reſpects ſuffer with it.—May God afford deliverance in due time, and give us occaſion to rejoice in the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013388_0029_0F90951A00029FE0"/>
kind interpoſitions of his providence in removing this and every other difficulty and grievance! For we ought to bear this in mind, that our main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance in the caſe is upon his over-ruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. We are not to truſt in an arm of fleſh, but in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength. Unto him are we to pray,—and unto him muſt we return,—that he may return in favour to us. <hi>Turn us again, O God of hoſts, cauſe thy face to ſhine; and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> It is at preſent, as has been ſaid, a time of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and diſtreſs. But are we to look altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the dark ſide of things? Is there no bright ſide to turn to? Yes verily, there is. Thus, it is a remarkable time of health throughout the land: We hear of no contagious, mortal ſickneſs prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any where: We have not this ſeaſon been viſited with ſcorching droughts, with devouring inſects. We have had the refreſhing rains and ſhines of heaven, and the fruits of the earth neceſſary for the ſupport of man and beaſts, were perhaps never in a more flouriſhing ſtate, nor a better proſpect of a plentiful increaſe.</p>
            <p>WE yet enjoy our quiet ſabbaths, and chriſtian inſtitutions, the day and the means of grace. And ſo I might mention many other favours and bleſſings of heaven. So that notwithſtanding all our difficulties and grievances, yet our ſtate is not abſolutely forlorn and deſperate. We have a bright ſide to look to, and ought to look to it; we have great reaſon for thankfulneſs to the great Governour of the world, at the ſame time that we have much cauſe for humiliation before him
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013388_0030_0F90951E46326918"/>
conſidering the moral grounds and reaſons of this controverſy with us.</p>
            <p>WE are deſirous of being extricated out of all our difficulties, and enjoying public good and happineſs of every kind. Now the ſubject I have been diſcourſing upon, directs us to the moſt effectual method to betake ourſelves to, in order to this. The way to be exalted, is to humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of God. All ſchemes and plans that may be laid, all endeavours that may be uſed, are not of that importance, nor will they be likely to be ſo efficacious, as ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friendſhip, the guardian-ſhip and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the God of heaven, who has all events and all hearts in his hands, and who can in the moſt ſurprizing, unexpected manner, ſcatter dark clouds, change the face of things, bring good out of evil, and open a fair, bright and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, turn our mourning into dancing, put off our ſackcloth and gird us with gladneſs. O! what a great thing is it, to have the omnipotent God engage on the ſide of a people! Every thing then muſt go well with them in ſpite of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and oppoſitions. For <hi>there is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi> Prov 21, 30.</p>
            <p>THERE is none that can avail any thing any more than for a worm to pretend to cope with a Lion.</p>
            <p>BUT in order that we may enjoy the friendſhip of God and be under his ſmiles and bleſſings, we muſt on our part be in friendſhip with him. And then only are we ſo, when we are brought
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013388_0031_0F9095209E54C928"/>
to that repentance and reformation that we have ſpoken of this day. This verily is of very great importance in regard of God's glory, and as we would conſult our own good and proſperity even at preſent. O that there were ſuch an heart in us all, and in this whole people, that we may humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt us in due time. If vice and wickedneſs, eſpecially in all its groſſer forms was ſuppreſſed, and piety and virtue, righteouſneſs, temperance, charity &amp;c. were generally to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the midſt of us, what a token for good would this be! We might then ſecurely depend upon God's kind care and protection, and that his bleſſing would be upon us in all regards. But now, inſtead of the prevalence of theſe duties and virtues, is it not too evident, that we are <hi>a people laden'd with iniquity,</hi> notwithſtanding all the goodneſs of God that he has manifeſted to us, and notwithſtanding all his frowns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, which by our iniquities we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured?</p>
            <p>CAN it be ſaid that the troubles, perplexities and difficulties of the preſent day have produced a general repentance and reformation of manners? May it not be truly ſaid, that the luſts and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of many have greatly and unhappily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, which inſtead of diminiſhing have very much increaſed our troubles! What jealouſies and reſentments have been entertained among old friends, neighbours and relatives? What hard and opprobrious names have been given to one another! What a diſpoſition to raiſe
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013388_0032_0F909520C1BD9268"/>
and propagate falſe reports without regarding the miſchievous conſequences of them! Yea, what wrath and malice, bitterneſs, clamour and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeaking has there been! How much horrible prophaneſs and impiety has there been, to the diſhonour of God, to the eating out the very vitals of religion, the religion of the bleſſed Jeſus, which breaths a quite different ſpirit, and tending alſo to the deſtruction of the very form of it.</p>
            <p>SUCH evils as theſe, alas! how greatly prevalent have they been in theſe days, in which the mighty hand of God has been lifted up againſt us! Nor is his anger turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill. It is far from being agreable to me, in itſelf conſidered, to enumerate the evils of the times, but I ſhould not be faithful if I did not. And all who are themſelves conſcientious, muſt approve of faithfulneſs in others.</p>
            <p>I WOULD now offer a few things by way of counſel, hoping they will be received and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically regarded.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, let every one ſearch and try his own heart and ways, humble himſelf before God, implore forgiveneſs through Chriſt, and grace for the future, to live in a holy, obedient manner. If it ſhould be thus with every one, then reformation would be general And in this caſe we might hope to be highly exalted.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>LET it be the care of every one to get poſſeſſed of a ſpirit of charity and brotherly kindneſs. This is of very great importance to the comfort and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of ſocieties, both the greater and the leſs.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013388_0033_0F909521E0F9B238"/>
For where there is contention, there is confuſion and every evil work. In almoſt all matters, civil, ſecular and religious, a diverſity of ſentiments takes place amongſt mankind. It is in vain to expect, that in all things they will be of the ſame mind and of the ſame judgment. And therefore a great deal of forbearance, candour, condeſcenſion, meekneſs and charity is neceſſary. Perſons may and ought to be good neighbours and friends, and to treat one another as brethren, however they may be of different opinions from one another in many matters.</p>
            <p>BROTHERLY kindneſs and charity, as it is a great chriſtian duty, ſo it is the beauty, ſtrength and glory of ſocieties. It tends greatly to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate burdens and to ſweeten life. I ſhall only juſt add her, the fine and beautiful deſcription of charity in the 1<hi>ſt</hi> epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth</hi> 13<hi>th</hi> chap. 4. 8. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ANOTHER thing I would mention, relative to the obſervation of this day. Some may not ſee their way clear to obſerve it, it not being enjoin'd in the uſual way.<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The obſervation of this day was not, as uſual, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation from the civil authority. It appears that the late Houſe of Repreſentatives applied to his Excellency Governor GAGE that a public faſt might be appointed. But at his Excellency was not pleaſed to comply with ſaid motion; it was voted in the houſe, that the Repreſentatives upon their return home, apply to their reſpective Pariſh Miniſters that ſuch a day might be obſerved. Having been applied to according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and finding upon laying it before the congregation in this place, which I th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'t but a juſt reſpect to them notwithſtanding ſaid application, and perceiving that it was very generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, the day was obſerved. And I have the pleaſure to declare that there was not the leaſt diſorder upon ſaid day. Many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable perſons who did not ſee ſo clearly into the propriety of it, yet being unwilling to give offence to their neighbours and brethren, laid aſide all their ſecular concerns, and with but few exceptions attended the public exerciſes. And I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare, that ſo far as I had opportunity to obſerve among my people, the principle that ſeemed to govern them, was not an oppoſition to government, but from a ſenſe they profeſſed to have of the frowns of heaven upon us, and the propriety of imploring God's gracious and powerful interpoſition.</hi>
               </note> Now as no one is under
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013388_0034_0F90952242BFB088"/>
any compulſion in the caſe, ſo I would earneſtly adviſe that there may be no hard and ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections caſt upon any, and that there be no uncivil, indecent conduct towards any upon the occaſion. Let there be nothing inconſiſtent with the character of men and chriſtians. This will doubtleſs be productive of the moſt ſalutary and comfortable effects. Again,</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to thoſe that have been deſirous of the obſervation of this day, (and this ſeems to be very general) I would ſay that you ought to regard it as unto the Lord. Do not you hereby profeſs to do honour to the great Governor of the world, to expreſs your unworthineſs before him, your dependance upon him, to acknowledge and bewail your ſins which have occaſioned him to lift up his mighty hand, and to bring us into difficulties and diſtreſſes, to implore his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the return of his favour. Thoſe that
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013388_0035_0F9095230C55A378"/>
are ſincere and hearty in all this, may upon good grounds hope and expect that God will accept them therein. You mean the ſolemnity of this day, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren! or the attendance upon it, as an act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Now won't you all of you carry the religion of this day into your families? Won't you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as your duty, beſides joining in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers of the ſanctuary, to offer up your prayers and ſupplications to the divine majeſty in your houſes, for thoſe favours and bleſſings from him that are peculiarly needed in the preſent day, and which we have publickly ſpread before God? Or does this day's obſervance compleat the whole affair?</p>
            <p>MAY it not juſtly be expected by God himſelf that a genuine repentance and reformation will follow this days ſolemnity? ſhall it be ſaid that any after this go on in prophaneſs, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, unchaſtity, in fraud and oppreſſion, in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, wrath, malice, anger, diſhoneſty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, ſabbath breaking, neglecting the public worſhip of God? Shall it be ſaid after this, that there are any more prayerleſs families, that live like heathens, not calling upon the name of the Lord? I muſt ſpeak freely and faithfully here, that I fear that there are a great many pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erleſs families among you, and I muſt earneſtly expoſtulate with you upon this head. Why will you thus live without God in the world? Are you afraid or aſhamed to acknowledge your Maker and daily benefactor? Can you live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, live independant on him? You ſurely will not acknowledge this, unleſs your are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013388_0036_0F909523C8BE9620"/>
Atheiſts. But I am well perſwaded that none of you are of this abandoned claſs of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. You acknowledge, all of you, I preſume that there is a God, and that you are abſolutely dependant upon him for public, perſonal and family bleſſings. And will you not then erect an altar for him in your houſes, whereon to offer religious ſacrifices daily, morning and evening? How can you expect the bleſſing of God upon your perſons or families, if you neglect having any concern with him in the way I have now mentioned? I muſt earneſtly exhort ſuch as have hitherto neglected family worſhip, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet it up, and not to make a bye buſineſs of it, but conſtantly to attend it. Conſider what you owe to your children. They are committed to your care not only to provide for their outward welfare and comfort, but to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And is it likely that they will have any ſenſe of God or religion if they ſee their parents live in the neglect of ſuch a plain incumbent duty, as that of family-worſhip is? And will no religion, the moſt important thing in the world, be loſt among the riſing generation if you go on in ſuch a neglect? I hope what I have now ſaid upon this matter will be ſeriouſly laid to heart by thoſe of you to whom it is eſpecially applicable. And may it pleaſe God to render it effectual to bring about a reformation in this matter! And I would juſt add in a word, that it will ill become thoſe to live in the neglect of family-worſhip, who have diſcovered a zeal, that this day of faſting
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013388_0037_0F90F4ADEBCAD4A8"/>
and prayer be obſerved on account of our public difficulties.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now cloſe all with briefly ſaying. That while you are in ſuch anxiety reſpecting your civil liberties, it infinitely concerns you, that you be in earneſt that you may have a ſhare in the glorious liberties and privileges of the children of God. Civil liberty it is acknowledged is a moſt valuable enjoyment. And what all are earneſtly deſirous of the enjoyment of. And as every one is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of it for himſelf, ſo every one ought to be willing that his neighbour ſhould enjoy it. But is it acting a conſiſtent part to viliſy and reproach others, becauſe they take that liberty which God and nature have given them to think and ſpeak differently from them? No one can ſoberly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this. No doubt all aim at the ſame thing, whatever difference there may be in opinion and conduct. Let us remember, Brethren! That the preſent ſcene will quickly be cloſed upon us. And we ſhall have no more any concern with the affairs, and tranſactions of the preſent ſtate. And if we get to heaven, as God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy thro' Chriſt grant we all may, we ſhall there be all of one heart and ſoul There harmony, love and peace will univerſally take place. There we ſhall enjoy liberty of the right ſort, be eternally free from the bondage of Satan and our own corruptions, and all the penal effects of them, and love God, and love one another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and ſincerely, and with the utmoſt freedom and chearfulneſs, ſerve and glorify God and the Lamb throughout eternal ages.</p>
