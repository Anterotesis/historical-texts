            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> of twenty-one, he took the command of a ſhip in the India trade, the cargo of which was conſigned to an Engliſh merchant, at CANTON, by the name of Negotio, he arrived ſafe at the Port, and delivered his charge to the merchant, who in return, ſhipped on board ſuch goods as he was directed to, by the owner. While theſe things were carrying on, Negotio took his country man Pariſmas to his houſe, where he was introduced to his lady.—Pariſmas was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment at the ſight, beauty's perfections were all diſplayed, her eyes out ſhone the diamond, the ruby was rival'd by her lips, the roſe faded when compared with the vivid colour of her cheeks, alabaſter loſt its whiteneſs when compared with her ſnowy boſom, her hair of a darkiſh brown hung in ringling treſſes over her ſhoulders, her ſhape was the moſt exquiſite that imagination can paint, ſhe was decorated in her habit in all the magnif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icence and pride of the eaſt,</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:034307_0004_0FFD7EC0FA0F9A08"/>
She received Pariſmas, with all that elegance of ſpeech and geſture, which the height of female accompliſhments and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements are capable of inſpiring: Pariſmas was at firſt loſt in wonder, and was for a while totally incapable of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any kind of compliments, at length he recovred in accents ſcarcely articulate, made as good a return as his ſituation was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of admitting, but further acquaintance, though it by no means leſſened his eſteem of her: yet it gradually dimiſhed the awe with which he was at firſt confounded, 'till he could ſtedfaſtly behold her without being confuſſed with her charms.</p>
            <p>His buſineſs being compleated, Pariſmas took an affectionate farewell of Negotio, but infinitely more ſo of the all accompliſhed lady, who by this time had unintentionally made herſelf perfect maſter of his heart and affections. He left Canton, and embarked for London; ſleepleſs nights and joyleſs days were by turns the melancholy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of his voyage home, he returned ſafely, much to the ſatisfaction of his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers, who aſſoon as circumſtances would admit, ſent him again to the ſame place on a ſimilar errand: after a cuſtomary courſe he arrived ſafely at Canton again. The ſight or the place reanimated every idea of his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088"/>lovely lady, for whoſe ſake only he could wiſh to live, though his ideas of chaſteical honour forbid his expecting or ever deſiring to enjoy her.</p>
            <p>He landed and directed his courſe to the Houſe of Negotio, who received him with that genteel ceremony which the moſt refined in manners make uſe of to thoſe they hold moſt dear, the ſame pleaſed vivacity ſparkled in his countenance, which Pariſmas had formerly obſerved ſeated there, and he experienced every mark of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity as well as affability which Negotio had made uſe of on former occaſions, every thing in his houſe appeared with the ſame grandeur and life as was uſual, but to the great mortification of our Captain, his ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable angel was not to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>He aſked no queſtions, ſuppoſing ſhe was abſent on a viſit to ſome friend, at night he retired, but the moſt diſmal forebodings that ſome dire fatality had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen her; at the return of morning, he again purſued the proſecution of his buſineſs, and again waited on Negotio, and for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days ſucceſſively, dined at his table, but with the moſt cutting mortification at not having the ſatisfaction of once beholding this admirable lady, or ever once hearing her name mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088"/>
At the expiraton of which time having his cargo all on board, &amp; a favourable wind preſenting, he went to take his leave of Negotio, who, with the warmeſt expreſſions of friendſhip, was about wiſhing a pleaſant and agreeable paſſage home, when Pariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, whoſe heart ſuffered the moſt vexing anxiety to have ſome information with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Negotio's lady, thus addreſſed him, Dear Sir, you appear poſſeſſed of the ſame tranquil diſpoſition which always ornament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and your circumſtances in life ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you a proper object of envy, yet there is one inquiry which labours in my ſwelling boſom, which I am no longer able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, I hope therefore you will be ſo good as to pardon me, when I inquire after your amiable lady, as ſhe has been abſent theſe ſeventeen days; and I have not once heard her named: Is ſhe living, or is ſhe dead, or abſent? his emotion of heart was ſo great that it was plainly perceivable by his uncommon accents. The undiſturbed Negotio calmly replied, ſhe is at home ſir. May I be indulged with taking leave of her? ſaid Pariſmas. O yes, reply'd Ngotio, I will introduce you to her if you deſire it, but at the ſame time, as a friend, I adviſe you not to truſt your curioſity too far, as the fight of her may not produce thoſe agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034307_0006_0FFD7E9799682298"/>ſenſations as you may now imagine. O Heavens! ſaid he, with your leave I muſt ſee her, my veneration for her is ſo great, that no conſideration whatever can prevent my ſeeing her, when in my power. Well, ſaid Negotio, your wiſhes ſhall be gratified, but if you have in conſequence thereof any diſagreeable ſenſations, you will be ſo good as to blame your own curioſity therefor, and acquit your friend. But however, I think it would be better for you not to think any more on the ſubject, but depart in peace. Pariſmas whoſe anxiety every moment aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in a geometrical proportion, replied, ſir, urge that matter no further I beſeech you—I am in torment—diſtracted, in the name of friendſhip, I conjure you delay me no longer. Friendſhip, reply'd Negotio forbids my gratifying you—I have ſuch a regard for your peace of mind that I again warmly recommend to give over a deſign which cannot fail of putting your mind in ſuch a ſtate, as will be very remote from the ſmalleſt ideas of ſatisfaction. Pariſmas replied, the more you endeavour to diſſuade me, the more anxious I am, and I do conjure you, by every principle of friendſhip, to hold me in this cruel ſuſpence no longer, your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe has raiſed my curioſity to ſuch a pitch, that I am to be delay'd no longer. Well,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034307_0006_0FFD7E9799682298"/>ſaid Negotio, you ſhall be gratified, follow me, ſo quitting the room, they paſſed a back parlour, on the back ſide of which, he unlocked a door, that introduced them into a long, narrow, dark and foul room, at the extreme part of which lay a corpſe partly devoured, the ſight of which, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the nauſeous ſcent which it produced, filled poor Pariſmas with an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror unknown to him before. Negotio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to unlock a door in the back ſide of this hideous department, from which iſſued the moſt wretched object that ever ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified the eyes of mortals, it was the wife of Negotio, but what a dreadful, horific meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſe! not a ſingle trace was left of her former ſelf; inſtead of thoſe beautiful charms with which ſhe was formerly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the moſt frightful viſage that imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation can depict, preſented itſelf—Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>She diſcovered every evidence of the moſt extreme anguiſh, horror and diſpair, her diſtorted looks were the emblem of rage and diſtreſs, ſcarcely containing any thing human, the whole decorated with a ſpecies of naſtineſs which ſerved to make the ſpectacle ſtill more horrid, while a hideous
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034307_0007_0FFD7EA4E16DC510"/>grin compleated the doleful appearance of her face. Round which hung the diſhevelled remains of that hair, which was once an ornament to her head.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had ſhe entered the room, but regardleſs both of her huſband and Pariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, ſhe ran with all the haſte her enfeebled ſtate of body would admit, to the place where lay the waſting corpſe, which ſhe fell to devouring with all the eagerneſs which hunger is capable of inſpiring, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the putrified fleſh with her teeth from the bones.

            <p>With a heart confounded with amazement, Pariſmas took leave of Negotio, repaired to his ſhip, ſcarcely realizing were he was, or what he was about.

Pariſmas made the rope faſt round his middle, and giving the end to the ſeamen, was by them let down into the room where ſhe was confined, be reached the bottom, groped round in the dark, he at laſt ſtumbled over the wretched object of his reſearch, he fell acroſs her, and his head ſtruck the floor, the noiſe of which, with the blow ſhe received awoke her in a fright; a ſcreech announced to Pariſmas that ſhe was no longer in a ſleep: He prevented her ſecond outcry by ſaying, <q>Dear lady, I am come to liberate you from this wretched place of confinement; ſubmit yourſelf to my direction, and you ſhall once more enjoy that liberty, from which you are now debarred; aſk me no queſtion, but if you deſire to gain your freedom, and once more be happy, let me make this rope faſt around you.</q> The lady loſt in extacy,

            <p>With all the ſpeed they were capable of, they deſcended to the ground, paſſed out of the yard, and the ſeamen taking up the lady, conveyed her ſafely on board of Pariſma's ſhip, and depoſited her ſafely in the captain's cabbin.</p>
            <p>Pariſmas called all hands upon deck, they weighed anchor, hoiſted fail, and having a favorable wind, a fair night, a full uncloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moon, in a few hours they loſt ſight of the light, which was erected on the outward point, which formed the harbour.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034307_0009_0FFD7EC297335C90"/>it is with the greateſt ſenſations of pleaſure when I reflect that I have been the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of delivering you from a ſituation, to which none of the human race were ever reduced: it is no part of my buſineſs to enquire what was the cauſe of that treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I am ſure you could not deſerve. My regards for you were ſo great that I had rather have riſked any thing than not have relieved you. You are now ſat at liberty, I will convey you to England, where you ſhall be totally ſecure from your perſecutor, and if providence makes it neceſſary, you ſhall want for nothing while I have any property left. I ſhall order that you have a ſuitable aſſortment of apparel brought you directly, together with ſuitable proviſion, for your diſengaging yourſelf from every thing diſagreeable about you."</p>
            <p>By this time the cabin boy had provided ſome ſuitable nouriſhment for her, which ſhe with due caution ſwallowed, and then proceeded to diveſt herſelf of her priſon apparel, and decked herſelf in a ſumptuous atti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement, which Pariſmas had prepared for her.</p>
            <p>After ſhe had waſhed herſelf, &amp;c. Pariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's barber dreſſed her head, and ſhe once more was ornamented with Jewels, diamonds and rings, and diſcovered many of thoſe
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034307_0010_0FFD7EA1F73D1148"/>charms which formerly ſhone in full luſtre in her countenance, and appeared once more in many reſpects to be an object of admiration.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Pariſmas coming into the cabin, took a ſeat by the lady, whoſe aſpect by this time had recovered much of its native ſerenity, with a look full of gratitude, ſhe caſt her eyes on her deliverer, and with as much compliſance as her ſtate would admit of, thus addreſſed him, "Moſt dear and benevolent ſir," it will be forever beyond the reach of my ability to make you any kind of ſatisfaction, for the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable favor you have done me, and the ſtrongeſt language is infinitely too feeble to expreſs the ſenſations of gratitude, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy my ſick heaving boſom: All I can ſay, is, that all I have, together with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I now dedicate to you, and your ſervice, diſpoſe of me as you think proper; I am willing—more than willing—I wiſh to be your bond ſlave while I have a breath to draw. But, if being your ſlave is too great a favor to grant (which I allow is the caſe) diſpoſe of, and fell me for life, to whom you ſee fit. She ended, and Pariſmas ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a ſilent tear ſtealing involuntarily down her cheek, and he fancied he ſaw ſomething ſtruggling in her boſom, which her greateſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034307_0010_0FFD7EA1F73D1148"/>exertions could not wholly conceal: he ſtood ſilent a few moments to obſerve the conflict, he then broke ſilence, and ſaid, "fair lady, I conjure you, to ſmother in your breaſt no longer, what you wiſh to reveal; your happy ſituation is ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that my impatience tortures me to know what thoſe ideas or reflections are, which ſo agitate your heaving boſom." Dear ſir, replied the lady, it is no eaſy or pleaſant piece of buſineſs to relate to you, the cauſe of my misfortune, which I know myſelf only by conjecture—Nineteen days ago, my huſband and myſelf roſe in the morning as uſual, we ſat down at the table, drank our chocolate, and I imagined that an unuſual pleaſantneſs was ſeated in his countenance, and good nature in his breaſt, we chatted away an hour at table, in the moſt agreeable manner, he then aroſe, gave me a kind ſalute, and with a look of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, left me, and repaired to the yard, at the back of the houſe, where ſome affairs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his preſence.

When he returned, he entered into a very familiar diſcourſe on her ſituation, enquiring if ſhe had no idea of any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, which might give riſe to thoſe ſuſpicions in her huſband's breaſt, which induced him to that conduct, in her anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſhe informed him ſhe was totally ignorant of any thing more than ſhe had told him in her relation before, and her ſincerity appeared to be ſuch, as gave Pariſmas no reaſon to doubt of her veracity.</p>
            <p>Pariſmas continued to conduct himſelf towards her with all poſſible politeneſs, and with particular care, and ſaw that ſhe wanted for nothing that could conduce to her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and notwithſtanding the dreadful ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe was in, before they reached Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhe had perfectly recovered whatever ſhe had loſt by the barbarous treatment of her huſband; brightneſs again ſparkled with additional brilliancy in her eyes, the roſe again bloomed in her cheeks, her ſkin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſumed its fairneſs, and ſhe was once more an object which could not be beheld without admiration.</p>
            <p>One evening as they ſat together in the cabin, after ſome agreeable diſcourſe, he interrogated her whether ſhe conſidered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under any kind of obligation to her
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034307_0013_0FFD7EB5DB6D7430"/>huſband or not, on account of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage covenant between them.</p>
            <p>The Lady replied, that notwithſtanding the ſolemnity of marriage contracts, and the great attention with which he had always treated her until the late unheard of tranſaction, that though, till that time no woman was ever bleſſed with a better, kinder, or more loving huſband, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et ſhe had not the leaſt doubt, but that ſuch an open and unprovoked violation of the marriage covenant, muſt in the nature of things, totally abſolve her from every degree of obligation which ſhe laid herſelf under, when ſhe entered thereinto. Pariſmas then infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her, if ſhe conſidered herſelf at her own diſpoſal, and had no objections for exchanging a ſingle life, for a matrimonial one, if her late treatment had not diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged her from again truſting her perſon in the hands of one of that ſex who had miſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, he would make an offer of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to her, and that, if it was agreeable to her, on their arrival at England, they would join their hands at the altar of Hymen.</p>
            <p>The lady, with looks tool of aſtoniſhment and ſweetneſs, in accents which diſcovered the fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moſt admirable goddeſs of ſincere adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, replied Pariſmas, you injure me when you ſuppoſe I have a tongue which is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of ſpeaking a language foreign from my heart; diſſimulation forms no part of my character, and I can eaſily acquit you of believing the ſuggeſtion which you have manifeſted, I only conceive that my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal does not meet your approbation, and that you have made choice of this genteel method of ſignifying your diſinclination to comply therewith; but a perſon whoſe heart is undergoing thoſe torments, which now take full poſſeſſion of my wretched boſom, is not to be put off by irony or any oblique pretence. I muſt have my doom categori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally pronounced by your lips before I give up the object, which is the great pole ſtar of my affections, ſo you will proceed to declare me the happieſt of mortals, or the moſt miſerable of any of the human ſpecies, according as you wiſh well or ill. The

Heavens! is it poſſible, that the man whom, ſince firſt I ſaw him, I prized above mortals, and whoſe benevolence has ſnatched me from the moſt loathſome, diſtreſſing and periſhing condition, has notwithſtanding all my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, vouchſafed to offer me the nuptial hand!

            <p>Every effort was made uſe of to reſtore her to her ſenſes, which at laſt proved ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, but the moſt apparent dejection was ſeated on her countenance, and in vain was every method uſed to eraſe from her mind the memory of him; to no purpoſe, was ſhe informed of the King's intention towards her, the gaudy tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For a week ſhe remained in an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034307_0023_0FFD7E8A97DD7388"/>ſtate, when her invention ſuggeſted to her a probability of once more meeting with her admired Alcander, (for that was his name) and ſhe immediately formed a reſolution of putting the ſcheme in execution. In order to effect which, ſhe procured a ſuit of Seaman's apparel, with which ſhe attired herſelf. With this habit ſhe entered on board a veſſel as a common Seaman, hoping by this means to meet with him whom ſhe prized more than all the riches in the world.</p>
            <p>It is foreign from my preſent deſign, to give a particular detail of what the poor Roſilla paſſed through on board of the veſſel under the name of Evander, and of what hardſhips ſhe experienced in a long and fruitleſs ſearch after her beloved Alcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſuffice it to ſay, that ſhe acquited her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo honourably, that ſhe became the ſecond commander in the veſſel on the death of her predeceſſor, in which ſtation ſhe poſſeſſed the higheſt degree of the confidence of all who were on board the veſſel, but what amazement and horror ſeized not only Roſilla, but the Captain, and the whole crew; one fair and pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In this confuſed ſituation they held a conſultation, the reſult of which was, to make as good a defence as they could, and knowing that fortune favours the brave; they reſted only on this ground, that there was a poſſibility of avoiding being captured by this mercileſs pirate.</p>
            <p>By the time this was agreed on, the ſhip was along ſide of them, when a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attack was begun by the pirate, and an obſtinate defence by the other. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never was more valour diſcovered than by this little band of heroes; 'till at length being overpowered, their Captain ſlain, and above half their men killed and wounded, they were boarded by the aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Priſoners were indiſcriminately hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on board of the Pirate, and huddled in below the deck, while the captors were buſily employed in plundering their new acquired booty.
