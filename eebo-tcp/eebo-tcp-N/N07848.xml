            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Defence of the Halifax Letter, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE editor of the Halifax letter hath, with much ſerenity and compoſure, attended to the illiberal oppoſition, and multiplied abuſe, which he and that pamphlet have received, from various quarters. He was willing to wait the laſt efforts of his malignant adverſaries, before he attempted a reply. Their rage, at length, ſeems to be near ſpent, and the troubled ſea of controverſy hath again almoſt ſubſided. He therefore ventures, once more, to embark upon it; and is deſirous, for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as well as for the example of his antagoniſts, to conduct himſelf with all poſſible decency and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. Thus, when a calm ſucceeds a ſtorm, we revolve in our minds the paſt tumult, and cooly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the confuſion it occaſioned.</p>
            <p>In order to juſtify the Halifax gentleman's letter, it is neceſſary to premiſe, that Great-Britain, during the late war, had laviſhed the blood of her ſubjects, and ſpent immenſe ſums, as well for the ſecurity of the colonies, as her own importance and dignity. A few years ago, when Oſwego and fort William-Henry were taken, no one can forget, that theſe colonies
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010012_0003_0F7B985042DCFC88"/>
were ſo terrified and alarmed, that they would gladly have conſented to have made even Albany the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, between the French and them: But, through the ſmiles of heaven, and the unanimity and bravery of the Britiſh councils and arms, the enemy were at laſt brought to terms, and the colonies ſecured, and made happy by a peace. The government, in purſuing ſuch meaſures as it thought neceſſary, to preſerve the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from future invaſions and attacks, became obliged to keep up a large body of troops, cantoned in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different parts of the continent. Already plunged in debt, to almoſt an incredible amount, and availing itſelf of every expedient, however burdenſome, to raiſe ſupplies from its diſtreſſed ſubjects in Great-Britain; it was judged reaſonable and equitable to draw ſome advantages from the trade of its colonies, in order to raiſe a fund for the maintenance and ſupport of thoſe troops, thus employed for our protection. An act of parliament, levying ſome impoſitions, was made; and we were given to underſtand, that the miniſtry were meditating ſuch further taxes as the exigence of things might require, and ſuch as might, at the ſame time, be leaſt burdenſome to us: Nevertheleſs, here it was, a diſcontent firſt began to appear, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the adminiſtration was arraigned, by many, with all the petulance of children, who, by long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, become impatient of the ſmalleſt reſtraints.</p>
            <p>From cenſuring the act of parliament, as uſeleſs and oppreſſive, the humour afterwards took a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent turn; and we were ſoon told by many, that the parliament of Great-Britain had no conſtitutional right, no authority, <hi>de jure,</hi> as ſome expreſſed it, to bind us by any act of their making, becauſe we were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010012_0004_0F7B9850F17B82D0"/>Ignorance and conceit firſt promulged this doctrine; and as it flattered the pride and ſelf-love of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is no wonder its progreſs hath been ſo rapid and ſucceſsful. To ſpread the folly and miſchief ſtill more, numberleſs pamphlets and pieces in news-papers were publiſhed, in which the parent country and its adminiſtration have been treated in the moſt contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious and irreverent manner.</p>
            <p>As the editor hath been charged with falſhood and miſrepreſentation in theſe aſſertions, he here begs leave, in the firſt place, to bring together, in one view, ſeveral extracts from theſe pamphlets and news-papers alluded to, that the public may judge for themſelves, whether his aſſertions are well founded.</p>
            <p>In a Providence news-paper of Auguſt 18, 1764, Great-Britain is treated with the greateſt mockery and deriſion; and in the ſtile and manner of a fanatick exhorter, the writer begins with this text: "In St. JAMES's, you will find theſe words, MOTHER COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRY." In the courſe of this exhortation, the preacher names a certain nobleman of the board of trade, that, a few years ago, (he ſays) enquired "if New-England was an iſland." This is a low, ſcandalous, legendary tale, purpoſely invented to bring contempt and odium upon the adminiſtration. He ſays, <q>It muſt look like a direct deſign of <hi>enſlaving</hi> us, to talk of the infinite obligation and debt, we are under to Old-England, for proſecuting a war here; and how ſubſervient we ought to be to particular intereſts in Britain, in conſideration thereof. When <hi>certain deſigns</hi> are to be anſwered, <hi>dark words and phraſes</hi> ſuit beſt, which really, without ſenſe or meaning, if properly ſounded and echoed, become ſacred, and effectual machines for bringing about the purpoſe,</q>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010012_0005_0F7B98522E679BB0"/>
i. e. to enſlave the colonies. Again, <q>Hath the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England been at any expence in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colonies of New-England? No. Is one farthing balance due to them, in the whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, from the firſt planting of New-England, to this time? No.</q>—The tendency of all this, is manifeſtly to degrade the mother country, to raiſe ſuſpicions and jealouſies againſt her, and to blot out of the colonies every trace of duty and gratitude.— Again he ſays, he <q>could mention many inſtances of treaſons and rebellions in a certain mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</q> It ſeems a general opinion here, that there can be no rebellion unleſs the pretender is concerned in it.—Again he ſays, <q>the late acts, clogging our trade, are unnatural, highly injurious, and not very motherly. The northern colonies have been moſt infamouſly belied, ſcandalized, and injuriouſly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by a number of ignorant and envious officers in the army and navy,</q> &amp;c.—What reaſon can there poſſibly be, that ſhould make the gentlemen of the army or navy envious againſt the colonies? The ſlander againſt them is groundleſs and malicious. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, more ſtrong than traytors arms,</hi> hath ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up all remembrance of their ſervices. Such are the breathings of our piety to thoſe who have bled for our deliverance.</p>
            <p>The Boſton gazette of the 24th September, 1764, contains a publication, in which are theſe words: <q>I know not what wiſe meaſures Mr. Gr—nv—l's political genius may ſuggeſt, for the benefit of the colonies; but I would fain whiſper in his ear, that there are millions of Britiſh ſubjects in America, who have a warm ſenſe of liberty: Many of them have as much underſtanding as he himſelf has, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010012_0006_0F7B9852A0706D98"/>
have acquired as thorough a knowledge of the Britiſh conſtitution, and the rights of Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as he. They ſmile at the <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>nonſenſe</hi> of him and others, who fancy that American ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are not intitled to all the rights of native Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. They have never forfeited thoſe rights; and therefore cannot, nay, they <hi>will not,</hi> conſent to part with them.</q> Mr. Grenville, here maliciouſly pointed at, is at the head of the treaſury; and, to his vigilance and great merit, the nation is much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted ever ſince he preſided there: Yet he is charged with <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>nonſenſe,</hi> in expreſs words; and the mother country is ſet at defiance, for the colonies <hi>will not,</hi> ſays the author, conſent to part with their rights. Such language as this, from inhabitants of dependant colonies to the ſuperior and ſovereign head, is froward, peremptory, and hoſtile.<note n="*" place="bottom">The paper here cited, was cenſured by the preſent <hi>Providence writer,</hi> in the Providence gazette of October 6, 1764, a little while before his apoſtacy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A pamphlet entitled, "the ſentiments of a Britiſh North-American," publiſhed at Boſton, ſome time paſt, has the following motto in the title page, taken from Phaedrus's fables.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Aſellum in prato timidus paſcebat ſenex,</l>
               <l>Is hoſtium clamore ſubito territus</l>
               <l>Suadebat aſino fugere ne poſſint capi</l>
               <l>At ille lentus. Quaeſo num binas mihi</l>
               <l>Clitellas impoſiturum victorem putas?</l>
               <l>Senex negavit; ergo quid refert mea</l>
               <l>Cui ſerviam, clitellas dum portem meas.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The profeſſed deſign of this pamphlet, was to arraign the meaſures of the adminiſtration, relative to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010012_0007_0F7B98532F179E48"/>
taxing the colonies, &amp;c. The application of the above fable to that ſubject, ſhews clearly the author's opinion, that under the preſent parliamentary regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is a matter of indifference what prince or power we are ſubject to, whether a GEORGE or a LEWIS, as a certain gentleman expreſſed it.</p>
            <p>In the Providence gazette, November 10, 1764, is contained, ſomething that is called a dream. The dreamer before he falls aſleep, introduces himſelf in this manner: <q>He that acknowleges that I am an Engliſhman, and tells me, at the ſame time, that I am to live under laws, which I have no hand in making, and am to be taxed where I have no repreſentative, does but mock me.</q> In the midſt of his Dream, ſpeaking of the ſtamp duty, intended to be laid on the colonies, he compares it to the branding of beaſts. The performance is ſomething of the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick kind; and among the perſons of the drama, is a maſter brander and his retinue,. Who this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter means, the reader muſt diſcover. In the ſame ſcene is alſo exhibited, a ragged country fellow, grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The dreamer ſays, <q>The maſter brander, with his retinue, approached the paſture with great pomp, one carrring a large ſilver brand, in the form of the letter S; and upon entering the field, they began with the aſſes, and branded them without interruption.</q> Soon after he adds, <q>A very rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged country fellow ſaid, with a facetious grin, that he always underſtood till then, that the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England very well knew, that none but aſſes would ſtand ſtill to be branded.</q> The meaning, wrapped up in this low, vulgar allegory, is plain.— The letter S, denotes the <hi>Slavery</hi> the colonies would be ſubjected to by the ſtamp duty, if they, like aſſes,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010012_0008_0F7B98575FB74340"/>
ſhould ſubmit to it.—The ragged country fellow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the dreamer himſelf.</p>
            <p>A piece in the New-York gazette, of Thurſday, March 7th, 1765, which came in the editor's way, while theſe ſheets were compiling, furniſhes him with a recent and palpable inſtance of that unfilial diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition too prevalent in the colonies. The author of this piece firſt endeavours to raiſe a cry againſt the Halifax letter, and then, exalting the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the colonies, he ſays, <q>If thoſe rights and privileges are violated, what reaſon then can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, why they ſhould prefer the Britiſh to the French <hi>government,</hi> or any other? They may, indeed, from their preſent weakneſs, be compelled to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the impoſitions of miniſterial power, but they will certainly conſider that power as ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical; they will hate and abhor it, <hi>and, as ſoon as they are able, will throw it off, or perhaps try to obtain better terms from ſome other power.</hi>
               </q> Here is an honeſt, plain ſpoken gentleman, that does not mince the matter at all; he roundly threatens Great-Britain with the defection of her colonies, <hi>as ſoon as they are able.</hi>

            <p>To give the laſt finiſhings to the opinions and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma's contained in the aforegoing extracts, and many others which might be produced, of the ſame ſort, his honour the governor of Rhode-Iſland colony, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon the ſtage,
<q>
                  <l>Mid the low murmurs of ſubmiſſive fear,</l>
                  <l>And mingled rage, my H— rais'd his Voice;</l>
               </q>
and in a ſolemn, argumentative manner, aſſumed upon himſelf to prove, that an act of parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not levy taxes on the colonies, by any other authority,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010012_0009_0F7B9857E067F988"/>
but that of mere ſuperiority and power. (See page 20 of "rights of colonies examined.") Beſides the boldneſs of ſuch a poſition, the performance appeared throughout oſtentations, in the manner and execution; and in the matter, diſreſpectful and unthankful to the mother country. The many quotations, from ancient and modern books, abundantly evince the firſt. The latter ſhall now be proved, by one or two obſervations upon it, which were omitted in the Halifax letter.</p>
            <p>In page 20, his honour ſays, <q>In the year 1746, when Duke D'Anville came out from France, with the moſt formidable French fleet that ever was in the American ſeas, enraged at theſe colonies for the loſs of Louiſbourg the year before, and with orders to make an attack on them; even in this greateſt exigence, theſe colonies were left to the protection of heaven and their own efforts.</q> This inſinuation is ungrateful and diſreſpectful. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration at that time, it is confeſſed, was inactive and indolent, and the Britiſh honour and intereſt alike neglected in all places; but the malevolence, in the manner of the expreſſion, is obvious; and the idea intended to be produced, is, that the colonies were particularly ſacrificed by Great-Britain at that time, for, ſays he, <q>they were left to the protection of heaven and their own efforts.</q> What other purpoſe can this effect, but to impreſs the people with an opinion, that they were at that time neglected by their mother country? What other paſſions will it kindle, but reſentment againſt her? What more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful argument can be uſed to withdraw the ſubjection of the colonies from Great-Britain, than to fill the minds of the people with doubts and diſtruſts of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010012_0010_0F7B9858B5E921D8"/>
that care and protection they might reaſonably expect from her? But further, the Duke D'Anville was enraged at <hi>theſe colonies</hi> for the loſs of Louiſbourg; as if <hi>theſe colonies</hi> alone were the ſole inſtruments of its reduction. The truth is, without depreciating the ſervices of the Americans, the conqueſt of that place was, in a great meaſure, owing to the ſquadron under Admiral Warren, without which, it's more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, it never would have been taken. But this paſſage of his honour's book, is ſtill further reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for its diſingenuity and concealment of the truth. Great-Britain is charged with neglecting the colonies, but not a word is ſaid of the parliamentary reimburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole charges of that expedition.</p>
            <p>In page 15, his honour, after cenſuring the enlarged power of the admiralty, and impeaching the integrity of the judge, makes the following reflection: <q>Such unbounded protection and encouragement given to informers, muſt call to every one's remembrance Tacitus's account of the miſerable condition of the Romans, in the reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> their emperor, who let looſe and encouraged the informers of that age.</q> Here, the neceſſary meaſures, contrived by the government, to ſuppreſs the infamous practice of ſmuggling, is called, an unbounded protection and encouragement given to informers; and the preſent moſt happy ſtate of the Britiſh nation, under a prince who is the delight of mankind, is aſſociated with, and likened unto, the miſerable condition of the Romans under <hi>Tiberius,</hi> one of the moſt wicked and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of their emperors. Theſe are not the effuſions of a peaceable citizen, or a faithful magiſtrate; and the editor unfeignedly regrets the occaſion, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced this remark, becauſe he hoped never to have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010012_0011_0F7B985933B2B5F0"/>
ſeen ſo great a ſacrifice made, by the honourable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to popular favour. But, alaſs! the foul path to popularity, muſt ever be ſtrewed with the ſpoils ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from the brow of royalty.</p>
            <p>Theſe remarks ſufficiently prove the charge of diſreſpect to the mother country, in his honour's book; which, together with the pamphlets and news-papers afore-recited, will ſtrongly mark the complection of too many in the colonies, when the Halifax letter made its appearance. The editor, truly ſcandalized at ſuch freedoms, and fully ſenſible of the bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which would follow the increaſe of this temper, which he hath now clearly expoſed to view, ventured to publiſh that letter. He foreſaw it would be unpopular, and draw on him a profuſion of obloquy and reproach; and the event is conformable to his expectations: but ſtill he is not diſmayed, and he will perſevere, with unremiting zeal, till time, which will produce his beſt vindication, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his adverſaries of their errors and miſtakes. Perhaps there never was an inſtance of ſo great a proſtitution, and debaſement of the human faculties, as in the conduct of thoſe who have appeared in this controverſy againſt the Halifax letter. A man might have committed blaſphemy and treaſon, and met with more humane treatment than has been ſhewn the author, as appears by the Boſton pamphlet, and many detached pieces in news-papers, publiſhed againſt him. To apologize for Great-Britain, it ſeems, is the only unpardonable ſin in this meridian. The bitterneſs of truth is very offenſive, and the Halifax letter has dared to ſpeak it out. Had the matters therein contained, been deſtitute of truth, it would have been treated like the lie of a day, and as ſoon
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010012_0012_0F7B9859F5E466E8"/>
diſappeared; but the rage and venom thrown out againſt it, is an unerring proof of its merit, and the authors moſt honorable teſtimony. The following points were all the Halifax letter intended to prove, <hi>to wit:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the New-England colonies privileges, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations created by the crown, are fixed and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by their charters.</p>
            <p>That theſe charters give them no exemption from the juriſdiction of parliament.</p>
            <p>That no grant of the king could exempt them from this juriſdiction, becauſe the common law, out of which it is derived, confeſſedly reaches the colonies, and brings with it that juriſdiction, and announces its force and operation over them.</p>
            <p>That the houſe of commons conſider themſelves as repreſentatives of every Britiſh ſubject, wherever he be; and therefore to every uſeful and beneficial purpoſe, the intereſts of the coloniſts are as well ſecured and managed by ſuch a houſe, as if they had a ſhare in electing them.</p>
            <p>That the late act for regulating trade, &amp;c. is founded upon the neceſſities of the adminiſtration, which muſt be ſuppoſed to have adopted the beſt methods it could, to raiſe thoſe monies intended to be applied for the protection of the colonies. And,</p>
            <p>That the employment of cutters, and enlarging the power of the admiralty, can be accounted for no otherwiſe, than from the apprehenſion of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſmuggling, in ſome of the colonies, required further and ſeverer remedies.</p>
            <p>This was the whole purport and deſign of the Halifax letter: If any ſatyr or ridicule, againſt the author of <hi>the rights of colonies,</hi> was occaſionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſperſed,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010012_0013_0F7B985B69569C70"/>
it was fairly and juſtly invited, by the vanity of an attempt, which was no leſs than to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate the parliamentary juriſdiction in the colonies.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition to this inoffenſive pamphlet, the editor of it is aſſailed by two very diſtinguiſhed perſonages; both of them eſteemed the exacteſt models of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, urbanity, and ſoftneſs of manners, perhaps in America. The firſt retailed his labours in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence news-papers. The ſecond has fabricated a pamphlet of thirty-two pages, printed at Boſton. They ſhall, in the few following remarks, be called, for brevity's ſake, the <hi>Providence writer,</hi> and the <hi>Boſton writer.</hi> The <hi>Providence writer</hi> ſhall be firſt taken notice of.</p>
            <p>He accuſes the Halifax gentleman of want of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, for charging the honourable author with main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, <q>that the colonies have rights independant of parliament.</q> So far from retracting the charge, the editor doth now aver, that this dogma hath been aſſerted by his honour in the moſt open and expreſs manner. It can be proved, even from public files and records, that the parliamentary authority hath been ludicrouſly treated by him. He and his followers, now unable to mantain the doctrine, upon any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, founded either upon the nature of government, common ſenſe, or prudence, are at length become aſhamed of their indiſcretion, and have no means of acquittal, but to deny, with confidence, that they ever maintained it. The editor, however, continues his accuſation, upon the expreſſion of his honour's book alone, without availing himſelf of any foreign aid; but he confeſſes, it will be difficult to convince the <hi>Providence writer</hi> of this, till the meaning of words ſhall be adjuſted by ſome authority, to which his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010012_0014_0F7B985B709C84E0"/>
may be exacted. To what purpoſe will it be to make uſe of ſigns, if their ſignification may be twiſted and varied juſt as a writer pleaſes? Does not his honour ſay, in plain Engliſh words, that <hi>the common people of Great-Britain have not any ſort of power over the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, and that they cannot give a power to their repreſentatives which they have not themſelves.</hi> Is not the inference from theſe expreſſions as clear as the ſun, that <hi>theſe repreſentatives have no power over the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans?</hi> And if the repreſentatives, i. e. the houſe of commons, have no power over the Americans, an act of parliament can have no power over them, for the houſe of commons is a conſtituent branch of the legiſlative, and their concurrence abſolutely eſſential to the making of every act: Yet the <hi>Providence writer,</hi> with the moſt inexcuſeable prevarication, would fain melt down this plain, ſtriking denial of parliamentary juriſdiction, to mean no more than this, <hi>that it was his honour's belief, that according to Britiſh principles of government, the ſubjects of America ought not to be taxed in parliament.</hi> This rude and violent perverſion of plain Engliſh, cannot deceive any body that will conſider but a moment.</p>
            <p>The editor thinks this a proper place to thank the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> for a little aſſiſtance. In page 5 of his book, he <q>confeſſes and laments that the aforegoing expreſſions of his honour involve a ſophiſm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him;</q> and to do the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> juſtice he has detected the fallacy which eſcaped the Halifax gentleman. His honour, however, may not take it ſo kindly, and will begin to ſuſpect, that he is in perils from falſe brethren; for certainly, the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> has given a ſpecimen of his diſingenuity, to ſay no worſe of it. Every body muſt allow this is acting a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010012_0015_0F7B985C32618D70"/>
double, inſincere part. A friend ſhould rather have concealed the fault, than expoſed it: But the ruling paſſion of the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> totally abſorbs him; and the cauſe itſelf is rather to be ſacrificed, than a ſingle ray of his ſuperior diſcernment ſhould be eclipſed.— He is, however, entitled to a further compliment from the editor, for he allows his honour's expreſſion to be an implicit denial of the authority of parliament, which is the ſame, in ſubſtance, as an explicit one; and the editor can ſee no difference in the two modes, except in the diſguiſe and cunning, which are, by no means, the talents of a fair and candid enquirer after truth. Here, it is hoped, that, with the reinforcement of the <hi>Boſton writer,</hi> the reader will be convinced that the charge upon his honour is fully made out.</p>
            <p>But ſhould it be ſtill thought, that his honour has not expreſly denied the juriſdiction of parliament, yet the tendency of his pamphlet will be found equally miſchievous. <q>If we are taxed, (ſays he) without our own conſent; we are in the miſerable condition of ſlaves.</q> Page 4. In this place, he hath combined together the idea of ſlavery, with that of being taxed without our conſent, which is very artful, and an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way to extinguiſh all regard to acts of parliament.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to foreſee, from the ſlighteſt knowledge of the temper and genius of a free people, as the Engliſh are, that whenever they are made to believe, that the authority, which takes money out of their purſes, is not founded in <hi>equity,</hi> they will ſoon refuſe obedience to it. And, therefore, ſuppoſing all that has been ſaid on this ſubject, by his honour, or any other, to have gone no further, than only to queſtion the <hi>equity</hi> of taxing the colonies without their being repreſented; the effect of ſuch reaſoning, upon the minds of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010012_0016_0F7B985FC25BF930"/>
people, will be equally as dangerous to the peace and order of government, as a downright denial of the authority of parliament would be. So that it is a poor evaſion for the patrons and promoters of ſuch doctrines, to ſay, they only humbly call in queſtion the <hi>equity</hi> of exerciſing the parliamentary juriſdiction; or, that according to Britiſh principles of government, the Americans ought not to be taxed in parliament; for the morality of any action is determined by its conſequences: And if ſuch opinions, however dreſſed up, will be found to have weakened the ties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the miſchief is great; and the guilt of it will fall upon the heads of thoſe who have promoted ſuch opinions.</p>
            <p>The Halifax gentleman ſays, <q>that he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to inveſtigate the natural relation, between the colonies and the mother ſtate, abſtracted from compact.</q> The <hi>Providence writer,</hi> remarkable for the cleanlineſs of his ideas, ſays, this is <hi>rank nonſenſe;</hi> that the mother country and colony have no natural relation. The editor could, on this occaſion, add a <hi>modicum</hi> to the <hi>Providence writer</hi>'s ſtock of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, by various extracts from books, and thereby juſtify the mode of expreſſion in the Halifax letter: But he is relieved from further elucidating this point, by the <hi>Boſton writer,</hi> to whom he again pays his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of thanks, for his aſſiſtance, in transferring to the <hi>Providence writer,</hi> the <hi>rank nonſenſe</hi> charged upon the Halifax gentleman. In page 31, the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> has ſhewn, that there is a natural relation between a mother ſtate and its colonies; ſo that the Halifax letter is fairly quit of the abſurdity, by a majority of two voices againſt one: But ſhould it be thought otherwiſe, the editor leaves the point to be
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010012_0017_0F7B986049B7B778"/>
decided between them. The policy, in the oppoſition to the Halifax letter, muſt appear new and ſingular. The <hi>amiable couple,</hi> who form this oppoſition, inſtead of being united, counteract each other; and, like the legs of Nebuchadnezzar's image, compoſed of iron and clay, will ſoon break to pieces.</p>
            <p>The Halifax gentleman ſays, "that acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment derive their authority from the common law." "If ſo, ſays the <hi>Providence writer,</hi> the juriſdiction of parliament <hi>muſt</hi> be ſubordinate to the common law." Not ſo neither: And the iſſue of ſtupidity ſhall be fairly tried. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſays, indeed, right, that the juriſdiction of this court is tranſcendant, &amp;c. But from whence is it derived? Could this juriſdiction form and create itſelf? No: It is the common law, founded upon long uſage and conſent, which has placed an uncontroulable, tranſcendant juriſdiction in that court, even to alter and amend the courſe and direction of various branches of the common law itſelf. If the <hi>Providence writer</hi> could trace a different ſource of this juriſdiction, or account for it better, he ought to have done it; but his ſilence is a proof that he could not.</p>
            <p>He charges the Halifax gentleman with unbounded folly, and then makes him ſay, that parliamentary juriſdiction <q>can be extended, occaſionally, into every kingdom of the world.</q> But there is no expreſſion in the letter that will warrant any ſuch conſtruction. It ſays, <q>The juriſdiction of parliament is attached to every Britiſh ſubject, whereſoever he be.</q> And this is, indeed, true of all ſubjects in the Britiſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. It is there, this juriſdiction is now diſputed; and they at preſent are the ſubject of this controverſy. Therefore, the general expreſſions, <hi>whereſoever he be,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:010012_0018_0F7B98618FB4CC38"/>
according to the rules of argumentation, muſt mean, and be interpreted, <hi>in the colonies.</hi> Lord Coke ſays, <q>The common law extends to all places granted under the broad ſeal.</q> Therefore it neceſſarily extends to, and operates in, the colonies. It there maintains and aſſerts the juriſdiction of parliament over them. Shall the editor be ſtill aſked for a better, or ſtronger authority, to juſtify his opinion?</p>
            <p>In one paragraph of the Providence news-paper, the Halifax gentleman is twice charged with <hi>impudence,</hi> with the <hi>moſt aggreſſing impudence.</hi> This is indeed very clever; and what is it for? Why he has preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay, "that a repreſentation, if allowed, would be of no real uſe to us." Is this ſo criminal? Have patience, gentle reader, and be not aſtoniſhed at the editor's calmneſs. Michael, the arch-angel, would not bring a railing accuſation againſt the Devil.— Bitter words, and opprobrious epithets, are harmleſs things, and prove nothing. It is the ſocial and moral conduct of a man, that forms his character in life. The meaneſt wretches are the moſt dextrous at all the artillery of low abuſe; and to excel in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, is only to ſink in fame.</p>
            <p>The Halifax gentleman ſays, <q>It is the opinion of the houſe of commons, and may be conſidered as a law of parliament, that they are the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of every Britiſh ſubject, wherever he be.</q> In ſaying this, his intention was merely to conciliate the minds of his countrymen, and to produce in the colonies a quiet ſubmiſſion to the meaſures of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by letting them know, that they have no reaſon to complain, becauſe, in the opinion of the houſe of commons, tho' they are not in fact repreſented, yet their properties and intereſts are equally regarded
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010012_0019_0F7B986237ED13E0"/>
with thoſe of their fellow ſubjects in Great-Britain. But it ſeems this prudent and commendable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Halifax letter, meets with the uſual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal invective from the <hi>Providence writer.</hi> Muſt not he, and his whole tribe, ſtand condemned, in the judgment of all ſober and moderate men, for wickedly miſleading the people, under the deceitful guiſe of liberty? Is not he a better friend to the colonies, who tells them the plain truth, and would fain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the increaſe of thoſe prejudices and idols of the mind, which, if ſuffered to grow wild, will infalliably be hurtful to the preſent age, and to poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Halifax letter ſays, <q>that a merchant, tho' worth £.100,000 ſterling, if it conſiſts only in perſonal effects, has no vote in election of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment members.</q> The <hi>Providence writer</hi> ſays, <hi>it is falſe.</hi> To prove that it is falſe, he cites juſtice Powys's argument, in the caſe of <hi>Aſhby</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> who ſays, <q>In ſome boroughs, every potwaller may vote; in ſome, reſidents; and in others, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying burgeſſes, &amp;c.</q> What then? Does this prove it falſe? A man may be worth £. 100,000 ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, perſonal eſtate, and yet be neither a freeholder, a burgeſs, a potwaller, or a freeman, of any corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Great-Britain; and therefore may have no right to vote. So that it remains yet undeniably plain, that a man of that fortune may be unqualified to vote; and it is undoubtedly true, that there are many ſuch in Great-Britain, who cannot vote at all. But the matter is ſcarcely worth the writing of a ſingle word, and ſhould here have been unnoticed, had it not been for the charge of falſhood.</p>
            <p>The Halifax letter affirms, <q>that copyholders in England, of £. 1000 ſterling per annum, cannot
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010012_0020_0F7B9863070C42A0"/>
vote.</q> Here the <hi>Providence writer</hi> gives him the lie again.—Thou parragon of truth and goodneſs, does it follow, that becauſe the ſtatute of the 9th of Anne qualifies a copyholder for life, of £. 600 ſterling per annum, to be a knight of the ſhire, that therefore copyholders may vote? It clearly does not. "Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders are a ſervile tenure: They are not free and common ſocage; and therefore fall ſhort of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the immunities, and the independency of that freehold tenure, which, for more than three hundred years, have conſtituted an elector of knight of the ſhire." This doctrine was fully eſtabliſhed, by a very learned man, with whom the <hi>Providence writer</hi> is not yet acquainted; and it was confirmed by the ſtatute of the 31ſt of the late king, which enacted, "That after the 29th day of June, A. D. 1758, no copyholder ſhould vote for a knight of the ſhire, under penalty of £. 50 ſterling," &amp;c.—The leſſon of humiliation is hard to learn; but painful as it is, the <hi>Providence writer</hi> ſhould here begin the work: And, for his encouragement, let him remember that his credit will raiſe in proportion to the decreaſe of his pride; and that meekneſs will reſtore to him, what he has loſt by his arrogance.</p>
            <p>The employment of cutters, and enlarging the power of the admiralty, contained in the act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, was complained of by the honourable author. As theſe meaſures ſeemed grievous to the coloniſts, the Halifax gentleman conceived, that if he could give any ſatisfactory account of the motives, which induced the adminiſtration to adopt them, it would not be unacceptable to ſuch perſons as had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the matter, and would rather ſoften the coloniſts, than provoke them againſt thoſe meaſures:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010012_0021_0F7B9863DE9E1AB0"/>
Accordingly he reſolved the cauſes of the new regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, into the neceſſity of the thing. In all ſtates, puniſhments muſt riſe in proportion to offences. The more flagrant <hi>theſe</hi> are, the more ſevere ſhould <hi>thoſe</hi> be. This will be admitted by every body. <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſima reſpublica, plurimae leges,</hi> ſays Tacitus. But it ſeems the <hi>Providence writer</hi> thinks theſe proceedings arbitrary and uſeleſs, becauſe, he ſays, "there has been, for years paſt, little or no ſmuggling carried on in theſe northern colonies, but in the article of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes." The editor here readily grants, that the trade of foreign melaſſes, though illicit, is by far the leaſt injurious of any: And he, with truth, can ſay, that that ſpecies of trade entered very little into the charge of ſmuggling, brought againſt the northern colonies. But does this <hi>Providence writer</hi> imagine, that the editor has ſuch a daſtardly, temporizing ſpirit, that he dares not ſpeak out what every body knows to be true? Is it not notorious, that a moſt iniquitous, ſmuggling trade has been long carried on, from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the colonies, to Holland, and other foreign European countries, to the vaſt prejudice of Great-Britain, and her manufactures? And there is not the leaſt kind of doubt, if the new inſtituted court of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty ſhould be aboliſhed, and the men of war and cutters withdrawn from their ſtations, but this ſame trade would be renewed, and practiſed in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to elude the contravention of cuſtom-houſe officers, however faithful and vigilant they might be. Can any one be ſo ignorant of the world, as not to know, that money is almoſt become the ſupreme good; and that the obligations of conſcience and duty, are but feeble reſtraints, when proſpects of great gain preſent themſelves? This is true every where.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010012_0022_0F7B9864924D9BA0"/>
The inclination to ſmuggle is equally prevalent in many parts of Great-Britain, the iſle of Man, &amp;c. The means uſed to check it, in thoſe places, are rather more rigorous than here: And the editor is not yet perſuaded, "that the people of New-England are ſuch philoſophers and divines, compared with thoſe of Great-Britain," that their virtue is proof againſt the allurements of <hi>mammon.</hi> He thinks it no breach of charity to ſay, that if the fear of confiſcation and forfeiture was removed, the king's revenue would be as little regarded by theſe New-England philoſophers and divines, as by any other people, though the law of both tables ſhould look them full in the face: And he will pay them no compliment, at the expence of truth.—For ſuch-like ſentiments as theſe, the Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax gentleman is threatened, by the <hi>Providence writer,</hi> with ſomething that looks like a legal proſecution. He ſays, there has been little or no ſmuggling in the colonies. What violence does this unhappy devoted man commit againſt the dictates of his own heart. The editor here confeſſeth, he feels ſome indignation, mixed with pity, towards a perſon, who is ſo loſt to every manly ſentiment, <q>that the words of his mouth have no interpretation: His tongue and his heart are for ever at variance.</q> To be threatened with a proſecution, from this <hi>Providence writer,</hi> is, indeed, enough to try one's patience. The editor thinks, however, he is ſecure, at preſent, in his own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; but when his crimes become ſo great, that thoſe whom he has betrayed demand reſtitution in a court of juſtice, for his falſhood and perfidy: When his conſcious guilt ſhall afford no ſolace to his mind; then he may be driven to take ſhelter under the wings of a party, to ſcreen himſelf from the reſentment of his injured and abuſed clients.</p>

            <p>The ſecond that has honoured the Halifax letter with his animadverſions, is a <hi>Boſton writer,</hi> who has publiſhed a pamphlet, entitled, <hi>A vindication of the Britiſh colonies, againſt the aſperſions of the Halifax gentleman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The treatment ſome of the moſt reſpectable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, have met with from this writer, left the editor no room to doubt what would be his own fate, and he is not diſappointed.</p>
            <p>In the firſt page, he ſays, <hi>all who grow outrageous, are diſguſtful.</hi> This has ſo great a likeneſs to the original, that one could take his oath, he was ſitting for his own picture. His features open and ſpread with almoſt the firſt ſtroke of his pen. KNOW THYSELF. This ſingle ſaying of old <hi>Chilo,</hi> the Lacedemonian, ſuitably impreſſed upon his mind, would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his writing this pamphlet, and ſaved the public much pain, becauſe, <hi>all who grow outrageous, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful.</hi>

            <p>The editor hath, with great travail and perſeverance, waded through this dreary waſte of 32 pages. In at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to explore it, Chaos ſeemed to be come again. The patience he exerciſed, on that dark and gloomy occaſion, has fitted him for any misfortune or diſappointment in life. Pain, he will no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as an evil. Nay, ſhould he be forced to paſs the Stygian river, and drink its poiſonous vapours, it would be more than Elyſian, compared with the miſery of reading through this pamphlet.</p>

            <p>This pamphlet has anſwered two purpoſes: Firſt, to ſcatter, upon the author of the Halifax letter, the moſt unprovoked abuſe: And ſecondly, by an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable fatality, to ſuſtain and confirm the principal argument contained in that letter. Though the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> is fairly foiled, he ſhall find, in the editor, a generous antagoniſt, for he will not rob him of his weapons.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Boſton writer</hi> ſays, <hi>"It is certain, that the parliament of Great-Britain hath a juſt, clear, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and conſtitutional right, power, and authority, to bind the colonies, by all acts wherein they are named. Every lawyer, nay, every tyro, knows this. No leſs certain is it, that the parliament of Great-Britain have a juſt and equitable right, power, and authority, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe taxes on the colonies, internal and external, on lands as well as on trade.</hi> Here he will certainly appear, in the opinion of his aſſociates and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, to have ſurrendered up all at diſcretion, and betrayed his whole party; for the above paſſage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a moſt unreſerved and ſolemn recognition of the abſolute, unlimited authority of parliament over the colonies. The warmth of the expreſſion, and the care taken to ſhun all ambiguity, indicates the zeal of a new convert; for that he is a new convert, will appear from a paſſage in his firſt pamphlet, which he cites in page 27 of his preſent performance, in theſe words: <q>
                  <hi>When</hi> the parliament ſhall think fit to allow the coloniſts a repreſentation in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the <hi>equity</hi> of their taxing the colonies <hi>will be</hi> as clear as their power is at preſent of doing it
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010012_0025_0F7B98676F693500"/>
without, if they pleaſe.</q> Hence it is evident, that when he wrote his firſt pamphlet, the <hi>equity</hi> of taxing the colonies depended, in his opinion, upon their being, in fact, repreſented in the houſe of commons: for <hi>when</hi> that ſhould be allowed, the <hi>equity</hi> of taxing <hi>would be</hi> as clear as their power is at preſent, &amp;c. Thus there was a time, when the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> was a meer <hi>tyro;</hi> it is a pleaſure to acknowlege, that he is now become a <hi>lawyer.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The rights of colonies aſſerted,</hi> of which this <hi>Boſton writer</hi> was the author, was almoſt univerſally cenſured at home. This ſufficiently accounts for his veering about.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It will afford ſome amuſement to obſerve here, that the preſent <hi>Providence writer</hi> was the author of the dream, taken notice of in page 8. The reader may recollect, that he there ſays, "He who tells me, that I am to be taxed where I have no repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, does but <hi>mock</hi> me." The reader will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that, in the preceeding paragraph, the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> ſays, that the parliament of Great-Britain may conſtitutionally and equitably tax us, and yet we are not repreſented. This will naturally produce ſome very diverting images. The ſcene, at length, opens, and diſcovers this amiable pair of writers; one of them dreaming, and the other mocking him. Mercy on us! what a group would this furniſh, for the groteſque genius of a <hi>Dutch</hi> painter?</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, the Boſton pamphlet, however barren it may be in ſome reſpects, affords a large field for the critical talents of a <hi>Proſodian,</hi> or an <hi>Auceps Syllabarum,</hi> which was a character given by <hi>Cicero</hi> to ſome lawyers of his time; but as the editor does not boaſt ſuch acquirements, he can have no kind of controverſy <hi>with the Boſton writer,</hi> after the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010012_0026_0F7B986B89BAD070"/>
confeſſion he hath made of his new political principles. He has diſarmed, by this very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable declaration, the little reſentment the editor had againſt him, for the perſonal abuſe his piece contains: Therefore, he freely forgives, and at the ſame time congratulates him, on the happy conviction of his errors. But the work of repentance ſhould not ſtop here; it is to be feared the <hi>honourable author</hi> is yet an unbeliever, and his converſion ſhould be made a point of. When this is done, his <hi>honour</hi> and the <hi>Boſton writer</hi> ſhould adjuſt, together, the fallacy detected in his book: For though the argument was not any ways affected by that fallacy, yet it impeaches his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's underſtanding; or, at leaſt, his candor. When this is well ſettled, the terms, <hi>natural relation,</hi> between a mother ſtate and its colonies, ſhould be diſcuſſed between him and the <hi>Providence writer.</hi> And when peace and unanimity are reſtored within their borders, they ſhould form a new plan of operations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute one of their body to attack the Halifax letter; but they ſhould, in all good policy, agree not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict or confute each other; for, beſides the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional trouble they give their antagoniſt, they weaken and deſtroy the ground they ſtand upon.</p>
            <p>As the particular remarks upon the <hi>Providence writer</hi> are, in a great meaſure, applicable to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contents of the Boſton pamphlet; and as this latter contains nothing new, but is rather inferior to the former, both in the method and argument; it would be but dull repetition to ſay any thing further upon it. The editor, therefore, will take his leave of the <hi>Boſton writer;</hi> but muſt firſt balance the <hi>ſing-ſong,</hi> with part of that celebrated character of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> (to compare ſmall things with great) which <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> has put in the mouth of <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

            <p>It is proper here to record, what, perhaps, may appear, a few years hence, almoſt incredible. At the general aſſembly of this colony, held at Eaſt-Greenwich, on the laſt Monday of February, A. D. 1765, the deputy-governor went down to the lower houſe, with this harmleſs Halifax letter in his hand, and requeſted them to take it into conſideration, and purſue ſuch meaſures againſt the printer, or pamphlet, as they ſhould think fit. Some warm members puſhed on this motion, and, in their anger, ſeemed to have forgot, that the liberty of the preſs was ſacred, and the greateſt bulwark of Britiſh freedom: They repreſented the pamphlet as a libel, inſiſted that the printer ſhould be ſent for, and ſome were for burning the pamphlet by the hands of the common hangman. This was in the genuine ſtyle of eaſtern deſpotiſm, and reminds the editor, that he has ſomewhere read of "two young ladies, in India, who were ſhut up for life in a box, thick ſet with pointed nails; one for having had a love intrigue, and the other for not diſcloſing it." The iſſue of this affair was, there were members in the houſe, of virtue and moderation, who ſaw nothing offenſive in the pamphlet: And the application of the deputy-governor only ſerved to ſhew, that our ſenators, in this inſtance, were neither acquainted with, or actuated by, the true principles of the Britiſh conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:010012_0028_0F7B986CDEE2A978"/>While we lament how thin the partition is, between exceſs of liberty and abſolute tyranny, it ſhould be a pleaſing conſideration, to every man in the colony, that his liberty and property are ſubject, in the laſt reſort, to the care and animadverſion of the mother country.</p>
            <p>The oppoſition to the Halifax letter, however cholerick and fretful it be, bodes no evil to the editor. He does not mean to be vain, when he ſays, that he is independant in ſpirit, and in circumſtances; he has not a wiſh which ſeeks its gratification from the ſmiles of popularity: If he had, the arts of adulation and duplicity lie open to his choice, and would yield him the ſame harveſt which brings a triumph to thoſe, who prefer preſent fame to all other conſiderations. —He now takes leave of the public, and of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, his private concerns will not permit him to continue the diſpute any longer, whatever inſults he may receive. Beſides, he thinks it wiſdom to diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a controverſy, which his antagoniſts have already made perſonal, and therefore can anſwer no end, but to ſour and provoke one againſt the other: Recrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation throws no light upon the enquiry, and the ſubject becomes loſt in a torrent of abuſe. <hi>Hae nugae, ſeria ducunt in mala.</hi> "The madneſs of others ſhall be a leſſon to him." He will give no occaſion for the further production of human depravity and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, leſt he ſhould loſe that philanthropy, which, at preſent, adminiſters to him the greateſt contentment, next to that he derives from the eſteem and friendſhip of good and virtuous men.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>SINCE the aforegoing ſheets were committed to the preſs, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral veſſels have arrived from London, and brought intelligence, that the act of parliament, for levying a ſtamp duty on the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, is actually paſt: That, upon this occaſion, not a ſingle member in the houſe of commons ſpoke againſt taxing America; nor would one of them even introduce a petition, which ſhould impeach the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's right: That one member, in particular, ſaid, "that where the colonies ſtand on ſuch high pretenſions of independance on the ſupreme legiſlative authority of Great-Britain, there is no moderating any thing." His majeſty's ſpeech, at opening the preſent ſeſſions, is alſo come over; wherein he ſays, he "relies on the wiſdom and firmneſs of parliament, to promote obedience to the laws, and reverence to the legiſlative authority of Great-Britain." In anſwer to this ſpeech, both houſes, in terms equally ſtrong, have ecchoed back to the throne, the king's pleaſure, and declared their reſolution to maintain due reſpect to this authority.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings at home, have compleated the defence of the Halifax letter, beyond even the power of cavil or chicane. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, by paſſing the ſtamp act, have determined the queſtion reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their right of taxing the colonies, in ſuch a manner, that no prudent or ſenſible man will ever hereafter diſpute it.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>the rights of colonies aſſerted and proved,</hi> hath been vainly puffed, in a London news-paper, by ſome hungry bookſeller, as a piece proper for the inſtruction of both houſes of parliament, yet the event has ſhewn, that not a ſingle member is one grain the wiſer by it. The other pamphlets and news-papers, publiſhed in America, with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and remonſtrances, ſent home by the colonies, were TOO BOLD, TOO FREE; and, as it is ſaid above, not a ſingle member would preſent one of them to the houſe: But, on the contrary, it was declared, that the pretenſions of independency in the colonies, would not admit of any moderation towards them.</p>
            <p>The reader is here intreated to look back a little into the Halifax gentleman's letter. In page 5, ſpeaking of his honour's pamphlet, he ſays, <q>It were to be wiſhed, that ſome friends of the colonies would endeavour to remove any unfavourable impreſſions, this and other pamphlets, of the like kind, may have occaſioned at home; leſt thoſe in power form the general character of the colonies from ſuch notices as theſe convey; and from thence be inclined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their dependance, rather than to emancipate them from their preſent ſuppoſed impoſitions.</q> Again, <q>This people, (of Great-Britain) juſtly conſcious of their dignity, will not patiently be dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010012_0030_0F7B986E3345FA00"/>
to, by thoſe, whom they have ever conſidered as dependant upon them.</q> In page 16, he takes notice of the conduct of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in the year 1733, when the Rhode-Iſland agent preſented a peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the then ſugar bill, containing pretenſions ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe now ſet up; and then ſays, <q>From hence you may perceive, how little proſpect there is of the colonies gaining any point, upon the footing of theſe new ſuppoſititious rights. Broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch opinions, will excite the jealouſy of parliament, and you will be looked upon with an evil eye. The promoters of ſuch doctrines are no friends to the colonies, whatever may be their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. Can his honour be ſo vain as to imagine, that ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſuch pamphlets as his, will influence the parliament; or that they will be perſuaded, by the force of his elocution, to give up their ſupremacy, and right of taxing the colonies? If we have any thing to aſk, we ſhould remember, that diffidence and modeſty will always obtain more, from generous minds, than frowardneſs and impertinence.</q>—Whether the Halifax gentleman hath prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied truly or not, let his enemies now declare? Whether he hath deſerved the foul uſage he has received, let the public now ſpeak? If, inſtead of our high pretenſions to independance, fomented and ſpirited up by thoſe gentry who oppoſe the Halifax letter, we had modeſtly repreſented our poverty and inability to pay taxes, or pointed out to the parliament any other more ſuitable, or leſs burdenſome method of taxation, we ſhould have been liſtened to, with an indulgent and parental ear: We ſhould have found the Britiſh legiſlature, like APOLLO, rewarding our merit, inſtead of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing our preſumption. But, alaſs! the fatal ſhaft is ſped; and thoſe who, from principles of falſe patriotiſm, have led the colonies into theſe errors, will, ſo long as taxes are felt by us, deſerve the execration and reproaches of their countrymen, whom they have thus betrayed and enthralled. At preſent, nothing remains, on our part, but a dutiful ſubmiſſion. If the late meaſures ſeem hard, let us compare our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition with other nations and countries, and learn contentment. The <hi>honourable author</hi> muſt now weep in ſilence, for what his lucubrations have not been able to accompliſh. The <hi>Providence dreamer,</hi> during the remainder of his reſtleſs, diſappointed days, muſt ſubmit to the <hi>mockery</hi> of thoſe who acknowlege the parliamentary juriſdiction. The <hi>Boſton writer,</hi> who cannot reliſh liberty, unleſs it be ſtained with the mixture of licentiouſneſs, ſhould take a leſſon from his preſent bad ſucceſs, and venture no more to diſturb the harmony of the beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution on earth; but rather ſeek out ſome other region, more agreeable to his troubled ſpirit, and unquiet imagination.</p>
