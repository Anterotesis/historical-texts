            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I once thought these Sands were brought up by the Waves of the Sea, and then by the Agitation of the Sea in Storms, and by the great Hurry of Waters, were carried back again to the Sea; but am now fully convinced that this Conjecture was unphilosophical, and not founded on true Principles: As the Solution of that Phoenomenon did not then appear any Way interesting, my Thoughts were unattentive, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to Brooks, from Brooks to Rivers, till they fall into the Sea, mingle with the Sand Ore, and add to the Quantity, or to some proper Bed. Travelling the Road with the Reverend Messrs. <hi>Ruggles</hi> and <hi>Todd,</hi> at the Bottom of an Hill which we had descended, while we were discoursing on this very Subject, we observed some Sand brought down by the Water, nigh a Brook, which it might probably reach the next Rain; on the Top of that Sand there was a thin Stratum of a blue Colour, we had nothing convenient to take off this Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, but took up all together, brought it to my House, and dried it; there was three Penny Weight of Sand, from which we extracted with the artificial Magnet 15 Grains of Iron Particles, which were in Figure and Colour the same with the Sand Ore.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that as Iron is much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than Water, so it must be contrary to the Laws of Gravitation to suppose Iron to be transported in Water: If we consider how Iron may be plated so thin as to swim in Water, and that these Particles of Iron are much less than Plates made by Hand, it is not strange they should swim.</p>
            <p>As these Particles of Iron were on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Sand, so they must have floated on the Top of the Water by which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed; if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

larger, the Velocity and rapid Motion of the Water might thrust them forward, as we see Gravel and even great Stones <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>umbled forward by the Force of Water. Since this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, Persons that are curious and attentive, have seen frequently in the Roads and elsewhere, these Iron Particles.</p>
            <p>From hence we may conclude the Usefulness of Water, not only in Vegetation, but also for Transportation of Bodies to the Place of their Destination; so what a Political Writer said of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> that they were the grand Carriers of the World, may with greater Propriety be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Water. Water not only serves to bring together the Materials which form a Tree, or a Mine of Iron, but also unites them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is the grand Cement or Bond of Union; take away Water from Wood and it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like Powder of Post, take away Water from common Stone and it become as Sand, extract it from Limestone (which as <hi>Borehaa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Many Years past a Number of Proprietors in an Iron Work, being in Want of Iron Ore, heard of a great Quantity in an Island; they sent and found a large Bed of it, but the Water which had fed and maintained it being drawn away, or dried away, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

when all the Cells are destitute of Honey, and therefore would yield no Iron.</p>
            <p>I was also informed of another Iron Mine at <hi>Windsor,</hi> which was so richly fed with Water, fully impregnated with Iron Particles, that the Ore being taken away, the vacant Bed in a Number of Years was replenished with a new Stock fit for Use. It is consistent with Reason to suppose, that as it is with Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, so it is with Iron, which is a component Part of the Earth; that there was at first, just such a Proportion and Quantity created, which is never more nor less, and hath so continued from the Beginning, and will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A Piece of Iron Ore was sent to me as a Curiosity from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> taken from the Ore Bed in that Place; it was in the Shape and Form of three Isicles, two or three Inches long, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Body of Ore like Fingers to the Hand; Water impregnated with Particles of Iron, had ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The third Week the Anvil gives Way, a large Breach is made; the greater Part of the Week is spent in cutting it down to make a new Face.

            <p>About this Time, and for some Time past; having been at Work on a Parcel of Pig Iron, which is of such a sharp sulphureous Nature, as frequently to burn and destroy the Tew Irons, which is the Occasion of much Delay and Expence, as well as Loss of Time; at all Times, and with the best Pig Iron, there is Difficulty and Loss on this Score, though not equal to what it is when they Work those of a sharp Kind. A Tew Iron is a Case of Iron so framed, and of such a Constructure, as to secure the Bellows Pipes from being hurt by the Fire, and to convey and direct the Blast of Wind into the Fire; I have thought of various Expedients to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that Evil, have some Times thought of making them of the Asbestos or Cotton Stone,

The Iron made of Sand Ore, is not only fit to answer all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Purposes for which Iron is used, but it seems to be well fitted for, and to have all the Qualities requisite for making Steel for Edge Tools.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the first Place, this Iron is soft; the popular or vulgar Notion is, that the hardest Iron is best for Steel; this I suppose to be a Mistake, founded on a Conjecture, that Steel is no other than Iron made hard; if this were the Case, a great Degree of Hardness in Iron would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Operation; as this Iron is soft, so the heat and virtues of the Ingredients made use of in making the Change, will the more effectually Penetrate, in order to make a full Conversion of the Iron to Steel.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d,</hi> This Iron is pliant, or as we vulgarly say, tough. In Iron Bars there is a Grain, which runs the whole Length of the Bar, which is sometimes visible to the naked Eye; in breaking a very tough Bar of Iron, the Fibres appearing in some Measure resembling the Grain of Wood; the more distinct and connected these Fibres are, so much the more pliant and tough. If this be true in Fact, we see what is the Cause of the Pliancy or Toughness in Iron; I suppose it to be a necessary Property in Iron, to render it fit for making the best Steel for Edge-tools.</p>

            <p>If I have any right Notion of the Manner in which Iron is cleansed or converted to Steel it is this; that when the Iron lies confined in the Store Chest or Box, the Heat and the Virtues of the Ingredients communicate, cut and divide these Fibres into Angles, resembling Diamond Point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
