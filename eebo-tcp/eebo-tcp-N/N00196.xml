            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

floods upon the dry ground</hi>: alluding partly unto plentiful showrs whereby the thirsty Earth is made fruitful, and partly unto rivers such as <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the floods and seasonable overflowing whereof do enrich the earth: the promise is explained in the lat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter part of the verse, the words that are before us to insist on. <hi>will pour my spirit and my blessing,</hi> h. e. that wonderful blessing of the Spirit: They are spiritual waters which are here spoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No other showrs then those that come down from the third, and highest heaven: and this promise is further illustrated from the blessed extent of it, in that, not only Parents, but Children are concerned therein.

            <p>Concerning the fulfilment of this promise, this (as well as many other Scriptures which are prophetical, and promissary) doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Typical and Partial, as also an Antitypical, and more ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Accomplishment. The Lords people whilest in <hi>Babylon</hi> were like unto dry and desolate ground; but the Lord received them afterwards, and brought them into a flourishing estate, and there was a glorious work of the Spirit of God in that matter, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> And there will be a more glorious accomplishment of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and Promise, when God shall pour out a Spirit of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace upon the body of the Israelitish Nation.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the words being a special branch of the Covenant of Grace, which God hath established with his Servants and with their Children, Gentiles are concerned therein as well as Jews; for upon them is come the blessing of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Jesus Christ.</p>

            <p>The Doctrine which we may take up from the Words, is,

               <hi>Doct.</hi> That one of the greatest blessings promised in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, is, That the Lord will pour his Spirit upon the Children and Posterity of his Servants.</p>
            <p>Now for the clearing of this Doctrine, four things may be enquired into? (1) What is here meant by the Spirit? (2) What is implyed in this pouring the Spirit. (3) How it doth appear that the pouring of the Spirit upon Children is a great Blessing? (4) The reason why the Lord hath made such a promise.</p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is here meant by the Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> The Spirit is not here taken in a personal sence;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Mr <hi>Cottons Answer to Bayly</hi> p. 36, 37, 38. Dr. <hi>Owen of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</hi> chap. 8.</note> although it be a glorious Truth, that the Holy Ghost himself doth dwell in the hearts of Believers, yet he is not as to his person said to be poured on men; for so he is equally in all the Saints: whereas this expression of <hi>Pouring</hi> the Spirit intimates a larger commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of him to some then unto others. Wherefore the Phrase is Metonymical, that being affirmed of the cause, which is proper to the effect. In respect of his effects and operations the Holy Ghost is poured forth upon his Servants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then by the Spirit here is meant, <hi>The gifts of the Spirit.</hi> All spiritual gifts, especially Illumination in the mysteries of the Gospel is from the Holy Ghost: Hence they that have such gifts are said to be <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Heb. 6.4. He that hath a gift of knowledge, or a gift of prayer, hath received it from the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit of the Lord is so far poured upon him. And the gifts of the Spirit are compared unto wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Scripture, <hi>Ioh. 7.38, 39. He that believeth on me, out of his belly,</hi> i. e. <hi>his heart, shall flow rivers of living water; this spake be of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive.</hi> For as Waters do refresh the bodies of men, so the gifts of the Holy Ghost do refresh their Souls: when the Lord did showr down his Spirit in that plentiful measure on the Apostles, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Souls were refreshed and revived thereby. This then is partly meant here, when it is said, I will pour my Spirit on your Seed, <hi>h. e.</hi> your Children shall have gifts of the Holy Ghost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon them; they shall be taught to know the Lord from the greatest to the least.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the Spirit here converting, sanctifying Grace is meant: The Spirit is put for the graces thereof: Conversion is the special work of the Holy Ghost: The conversion of the house of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000255_0007_0FA4103B6F9CE378"/>
h. e. the Elect of God, is intimated by that of <hi>pouring a Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rit of Grace vpon them,</hi> Zech. 12.10. Grace is wrought in the Soul by no other hand then that of the Spirit. When God sends down his Spirit to accompany his Word and Ordinances, then converting work goeth on, but if he withhold the efficacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of his holy Spirit, converting work will be at a stand, all means and outward dispensations notwithstanding. Wherefore <hi>Conversion,</hi> or <hi>Regeneration</hi> is called the <hi>Renewing of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Tit. 3.5. These words then are a promise and gracious intimation unto the Lords People, that a Spirit of Converting grace shall be poured upon their Children.</p>
            <p>We come to the second enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi> What is implyed in this <hi>Pouring</hi> of the Spirit, which the Text speaketh of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This expression doth imply, <hi>that the graces of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are fitly resembled unto water</hi>; so much is intimated by the Metaphor of <hi>pouring,</hi> which alludeth unto the Clouds, pouring down Rain upon the Earth. Water is of a purifying nature, so the waters of the Spirit, sanctifying grace doth cleanse, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the souls of men, <hi>Ezek. 36.25. I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness, and from all your Idols will I cleanse you.</hi> The guilt of sin is washed away in the blood of Christ; the filth of sin is purged by those blessed waters which do proceed from the Spirit of Christ, even converting, sanctifying grace: For the same reason grace is compared unto fire, <hi>Mat. 3.11.</hi> Metals, Gold and Silver, are purified by fire, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things by water, therefore are the blessed operations of the Holy Ghost compared both to the one, and to the other. Water is of a mollifying nature; the Earth that is dry and hard is thereby softened, <hi>Psal. 65 10. Thou visitest the earth and waterest it,</hi> thou greatly enrichest it with the River of God, which is full of water, <hi>thou makest it soft with showers</hi>: So doth converting grace soften the dry and hard hearts of the children of men; that heart wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch was as hard as a stone before, if once a spirit of converting grace be poured thereon; it doth become soft and plyable like water. Again, Water maketh fruitful; showers and floods do so: Thus wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that was a desolate, parched, barren Wilderness, when once the Spirit from on high is poured upon it, doth become like a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful field, <hi>Ezek. 34.26, 27.</hi> Fruits of holiness and righteousness are the effect of being watered by the spirit of God; only the converted man, that hath Grace in his soul, is indeed fruitful, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are barren and desolate ground. Once more, water is of an healing nature; so are the waters of the spirit, sin is the souls sickness, grace is the souls health; the wound received by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Corruption is in some measure healed by converting grace. <hi>Ezek. 47.9. For they shall be healed, and every thing shall live whither the River cometh</hi> Those words are a prophesie, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conversion of the Gentiles, by means of that healing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which doth attend the blessed waters of the Gospel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This expressi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of pouring the spirit, doth intimate, <hi>an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant measure of the spirit,</hi> i. e. of the gifts and graces thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pouring</hi> is something more then <hi>Sprinkling,</hi> as when their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a plentiful rain from Heaven, enough to satisfie dry Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it cometh pouring down. As <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks, <hi>Iob 36.27, 28. He maketh small the drops of water, they pour down Rain according to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vapour thereof, which the Clouds do drop and distil upon man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly.</hi> So this pouring of the spirit noteth a great showr of grace, Hence it is said in the Context, that <hi>Floods</hi> shall be poured on the dry ground, now a <hi>Flood of Grace</hi> intimates a great measure thereof. There are many Scripture expressions that confirm this, <hi>Prov. 1.23. I will pour out my spirit upon you.</hi> The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Nabang</hi> which is there translated, <hi>Pour,</hi> signifieth to <hi>spring up,</hi> intimating that the spirit of grace in the souls of Believers is like a Fountain, where is an abundance of water. <hi>Isai. 32.15. Vntil the spirit be poured out upon us from on high.</hi> The Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Gnadah</hi> signifieth <hi>to make bare</hi>; so that the meaning is, that there shall be a manifest, conspicuous pouring forth of the spirit, that all the world should take notice of it. And indeed, when a soul is converted there is an abundant effusion of the spirit, to accomplish such a strange thing as that is, to change such a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed nature, to renew such a vile heart, must needs proceed from a plentiful effusion of the spirit. <hi>Tit. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5, 6.

Off-spring:</hi> the Lord doth graciously promise his servants that their Children shall attain unto an eminency of spiritual gifts, and unto large measures of Grace and Holiness.</p>
            <p>We come to the third Enquiry, <hi>viz. How it doth appear that the pouring of the spirit upon Children is a great blessing</hi>? Ans.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In that the gift of the Holy Ghost is mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as a great and wonderful thing</hi> It is said, Act. 10.45. <hi>They were astonished, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cause that on the Gentiles was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Yea, it is mentioned as such a gift as is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to all good things, <hi>Mat. 7.11. Your Father which is in Heaven shall give good things to them that ask him</hi>: Now in <hi>Luke</hi> it is expressed by saying, <hi>Your Heavenly Father shall give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him,</hi> Chap 11.13. So then the gift of the Spirit is virtually all good things: Truly if God pour his Spirit upon our Children, he doth more for them then if he bestowed all the good things in the World upon them. This is the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Gospel: As the great promise of the Old Testament was concerng the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> so the great promise of the New-Testament doth respect a more plentiful effusion of the Spirit of Grace. Hence the pouring down of the spirit is noted by that expression of the promise of the Father, <hi>Act. 1.4.</hi> And he is called <hi>the spirit of Promise,</hi> Eph 1.13. as being the great gift which God hath promised to bestow on his servants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Truth is evident in that the Blessing here spoken of, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A spirit of Converting Grace is such a Blessing as never goeth alone</hi>: that setteth forth the greatness, and eminency of it: If (saith the Apostle) God give us his Son, shall he not with Him give us all things, <hi>Rom 8.32</hi> So if the Lord give his holy spirit to us, and to our Children, shall he not with him give all things: Godliness hath the promise of this life, and of that which is to come, <hi>1 Tim 4.8</hi> We should not trouble our selves about laying up great portions or much of the things of this World for our Children; if we can but prevail with God to pour his spirit on them, to give grace to them, they are sure never to want as long as they live in this World. Is not pardon of sin a rich and glorious blessing, which our poor Children, because they are <hi>our</hi> Off spring stand in need of?

The Elect of God are the proper Subjects of this promise: The Lord in the Covenant of Grace hath not only promised that whoever doth truly believe and repent shall be saved, but as to the Elect, there is a promise of the first Grace, even that converting grace shall be poured on them, they shall be made to repent and believe. A new heart shall be given to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> h. e. the Elect, typified by the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> Gal. 6.16. Now God hath seen good to cast the line of Election so, as that it doth (though not wholly, and only, yet) for the most part, run through the loins of godly Parents.

They that have their thoughts exercised in discerning things of this nature, have sad apprehension with reference unto this matter: That the work of Conversion hath been at a great stand in the world: In the last age, in the days of our Fathers, in other parts of the world, scarce a Sermon preached but some evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted;<note place="margin">

Clear sound conversions are not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in some Congregations. The body of the Rising Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a poor perishing, unconverted, and (except the Lord pour down his Spirit) an undone Generation. Many that are profane, Drunkards, Swearers, Lascivious, Scoffers at the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Despisers of those that are good, Proud, Disobedient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, God from Heaven pity them! Others that are only civil, and outwardly conformed to good order, by reason of their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but never knew what the new birth means; pray for them that they may not only come near, but enter into the Kingdome of God.</p>
            <p>Consider 2. <hi>That Prayer is a notable means to obtain this mercy</hi>; Prayer opens the Windows of Heaven: <hi>Elias</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Assuredly, if there be Prayers, and Tears before the Lord on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, they will come pouring down again in showrs of grace at last. I have read of an eminent Minister of Christ, that having prayed fervently with some Christian Friends, they in the next room felt strange Elapses of the spirit upon the heart, so as that one said, O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Luk. 24.49.</hi> And what were they to do at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the mean time? No question but (as some have noted) they were much in Fasting and Prayer that this promise of the Father might come upon them. And not long after there was a most gracious and glorious effusion of the spirit. And of later times, God hath been entreated to send down his Spirit abundantly for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of souls. Not fifty years ago, in a place in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a great number of praying Christians met together,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem, codem libro</hi> p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 417.</note> when a Sermon was to be Preached the next day, and they spent the night afore in Prayer, that the Lord would own the word then to be spoken, for the Conversion of souls, and Behold! the Lord went forth with his word, so as that near upon five hundred Souls were wrought upon, and converted by that one Sermon. I have been told of a Church in <hi>New England,</hi> that set apart a day for this end,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>At Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
               </note> that they might by Fasting and Prayer beg converting Grace for their Children, and that since, the Gospel hath been made successful in that Congregation, so as that a day of publick Thanksgiving hath been attended, in that so many of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Rising Generation have been brought home to Christ. Now if the Lord awaken a Spirit of Prayer concerning this thing in these Churches generally, there will doubtless be some blessed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, with respect to the Rising Generation. And whereas God hath put it into our hearts to set apart this day, thus to seek unto him, I am perswaded it shall not be in vain, but that there are a number of souls belonging to this Congregation, that must have the spirit of the Lord pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000255_0015_0FA4104261807A20"/>
hath God heard them? and will he not hear us if we go and pray in like manner for our Off-spring? And have we not already seen some Answers? If we look into our Families, do we not discern that as to some of our Children, the fear of God is put into their hearts? And why should we not look upon that as a first fruits, that all the rest of our Children shall be converted in due time? Moreover, the consideration of the Covenant, and Promises of God respecting Children, are a great encouragement to pray for them. This is his everlasting Covenant, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This promise is expressed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, and therefore doth encourage godly Parents to plead with the Lord for mercy and grace for all their Children: As an Holy man once said, and it was a great word of Faith in him, <hi>If I had twenty Children I would not bate God one of them.</hi> He hath promised to be a God to my children indefinitely,<note place="margin">

               </note> and therefore I'le pray for them all, and believe for them all, and why should it not be so, since the Lord himself hath said, ALL <hi>thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall be taught of God,</hi> Isai. 54.13. And the Scripture doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with particular promises, respecting the Conversion and Salvation of the Children of godly Parents: When thou dost that which is good, and right in the sight of God, <hi>it shall go well with thy Children after thee for ever,</hi> Deut. 12 28 There is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mercy belonging to those that are the Seed of the blessed of the Lord, and to their Off-spring with them, <hi>Isai. 65.23.</hi> yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of converting Grace to be poured upon them, <hi>Zech. 10.9.

respect to Children in the times of the Gospel: <hi>Ioel 2.28. It shall come to pass afterwards,</hi> h. e. <hi>in the last dayes, or times of the Gospel,</hi> as the Apostle doth expound the words, I <hi>will pour my Spirit upon your Children.</hi> Now these days wherein we live, come under the last days, we therefore should plead that promise before the Lord, and say, These are the last days, Lord, and thou hast said, that in the last dayes thou wilt pour thy Spirit upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thy Servants. And indeed that fulfilling of the promise which our eys have seen is ground of encouragement to pray and plead, and believe for more. Some of <hi>New England</hi> Children have been eminently blessed by the Lord; he hath poured his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon them richly, <hi>Plants of Renown</hi> have sprung up here, that have been the glory of the Land where they have had their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: yea, some, that whole Nations have fared the better for them: Rivers of Water have flow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d out of their Souls, whereby thousands have been refreshed. And there is a blessed sprinkling in most Churches; though not that general pouring down of the Spirit that is to be desired, yet a sprinkling which we should take notice of, for the encouragement of Faith and Prayer. I shall only mention that which I have most reason to know; in this poor Congregation, within these few late years, there have been of Children born in <hi>New-England,</hi> near upon fourscore persons, that have come before the Church, and declared what God hath done for their souls, and in that way subscribed their names to the God of <hi>Israel</hi>; besides many that have come out of other Lands, and when they have been here, the Lord hath poured his Spirit upon them. I speak it that God may have the glory of his grace, and that Ministers may be encouraged to Preach, and the Lords People to pray for the conversion of souls. Moreover, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what Parents the children of this Land are (many of them) sprung from, doth afford matter of encou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
