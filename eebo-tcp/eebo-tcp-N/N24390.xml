            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>BEFORE the reader peruſes the following diſſertation, I muſt beg leave to inform him, that this is the firſt attempt of a young man, inexperienced in writing, and is done only in compliance with the regulations of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege for conferring the degree of Doctor of Medicine.</p>
            <p>I have purpoſely avoided any inquiry as to the origin of the diſeaſe, or the chemical com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the matter or poiſon producing it; referring the reader for particulars upon theſe ſubjects to the more complete hiſtory of the diſeaſe, as publiſhed by Doctor BAYLEY, Mr. WEBSTER, and others; and have confined myſelf to a plain detail of the <hi>ſymptoms, cauſes</hi>, and <hi>cure</hi> of the diſeaſe, as far as fell under my own obſervation, in my attendance at the New York Hoſpital, and upon the private practice of Doctor SAMUEL BARD, and my brother Doctor DAVID HOSACK.</p>
            <p>If a ſingle fact, either new or uſeful, ſhall be communicated, I ſhall feel myſelf much gratified in having undertaken the taſk.</p>

               <p>THE Yellow Fever is known by a variety of names. By the French it has been deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>La Maladie de Siam</hi>, from a country of that name in the Eaſt-Indies, where it is ſuppoſed to have had its origin, and from thence to have been conveyed to diſtant parts of the world. Sometimes they call it <hi>La fiévre matelotte</hi>, from its attacking ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring people and foreigners more readily than the natives of the country in which it prevails. The Spaniards have given it the name of <hi>vomito préto</hi>, or the black vomit, which is one of its moſt malignant and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic ſymptoms. Some have called it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032282_0007_0FF1B35C0D865378"/>the <hi>malignant fever</hi>—others the <hi>putrid bilious</hi>, and <hi>bilious remitting fever</hi>, &amp;c. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe firſt appeared in this city about the year 1740; and, as I am informed by Doctor JOHN BARD, who was at that time a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, it manifeſted the ſame malignant ſymptoms which characteriſed the late mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal epidemic.—In ſome of the ſouthern ſtates it has been known to prevail at a much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier period.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. Lining.</note> In 1791 it appeared again in New-York, and has been deſcribed in a diſſertation publiſhed by Doctor ADDOMS.</p>
               <p>THE epidemic I am now about to deſcribe, and which has univerſally received the name of yellow fever, firſt appeared about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of July, and continued until the weather became cold. The ſeaſon, during its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence, was very hot and moiſt. It raged with moſt violence in thoſe parts of the town adjacent to the eaſtern ſhore, where the air is leſs pure, and the ground lower than in any other part of the city; which, conſequently, muſt, in ſome degree, ſerve as a reſervoir for the filth of the upper parts of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032282_0008_0FF1B35D9DCA05B8"/>the city. It attacked perſons of all ages, adults more frequently than children, and males than females—foreigners more than the natives, or ſuch of our inhabitants as had lived in warm climates.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame has been remarked in the Weſt-Indies, and in the other parts of the United States, viz. that foreigners from northern climates were more ſuſceptible of the diſeaſe than the natives. In ſupport of this opinion, I beg leave to introduce the following extract of a letter from Doctor GEORGE DAVIDSON to Doctor DAVID HOSACK, dated Fort-Royal, Martinique, September 23, 1796; in which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the following ingenious explanation of this fact: "I have already mentioned the experiments made upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheric air here, with a view to aſcertain the compoſition of it. Thoſe experiments have been frequently repeated, in the preſence of the late Doctor CHARLES WEBSTER, of Edinburgh, Doctor SAUNDERSON, of London, and Doctor CHISHOLME, lately. The reſult has ſhewn a much greater proportion of oxygene than what I could have conceived —no leſs than 67/100 of oxygene gas. It may, perhaps, tend to explain ſome difficulties which we meet with in the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena attending upon yellow fever, viz. why Europeans, or thoſe from cold climates, of tenſe, rigid fibres, and in the prime of life, are the ſubjects of its attack. I ſuppoſe, what you will admit, that Europeans or Americans, from cold climates, have a more tenſe and firmer texture of fibres than Creoles, or thoſe who have long reſided here—cold tending to brace the habit and invigorate the body, and whilſt it does ſo, increaſing the appetite and digeſtive powers. Beſides this connection between the ſtomach and ſurface, we alſo obſerve a remarkable ſympathy between the ſtomach and lungs: whatever tends to invigorate the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, remarkably increaſes the action of the lungs, as we may perceive from what follows after a full meal and a few glaſſes of generous wine. Inſpiration and reſpiration are increaſed; a greater quantity of atmoſpheric air is taken into the lungs, and a greater quantity of oxygene fixed in the blood: hence the irritability; a glow of genial heat diffuſed; and the circulation becomes more rapid. But as the atmoſpheric air in Europe contains a leſs proportion of oxygene, the quantity of it fixed will be proportioned to the neceſſities and calls of the ſyſtem. It is, however, far different in thoſe climates: before the appetite and digeſtive faculties are impaired, whilſt the tone and vigour of the ſyſtem ſtill continue, and alſo the correſponding action of the lungs, a much greater proportion of oxygene being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the atmoſpheric air, will be fixed, and the irritabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſyſtem increaſed; or, in other words, the ſyſtem ſurcharged with oxygene. Hence the prediſpoſition to fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver."</note> Frenchmen and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032282_0009_0FF1B36258EB49A8"/>blacks who had lately arrived from the Weſt-Indies, were rarely the ſubjects of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as they appeared to have been inured, and thence rendered inſenſible to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its cauſe; but their exemption is, no doubt, more particularly to the aſcribed to their temperate mode of life, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their freer uſe of vegetables; for it is certain, that thoſe who moſt indulge in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032282_0010_0FF1B365A79A3EA0"/>uſe of animal food and ſpirituous drinks were moſt ſuſceptible of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>THE ſymptoms which marked the yellow fever in its firſt ſtage were, a general lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and heavineſs—depreſſion of the ſpirits, ſometimes approaching to ſtupor—diſincli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to motion—a ſenſe of cold, and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering—acute pain in the head, eſpecially above the eyes—pains in the back, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extending down the extremities— the ſkin was hot, dry, and much fluſhed, not unlike the ſcarlet bluſh of an eryſipelatous inflammation—the eyes were ſuffuſed with water, and the veſſels of the tunica adnata much diſtended with blood: ſo conſtant were theſe laſt ſymptoms, that they may, in a certain degree, be conſidered as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the diſeaſe. The pulſe was, for the moſt part, frequent, full, and hard—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration was proportionably quickened, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much anxiety, ſtricture, ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and frequently intenſe heat about the precordia—the tongue was foul, the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite depraved, with nauſea, vomiting, and not unfrequently pain about the region of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032282_0011_0FF1B367320E3198"/>the ſtomach: theſe were among the firſt ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. The bowels were conſtipated, unleſs the patient laboured under a diarrhoea at the commencement of the fever —the urine, in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, for the moſt part, as in the firſt ſtage of the fevers in general, viz. high-colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſmall in quantity; in the laſt ſtage, when the fever had continued for ſome days with violence, and the general maſs of fluids became changed, this excretion manifeſted the ſame alterations, becoming ſometimes turbid, and at others yellow, as if tinged with bile.—Such are the ſymptoms which generally appeared at the commencement of the diſeaſe, conſtituting what I would call the inflammatory ſtage, but differing from any inflammatory diſeaſe, inaſmuch as in the former there was no particular part of the body which appeared to be excluſively the ſeat of inflammation. Where the diſeaſe terminated favourably, there was, for the moſt part, an evident abatement of the above ſymptoms in forty-eight hours; and in the courſe of five days the patients were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032282_0012_0FF1B36BA51341B8"/>freed from fever, but were left greatly debilitated by the violent operation of the poiſon producing the diſeaſe, and the evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which became neceſſary for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the fever: even in thoſe inſtances where blood-letting, the moſt debilitating of all evacuations, was not employed, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was ſo reduced as to require all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, both of nature and of art, for his ſupport. This ſtage of the diſeaſe was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marked by ſymptoms of debility, yet accompanied with great <hi>irritability</hi>, ſo much ſo, that the leaſt imprudence in diet, cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bodily exertion, or indulgence in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and company, would frequently induce a return of fever. But where this abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe did not take place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt three days, a very different and more malignant train of ſymptoms appeared, partaking more of the ſymptoms of the laſt ſtage of putrid fever, as deſcribed by HUX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAM and CULLEN.</p>
               <p>IN the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, the pulſes ſunk, became more frequent, irregular, and ſometimes intermittent: the perſon would
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032282_0013_0FF1B36EAB4CEE30"/>lie continually on the back, with the knees drawn up, and the body ſinking toward the bottom or foot of the bed; the breathing became proportionably more difficult; and the cruſt which had formed on the tongue became of a black colour, which change alſo took place on the lips and teeth; the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs became more general over the body, attended with cold clammy ſweats; the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting now became more frequent and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; in ſome inſtances patients have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited inceſſantly, and in aſtoniſhing quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities; and what was brought up reſembled the grounds of coffee: this, for the moſt part, was conſidered as a fatal ſymptom: there were, however, ſeveral inſtances of recovery after this had taken place to a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree.<note n="*" place="bottom">The opinions, as to the nature and origin of the black matter vomited up, are very numerous and different. Some have ſuppoſed it to be part of the ſtomach; but we muſt entirely reject this idea, when we conſider the enorm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

[<hi>See Saunders on the liver.</hi>] Here I beg leave to quote the words of Doctor JACKSON, who, from diffection, has formed the ſame opinion: after opening the abdomen, &amp;c. and noticing the appearance of the viſcera, he ſays, "The liver and ſpleen were generally enlarged in ſize; the colour of the liver was often of a deeper yellow than that of any other of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominal viſcera; while the texture of the ſpleen was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently leſs firm than it is found to be in its natural ſtate. The gall-bladder, for the moſt part, was moderately full, but the bile it contained was black and thick. The bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ducts were likewiſe enlarged, and moderately filled with the ſame ſort of bile which was found in the gallbladder; while the very blood-veſſels of the liver bore the marks of uncommon diſtention. In the cavity of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, likewiſe, there was uſually more or leſs of a dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured liquor, ſimilar to what had been thrown up in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe."</note> It is worthy of remark,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032282_0014_0FF1B374A729D160"/>that when the vomited liquor acquired this black colour, a diarrhoea ſometimes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in which there was a diſcharge of a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſort of black matter, but more reſembling tar or molaſſes. The florid colour now left the eyes, and they became yellow and ſunk. The functions of the brain and nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem were alſo very much deranged: the patient was attacked with delirium, attended with ſubſultus tendinum, and ſometimes a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtupor, with a convulſive kind of ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſpeech began to faulter and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The patient appeared very uneaſy, and ſhewed a diſpoſition to leave the bed. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032282_0015_0FF1B3762ECF0070"/>a deceitful tranquillity appeared, and by ſome was ſuppoſed to be a favourable ſymptom; but the patient, upon getting aſleep, was much agitated. The ſtools and urine became black, very offenſive, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged involuntarily: in ſome inſtances there was an entire ſuppreſſion of urine: the extremities became cold, but the heat ſtill continued about the ſtomach: blood was diſcharged from the mouth, noſe, ears, and eyes, and from thoſe parts of the ſkin where bliſters had been applied. Sometimes blood was effuſed in the cellular membrane, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the form of mortification—pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae appeared about the neck and breaſt— vibices, or livid ſpots, came out upon the body, particularly upon the abdomen—the perſpiration became very foetid—the eyes ſhone like glaſs—hiccough and muttering came on, and were followed by death.</p>
               <p>Doctor RUSH, in his hiſtory of the yellow fever as it prevailed in Philadelphia, has taken notice of buboes and carbuncles as among its ſymptoms. I do not now a ſingle inſtance where theſe ſymptoms have occurred in this diſeaſe in New-York. In
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032282_0016_0FF1B3792B941508"/>the Weſt-Indies theſe ſymptoms are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common, as would appear from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract of the before-mentioned letter, which I have introduced, as it ſerves to eſtabliſh the ſimilarity of the yellow fever to the plague.—"We have had a return of the yellow fever during the months of July, Auguſt, and September, much more violent than I ever recollect ſeeing. The rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſet in very late, and the weather proved, during theſe three months, remarkably warm and ſultry. The diſeaſe commenced early in July, and was not only contagious, but attended with peſtilential ſymptoms. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes appeared in ſeveral patients, who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, recovered; and I have ſeen ſeveral inſtances of the anthrax and peſtilential car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncle. One patient evidently ſunk from a carbuncle on his elbow, the haemorrhage from which could ſcarcely be ſuppreſſed by pledgits dipt in diluted vitriolic acid; and two others alſo appeared upon the foot and ankle of the ſame patient. I am at preſent attending a medical gentleman who has above fifty carbuncles upon his body. The
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032282_0017_0FF1B37AB4FEC5C0"/>diſcharge has reduced him, but he is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The appearance was firſt a red une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual eryſipelatous appearance upon the ſkin; in the centre appeared an elevated ſpot, which gradually changed to black, burſt, and diſcharged a blackiſh bloody ichor, and left behind it a deep pit. Upon other parts a white puſtule appeared, which, after burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſcharged pus and bloody ſerum, and pitted in the ſame manner. The back, loins, and upper part of the thighs were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally affected."</p>

               <head>PREDISPOSING CAUSE.</head>
               <p>PREDISPOSITION is that ſtate of the body not of itſelf capable of producing the diſeaſe, but rendering the body more ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of the exciting cauſe. In order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce yellow fever, it is neceſſary that the body ſhould be in ſuch a ſtate as to receive the action of the exciting cauſe. This ſtate appears to be a peculiar irritability in the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032282_0018_0FF1B380CFEC56F8"/>ſyſtem, by whatever means induced. Upon no other principle can we explain the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the contagion does not affect every perſon within its atmoſphere, and why the attendants of the ſick are not always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked. The cauſes which produce prediſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the body, for the moſt part, are,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Fear, which poſſeſſes great power in debilitating the body, and hence rendering it more irritable. Upon this principle we may account for the good effects of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent preventives which many were in the habit of uſing; ſuch as the wearing a ſmall quantity of camphor, vinegar, &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly about the body, inſpiring them with a certain degree of courage. The uſe of tobacco was ſuppoſed to have a good effect in counteracting the diſeaſe, probably from its poſſeſſing more ſtimulus than the matter of contagion.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. Heat. eſpecially expoſure to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect rays of the ſun, was a common cauſe, as it aſſiſted the ſtimulus of contagion in bringing on indirect debility. Fire alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the contagion more active. To prove
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032282_0019_0FF1B383D7608EE0"/>this we notice, that a great majority of thoſe that were infected were ſuch as, from the nature of their occupations, were much expoſed to the heat of the ſun and fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. Fatigue, whether induced upon the mind or body, and from whatever ſource.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Grief. Perſons who attended friends or relatives in this diſeaſe were not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeized during <hi>their attendance</hi>.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. Exceſs in venery, and other evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as bleeding and purging, aided by fear, which cauſed ſome perſons to adopt theſe means in order to prevent the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contagion.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. Cold; accordingly ſuch as had been previouſly much heated, upon getting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wet, drinking largely of cold water, or expoſing themſelves to a ſtream of cool air, were readily attacked with the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7th. Intemperance in eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: taking either too large or ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of improper food; or a ſcantity allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of common diet.</p>
            </div>

               <head>EXCITING CAUSE.</head>
               <p>DISEASE is brought on by the action of the exciting cauſe, after the body is rendered capable of receiving the contagion by the action of the prediſpoſing cauſe. The yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever being a contagious diſeaſe, it muſt undoubtedly depend upon the action of a poiſon either generated or introduced into the body. This matter, or poiſon, is generally acknowledged to be exhaled from animal and vegetable ſubſtances in a ſtate of putrefaction: but, as there is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of opinion upon this ſubject, I ſhall purpoſely paſs it over, referring the reader to the works of LAVOISIER and others.— There are alſo many different opinions as to the mode in which this contagion acts upon the body in producing the diſeaſe. Some have ſuppoſed that it enters the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem by the ſtomach—ſome that it enters by the lungs—and others, that the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032282_0021_0FF131149E2AD6E0"/>it by the pores of the ſkin. All theſe opinions have their advocates; but by which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paſſage it is communicated to the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, whether by the ſtomach, the lungs, or the pores of the ſkin, it is certain, that, in common with the matter of ſmall-pox, meaſles, lues venerea, the venom of the rattle-ſnake, &amp;c. it produces a violent irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout the whole ſyſtem. Its firſt operation I conſider to be upon the <hi>nervous ſyſtem</hi>: hence the violent pains of the head, back, and extremities of the body—hence the ſickneſs of ſtomach and vomiting— hence the ſenſation of cold and conſtriction upon the ſecreting and excreting veſſels. Such an irritation upon the nervous ſyſtem, with an interruption to the ſecretions and excretions, are neceſſarily followed with a quickened circulation. The irritating matter of itſelf is ſufficient to produce this effect; but the ſuppreſſion of perſpiration, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſtate of the bowels, and eſpecially the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of bile of an uncommonly acrid qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, muſt alſo unqueſtionably have a ſhare in adding to this irritation and increaſed action.</p>

               <head>CURE.</head>
               <p>HAVING ſtated the ſymptoms and cauſes of the diſeaſe, we are next to conſider the indications of cure, which appear to be,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi>, To prevent the further operation of the poiſon producing the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>, to procure a ſolution of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſtage of the fever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>, To counteract the putreſcent ſtate of the body, as deſcribed in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe. And,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly</hi>, to reſtore the tone of the ſyſtem when the preceding indications are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi>, To prevent the further operation of the poiſon producing the diſeaſe. To this end it is neceſſary that the patient be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the atmoſphere in which he took the diſeaſe, and placed in a ſituation where he may enjoy a pure, free air: all articles capable of conveying the contagion ſhould
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032282_0023_0FF1B39174661FA0"/>be immediately removed from the body, ſuch as clothing, &amp;c. in place of which there ſhould be clean dry clothing, bedding, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi>, To procure a ſolution of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſtage of the fever. It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to moderate the increaſed action of the ſyſtem, and to remove, as far as poſſible, every other ſource of irritation. To evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate immediately the poiſon from the body, when one introduced, is as impoſſible as to eradicate the matter of ſmall-pox, meaſles, or any other diſeaſe produced by ſpecific con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion. In the treatment of yellow fever, as in that of the ſmall-pox, if the analogy be a juſt one, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ſneſs of the phyſician appears to be, to moderate the action of the poiſon producing the diſeaſe, and, at the ſame time, to remove every circumſtance which can aggravate its operation upon the body. With a view to diminiſh the increaſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſyſtem, evacuations of different kinds were employed. Some practitioners had recourſe to <hi>blood-letting</hi>, followed by <hi>purging</hi> and <hi>ſweating</hi>; and others truſted
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032282_0024_0FF1B393018F7D88"/>entirely to the two latter. With reſpect to blood-letting, my obſervation has been, that the promiſcuous uſe of the lancet was very injurious and unſucceſsful. In the New-York hoſpital it was frequently employed, but in the majority of caſes the diſeaſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated fatally; yet, in ſome few inſtances, where the conſtitution was uncommonly ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric, and the determination to the head more violent than uſual, I have obſerved good effects follow the loſs of a <hi>moderate</hi> quantity of blood. But, generally ſpeaking, blood-letting was attended with pernicious conſequences. The ſame has been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the obſervations of ſeveral of our moſt reſpectable practitioners. The more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſucceſsful practice was,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To procure a free evacuation from the bowels. The purgative medicines which were employed were many and various. By ſome, calomel and jalap were preſcribed, and, in the beginning of the diſeaſe, with good effect. Others adminiſtered a mixture of rhubarb and magneſia with cinnamon or mint-water. This alſo anſwered well in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032282_0025_0FF1B3948AEEEF58"/>many caſes, where the ſtomach was irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and rejected the former medicines. But the medicine which was the moſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and acquired the greateſt reputation, was the Glauber's ſalts, given in warm diluting drinks. The doſe was generally from one to two ounces, diſſolved in a pint of gruel made of Indian meal, and given in divided doſes until it operated freely; the patient at the ſame time drinking freely of gruel or chicken water, to promote its operation. Salts, exhibited in this form, for the moſt part ſat well on the ſtomach: they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious in their operation, and, in many inſtances, poſſeſſed the additional advantage of relaxing the ſkin and inducing perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially where the patient drank large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly during their operation. But when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach was ſo much irritated as immediately to reject every thing taken into it, recourſe was then had to glyſters, compoſed of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and water, quickened by the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſmall quantity of molaſſes: theſe ſcarcely ever failed to produce the intended effect.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032282_0026_0FF1B399126B4948"/>2. Having procured copious and free eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations from the bowels, the next object appeared to be to relax the ſurface of the body, and induce free perſpiration. In ſome inſtances this ſalutary diſcharge came on im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the bowels had been empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was readily continued by taking plentifully of warm drinks; but, for the moſt part the febrile ſymptoms continued violent, the ſkin remained hot and dry, the pains ſtill diſtreſſing, and it became neceſſary to have recourſe to more active means to induce <hi>ſweating</hi>. For this purpoſe many ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorific medicines were employed. Some practitioners uſed <hi>emetics</hi>, and others ſmall doſes of James's powders, and the different preparations of antimony. Vomiting, in this diſeaſe, I have generally obſerved to be of dangerous tendency. It may, perhaps, not be amiſs, when the diſeaſe firſt diſcovers itſelf, and is attended with much ſickneſs and vomiting, to empty the ſtomach freely, by means of an infuſion of chamomile flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: but the exhibition of <hi>emetics</hi> I conſider to be highly dangerous and improper. I
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032282_0027_0FF1B39A9B1A4738"/>believe I have ſeen ſome caſes in which the death of the patients could be aſcribed to no other cauſe than the inceſſant vomiting brought on by an emetic given in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the diſeaſe. But the moſt certain and ſucceſsful means were, to waſh the whole ſurface of the body with cold vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and water, and immediately after co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the patient with blankets—to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſuch medicines as poſſeſs the effect of bringing on ſweating: of theſe the ſpiritus mindereri and ſaline draughts of RIVERIUS ſucceeded well, more eſpecially if the warm drinks were continued, ſuch as the infuſion of ſnake-root, gruel, toaſt water, tamarind water, lemonade, &amp;c. Theſe were much aided by applying to the feet of the patient a warm brick, ſteeped in vinegar and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a flannel cloth wet with vinegar or ſpirits: the ſteam, thus emitted and diffuſed through the bed, had a wonderful effect in ſoftening the ſkin and exciting ſweat, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where the cold waſhing had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly employed.—Some practitioners have preferred the practice of plunging the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032282_0028_0FF1B39D97EB3EC8"/>ſeveral times in a cold bath, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently daſhing the body with cold water. But ſimply waſhing the patient with cloths dipped in cold vinegar and water, was found much preferable to immerſion, both becauſe it more effectually diminiſhed the heat of the ſyſtem, and was leſs fatiguing to the patient. Experiments have proved, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly wiping and waſhing with water, in the ordinary way in which the operation is performed, diminiſhes the heat ſeven or eight degrees more than ſimple immerſion, or daſhing it over the body with pails.</p>
               <p>THE practice of cold bathing in fevers of this type is not a new one, but was very commonly employed at Breſlaw, in Sileſia;<note n="*" place="bottom">See DE HAEN's Ratio Medendi.</note> and of late years has been very ſucceſsfully applied in the Weſt-Indies,<note n="†" place="bottom">Doctor JACKSON on the Diſeaſes of Jamaica.</note> as well as in different parts of Europe, where diſeaſes of this type prevail.</p>
               <p>PROFESSOR GREGORY, of Edinburgh, and Doctor CURRIE, an eminent phyſician
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032282_0029_0FF1B39F20F59388"/>at Liverpool, have alſo preſcribed it with great advantage in the low typhus fevers of thoſe cities. But its great ſucceſs in the New-York hoſpital, as employed by Doctor SAMUEL BARD, and in the private practice of my brother, have fully convinced me of the propriety of its uſe. It is alſo proper to remark, that where the phyſician was not called to the patient in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, and putrid ſymptoms had appeared, and the patient had become much debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the cold bath was injurious; and from the abuſe of cold bathing, by employing it in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, it has fallen into diſrepute with ſome practitioners. But as the abuſe of a thing is no argument againſt its uſe, I repeat my obſervation, that in the firſt or inflammatory ſtage of the diſeaſe, it was one of the moſt uſeful remedies that was employed. When the cold bath had been thus made uſe of, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after followed by the ſpiritus mindereri or ſaline mixture, with plentiful dilution, it rarely failed to produce ſweating in the courſe of fifteen minutes; and when once
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032282_0030_0FF1B3A0B9C27408"/>induced, it was eaſily continued by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſudorific medicines and drinks, until a ſolution of the fever was obtained. In ſome inſtances where the patient refuſed his drink and medicines, or, from the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of the nurſes, they had not been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as frequently as was proper, and the perſpiration had been ſuppreſſed, it became neceſſary to repeat the cold bathing, which ſeldom failed to procure a return of the ſweating. By the continuance of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge an abatement of all the ſymptoms took place: it appeared to operate as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific in the diſeaſe; the pulſe in a ſhort time became moderate; the heat of the ſkin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed; the pain in the head and back, before ſo diſtreſſing, was alſo relieved; the ſickneſs of ſtomach and vomiting were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; and, in the courſe of two or three days from the attack, the patient had little elſe to contend with but mere debility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi>, In thoſe caſes where the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian was not called in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe, where the bowels were not freely emptied, and perſpiration had remained ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032282_0031_0FF1B3A82DB04DE8"/>with a continuance of the fever, a more diſtreſſing train of ſymptoms appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as deſcribed in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe, and required a different mode of practice: few patients, however, recovered from this ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>WHERE the ſtomach was much diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſickneſs and vomiting, which was one of the moſt dangerous ſymptoms, the ſaline draught was exhibited in the efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſtate; and, in ſome inſtances, <hi>yeaſt</hi> was employed with advantage, followed with nouriſhing antiſeptic drinks, as milk-punch, lemonade, porter diluted with water, &amp;c. Snake-root-tea, where it ſat well upon the ſtomach, appeared to poſſeſs moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, inaſmuch as it procured a free determination to the ſurface of the body, independent of its anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeptic properties; but where the ſtomach rejected every thing, recourſe was had to bliſters, applied immediately over the region of the ſtomach, and, in ſome inſtances, with the moſt happy effects. Spirituous fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, applied to the lower extremities,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032282_0032_0FF1B3A9B6959648"/>eſpecially where they were followed with perſpiration, in many inſtances gave relief to the ſtomach, and rendered it more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive.</p>
               <p>WHERE the bowels were in a coſtive ſtate, purgative medicines were given to the patient; at the ſame time injections were employed, compoſed of vinegar and water, with the addition of molaſſes and repeated every hour until they produced the deſired effect.</p>
               <p>WHEN the functions of the brain and nervous ſyſtem were much diſturbed, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by delirium, ſubſultus tendinum, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, &amp;c. ſinapiſms, compoſed of rye-meal, vinegar, and muſtard, applied to the ſoles of the feet, bliſters to the ankles, to the inſide of the thighs, and to the head, in ſome few inſtances procured relief.—In this ſtage of the diſeaſe ſome practitioners had recourſe to bark, wine, and the tonic treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in general; but the plan I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be attended with moſt ſucceſs in addition to the medicines and treatment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated above, was to ſupport the patient's
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032282_0033_0FF1B3AB45FDA548"/>ſtrength, by the mildeſt nouriſhment, and ſuch as was the leaſt ſtimulating to the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, viz. ſoups, compoſed of a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of vegetables, ſago, milk punch, with a ſmall quantity of ſpirits or brandy, merely ſufficient to render it grateful to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. In addition to this mode of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, great attention was paid to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of every external ſource of irritation, by frequent changes of linen and bedding, by frequently wiping the body with cloths dipped in ſpirits or vinegar, removing every offenſive matter from the room, and by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the atmoſphere around him, by the exploſion of gun-powder, ſprinkling vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar over his bed, and through the room, and procuring a free circulation of freſh air.</p>

                  <hi>Fourthly</hi>, Having, by the means above enumerated, procured an entire ſolution of the fever, it remains to reſtore the ſtrength of the ſyſtem. In the ſtage of the diſeaſe alluded to under the laſt indication, while a degree of fever remained, an active tonic or ſtimulating plan of treatment was found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious; but, when a perfect ſolution of the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032282_0034_0FF1B3AFCEC27910"/>diſeaſe was obtained, and the patient labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under mere debility of body, this mode of treatment was not only admiſſible, but, in many inſtances, the patient's ſtrength was ſo completely exhauſted, that the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorative medicines and diet became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. In this ſtate of body recourſe was had to the bark, ſerpentaria, the different bitters, mineral acids, and the uſual medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines preſcribed with this intention, viz. wine, porter, milk-punch, &amp;c. The diet employed with moſt advantage conſiſted chiefly of vegetables: ſago, tapioca, indian and oat-meal gruel, rendered palatable by the addition of wine, were, for the moſt part, grateful to the patients—were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nouriſhing, and, being of a more antiſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic quality, were found leſs hazardous than the uſe of animal food. When animal food was employed, it was in the form of ſoups, with a large proportion of vegetables, or calves-feet jelly, with the addition of wine: in this form it became leſs exceptionable. But ſolid animal food was very commonly injurious, retarding the recovery of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032282_0035_0FF1B3B4422E7CA8"/>and in many inſtances producing a return of the diſeaſe; it was therefore very generally prohibited during the convaleſcent ſtate of the patient.</p>
               <p>THE drinks employed with moſt benefit, and which were found moſt grateful to the ſick, were wine and water, milk-punch, porter, &amp;c. Such was the diſeaſe, and ſuch the mode of treatment, as far as has come within my knowledge.</p>
