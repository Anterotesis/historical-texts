            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AT a time when the thirſt for knowledge is ſo univerſal, that it is ſought after by all ranks of people; through its moſt intricate windings, and mazy labyrinths, it is not to be wondered at, that books of ſcience and polite literature are publiſhed in ſuch abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that they meet with that reception and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, from a liberal minded public, which their noble deſign requires, and which their intrinſic merit demands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The deſign of this publication, is not merely to amuſe; but rather, in an engaging, diverſified and pleaſing manner, to attract the attention—imperceptibly gain the affections—and draw the ſoul to a love of virtue, (by delineating her in her moſt attractive and alluring dreſs) from whence ariſes the ſpring of all great, noble and generous actions:—To inculcate a ſincere deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every ſpecies of vice, by an expoſition of the malevolent affections of the mind, as well in their ſofter, as in their more glaring, or aggravated colours.</hi>

               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028841_0004_0FDD1DDC98AC8F10"/>
               <hi>The above, though not the leaſt, is not the chief inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſelection.—The art of thinking juſtly, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pertinently and writing with correctneſs, eaſe, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and preciſion upon any ſubject, has ever been eſteemed the firſt ornament of the human mind, and juſtly accounted the grand characteriſtical mark, by which the rational being is diſtinguiſhed from the irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.—Yet, how few do we find thus accompliſhed, or how very few give themſelves any trouble to hold their rank in the great ſcale of animal creation? To render the above invaluable accompliſhment eaſy of acquirement, is the principal deſign of</hi> THE HIVE, <hi>wherein all the vices, virtues, relative duties and affections of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul are delineated by the maſterly hands of many of the firſt writers in the Engliſh language, who are as much eſteemed for their correctneſs, eaſe, elegance and beauty of diction, as for their conciſeneſs, perſpicuity, juſtneſs and dignity of thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The editor of this miſcellaneous volume, deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the importance of the above conſideration, without any parade of unmeaning ceremony, humbly recommends</hi> THE HIVE <hi>to the ſupport and attention of the candid public, as a publication ſolely intended to improve the heart, to inform the judgment, and gently to draw the affections to the love of virtue.</hi>

                  <q>THE PRESENT MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE GREATEST: THEREFORE, SMALL CAUSES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US UNEASY, WHEN GREAT ONES ARE NOT IN THE WAY.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>WE ought to make a good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paſt and preſent afflictions. If they are not ſanctified to us, they become a double croſs; but if they work rightly in us, and, convince us of our failings, and how juſtly we are afflicted, they do us much good. Affliction is a ſpiritual
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028841_0006_0FDD1DDFB0726B88"/>
phyſic for the ſoul, and is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, ſo men are proved, and either purified from their droſs, and fitted for good uſes, or elſe entirely burnt up and undone forever. Therefore may all who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under any kind of affliction, have reaſon to ſay with JOB—"when he hath tried me, I ſhall come forth as pure gold."</p>
               <p>LET a man live (ſays Mr. Steele) but two or three years without affliction, and he is almoſt good for nothing, he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon ſpiritual things; but let God ſmite him in his child, health, or eſtate; now he can find his tongue and affections again, now he awakes and falls to his duty in earneſt; now God has twice as much honour for him as he had before. Now, faith God, this amendment pleaſeth me, this rod was well beſtowed, I have diſappointed him in his great benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>IT may be boldly affirmed, that good men gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally reap more ſubſtantial benefit from their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, than bad men do from their proſperities; and what they loſe in wealth, pleaſure, or honor, they gain with vaſt advantage in wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tranquillity of mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028841_0007_0FDD1DE1133F46D0"/>
PROSPERITY is not without its troubles, nor adverſity without its comforts. A mind that can bear affliction without murmur, and the weight of a plentiful fortune without vain glory—that can be familiar without meanneſs, and reſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pride, has ſomething in it great, particularly pleaſing, and truly admirable.</p>
               <p>NOTHING would be more unhappy, (ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius) than a man who had never known afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The beſt need afflictions for the trial of their virtue: How can we exerciſe the grace of contentment, if all things ſucceed well? or, that of forgiveneſs if we have no enemies?</p>
               <p>HE who barely weeps at misfortunes, when it is in his power to heal them, is not touched with them to the heart, and only ſheds the tears of a crocodile.</p>
               <p>IF you are diſquieted at any thing, you ſhould conſider with yourſelf, Is this thing of that worth, that for it I ſhould ſo diſturb myſelf, and loſe my peace and tranquillity?</p>
               <p>THE conſideration of a greater evil, is a ſort of remedy againſt a leſſer. THEY are always im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by affliction, who are not improved by it. A virtuous man is more peaceable in adverſity, than a wicked man in proſperity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028841_0008_0FDD1E15A5E9DB38"/>
THE keeping of ourſelves above grief, and every painful paſſion, is indeed very beautiful and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; and none but ſouls of the firſt rate ſeem to be qualified for the undertaking.</p>
               <p>IT were no virtue to bear calamities, if we did not feel them.</p>
               <p>DIVINE PROVIDENCE always places the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy near the evil; there is not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a bleſſing; nor any affliction for which virtue has not provided a remedy.</p>
               <p>IF ſome are refined like gold in the furnace of affliction, there are many more, that, like chaff, are conſumed in it.</p>
               <p>SORROW, when it is exceſſive, takes away fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from piety, vigour from action, health from the body, light from the reaſon, and repoſe from the conſcience. Reſignation to the divine will is a noble and needful leſſon.</p>
               <p>YET there is a gloomy pleaſure in being deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inconſolable. Melancholy ſtudies how to improve itſelf, and ſorrow finds wonderful relief in being more ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>To be afflicted with the afflicted, is an inſtance of humanity, and the demand of good nature and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028841_0009_0FDD1E1716A21910"/>
good breeding: Pity is but an imaginary aid; and yet, were it not for that, ſorrow would be many times utterly inſupportable.</p>
               <p>MIRTH is by no means a remedy for grief; on the contrary, it raiſes and inflames it. The only probable way I know of, to ſoften or cure grief in others, is by putting on an appearance of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it yourſelf; and you muſt beſides, talk fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and feelingly on the occaſion, and praiſe and blame as the ſufferer does; but then remember to make uſe of the opportunity this condeſcenſion and familiarity gives you, of leading him, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, into things and paſſages remote from his preſent bent of mind, and not unpleaſing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In this manner, and by this policy, you will be able to ſteal him away from his afflictions with his own approbation, and teach him to think and ſpeak of other things than that alone, which frets—or rather WRINGS his heart.</p>
               <p>NONE ſhould deſpair, becauſe God can help them, and none ſhould preſume becauſe, God can croſs them. A firm truſt in the aſſiſtance of an Almighty Being naturally produces patience, hope, chearfulneſs and all other diſpoſitions of mind, that alleviate thoſe calamities which we are not able to remove.</p>
               <p>

HE who is puffed up with the firſt gale of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, will bend beneath the firſt blaſt of adverſity.</p>
               <p>REPROOF in adverſity hath a double ſting.</p>
               <p>THERE is but one way of fortifying the ſoul againſt all gloomy preſages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by ſecuring to ourſelves the friendſhip and protection of that being who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of events, and governs futurity.</p>
               <p>EVENTS which have the appearance of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, often prove a happy ſource of future felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; this conſideration ſhould enable us to ſupport affliction with calmneſs and fortitude.</p>

               <p>AN angry man who ſuppreſſes his paſſions, thinks worſe than he ſpeaks, and an angry man that will chide, ſpeaks worſe than he thinks. A vindictive temper is not only uneaſy to others, but to them that have it.</p>

IN all things miſtakes are excuſable; but an error that proceeds from any good principle leaves no room for reſentment.</p>
               <p>IT was a good method obſerved by Socrates, when he found in himſelf any diſpoſition to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he would check it by ſpeaking low, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the motions of his diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>IT is much better to reprove ingenuouſly, than to be angry ſecretly.</p>
               <p>HE that waits for an opportunity of acting his revenge, watches to do himſelf a miſchief.</p>
               <p>BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but by paſſing it over, he is ſuperior.—</p>
               <p>IT is the only valour to remit a wrong; and the greateſt applauſe that I might hurt and would not.</p>
               <p>To be able to bear provocation, is an argument of great wiſdom; and to forgive it, of a great mind.</p>
               <p>THEY who will be angry for any thing, will be angry for nothing.</p>

               <head>BEAUTY.</head>
               <p>THERE is nothing that gives us ſo pleaſing a proſpect of human nature, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of wiſdom and beauty. Beauty is an overweaning, ſelf-ſufficient thing, careleſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding itſelf any more ſubſtantial ornament; nay, ſo little does it conſult its own intereſt, that it too often defeats itſelf by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and deſirable. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore virtue makes a beautiful woman appear more beautiful, ſo beauty makes a virtuous woman really more virtuous.</p>
               <p>IT is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that ſex, which was created to refine the joys, and ſoften the cares of human nature, by the moſt agreeable participation, to conſider them merely as objects of ſight. This is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028841_0017_0FDD1EAB9A801690"/>
with their pictures. How much nobler is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our eſteem and love, while it draws our obſervation? How faint and ſpiritleſs are the charms of the coquet, when compared with the real lovelineſs of innocence, piety, good humour, the irreſiſtable charms of modeſty unaffected, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, with all thoſe rare and pleaſing marks of ſenſibility; virtues, which add a new ſoftneſs to her ſex; and even beautify her beauty.</p>
               <p>NOTHING (ſays Mr. Addiſon) can atone for the want of modeſty and innocence, without which, beauty is ungraceful and quality contemptible.</p>
               <p>LET a women be decked with all the embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of art and care of nature; yet if boldneſs be to be read in her face, it blots all the lines of beauty.</p>
               <p>THE plainer the dreſs, with greater luſtre does beauty appear: Virtue is the greateſt ornament, and good ſenſe the beſt equipage.</p>
               <p>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of temper in a woman, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it inviſible.</p>
               <p>IT is but too ſeldom ſeen, that beautiful perſons are otherwiſe of great virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028841_0018_0FDD1EAD1E575968"/>
No beauty hath any charms equal to the inward beauty of the mind. A gracefulneſs in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is much more engaging than that of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the former every one has the power to attain to in ſome meaſure, the latter is in no one's power,—is no internal worth, and was the gift of God, who formed us all. Meekneſs and modeſty are the true and laſting ornaments.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Virtue's the chiefeſt beauty of the mind,</l>
                  <l>The nobleſt ornament of human kind.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>BEAUTY inſpires a pleaſing ſentiment, which prepoſſeſſes people in its favour. Modeſty has great advantages, it ſets off beauty, and ſerves as a veil to uglineſs. The misfortune of uglineſs is, that it ſometimes ſmothers and buries much merit; people do not look for the engaging qualities of the head and heart in a forbidding figure. 'Tis no eaſy matter when merit muſt make its way, and ſhine through a diſagreeable outſide.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT virtue, good ſenſe and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, the fineſt ſet of features will, ere long ceaſe to pleaſe; but, where theſe with the graces are united, it muſt afford an agreeable and pleaſing contemplation.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>BEAUTY without the graces of the mind, will have no power over the hearts of the wiſe and good. Beauty is a flower which ſoon withers, health changes, and ſtrength abates, but innocency is immortal, and a comfort both in life and death.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let us ſuppoſe the virtuous mind a roſe,</l>

               <p>THERE are emanations from the mind, which, like a ray of celeſtial fire, animate the form of beauty; without theſe the moſt perfect ſymmetry is but a moulded clod; and whenever they appear, the moſt indifferent features acquire a ſpirit of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,

               <p>THE greateſt benefits of all, have no witneſs, but lie concealed in the conſcience.</p>
               <p>A KIND benefactor makes a man happy as ſoon as he can, and as much as he can. There ſhould be no delay in a benefit, but the modeſty of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. If we cannot foreſee the requeſt, let us however immediately grant it. It is ſo grievous a thing to ſay, I beg!—The very word puts a man out of countenance, and it is a double kindneſs to do the thing, and ſave an honeſt heart the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a bluſh.</p>

IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in duſt.</p>
               <p>THE following fact, I think, ſtrongly delineates the image of a noble and generous mind, and may juſtly be ranked among the beauties of STERNE—ſo deſervedly famed for his humanity, ſenſibility and generoſity. A friend of this benevolent <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> being diſtreſſed in finances, and whom Sterne wiſhed to relieve, (for Sterne could not be happy while a <hi>friend</hi> was diſtreſt,) but it was not in his power at that time!—Yet,—the <hi>friend!</hi>—a friend muſt be relieved at all hazards!—"A friend is ſacred!"—Sterne finds no reſt till 'tis done.—"I was" (ſays he) "obliged to borrow two hundred pounds beyond my own currency, upon the occaſion. I had no ſufficient ſecurity to proffer; but Captain Le Fevre happened luckily juſt then, to have ſold out of the army—<hi>I mortga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſtory to him,</hi> and he lent me the money." The friend and Sterne, were each relieved—Sterne was the happieſt of the two.</p>
               <p>LET us be careful that we permit no artificial deſires to prevent us of the power, in which we ſhall ever find real pleaſure—that of relieving diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THAT which is given with pride and oftenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is rather an ambition than a bounty. Let a
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028841_0023_0FDDDA216B76F400"/>
benefit be ever ſo conſiderable, the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it is yet the nobleſt part.</p>
               <p>IT is a good rule for every one who has a competency of fortune, to lay aſide a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his income for pious and charitable uſes; he will then always give eaſily and chearfully.</p>
               <p>IT was well ſaid of him that called a good office that was done harſhly, "a ſtony piece of bread:" It is neceſſary for him that is hungry to receive it, but it almoſt chokes him in the going down.</p>
               <p>ALPHONSO, king of Scicily, being aſked, What he would reſerve for himſelf, who gave ſo much away? Even thoſe things, ſaid he, that I do give, for the reſt I eſteem as nothing.</p>
               <p>IT is a much greater kindneſs not to ſuffer us to fall, than to lend a hand to help us up, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſatisfaction to be kindly received, and obtain nothing, than obtain what we deſire, after having been expoſed.</p>
               <p>REQUESTS coſt a reluctancy in nature, fearing to receive the diſcourteſy of a denial. That which is beſtowed too late, is next to not giving.</p>
               <p>MONARCHS are unhappier than their ſubjects.—For uſe makes ſtate familiar, and the fatigue grows every day more irkſome.—Has opulence and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur then no advantages? NONE—but the power of doing good. I have often been ſurpriſed that ſo

               <p>THERE is no end of books. Many libraries are furniſhed for ſight and oſtentation, rather than uſe; the very indexes not to be read over in an age: And in this multitude, how great a part of them are either dangerous, or not worth reading! A few books well choſen, and well made uſe of, will be more profitable than a great confuſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrian library.</p>
               <p>SUCH books as teach ſapience and prudence, and ſerve to eradicate errors and vices, are the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028841_0028_0FDDDA2E40AF81B0"/>
moſt profitable writings in the world, and ought to be valued and ſtudied more than all others whatſoever.</p>
               <p>IN vain do we look for true and laſting ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in any other books than the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein are contained all that is neceſſary to the happineſs of this life, and the life hereafter.</p>
               <p>SOME <hi>will read over, or rather over read a book, with a view only to find fault, like a venomous ſpider, extracting a poiſonous quality, where the induſtrious bee ſips out a ſweet and profitable juice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A GREAT many people are too fond of books, as they are of furniture, to dreſs and ſet off their rooms, more than to adorn and enrich their minds.</p>
               <p>NEXT to the ſtudy of the Holy Scriptures, it may not be amiſs to recommend the reading of a little poetry, properly choſen. The faculty in which <hi>women</hi> moſt excel (ſays the admirable—the judicious Mrs. Chapone) is that of imagination—and when properly cultivated, it becomes the ſource of all that is charming in ſociety.—Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you can read will ſo much contribute to the improvement of this faculty, as <hi>poetry</hi>—which if applied to its true ends, adds a thouſand charms to thoſe ſentiments of religon, virtue, generoſity
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028841_0029_0FDDDA32C4BFE970"/>
and delicate tenderneſs, by which the human ſoul is exalted and refined.</p>
               <p>NATURAL philoſophy, the ſtudy of nature, moral philoſophy, &amp;c. are ſtrongly recommended, in an elegant, refined, and ſublime ſtyle, by the amiable lady above mentioned: As alſo the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Spectators, Guardians, Ramblers,</hi> and <hi>Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers,</hi> as particularly uſeful to young people, &amp;c. Nor would I by any means (ſhe adds) exclude that kind of reading which young people are nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally moſt fond of, though I think the greateſt care ſhould be taken in the choice of thoſe <hi>ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſtories,</hi> that ſo enchant the mind, moſt of which tend to inflame the paſſions of youth, whilſt the chief purpoſe of <hi>education</hi> ſhould be to moderate and reſtrain them.

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028841_0039_0FDDDA4B87CC1030"/>
without bread to give them—unable, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of better days, to dig;—to beg, aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When we enter the houſe of mourning ſuch as this—it is impoſſible to inſult the unfortunate even with an improper look. Under what levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diſſipation of heart ſuch objects catch our eye—they catch likewiſe our attentions, collect and call home our ſcattered thoughts, and exerciſe them with wiſdom. A tranſient ſcene of diſtreſs ſuch as is here ſketched, how ſoon does it furniſh materials to ſet the mind at work, how neceſſarily does it engage it to the conſideration of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and misfortunes, the dangers and calamities, to which the life of man is ſubject! By holding up ſuch a glaſs before it, it forces the mind to ſee and reflect upon the vanity—the periſhing condition, and uncertain tenor of every thing in this world.

think before, how penſive is it now! how ſoft, how ſuſceptible, how full of religious impreſſions! how deeply is it ſmitten with a ſenſe, and with a love of virtue!—Without this end, ſorrow, I own, has no uſe, but to ſhorten our days, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>LET any who is converſant in the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life reflect upon it, and he will find—the man life who wants mercy, has a taſte for no other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of any kind: There is a natural diſreliſh of every thing which is good in his very nature, and he is born an enemy to the world, he is ever extremely partial to himſelf, in all his actions, and has no ſenſe of iniquity but from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhall attend it: The law of the land is his goſpel; and all his caſes of conſcience are determined by his attorney: Such men know not what it is to gladden the heart of the miſerable.</p>

               <p>NUMA POMPILIUS thought the company of good men ſo real a pleaſure, that he eſteemed it preferable to a diadem. And when the Roman ambaſſadors ſolicited him to accept of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he frankly declared, among other reaſons for declining it, the converſation of men, who aſſemble

together to worſhip God, and to maintain an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able charity, was his buſineſs and delight.</p>
               <p>IT often happens in company, as in apothecaries' ſhops, that thoſe pots which are empty, are as gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dreſſed and flouriſhed, as thoſe that are full.</p>
               <p>THE life of all life is ſociety; of ſociety, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; of freedom, the diſcreet and moderate uſe of it.</p>
               <p>FROM ill air we take diſeaſes; from ill company, vices and imperfections. The beſt knowledge of behaviour is, obſerving decency. Complaiſance renders a ſuperior amiable, an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable.</p>
               <p>A MAN without complaiſance ought to have much merit in the room of it.</p>
               <p>A WELL bred man, ſays Montaigne, is always ſociable and complaiſant.</p>
               <p>HE that is not ſo exact as to pleaſe, ſhould at leaſt be ſo affable as not to diſoblige.</p>
               <p>IT is beſt mourning when alone, and beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing when in company.</p>

CONSCIENCE is a high and awful power, it is next and immediately under God, our Judge; the voice of conſcience is the voice of God; what it bindeth or looſeneth, is accordingly bound or looſened in heaven, 1 John iii. 21. The greateſt deferance and preciſe obedience is due to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Its conſolations are of all, the moſt ſweet: and its condemnations the moſt terrible.</p>
               <p>WHEREVER you go, conſcience accompanies you, whatever you ſay, do, or but think, it regiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and records in order to the day of account; when all friends forſake you, when even your ſoul forſakes your body, conſcience will not, cannot forſake you; when your body is weakeſt and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, your conſcience is then moſt vigorous and active. Never more life in the conſcience than when death makes its neareſt approach to the body. When it ſmiles, cheers, acquits and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, O what a heaven doth it create within; and when it frowns, condemns and terrifies, how are our pleaſures, joys and delights of this world clouded, and even benighted! 'tis certainly the beſt of friends, or the worſt of enemies in the whole creation.</p>

               <p>THERE is no true felicity, but in a clear and open conſcience, and thoſe are the happy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, where only ſuch things are ſpoken and heard, as we can reflect upon after with ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, free from any ſhame, or mixture of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

A GOOD conſcience is to the ſoul what health is to the body. It preſerves a conſtant eaſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity within us, and more than countervails all the calamities and afflictions that can befal us.</p>
               <p>No line holds the anchor of contentment ſo faſt as a good conſcience. This cable is ſo ſtrong and compact, that when force is offered to it, the ſtraining rather ſtrengthens, by uniting the parts more cloſe.</p>
               <p>IT fareth with men of an evil conſcience, when they muſt die, as it does with riotous ſpendthrifts, when they muſt pay their debts; they will not come to an account, for the diſtruſt they have of their ability to ſatisfy for what they have done.</p>
               <p>MOST men fear a bad name, but few fear their conſciences.</p>
               <p>NO man ever offended his own conſcience, but firſt or laſt it was revenged upon him for it.</p>
               <p>CONSCIENCE is the gift of the Almighty: That moral inſpector is not more ſevere as an enemy, than kind as a friend; was it not this that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ſufferer of Uz, and was he not ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the ſuffrage of conſcience, when he wiſhed that man might be permitted to plead his cauſe with God?</p>

               <p>IT is highly requiſite to avoid too much famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity in converſation. It is an old Engliſh adage, <hi>"too much familiarity breeds contempt,"</hi> ſo he that familiarizes himſelf, preſently loſes his ſuperiority, that his ſerious air, and good deportment gave him, and conſequently his credit. The more common human things are, the leſs they are eſteemed; for communication diſcovers imperfections that a prudent reſerve concealed. We muſt not be too familiar with ſuperiors, becauſe of danger; nor with inferiors by reaſon of indecency; and far leſs with mean people, whom ignorance renders inſolent; for, being inſenſible of the <hi>honours</hi> done them, they preſume it is their due.</p>
               <p>IN your diſcourſe be cautious what you ſpeak, and to whom you ſpeak; how you ſpeak, and when you ſpeak; and what you ſpeak, ſpeak
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028841_0053_0FDDDA6DA9825BA8"/>
wiſely, ſpeak truly. A fool's heart is in his tongue, but a wiſe man's tongue is in his heart.</p>
               <p>PLUTARCH adviſes to moderate and correct all baſe, unworthy and hurtful paſſions, that in all our converſations we may be open hearted and ſincere, and not ſeek to overreach or deceive others in any of our dealings.</p>
               <p>LET all your converſation with men be ſober and ſincere; your devotion to God dutiful and decent; let the one be hearty and not haughty, let the other be humble, but not homely. So live with men as if God ſaw you, ſo pray to God as if men heard you.</p>
               <p>NOTHING more engages the affections of men, than a handſome addreſs and graceful converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>OUR converſation ſhould be ſuch, that youth may therein find improvement, women modeſty, the aged reſpect, and all men civility.</p>
               <p>TALKATIVENESS is uſually called a feminine vice, but it is poſſible to go into maſculine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, where it will be as hard to wedge in a word as at a female goſſoping.</p>
               <p>CONTROVERSIES for the moſt part, leave truth in the middle, and are factious at both ends.</p>
               <p>

VILE and debauched expreſſions are the ſure marks of an abject and grovelling mind, and the filthy overflowing of a vicious heart.</p>
               <p>SPEAK always according to your conſcience, but let it be done in terms of good nature, civility and good manners.</p>
               <p>IT is a ſure method of obliging in converſation, to ſhew a pleaſure in giving attention.</p>
               <p>AS men of ſenſe ſay much in few words; ſo the half witted have a talent of talking much, and yet ſay nothing.</p>
               <p>SOME men are ſilent for want of matter, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; and again ſome are talkative for want of ſenſe.</p>
               <p>MODESTY in your diſcourſe will give a luſtre to truth, and an excuſe to your errors.</p>
               <p>MUCH tongue and much judgment ſeldom go together, for talking and thinking are two quite different faculties, and there is commonly more depth where there is leſs noiſe.</p>
               <p>BUFFOONERY and ſcurrility are the corrupters of wit, as knavery is of wiſdom. Some are ſo black in the mouth, as to utter ſcarce any thing that is decent; ſupplying want of ſenſe with want of modeſty, and want of reputation with want of ſhame.</p>
               <p>

IT is a fair ſtep towards happineſs and virtue, to delight in the converſation of good and wiſe men; and where that cannot be had, the next point is, to keep no company at all.</p>
               <p>DISCRETION of ſpeech is more than eloquence; and to ſpeak agreeably, is more than to ſpeak in exact order.</p>
               <p>THE value of things are not in their ſize, but quality, and ſo of reaſon, which wrapped in few words, hath the greater weight.</p>
               <p>A MAN may contemplate on virtue in ſolitude and retirement; but the practical part conſiſts in its participation, and the ſociety it hath with others; for whatever is good, is the better for being communicable.</p>
               <p>THE talent of turning men into ridicule, and expoſing thoſe we converſe with, is the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of little ungenerous tempers.</p>
               <p>IN diſputes men ſhould give ſoft words, and hard arguments, they ſhould not ſo much ſtrive to vex, as to convince an enemy.</p>
               <p>WHEREVER the ſpeech is corrupted, ſo is the mind.</p>
               <p>IN heat of argument, men are commonly as tho' they were tied back to back, cloſe joined, and yet they cannot ſee each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:028841_0056_0FDDDA746BFA77F8"/>
FAMILIAR converſation ought to be the ſchool of learning and good breeding. A man ought to make his maſters of his friends, ſeaſoning the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of converſe, with the profit of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>PLEASURE given in ſociety, like money lent to uſury, returns with intereſt to thoſe who diſperſe it.</p>
               <p>MODESTY ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from an auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward baſhfulneſs, and ſilence ſhould only be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined when it would be froward and impertinent to talk; if you ſpeak without conceit or affectation, you will always be more pleaſing than thoſe who ſit like ſtatues without ſenſe or motion. When you are ſilent, your looks ſhould ſhew your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preſence to the company.

               <p>CONVERSATION may be divided into two claſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es—the familiar and the ſentimental.</p>
               <p>IT is the province of the familiar, to diffuſe cheerfulneſs and eaſe—to open the heart of man to man, and to beam a temperate ſunſhine upon the mind.</p>
               <p>NATURE and art muſt conſpire to render us ſuſceptible of the charms, and to qualify us for the practice of the ſecond claſs of converſation here termed ſentimental.</p>
               <p>TO good ſenſe, lively feeling and natural delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of taſte, muſt be united an expanſion of mind,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028841_0057_0FDDDA762A0F70D8"/>
and a reſinement of thought, which is the reſult of high cultivation. To render this ſort of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation irreſiſtably attractive, a knowledge of the world is requiſite, and that enchanting eaſe, that elegance of manner, which is to be acquired only by frequenting the higher circles of poliſhed life. In ſentimental converſation, ſubjects intereſting to the heart and to the imagination, are brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; they are diſcuſſed in a kind of ſportive way, with animation and refinement, and are nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continued longer than politeneſs allows: Here fancy flouriſhes—the ſenſibilities expand—and wit guided by delicacy and embelliſhed by taſte—points to the heart.</p>

                  <l>For he that would be rich, brooks no delay,</l>
                  <l>But drives o'er all, and takes the ſhorteſt way:</l>

                  <l>The greedy wretch in full purſuit of gain.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>IT is almoſt a wonder that covetouſneſs, even in ſpite of itſelf, does not at ſome times argue a man into charity, by its own principle of looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the firm expectation it would delight in, of receiving its own again with uſury.</p>

               <head>COURAGE.</head>
               <p>ALL true Courage is derived from virtue, and honour from integrity.</p>
               <p>IF you deſire to be magnanimous, undertake nothing raſhly, and fear nothing you undertake; fear nothing but infamy, dare any thing but injury.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028841_0060_0FDDDA7C5BED5A60"/>
The meaſure of magnanimity is to be neither raſh nor timorous; for magnanimity or true courage, which is an eſſential character in a ſoldier, is not a ſavage ferocious violence—not a fool hardy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility of danger, or head ſtrong raſhneſs to run into it; not the fury of inflamed paſſions, broke looſe from the government of reaſon—but a calm, deliberate, rational courage, a ſteady, judic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, thoughtful fortitude; the courage of a man, and not that of a tyger.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let us appear, nor raſh, nor indifferent,</l>
                  <l>Immoderate valour ſwells into a fault;</l>

               <p>COURAGE certainly is of no ſex, but a faculty of the ſoul; and however cuſtom may depreſs, or diſcourage it in females, it certainly belongs to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature in general. If men poſſeſs a more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined courage in perils, which they foreſee, women are allowed to be bleſſed with a ſuperior preſence of mind in ſudden dangers; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the latter is one of the moſt diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of real courage.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Preſence of mind, and courage in diſtreſs,</l>

               <head>CHARITY.</head>
               <p>CHARITY makes the beſt conſtruction of things and perſons, excuſes weakneſs, extenuates miſcarriages, makes the beſt of every thing, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives every one, and ſerves all.</p>
               <p>IN order to our final doom and ſentence, we need but this one enquiry, whether we were char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable or uncharitable? For they who are poſſeſſed with a true divine charity, have all chriſtian graces. They who have not this divine principle have no good in them, and that is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, without enquiring what evil they have done.</p>
               <p>

WHEN a compaſſionate man falls, who would not pity him! Who that had power to do it, would not befriend and raiſe him up? Or could the moſt barbarous tempter offer an inſult to his diſtreſs, without pain and reluctance? True charity is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unwilling to find excuſes;—in generous ſpirits, compaſſion is ſometimes an over balance for ſelf preſervation: God certainly interwove that friendly ſoftneſs in our nature, to be a check upon too great a propenſity towards ſelf love.</p>
               <p>UNDER the goſpel, God is pleaſed with a living ſacrifice; but the offerings of the dead, ſuch as teſtamentary charities are, which are intended to have no effect ſo long as we live, are no better than dead ſacrifices; and it may be queſtioned, whether they will be brought into the account of our lives, if we do no good while we are living. Theſe death bed charities, are too like a death bed repentance; men ſeem to give their eſtates to God and the poor, juſt as they part with their ſins—when they can keep them no longer.</p>
               <p>CHARITY obliges us not to diſtruſt a man, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not to truſt a man before we know him.</p>
               <p>THE firſt duty of man next to that of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Deity, is, miniſtering to the neceſſities of his fellow creatures.</p>

ARE we not all citizens of the world? Are we not all fellow ſubjects of the univerſal monarch? Is not the univerſe our home? And is not every man a brother?

They who die well have lived long enough; as ſoon as death enters upon the ſtage, the tragedy of life is done. There are a great many miſeries which nothing but death can give relief to. This puts an end to the ſorrows of the afflicted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed. It ſets priſoners at liberty; it dries up the tears of the widows and the fatherleſs; it eaſes the complaints of the hungry and naked; it tames the proudeſt tyrants, and puts an end to all our labours: And the contemplation on it, ſupports men under their preſent adverſities, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they have a proſpect of a better life after this.</p>

Every night before I addreſs myſelf to my Creator, I lay my hand upon my heart, and aſk myſelf, whether, if God ſhould require my ſoul of me this night, I could hope for mercy from him. The bitter agonies

I underwent in this my firſt acquaintance with myſelf, were ſo far from throwing me into deſpair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that it proved motives of greater circumſpection in my future conduct. The oftener I exerciſed myſelf in meditations of this kind, the leſs was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at firſt ſo terrible and ſhooking, is now become the ſweeteſt of my enjoyments.

POSTERITY wiſely regulates the rewards due to men of learning, and equals them to the greateſt princes: Three thouſand years after their death, their honour is not tarniſhed by that of the greateſt heroes. Homer is as well known as Achilles. The able hiſtorian, the famous poet, the great—the pious and ingenious philoſopher have an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over the conqueror and the general. Twenty centuries after they are dead and rotten they ſpeak with as much eloquence and vivacity as when liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and all that read their writings perceive their genius. The heroes who have rendered themſelves famous by their actions, have not near ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over our hearts; for he, at one and the ſame inſtant, perſuades, engages and captivates the heart of one man ſhut up in his cloſet at Stockholm, and of another that lives in the middle of Paris, London, &amp;c. &amp;c. Heroes are infinitely obliged to poets and hiſtorians, but the latter are ſeldom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the former. Achilles owes part of his glory to Homer: If there had been no hiſtorians, it would ſcarce have been known that there ever was ſuch a man as Alexander, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>EDUCATION is the ruling motive in moſt of the actions of mankind; they are more or leſs tractable, according as they have been more or leſs cultivated in their youth. When they have been taught early to render themſelves ſociable, to bend
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028841_0074_0FDDDA9FC7CC71D8"/>
their tempers, and to accomodate their wills to thoſe of others, it grows into a cuſtom, and they become inſenſibly complaiſant, without thinking of being ſo. In ſhort, habit is to them a ſecond nature.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould juſtly conſider religion as the moſt eſſentially neceſſary qualification, at the ſame time children ſhould be fitted for an appearance becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtation in this world. Many are apt to diſjoin the ideas of piety and politeneſs, but true religion is not only conſiſtent with, but <hi>neceſſary to</hi> the perfection of true politeneſs.</p>
               <p>THE end of learning is, to know God, and, in conſequence of that knowledge to love him, and to imitate him, as we may the nearer, by poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves of virtue.</p>
               <p>WHAT ſculpture is to a block of marble, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is to the human ſoul. The philoſopher, the ſaint, the hero, the wiſe, the good, or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian; which a proper education might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interred and brought to light.</p>
               <p>THE educator's care ſhould be, above all things to lay in his charge the foundation of religion and virtue.</p>
               <p>PARENTS are more careful to beſtow wit on their children, than virtue; the art of ſpeaking
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028841_0075_0FDDDAA0F5C3FE08"/>
well, rather than doing well; but their morals ought to be their greateſt concern.</p>
               <p>AN induſtrious and virtuous education of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is a better inheritance for them than a great eſtate. To what purpoſe is it, ſaid Crates, to heap up eſtates, and have no care what kind of heirs they leave them to?</p>
               <p>THE higheſt learning is to be wiſe, and the greateſt wiſdom to be good.</p>
               <p>THE great buſineſs of man is, to improve his mind and govern his manners.</p>
               <p>EXCESS of ceremony ſhows want of breeding. That civility is beſt, which excludes all ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous formality.</p>
               <p>TRUE philoſophy, ſays Plato, conſiſts more in fidelity, conſtancy, juſtice, ſincerity and in the love of our duty, than in a great capacity.</p>
               <p>If our painful peregrination in ſtudies be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſupreme light, it is nothing elſe but a a miſerable kind of wandering.</p>
               <p>THE mind ought ſometimes to be diverted, that it may turn to thinking the better.</p>
               <p>LEARNING is the dictionary, but ſenſe the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar of ſcience. Poetry is inſpiration—it was
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028841_0076_0FDDDAA47B6CC8A8"/>
breathed into the ſoul, when it firſt quickened, and ſhould neither be ſtyled art nor ſcience, but genius.</p>
               <p>GREAT men are always reſerved and modeſt, and being content with meriting praiſe, do not endeavour to court it; and for this they are the more praiſe worthy, becauſe if vanity <hi>is</hi> pardonable, it is in the man who deſerves thoſe ſhining com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, which are ſo becoming to many learned men. 'Tis ſaid, that Racine was a whole year in compoſing his tragedy of Phaedra, the maſter piece of the theatre, and before he committed it to the ſtage, conſulted his friends a long time, corrected ſeveral paſſages by their advice, and waited for the ſucceſs of his performance before he would preſume to pronounce it a good one. Prado wrote the ſame in a month's time; gave it out boldly to be acted, and aſſured the public it was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece. But it happened to him as it often does to all half witted authors; his work quickly went to the chandler's ſhops, whereas Racine's will reach to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
               <p>GREAT talents, ſuch as honour, virtue, learning and parts, are above the generality of the world who neither poſſeſs them themſelves, nor judge of them rightly in others: But all people are judges of the leſſer talents, ſuch as civility, affability and an obliging agreeable addreſs and manner: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028841_0077_0FDDDAA579FD5A28"/>
they feel the good effects of them, as mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſociety eaſy and pleaſing.</p>
               <p>ALMOST all the advantages or miſcarriages of our lives depend, in a great meaſure, upon our education. Therefore it is greatly the duty of all who have in <hi>any</hi> way the inſpection of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affair, by every means poſſible, to win young minds to improvement; to the end that good parts may not take an evil turn, nor indifferent ones be totally loſt for want of induſtrious cultivation.</p>
               <p>EDUCATION, when it works upon an ingenious mind, brings out to view every latent perfection, which, without ſuch helps are never able to make their appearance. And, if we take the trouble to look round, we ſhall find very few, to whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been ſuch a niggard of her gifts, that they are not capable of ſhining in one ſphere of ſcience or another: Since then there is a certain bias to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards knowledge, in almoſt every mind, which may be ſtrengthened and improved by proper care; ſure parents and others ſhould conſider, that, in the neglect of ſo eſſential a point, they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a private injury only, as thereby they ſtarve poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and defraud our country of thoſe perſons, who, under better management, might perhaps make an eminent figure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:028841_0078_0FDDDAA9300ACC30"/>
INDEED, the difference in the manners and abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of men proceeds more from education, than from any imperfections or advantages derived from their original formation.</p>
               <p>YOUTH moreover is the proper and only ſeaſon for education; for if it be neglected then, it will ſurely be in vain to think of remedying the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in more advanced years; it will be too late to think of ſowing it, when maturity has rendered the mind ſtubborn and inflexible, and when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of receiving the ſeeds, it ſhould be bringing forth the fruits of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>BUT there is one point in the article of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is more eſſential than any of the reſt: I mean the great care that ought to be taken to form youth to the principles of religion. Vice, if we may believe the general complaint, grows ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant now a days, that it is almoſt impoſſible to keep young people from the ſpreading contagion; if we venture them abroad, and truſt to chance or inclination, for the choice of their company; it is therefore virtue, and a perfect ſenſe of their duty to God, which is the great and valuable thing to be taught them. All other conſiderations and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments ſhould give way, and be poſtponed, to theſe; theſe are the ſolid and ſubſtantial good we ſhould labour to implant and faſten on their minds, neither ſhould we ceaſe till we have attained a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028841_0079_0FDDDAAC87BAE5A8"/>
true reliſh for them, and placed their ſtrength, their glory and their <hi>pleaſure in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is alſo of the firſt conſequence in training up youths of both ſexes, that they be early inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with humanity, and particularly that its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be implanted ſtrongly in their yet tender hearts, to guard them againſt inflicting wanton pain on thoſe animals, which uſe or accident may occaſionally put into their power.</p>

               <p>TAKE heed you harbour not that vice called Envy, leſt another's happineſs be your torment; and God's bleſſing become your curſe.—Spencer in his Fairy Queen gives the following deſcription of Envy:

                     <l>That all the poiſon ran about his jaw:</l>
                     <l>But inwardly he chew'd his own maw</l>

                     <l>But when he heard of harm he waxed wond'rous glad.</l>
                     <l>He hated all good works, and virtuous deeds,</l>
                     <l>And him no leſs than any like did uſe;</l>
                     <l>And who with gracious bread the hungry feeds,</l>
                     <l>His aims, for want of faith, he doth accuſe,</l>

               <p>VIRTUE is not ſecure againſt envy. Men will <hi>leſſen</hi> what they will not imitate. It is obſerved that the moſt cenſorious are generally the leaſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious; who having nothing to recommend themſelves, will be finding fault with others.</p>
               <p>NONE envy the merit of others, but who have little—or none at all themſelves. He that envies, makes another man's virtue his vice, and another man's happineſs his torment, whereas he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices at the proſperity of another, is partaker thereof.</p>
               <p>SOME people as much envy others a good name, as they want it themſelves, and perhaps that is the reaſon of it.</p>

               <p>ENVY is fixed only on merit; and, like a ſore eye, is offended with every thing that is bright.</p>
               <p>A MAN that hath no virtue in himſelf, envieth it in others.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>The man who envies, muſt behold with pain</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Friendſhip's a name to few confin'd,</l>
                  <l>The offſpring of a noble mind;</l>
                  <l>A generous warmth which fills the breaſt,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>FRIENDSHIP is a ſweet attraction of the heart, towards the merit we eſteem, or the perfections we admire; and produces a mutual inclination
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028841_0084_0FDDDAB6D998C7B8"/>
between two perſons, to promote each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, knowledge, virtue and happineſs.</p>
               <p>THERE'S nothing ſo common as pretences to friendſhip; though few know what it means, and fewer yet come up to its demands. By talking of it, we ſet ourſelves off; but when we enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, we ſee our defects; and when we engage in it, we muſt charge through abundance of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The veneration it has challenged in every age, (the moſt barbarous not excepted) is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony of its excellence: And the more valuable it is, the more are we concerned to be inſtructed in it.</p>
               <p>MONSIEUR DE SAOY in his eſſay upon friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, treats to this effect: The friendſhip which is to be recommended, is union of affections, ſpringing from a generous reſpect to virtue, and is maintained by a harmony of manners. It is a great miſtake to call every trifling commerce by this ſerious name; or to ſuppoſe that empty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments and viſits of ceremony, when no more is intended than to paſs the time, and ſhew the equipage, ſhould paſs for a real and well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friendſhip. The frequency of the practice will not wipe off the abſurdity:—There is as wide a difference between a bully and a man of honour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:028841_0085_0FDDDABA32EABAA0"/>
NOT that theſe amuſements are to be found fault with, the innocence and convenience of which protects them, when they paſs for nothing but what they are; but certainly they ought to be diſtinguiſhed from their betters; and the language and profeſſions bear a proportion to the real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion they have on our heart.</p>
               <p>CONFORMITY of inclination is the life of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>WHILST all are purſuing this common intereſt, all are travelling the ſame courſe, nothing can break the union of their affections and deſires. The danger is only from irregular motions, and forgetting from which they ſhould act. So long as we maintain a reſpect to this principle of union, and keep virtue on the throne, our humour and caprice will be checked and ſubdued. If intereſt can maintain and form ſocieties, as we find it does, why ſhould not thoſe who are actuated by a higher principle, (and with ſuch only is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) do as much, if not more.</p>
               <p>IT may be ſaid, from hence I conclude that all good men are friends, if virtue be the life of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The conſequence holds good as far as eſteem goes, if they knew one another, they would value one another. But though friendſhip is founded on eſteem, ſo much that it cannot otherways ſubſiſt,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028841_0086_0FDDDABB29F96450"/>
there goes however, ſomething more to form it, eſteem is a tribute due to merit in general; but friendſhip is an improvement made upon merit, and engages us in a very different degree.</p>
               <p>SUCH impreſſion has been made upon the heart as cannot be well deſcribed, and works like a mother's affection to her own children, above thoſe of ſtrangers, as amiable in themſelves. Thoſe who would have friendſhip confined to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt compaſs, have notions of it the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime; though number, if practicable, may be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſeful.</p>
               <p>FOR to have but one friend, may ſometimes be to have none, or, which is the ſame thing, none when we want him. The circumſtances of time, and place and ability too, make it proper that we have more than one bottom to venture in. The offices of friendſhip are various, to direct our choice, and rectify our miſtakes; to ſuſtain our misfortunes, moderate our joys and the like. This may poſſibly be better done by the care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of ſeveral. Not that I would have friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip governed by profit and convenience, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſo mean can produce nothing extraordinary. There is ſomething generous in the compoſition, that looks at another man's advantage as much as his own.</p>

AND that we may not talk without a precedent for what we ſay, the ſages of old, whoſe friendſhips were ſo well cultivated, and became ſo famous as to be handed down to the preſent time, even theirs were divided into ſeveral ſtreams. The moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite nations, and their <hi>philoſephers</hi> too, gave us examples of that ſort to build upon. It were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to determine, juſt how many make a ſufficient quantity of friends, ſome fix the number to three, others allowing a greater latitude, but this rule will ſerve us, <hi>the fewer the better;</hi> and he who thinks he has a great number of friends, has moſt reaſon to believe he has none. It was a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Socrates, when his houſe was thought too little "Would to God I could fill it with true friends;" ſaid he: After all, if one ſhould have a barn full, one would wiſh for no more than a cloſet would hold. Let the matter at leaſt turn upon this, ſetting aſide the reaſons I have offered:—The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty we ſhall find in the choice of our friends, will make us rejoice we have but few to chuſe, Of ſuch importance is the work, 'tis ſo hard to ſucceed, and ſo dangerous to miſcarry, ſo ſevere an inquiry into the inclination and merits of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the experience we muſt run through, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſafe in their hands, will convince us, that to gain three or four in the courſe of our life, is to employ it well. Whence is it, ſo many friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips

clapt up on a ſudden, which have the air of a veteran, not of a raw, undiſciplined affection; and look like the meeting of old friends, not of new ones; whence can it be, theſe ſo promiſing, and kindly advances ſhould ſo ſoon be overturned? 'tis becauſe they began too ſoon, and run up too faſt: And is there any myſtery in this, that time ſhould deſtroy what we ſet up without conſulting him? We meet, and at firſt ſight like one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er well, the next thing is to ſay ſo, the next in courſe to be <hi>dear friends.</hi> We vow and ſwear eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal amity; and when we go to conſidering, we find him out; we grow cool;—and at length come to hate him. We ſwing ourſelves up by main force, and our own weight brings us down again. Would you contract a friendſhip that ſhould laſt a long time, be a long time in contracting it.</p>
               <p>PLUTARCH thus deſcribes the perſon a friend ſhould be. As to the perſon of whom we are to make a friend, he muſt be endowed with virtue, as a thing in itſelf lovely and deſirable, which conſiſts of a ſweet and obliging temper of mind, a lively readineſs in doing good offices; than which qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications, nothing is more rarely found in nature. To this a familiar converſation muſt be added, for the perſon whom we deſire to make our friend, muſt not caſually be picked up at a tavern, or an

eating houſe, nor at a promiſcuous meeting at a horſe race; but one choſen upon long and mature deliberation, confirmed by ſettled converſe, and with whom, as the proverb ſays, "<hi>we have eaten a buſhel of ſalt.</hi>"</p>
               <p>FROM a vicious man I ſhould deſire to ſtand off altogether. By a vicious man I do not mean one liable to failings, as all men are, but one that acts without any regard to honour and conſcience. He's out of his element that makes an engagement that is not ſupported only by principles of virtue. True friendſhip juſtly founded is a bleſſing, in which virtue has the ſole property. And, as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has but few temporal rewards to propoſe, thoſe few are to be found no where elſe.</p>
               <p>EQUALITY of birth and fortune, is by ſome made a point neceſſary to a well inſtructed friendſhip, and it muſt be ſaid the rule ever to be embraced, if we could, when we pleaſed, find as good men of our own rank, as elſe where. But conſidering there are but few of any rank fit to be choſen, we ſhould look at the ſolid foundation of merit, and paſs by mere accompliſhments. We make no league with the coat of arms and liveries, but the man, and with that part of the man too, that is conſidered abſtractly from both. Theſe things are not fixed to the freehold.</p>

THE general duty of a friend is, an induſtrious purſuit of his friend's real advantages; fidelity in his truſts, aſſiſtance in all his wants, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant endeavour for his advancement in piety and virtue, for ſo cloſe is the connection, that this is the expreſſion of GOD himſelf ſpeaking of a friend: THY FRIEND, WHICH IS AS THINE OWN SOUL, Deut, xiii. 6.</p>
               <p>REVENGE (ſays de Sacy) which is never to be indulged, is between friends, moſt of all a crime, and yet it will ſometimes creep in, under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of juſtice; and here the eaſineſs of revenge may encourage us to it. We know the man to the bottom, and can therefore injure him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ways; but, this is ungenerous—inhuman! All that we can honourably allow ourſelves in, is to ſhew, by a genteel behaviour, what he has loſt, who has forfeited our friendſhip; by our gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conduct, to diſcover the fault is his, and make him ſuffer in the reproach of his own breaſt. To be unconcerned at his misfortunes, or ſucceſs; to look upon him with the averſion of an enemy, is paſſion and not juſt reſentment. His betraying your ſecrets will not juſtify you in expoſing his. You will meet with more favourable opinion from the beſt of men, while you are ſo generous to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer rather than retaliate. Whereas they will
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028841_0092_0FDDDAC9A8959E30"/>
think you deſerve ſuch uſage, if you can allow it in yourſelf. There is no relief but patience, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it otherwiſe, you open a door to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſorder. Friendſhip has no ſting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge affronts with, the remorſe which a guilty perſon feels, and the diſgrace he meets with abroad, if his character be known, is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſhould content ourſelves with inflicting.</p>
               <p>AMONG the friends we ſhould caſt off, I reckon thoſe that ſtick as long as fortune is kind, but turn with the tide and keep at a diſtance, thoſe flies that follow the honey pot while there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be had, and take leave when there is no more to be hoped for. A true friend may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, if in time of proſperity he ſeem to neglect you, but he is not worth having, who neglects you in diſtreſs; for 'tis then his duty comes on, when things go againſt you; to ſuſtain and comfort you when you are in trouble; and to bear a part of your burden.</p>
               <p>WE think we come up to the higheſt pitch of friendſhip, when our purſe is open to our friend. It is true, comparatively reckoning, he is a gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man that will do ſo much; but that is not enough, if to part with our money to thoſe who profeſs an affection for, be the higheſt piece of friendſhip, pray what muſt the loweſt be? Is it ſuch a mighty piece of buſineſs to do that for the deareſt perſon
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028841_0093_0FDD1DC493B34238"/>
on earth, which we do to gratify a vain humour? What common humanity or applauſe will put us upon, ſurely, amongſt friends, is not to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an act of tranſcendent kindneſs, when it is no more than giving to another ſelf, and paying of debts. Is there any thing more certainly a due, than what we are engaged to by the alliance of friendſhip: Let a man incur the diſpleaſure of his ſuperiors, and warmly embark in my ſervice, I will own ſuch a man to be a friend indeed, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and affectionate, one cannot praiſe him too much. Let him open his purſe to one he loves, this comes ſhort of the other. A man of honour upon a ſlender friendſhip, will do as much as this. To cry up the parting with our pence, for the higheſt ſacrifice that can be paid to friendſhip, is the ſign of a grovelling ſpirit, that knows not what is truly noble. The people of old had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter notions of the matter, who would borrow to give others in diſtreſs, and think they had done no more than their duty.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE, he that fails in this point, is not worth our acquaintance, he that deſerts a man to ſave his pocket, will never hazard life and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his ſervice. Virtue is the principle of union, but vice is often ſtrong enough to make a ſeparation. Adverſity is a time to try how ſincere the profeſſions were, if they paſs that teſt we may depend upon them.</p>

WITH three ſorts of men enter into no ſerious friendſhip, the ungrateful man, the multiloquous man and the coward. The firſt cannot prize your favours, the ſecond cannot keep your council and the third dares not vindicate your honour.</p>

               <p>O! HOW amiable is gratitude! eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially when it has the ſupreme benefactor for it, object. I have always looked upon gratitude as the moſt exalted principle that can actuate the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028841_0102_0FDD1DCC1165D798"/>
heart of man. It has ſomething in it noble, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, and (if I may be allowed the term) gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly devout. Repentance indicates our nature fallen, and prayer returns chiefly upon a regard of one's ſelf. But the exerciſe of gratitude ſubſiſted in Paradiſe, when there was no fault to deplore; and will be perpetuated in heaven, when God ſhall be "all in all."</p>
               <p>DEMOSTHENES ſaid, it becometh him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a benefit from another man, for ever to be ſenſible of it, but him that beſtowed it, preſently to forget it. He is unjuſt, ſaid Socrates who does not return deſerved thanks for any benefit, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he be a friend or a foe.</p>
               <p>THERE is no vice nor failing of man, that doth ſo much unprinciple humanity, as ingratitude: Since he who is guilty of it lives unworthy of his own ſoul, that hath not virtue enough to be obliged nor to acknowledge the true merits of the obliger.</p>
               <p>IT is a common thing for gratitude to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful, as for hope to be mindful.</p>
               <p>WITHOUT good nature and gratitude, man had as well live in a wilderneſs, as in a civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>HE who receives a good turn, ſhould never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it, he who does one, ſhould never remember it.</p>
               <p>IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in duſt.</p>

               <p>IT is the glory of gratitude, that it depends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the good will: If I have will to be grateful, ſays Senecca, I am ſo.</p>
               <p>IF gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his maker? The Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does not only confer upon us thoſe bounties which proceed more immediately from his hand, but even thoſe benefits which are conveyed to us by others. Every bleſſing we enjoy, by what means ſoever it may be derived upon us, is the gift of him who is the great author of good, and Father of mercies.</p>
               <p>GRATITUDE, when exerted towards one anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, naturally produces a very pleaſing ſenſation in the mind of a grateful man; it exalts the ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to rapture, when it is employed in this great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of gratitude; on this beneficent Being who has given us every thing we already poſſeſs, and from whom we expect every thing we hope for.</p>

               <p>WE read a pretty paſſage (ſays Philologus) of a certain Cardinal, who, by the multitude of his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous actions, gave occaſion for the world to call him "The patron of the poor." This eccleſiaſtic prince had a conſtant cuſtom once or twice a week, to give public audience to all indigent people in the hall of his palace, and to relieve every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their various neceſſities, or the motions of his own bounty. One day a poor widow, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by the fame of his generoſity, came into the hall of this cardinal, with her only child, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful maid, about fifteen years of age. When her turn came to be heard, among a croud of petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the cardinal diſcerning the marks of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary modeſty in her face and carriage, as alſo on her daughter, encouraged her to tell her wants freely—ſhe bluſhing—and, not without tears, thus addreſſed herſelf to him. "My lord, I owe for the rent of my houſe, five crowns, and
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028841_0106_0FDDDAE4691D0258"/>
ſuch is my misfortune, that I have no other means to pay it, ſave what would break my heart, ſince my landlord threatens to force me to it; that is, to proſtitute my only daughter, whom I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with great care, educated in virtue.—What I beg of your eminence is, that you would pleaſe to interpoſe your authority, and protect us from the violence of this cruel man, till, by our honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, we can procure the money for him." The cardinal, moved with admiration at the woman's virtue and innocent modeſty, bade her be of good courage; then he immediately wrote a billet, and giving it into the widow's hands, Go, ſaid he, to my ſteward, and he ſhall deliver thee five crowns to pay thy rent. The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the cardinal a thouſand thanks, went directly to his ſteward—and gave him the note, which when he had read, told her out fifty crowns. She, aſtoniſhed at the meaning of it, and fearing it was the ſteward's trick to try her honeſty, refuſed to take above five, ſaying, ſhe mentioned no more to tho cardinal; and ſhe was ſure it was ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. On the other ſide, the ſteward inſiſted on his maſter's order, not daring to call it in queſtion. But all the arguments he could uſe were inſuffic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ient to prevail on her to take more than five crowns. Wherefore, to end the controverſy, he offered to go back with her to the cardinal, and refer it to him. When they came before that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent

prince, and had fully informed him of the buſineſs;—it is true—ſaid he, I miſtook in writing fifty crowns. Give me the paper, and I will rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify it. There upon he wrote again; ſaying this to the woman, "So much candour and virtue deſerves a recompenſe. Here I have ordered you five hundred crowns. What you can ſpare of it, lay up as a dowry to give with your daughter in marriage.</p>

               <p>THE conferring of a happineſs on any creature, is certainly the higheſt enjoyment of the human mind! but the paying of it to an amiable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving object, muſt heighten the ſentiment even to tranſport.</p>

imputed this calamity to the hatred of the Chriſtians; and, without examining if ſuch an accuſation was well founded or not, ſeveral young people ran to the quarter inhabited by chriſtians, and ſet fire to it by way of repriſal.</p>
               <p>SUCH an outrage deſerved the ſevereſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The governor cauſed the perpetrators to be apprehended; but, as the number was very great, he could not reſolve to doom to death ſo many young perſons, who were hurried into this exceſs more by paſſion than malice.</p>

               <p>WHEN they had all drawn their lots out of the fatal urn, one of thoſe deſtined to death cried out in a tranſport of grief.

               <p>ONE of thoſe that had eſcaped death, replied to him that was lamenting his fate. "Friend, I have neither father nor mother; my life is of no uſe to any one; give me your lot, and take mine."

HE only is worthy of eſteem, that knows what is juſt and honeſt, and dares to do it; that is maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his own paſſions, and ſcorns to be ſlave to another's.

               <p>TRUE honour, (ſays Dr. Hildrup) is ſeated in the ſoul. It is a kind of <hi>ſons-perſennis</hi> riſing from a generous heart, and flowing with a natural and eaſy deſcent into all the different traces of life, and channels of duty; refreſhing, invigorating, and adorning all the faculties of the ſoul, language of the tongue, the very air of the face, and motion of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028841_0112_0FDDDAF56B677B10"/>
the body. It diſplays itſelf in a natural unaffected greatneſs and firmneſs of mind, improved by a train of wiſe and religious reflections, and generous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which perſonal virtue and real merit tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſt.</p>
               <p>THE bulk of mankind are caught by ſhew. The pompous ſound of titles, and glitter of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſtrike their ſenſes, attract their attention, raiſe their admiration, and extort from them all that reverence which is due only to eminent and diſtingiſhed merit; while real virtue and true honour paſs ſilently through the world, unheeded and unregarded, but by the happy and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing few, who are ſenſible of its merit, or enjoy the bleſſed communication of its influence.</p>
               <p>FOR to do good, to be lovers of mankind, to alleviate the diſtreſſes, and promote the peace and happineſs of our fellow creatures, is the higheſt honour, the nobleſt ambition that can enter into the heart of man. But the bulk of mankind judge otherwiſe. Noiſe and ſhew, title and equipage, glitter and grandeur, conſtitute the whole idea of honour; and whoever can command an intereſt ſufficient to procure, and an affluence ſufficient to ſupport them, becomes thereby not only a man of honour, but even a ſubordinate fountain of honour, enabled to produce others after his kind, and
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028841_0113_0FDDDAF72BAC05F0"/>
propagate the <hi>honourable</hi> ſpecies from generation to generation.</p>
               <p>THE man of honour is an internal, the perſon of honour an external; the one a real the other a fictitious character. I am therefore never ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee or hear ſuch things attempted, ſaid, and done by a perſon of honour, which a man of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our would bluſh to think of.</p>
               <p>A PERSON of honour may be a prophane irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious libertine; a penurious, proud, revengeful coward; may inſult his inferiors, oppreſs his tenants and ſervants, debauch his neighbours wives and daughters, defraud his creditors, and proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute his public faith for a protection, may aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with ſots and drunkards, ſharpers and game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in order to increaſe his fortune; I ſay, it is not impoſſible but that a perſon of honour may be guilty of all theſe; but it is abſolutely impoſſible for a man of honour to be guilty of any one of them.</p>

Ignorance is mere privation, by which nothing can be produced; it is a vanity in which the ſoul ſits motionleſs and torped for want of attraction; and without knowing why, we always rejoice when we learn, and grieve when we forget. I am therefore inclined to conclude, that if nothing counteracts the natural conſequence of learning, we grow more happy as our minds take a wider range.</p>
               <p>KNOWLEDGE will ſoon become folly, when good ſenſe ceaſes to be its guardian. The true knowledge of God and yourſelf, are true teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of your being in the high road to ſalvation; that breeds in you a filial love, this a filial fear; the ignorance of yourſelf is the beginning of all ſin, and the ignorance of God, is the perfection of all evil.</p>

               <p>LOVE founded on external charms, and which only ſeeks the gratification of the ſenſes, will ſoon change its object, and be pleaſed with novelty: but where eſteem is the baſis of love, when it is founded on virtue—accompanied by all thoſe ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and endearing qualities of the head and heart and mind enlarged, ſurely that affection—that friendſhip cannot die—it can never fall, while thoſe virtues remain on which it is built—by which it is enlarged, ſtrengthened and ſupported.</p>

               <p>THE three great ſprings of love to God are theſe; A clear diſcovery of what God is in himſelf; a lively ſenſe of what he has done for us, and a well grounded hope of what he will do for us. Where the love of God reigns in the affections, it will command all the powers of nature, and all the reſt of the paſſions to act ſuitably to this ſovereign and all ruling affection of love. The eye will often look up to God in a way of humble dependence; the ear will be attentive to his holy word; the hands will be lifted up to heaven in daily requeſts; the knees will be bent in humble worſhip; all the outward powers will be buiſy in doing the will of God, and promoting his glory. He that loves God will keep his commandments, and fulfil every preſent duty with delight: He will endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to pleaſe God in all his actions, and watch againſt and avoid whatever may offend him; and while the ſeveral outward powers are thus engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all the inward affections of nature will be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in correſponding exerciſes. Supreme love will govern all the active train of human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and lead them captive to chearful obedience,</p>

HOW ſenſeleſs and abſurd is the pretence to love God above all things, if we do not reſolve to live upon him as our hope and happineſs; if we do not chuſe him to be our God and our all, our chief and all ſufficient good in this world, and that which is to come! Where the idea of God, as a Being of ſupreme excellence, doth not reign in the mind, where the will is not determined and fixed on him as our ſupreme good, men are ſtrangers to that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and divine affection of love. 'Till this be done, we cannot be ſaid to love God with all our heart.</p>
               <p>HOW neceſſary and uſeful a practice it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a chriſtian to meditate often on the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent perfections and worth of the bleſſed God, to ſurvey his attributes, and his grace in Chriſt Jeſus; to keep in mind a conſtant idea of his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme excellence, and frequently to repeat and confirm the choice of him as our higheſt hopes, our portion and our everlaſting good! This will keep the love of God warm at heart, and maintain the divine affection in its primitive life and vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But if our ideas of the adorable and ſupreme excellence of God grow ſaint and feeble, and ſink lower in the mind; if we loſe the ſight of his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able glories, the ſenſe of his amazing love in the goſpel, his rich promiſes, and alluring grace; if we ſhall abate the fervency of this ſacred paſſion,

our love to God grows cold by degrees, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers great and gradual decays.</p>
               <p>WHAT thanks do we owe to God, who, though we are ſo much indebted to him, demands only our love, to pay off all our debts upon this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; doth he not ſhew us, by placing the precept of love above all others, how, poor and inſolvent as we are, we may clear ourſelves of all that we owe him?</p>
               <p>IT is ſurely impoſſible to read the life and death of our bleſſed Saviour, without renewing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude to him, which is ſo juſtly due for all he did and ſuffered for us; every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the treaſures of the earth, for his are the words of eternal life! They muſt therefore be laid up in our hearts, and be conſtantly referred to, on all occaſions, as the rule and direction of all our actions.</p>
               <p>IT is impoſſible to love God, without deſiring to pleaſe him, and as far as we are able to reſemble him; therefore the love of God muſt lead to every virtue in the higheſt degree; and we may be ſure we do not truly love him, if we content ourſelves with avoiding flagrant ſins, and do not ſtrive in good earneſt, to reach the greateſt degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we are capable of, by his help.</p>

If you neglect your love to your neighbour, in vain you profeſs your love to God; for by your love to God, your love to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is acquired; and by your love to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, your love to God is nouriſhed.</p>
               <p>ALL men of eſtates are, in effect, but truſtees for the benefit of the diſtreſſed, and will be ſo reckoned when they are to give an account.</p>

WE may hate men's vices without any ill will to their perſons; but we cannot help deſpiſing thoſe that have no kind of virtue to recommend them.</p>
               <p>HE that makes any thing his chiefeſt good, wherein virtue, reaſon and humanity, do not bear a part, can never do the offices of friendſhip, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or liberality.</p>
               <p>A REGARD to decency and the common punctil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ios of life, has been often ſerviceable to ſociety. It has kept many a married couple unſeparated, and frequently preſerves a neighbourly intercourſe, wherelove and friendſhip have both been wanting.</p>
               <p>IT is providential that our affection diminiſhes in proportion as our friend's power increaſes. Affection is of leſs importance, whenever a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can ſupport himſelf. It is on this account that younger brothers are oft beloved more than their elders; and that Benjamin is the favourite.</p>
               <p>"LOVE worketh no ill to his neighbour," therefore, if we have true benevolence, we will never do any thing injurious to individuals, or to ſociety. Thoſe very comprehenſive moral precepts our Saviour has graciouſly left with us, which can never fail to direct us aright, if fairly and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly applied, ſuch as, "whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do unto them." There is no occaſion, great or ſmall, on
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028841_0135_0FDDDB33412F7398"/>
which you may not ſafely apply this rule, for the direction of your conduct; and whilſt our hearts honeſtly adhere to it, we can never be guilty of any ſort of injuſtice, or unkindneſs.</p>

               <head>MARRIAGE.</head>
               <p>MARRIAGE is certainly a condition, upon which the happineſs or miſery of life does very much depend; more than indeed moſt people think beforehand. To be confined to live with one perpetually, for whom we have no liking and eſteem, muſt certainly be an uneaſy ſtate. There had need be a great many good qualities to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile a conſtant converſation with one, where there is ſome ſhare of kindneſs, but without love, the very beſt of all good qualities will never make a conſtant converſation eaſy and delightful. And whence proceed thoſe innumerable domeſtic miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028841_0136_0FDDDB34B6899BE0"/>
that plague and utterly confound ſo many fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies, but from want of love and kindneſs in the wife or huſband; from theſe come their neglect and careleſs management of affairs at home, and their profuſe extravagant expenſes abroad. In a word, it is not eaſy, as it is not needful, to recount the evils that ariſe abundantly, from the want of conjugal affection only. And ſince this is ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, a man or woman runs the moſt fearful hazard that can be, who marries without their affection in themſelves, and without good aſſurances of it in the other.</p>
               <p>LET you love advice before you chuſe, and your choice be fixed before you marry. Remember the happineſs or miſery of your life depends upon this one act, and that nothing but death can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the knot.</p>
               <p>A SINGLE life is doubtleſs preferable to a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one, where prudence and affection do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the choice; but where they do, there is no terreſtrial happineſs equal to the married ſtate.</p>
               <p>THERE cannot be too near an equality, too exact a harmony betwixt a married couple; it is a ſtep of ſuch weight as calls for all our foreſight and penetration, and, eſpecially the temper and education muſt be attended to. In unequal match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the men are generally more in fault than the women, who can ſeldom be chuſers.</p>

               <p>MARRIAGES founded on affection are the moſt happy. Love (ſays Addiſon) ought to have ſhot its roots deep, and to be well grown before we enter into that ſtate.

               <p>THE beſt dowry to advance the marriage of a young lady is, when ſhe has in her countenance, mildneſs; in her ſpeech, wiſdom; in her behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour, modeſty; and in her life, virtue.</p>
               <p>BETTER is a portion in a wife, than with a wife.</p>
               <p>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of temper in a wife, cutlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it inviſible.</p>

THE ſureſt way of governing both a private family and a kingdom, is, for a huſband and a prince to yield at certain times ſomething of their prerogative.</p>
               <p>A GOOD wife, ſays Solomon, is a good portion; and there is nothing of ſo much worth as a mind well inſtructed.</p>
               <p>SWEETNESS of temper, affection to her huſband and attention to his intereſts, conſtitute the duties of a wife, and form the baſis of matrimonial felic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.

               <p>HOW many men of extraordinary parts and merit have died unknown? How many are there who ſtill at this time live unknown, and who will never be taken any notice of? Nature produces merit, virtue carries it to perfection, and fortune gives it the power of acting.</p>
               <p>TRUE merit is not afraid of being effaced by that of others. We judge of the merit of men by the uſefulneſs of their actions, and there are a great many men valued in the world, who have no other merit than vices profitable to commerce and ſociety. The more true merit a man has, the more does he applaud it in others. Real merit gains a man the eſteem of good men, but it is only fate and chance that gains him that of the multitude.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>MEN of mean qualities ſhew but little favour to great virtues, a lofty wiſdom offends an ordinary reaſon.</p>
               <p>SUPERIORITY of virtue is the moſt unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble provocation that can be given to a baſe mind. Innocence is too amiable to be beheld without hatred; and it is a ſecret acknowledgment of merit which the wicked are betrayed into, when they purſue good men with violence. This behaviour viſibly proceeds from a conſciouſneſs in them, that other people's virtues upbraid their own want of it.</p>
               <p>WE ought not to judge of men's merits by their qualifications, but by the uſe they make of them.</p>
               <p>IT is a thing exceedingly rare to diſtinguiſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and fortune. The moſt impious, if proſperous, are always applauded; the moſt virtuous, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous, are ſure to be deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>OUR good qualities often expoſe us to more hatred and perſecution, than all the ill we do.</p>
               <p>THE common people are oft but ill judges of a man's merit; they are ſlaves to ſame, their eyes

are dazzled with the pomp and titles and large retinue, and then no wonder if they beſtow their honours on thoſe who leaſt deſerve them.</p>

               <p>IN the flouriſhing commonwealth of Greece and Rome, it was either ſome brave action againſt the enemy, or eminent juſtice, virtue, or ability, that raiſed one man above another; wealth had no ſhare in it.</p>
               <p>THE world is a theatre, the beſt actors are thoſe that repreſent their parts moſt naturally; but the wiſeſt are ſeldom the heroes in the play. It is not to be conſidered (ſays Epictetus) who is prince, or who is beggar, but who acts the prince or the beggar beſt.</p>
               <p>IT is true greatneſs that conſtitutes glory, and virtue is the cauſe of both. But vice and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance taint the blood, and an unworthy behaviour degrades and diſennobles the man, more than birth and fortune aggrandize and exalt him.</p>
               <p>WHAT need has a great man of any foreign aid to promote the regard that is due to his merit,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028841_0143_0FDDDB46BA81D050"/>
when a certain air of noble ſimplicity, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his own grandeur, will not fail to attract the public attention; ſince ſhutting his eyes upon himſelf, is an infallible way to open all the world's upon him.</p>
               <p>LEWIS the fourteenth though a king, rewarded merit and encouraged literature. Plutarch has a fine expreſſion, with regard to ſome women of learning, humility and virtue—that her orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſuch as might be purchaſed without money, and would render any woman's life glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy. Adam ſignifies earth, and Eve life. But not to inſiſt upon Hebrew definitions, man was originally made of the dead earth—but woman of the living man—therefore, of a more excellent nature.</p>
               <p>MERIT muſt take a great compaſs to riſe, if not aſſiſted by favour.</p>
               <p>IT is not always to merit, that we ought to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the ſame a man has got in the world, chance often contributing greatly to it.

               <head>MODESTY AND IMPUDENCE.</head>
               <p>MODESTY has a natural tendency to conceal a man's talents, as impudence diſplays them to the utmoſt, and has been the only cauſe why many have riſen in the world, under all the diſadvantages of low birth and little merit. Such indolence and incapacity is there in the generality of mankind, that they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has a mind to put himſelf off for, and admit his over bearing airs, as proofs of that merit which he aſſumes to himſelf.</p>
               <p>A DECENT aſſurance ſeems to be the natural at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on virtue; and few men can diſtinguiſh impudence from it; as, on the other hand, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being the natural reſult of vice and folly, has drawn diſgrace upon modeſty, which in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance ſo nearly reſembles it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:028841_0153_0FDDDB5EA6575A78"/>
As impudence, though really a vice, has the ſame effect upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue, ſo we may obſerve, that it is almoſt as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be obtained, and is, in that reſpect, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all the other vices which are acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little pains, and continually increaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indulgence. Many a man being ſenſible that modeſty is exceedingly prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has reſolved to be impudent, and put a bold face upon the matter; but 'tis obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that ſuch people have ſeldom ſucceeded in their attempts, but have been obliged to relapſe into their primitive modeſty. Nothing carries a man through the world, like a true, genuine, nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural impudence; its counterfeit is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor can ever ſupport itſelf. If any thing can give a modeſt man more aſſurance, it muſt be ſome advantages of fortune which chance procured to him. Riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world, and give merit a double luſtre, when a perſon is endowed with it. 'Tis wonderful to obſerve what airs of ſuperiority fools and knaves, with large poſſeſſions, give themſelves, above men of the greateſt merit, in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make any ſtrong oppoſition to thoſe uſurpations, but rather ſeem to favour them by the modeſty of their behaviour.</p>

TO make wiſdom agree with impudence, is as difficult as to reconcile vice and modeſty. Theſe are the reflexions which have occurred upon this ſubject of modeſty and impudence, and I hope the reader will not be diſpleaſed to ſee them wrought into the following allegory.</p>
               <p>JUPITER in the beginning joined Virtue, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Confidence together; and Vice, Folly and Diffidence; and thus connected, ſent them into the world. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and ſaid, that Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice deſerved to be attended with Diffidence. They had not gone far before diſſenſion aroſe among them. Wiſdom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accuſtomed, before ſhe ventured on any road, however beaten, to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it carefully, to enquire whither it led; what dangers, difficulties, or hindrances might poſſibly, or probably occur in it. In theſe deliberations ſhe uſually conſumed ſome time, which delay was very diſpleaſing to Confidence, who was always inclined to hurry on, without much forethought or deliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in the firſt road he met. Wiſdom and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were inſeparable; but Confidence one day following his impetuous nature, advanced a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable way before his guides and companions, and not feeling any want of their company, he
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028841_0155_0FDDDB61DE09C9F0"/>
never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other ſociety, though joined by Jupiter, diſagreed and ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As Folly ſaw very little way before her, ſhe had nothing to determine concerning the goodneſs of roads, nor could give the preference to one above another, and their want of reſolution increaſed by Diffidence, who, with her doubts and ſcruples always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never ſatisfied without his full career in whatever his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations led him to. Folly, he knew, though ſhe hearkened to Diffidence, would be eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged when alone, therefore, as a vicious horſe throws its rider, he openly beat away this controller of his pleaſures, and proceeded on his journey with Folly, from whom he is inſeparable. Confidence and Diffidence being after this manner both thrown looſe from their reſpective companions, wandered for ſome time; till at laſt chance led them at the ſame time to the ſame village. Confidence went directly up to the great houſe, which belonged to Wealth, the lord of the village, and without ſtaying for a porter, intruded himſelf immediately into the innermoſt appartments, where he found Vice and Folly were received before him. He joined the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028841_0156_0FDDDB63436E24B0"/>
train, recommended himſelf very quickly to his landlord, and entered into ſuch familiarity with Vice, that he was enliſted in the ſame company with Folly. They were frequent gueſts with Wealth, and from that moment inſeparable. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the mean time, not daring to approach the great houſe, accepted of an invitation from one of the tenants, and entering the cottage found Wiſdom and Virtue, who, being repulſed by the landlord, had retired thither.</p>
               <p>VIRTUE took compaſſion on her, and Wiſdom found from her temper, that ſhe would eaſily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, ſo they admitted her into their ſociety. Accordingly by their means, ſhe altered, in a little time, ſomewhat of her manner; and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Modeſty.</p>
               <p>AS ill company has a greater effect than good, Confidence, though more refractory to council and example, degenerated ſo far by the ſociety of Vice and Folly, as to paſs by the name of Impudence.</p>
               <p>MANKIND, who ſaw theſe ſocieties as Jupiter firſt joined them, and knew nothing of theſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſſenſions, are thereby led into ſtrange miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and whenever they ſee Impudence, make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Virtue and Wiſdom; and oft when they obſerve Modeſty, call her attendants Vice and Folly.</p>

               <p>A MAN without modeſty, is loſt to all ſenſe of honour and virtue.</p>
               <p>MODESTY is ſure the chiefeſt ornament of our ſex, and cannot be blameable in the men; it is one of the moſt amiable qualities that either man or woman can poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>THERE ſcarce can be named one quality that is amiable in a woman, which is not becoming in a man, not excepting even modeſty and gentleneſs of nature.</p>
               <p>THE modeſty of women prevails more than their power, riches, or beauty. Modeſty in your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, will give a luſtre to truth, and an excuſe to your errors.</p>
               <p>IT has been ſaid, that when Jove created the paſſions, he aſſigned every one of them its deſtined abode; modeſty was forgotten, and when ſhe was introduced to him, he knew not where to place her; ſhe was therefore ordered to conſort with all the reſt; ever ſince that time ſhe is inſeparable from them; ſhe is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; ſhe is in a ſtrict and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate unity with love, ſhe always attends, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcovers and proclaims it; love, in a

               <p>THE firſt of all virtues is innocence, the next is modeſty. If we baniſh modeſty out of the world, ſhe carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</p>
               <p>MODESTY makes large amends for the pain it gives the perſons who labour under it; by the prejudice it affords every worthy perſon in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>AS real modeſty is the beauty of the mind, ſo an affectation of it, as much diſgraces a perfect mind, as art and an affected dreſs do a perfect face.</p>

               <p>MUSIC is one of the ſeven ſciences, and is juſtly admired by all people of a fine taſte, and who love the liberal arts.

A taſte for this art does not imply that a perſon is an actual performer upon an inſtrument, or that he is a good ſinger; both judgment and taſte for muſic, may be where the power of the organs that are neceſſary for execution are wanting.

GREAT qualities make great men. Who, ſays Seneca, is a gentleman? The man whom nature has diſpoſed, and as it were, cut out for virtue. This man is well born indeed; for he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to make him noble, who has a mind ſo generous, that he can riſe above, and triumph over fortune, let his condition be what it will.</p>

               <p>THIS one advantage is obſervable in being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly born, that it makes men ſenſible they are alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to virtue, and lays ſtronger obligations on them not to degenerate from the excellencies of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <p>THERE is a nobility without heraldry. There is no true glory, no true greatneſs without virtue; without which we do but abuſe all the good things we have, whether they be great or little, falſe or real. A high pedigree makes a man take up with
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028841_0167_0FDDDB8367440468"/>

               <p>TITLE and anceſtry render a good man more illuſtrious, but an ill one more contemptible, Vice is infamous, though in a prince; and virtue hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable, though in a peaſant.</p>
               <p>MEN in former ages, though ſimple and plain were great in themſelves, and independent on a thouſand things, which are ſince invented, to ſupply perhaps that true greatneſs which is now extinct.</p>
               <p>WE may obſerve ſome of our noble countrymen, who come with high advantage, and a worthy character into the public. But, ere they have long engaged in it, their worth unhappily becomes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Equipages, titles, precedences, ſtaffs, ribbands and ſuch like glittering ware, are taken in exchange for inward merit and true honour. They may be induced to change their honeſt meaſures and ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice their cauſe and friends to an imaginary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and, after this, act farces as they think fit, and hear qualities and virtues aſſigned to them, under the titles of graces, excellencies and the reſt of this mock praiſe, and mimical appellation. They may even, with ſerious looks, be told of honour and worth, their principle and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but muſt be ſenſible that the world knows better, and that their few friends and admirers,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028841_0168_0FDDDB872E3938B0"/>
have either a very ſhallow ſenſe, or a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>ALL things have ſome kind of ſtandard, by which the natural goodneſs of them is to be meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured. We do not therefore eſteem a ſhip to be good becauſe ſhe is curiouſly carved, painted, and gilded; but becauſe ſhe is fitted for all the purpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of navigation, which is the proper end of a ſhip. It ſhould be ſo likewiſe in our eſteem of men, who are not ſo much to be valued for the grandeur of their eſtates or titles, as for their inward good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellence.</p>

A MAN cannot be bound by one benefit to ſuffer all ſorts of injuries, for there are ſome caſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we lie under no obligation for a benefit, becauſe a greater injury abſolves it. As for example a man helps me out of a law ſuit, and afterwards commits a rape upon my daughter; where, the following impiety cancels the antecedent obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A man lends me a little money, then ſets my houſe on fire; the debtor is here turned credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, becauſe the injury outweighs the benefit: Nay, if he does but ſo much as repent the good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice done, and grow ſour and inſolent upon it, and upbraid me with it.

               <p>A CERTAIN perſon once had done me a ſingular piece of ſervice, but had afterwards behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very unworthily towards me. An occaſion ſoon occurred which put it into my power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite his ill offices; and I was urged to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, by a friend of mine—or rather, an enemy of his.

A perſon who has once obliged, has put it out of his power ever after to diſoblige us.

               <p>THE lawful uſe and end of ſwearing, is, to put an end to all ſtrife, and to maintain both equity and charity among men; the two bonds and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſociety. Now, ſince it is the ſovereign

               <p>BUT to break in rudely and blaſphemouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſacred and tremendous name of God, with bold and full mouthed oaths, ſtriking through his ſacred name with direct contumelious blaſphemies, this argues a heart from which all fear of God is utterly expelled and baniſhed.

If there be a God, which they ſcarce believe, they are reſolved audaciouſly to provoke him, to give them a convincing evidence of his Being. And if he be, as they are told he is, rich in patience and forbearance, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try how far his patience will extend, and what load of wickedneſs it is capable to bear. If therefore deſtruction be not ſure enough, they will do their utmoſt to make it ſo, by treading down the only bridge where they can eſcape it, that is, by trampling under their feet the precious blood and wounds of the Son of God, and impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the damnation of hell upon their ſouls, as if it ſlumbered too long, and was too ſlow paced in its motion towards them.</p>
               <p>IT is common for ſome men to ſwear, only to fill up the vacuities of their empty diſcourſe.</p>

               <p>THERE is a politeneſs of the heart which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to no rank, and dependant upon no educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the deſire of obliging ſeldom fails, (if joined with delicacy of ſentiment to pleaſe) though the ſtile may differ from that of modern refinement.</p>
               <p>TRUE politeneſs is a ſcience not to be acquired in ſchools. Nature muſt beſtow a genius; and that genius muſt be improved by reading authors of delicacy and ſpirit; and heightened by a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of converſation with perſons of taſte. It is an enemy to all kind of conſtraint, does every thing with eaſe, and though certain never to offend, is never at the expenſe of flattery to oblige.</p>
               <p>BE careful to obſerve the diſtinction between over ſtrained complaiſance and true politeneſs—between falſe delicacy and true.</p>

HE that is truly polite, knows how to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict with reſpect, and to pleaſe without adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and is equally remote from an inſipid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, and a low familiarity.</p>
               <p>MERIT and good breeding will make their way every where. Knowledge will introduce you, and good breeding will endear you to the beſt of companies; for, politeneſs and good breeding are abſolutely neceſſary to adorn any, or all other good qualities or talents. Without them no knowledge, no perfection whatever, is ſeen in its beſt light. The ſcholar, without good breeding, is a pedant; the philoſopher a cynic; the ſoldier a brute; and every one diſagreeable. If a man accoſts you, and talks to you ever ſo dully or frivolouſly, it is worſe than rudeneſs, it is brutality, to ſhew him, by a manifeſt inattention to what he ſays, that you think him a fool, or a blockhead, and not worth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is much more ſo with regard to women, who, of whatever rank they are, are intitled, in conſideration of their ſex, not only to an attention, but an officious good breeding from men. The moſt familiar habitudes, connexions, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, require a degree of good breeding elſe their intimacy will ſoon degenerate into a coarſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, infallibly productive of contempt or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</p>

POLITENESS and modeſty are becoming in all men, but eſpecially in thoſe whom fortune has raiſed above others.</p>
               <p>GOOD breeding is the reſult of much good ſenſe, ſome good nature, and a little ſelf denial for the ſake of others, and with a view to obtain the ſame indulgence from them. Good manners are, to particular ſocieties, what good morals are to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in general, their cement and their ſecurity.</p>
               <p>WORLDLY politeneſs is no more than an imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or imperfect copy of Chriſtian charity, being the pretence or outward appearance of that defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the judgment, and attention to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of others; which a true Chriſtian has as the rule of his life, and the diſpoſition of his heart.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER ſphere a man has been bred in, or attained to, religion is not an injury, but an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the politeneſs of his carriage. They ſeem indeed to confeſs their relation to one another, by their reciprocal influence. In promiſcuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, as true religion contributes to make men decent or courteous, ſo true politeneſs guards them effectually from any out rage againſt piety or purity.</p>
               <p>TO be perfectly polite, one muſt have a great preſence of mind, with a delicate and quick ſenſe of propriety, or, in other words, one ſhould be
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028841_0183_0FDDDBAD736CA088"/>
able to form an inſtantaneous judgment of what is fitteſt to be done, on every occaſion as it offers. I have known one or two perſons, who ſeemed to owe this advantage to nature only, and to have the peculiar happineſs of being born, as it were, with another ſenſe, by which they had an immediate perception of what was proper and improper, in caſes abſolutely new to them; but this is the lot of very few. It muſt every where be good breeding, to ſet your companions in an advantageous point of light, by giving each an opportunity of diſplaying their moſt agreeable talents, and by carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ocoaſions of expoſing their defects;—to exert your own endeavours to pleaſe, and to amuſe, but not to outſhine them:—To give each their due ſhare of attention and notice:—Not engroſſing the talk, when others are deſirous to ſpeak, nor ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the converſation to flag, for want of introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething to continue or renew the ſubject. In honour preferring one another. We ſhould be perfectly eaſy, and make others ſo if we can. But this happy caſe belongs perhaps to the laſt ſtage of perfection in politeneſs—but a real deſire of oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a reſpectful attention, will in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſupply many defects.</p>

               <p>IN ſeeking virtue, if you find poverty, be not aſhamed, the fault is not yours. Your honour or diſhonour is purchaſed by your own actions; though virtue gives a ragged livery, ſhe gives a golden cognizance. If her ſervice make you poor, bluſh not; your poverty may prove diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to you, but cannot diſhonour you.</p>
               <p>TO feel the extremity of want, and be always under diſcipline and mortification, muſt be very uncomfortable: But then we are to conſider, that the world will either mend or wear off, and that the diſcharge will come ſhortly, and the hardſhip turn to advantage; that the conteſt is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and brave, and that 'tis dangerous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to ſurrender.</p>

                  <l>That poverty's the ſouce of happineſs.</l>
                  <l>Modern opinion holds, that wealth in ſtore</l>

                  <l>But heav'n born wiſdom teaches better things;</l>
                  <l>Not to expect from theſe, what virtue only brings.</l>

               <p>POVERTY falls heavy upon him only, who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teems it a misfortune.</p>
               <p>IT is more honourable not to have and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, than to have and not deſerve.</p>
               <p>THE little value Providence ſets upon riches, is ſeen by the perſons on whom it is beſtowed. Though want is the ſcorn of every wealthy fool, an innocent poverty is yet preferable to all the guilty affluence the world can offer.</p>
               <p>THERE is no contending with neceſſity; and we ſhould be very tender how we cenſure thoſe that ſubmit to it. It is one thing to be at liberty to do as we will, and another thing to be tied up to do what we muſt.</p>
               <p>OF all poverty, that of the mind is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable.</p>
               <p>IT is in every body's obſervation with what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage a poor man enters upon the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary buſineſs; for as certainly as wealth gives
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028841_0186_0FDDDBB2E8CA94C8"/>
grace and acceptance to all that its poſſeſſor ſays or does, ſo poverty creates diſeſteem, ſcorn and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to all the undertakings of the indigent. The neceſſitous man has neither hands, lips, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for his own, or his friends uſe; but is in the ſame condition with the ſick, with this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference only, that his is an infection no man will relieve, or aſſiſt; or if he does, 'tis ſeldom with as much pity as contempt, and rather for the oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the phyſician, than compaſſion on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient: It is a circumſtance, wherein a man finds all the good he deſerves inacceſſible, all the ill una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable; under theſe preſſures, the poor man ſpeaks with heſitation, undertakes with irreſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and acts with diſappointment; he is ſlighted in men's converſations, overlooked in their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, &amp;c. But from whence, alas! has he this treatment? From a creature that has only the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of, but not an exemption from the wants, for which he deſpiſes him; for ſuch is the unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inſolence of man, he will not ſee, that he who is ſupported, is in the ſame claſs of natural neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, as he that wants a ſupport; and to be helped implies to be indigent.</p>
               <p>A MAN is not judged by the internal qualifications of his mind, but by the extent of his houſe. One who has been in buſineſs, and has not gained riches, is ſaid to have done poorly, notwithſtanding his
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:028841_0187_0FDDDBB5D8EF8F68"/>
mind may be formed by the beſt of principles, and his actions guided by the higheſt rules of Chriſtian benevolence; which perhaps was the only cauſe of his not thriving in temporary wealth in an equal degree with ſome of his cotemporaries. While ſome who live as "without God in the world," thoughtleſs of every concern but accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating wealth, are eſteemed of the firſt rank in the community, and the moſt able members of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So much is the truth of that ſaying verified, that "Money commands all things."</p>
               <p>AMIDST the miſeries to which human life is liable, nothing is ſo generally dreaded as poverty; ſince it expoſes mankind to diſtreſſes that are but little pitied, and to the contempt of thoſe who have no natural endowments ſuperior to our own. Every other difficulty or danger, a man is enabled to encounter with courage and alacrity, becauſe he knows that his ſucceſs will meet with applauſe, for bravery will always find its admirers; but in poverty every virtue is obſcured, and no conduct can entirely ſecure a man from reproach. Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, (as an admirable author obſerves) if here inſenſibility, and dejection, ſullenneſs; its hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are without honour, and labours without reward. Notwithſtanding this, there is no ſtation more favourable to the growth of virtue, where the ſeeds of it are previouſly ſown in the mind.
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:028841_0188_0FDDDBB8A614FA48"/>
But when poverty is felt in the utmoſt extreme, it then becomes exceſſively dangerous, and ſome deviations from rectitude, are perhaps impoſſible to be avoided.</p>
               <p>VICE is covered by wealth, and virtue by pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.</p>
               <p>HOW many abject ſouls there are, who eſteem the want of wealth as a want of virtue?</p>
               <p>A CONSCIOUSNESS of the rectitude of our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tell us, though we are unfortunate, it is not becauſe me are more undeſerving than others; nor is our native pride depreſſed by a ſenſe of our poverty. We can ſee in idea Cencinnatus, the great dictator, preparing on his hearth the homely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, with thoſe hands that had ſubdued the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of this country, and borne the triumphal laurel; reflect that Socrates, the reformer, and Memnius Agrippa, the arbiter of his country, had been, the one maintained, and the other buried by contribution. And the great Scipio Africanus had been ſo poor, that the portions of his daughters were paid by the public: Who then would repine at adoption into a family that has been honoured by ſuch illuſtrious anceſtors.</p>

               <head>PRAISE.</head>
               <p>PRAISE is the tribute due to virtuous deeds, and though it is heartily to be deſpiſed, when it comes from the lips of bad men, when we have not a true title to it; yet it is not to be eſteemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, or undiſcreditable when beſtowed upon occaſions where it is really due, and by thoſe who are really judges of virtue. Praiſe is the reward of noble actions: What is more animating to our commanders both by ſea and land, than the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their country's applauſe, for their heroic behaviour. Praiſe is only to be given when truly merited, and then not in the preſence of the party to whom it is due. When Telemachus repaired to the aſſembly of the confederate kings, after the death of Adraſtus, and the Daunians deſired peace, we are told, that as ſoon as they eſpied him, they
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:028841_0190_0FDDDBBD29047918"/>
were all huſhed in expectation to hear him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; this made him bluſh, and he could not be prevailed upon to ſpeak. The praiſes that were given him by public acclamations, on account of his late action, added to his baſhfulneſs ſo, that he would gladly have hid himſelf. At length, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired as a favour, that they would deſiſt from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him: Not but that I am a lover of praiſe, ſaid he, eſpecialy when it comes from ſuch good judges of virtue; but, I am afraid of loving it too much. Praiſes are apt to corrupt men; they fill them full of themſelves, and render them vain and preſumptuous; we ought equally to merit and decline them; there is a great likeneſs between the juſteſt and the falſeſt praiſes. Juſt praiſes are ſuch as you will give me in my abſence, if I am ſo happy as to deſerve them. If you believe me to be really good, you ought alſo to believe that I am willing to be modeſt, and would fear vanity; ſpare me, therefore, if you have any eſteem for me, and do not praiſe me as if I were a man fond of ſuch things. A man ought to bluſh, when he is praiſed for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections he does not poſſeſs. Be careful how you receive praiſe; from good men neither avoid it nor glory in it; from bad men neither deſire nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. To be praiſed of them that are evil, or for that which is evil, is equal diſhonour; he is
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028841_0191_0FDDDBC0D1313308"/>
happy in his merit, who is praiſed by the good, and emulated by the bad.</p>

                  <l>Of folly, vice, diſeaſe, men proud we ſee,</l>
                  <l>And (ſtranger ſtill) of blockheads flattery;</l>
                  <l>Whoſe praiſe defames; as if a fool ſhould mean,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>THEY who deſerve leaſt praiſe themſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways allow it leaſt to others; for the poor in merit, like all other poor, envy thoſe of ſuperior worth, and would willingly bring them down to their own level.</p>
               <p>THE underſtanding is by nothing more eaſily vanquiſhed than the artillery of praiſe, eſpecially if accompanied with the ideas of truth and gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: It makes its way to the heart, without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and the ſenſe and dignity of the ſpea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <p>NONE are worthy to give true praiſe, but ſuch as are themſelves praiſe worthy.</p>
               <p>PRAISE from the common people is generally falſe, and rather follows vain perſons than virtuous.</p>
               <p>LET us conſtantly follow reaſon, ſays Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne, and let the public approbation follow us the ſame way, if it pleaſes.</p>

               <p>THE character of the perſon who commends you is to be conſidered, before you ſet a value on his eſteem.</p>
               <p>THE praiſes of a worthy perſon, of whoſe good ſenſe, penetration and underſtanding we have an exalted opinion, is certainly—though pleaſing to the ſenſe, a moſt dangerous thing; it is not in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to reſiſt it, it ſurely makes us vain—unleſs we catch—and check its riſing progreſs.</p>

               <p>PRAYER unaccompained with a ſervant love of God, is like a lamp unlighted; the words of the one without love being as unprofitable, as the oil and cotton of the other without flame. "Our wants" ſays the late Biſhop of London (Dr. Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) "are daily, and the temptations which draw our hearts from God, to the things of this world are daily, and upon both theſe accounts our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ought alſo to be daily,"</p>
               <p>THE ſaid doctor gives the following advice;</p>
               <p>"OUR morning prayers will always moſt prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly begin with thankſgivings to Almighty God, our Creator and Preſerver. In the next place a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn dedication of ourſelves to his ſervice. This followed by petitions, <abbr>viz.</abbr> for his grace and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ourſelves—for the like in behalf of others.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:028841_0194_0FDDDBC6E5737E70"/>
The evening prayers to begin in the ſame order, only a confeſſion of ſins at the end of the day, and petition muſt ſtand in the place of morning dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and the concluſion ſhould be with a petition for reſt and protection inſtead of that for a bleſſing on our buſineſs.—For the Sabbath, the great day of reſt, &amp;c." Let your prayers be ever ſo proper in the form and expreſſion, or let your heart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them with a devotion ever ſo intenſe, ſtill be very careful to avoid the dangerous error of imagining that any merit ariſes from the moſt perfect performance of them. They become accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God through Chriſt alone; and are the means, indeed, to make you good; but the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf is not in them, no more than a favour among men can be ſaid to be deſerved, becauſe aſked with humility, propriety and elegance. If therefore you were to truſt merely in them, 'twould be making idols of your prayers;—it would be putting them in the place of CHRIST'S atonement, which is quite contrary to praying, (as an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſinner) in the name of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>IF we have not recourſe to God with the mind and thoughts that we ought, it looks as if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nothing from him; or rather, (ſeeing our remiſſneſs and indolence) it may be ſaid, that we do not deſerve to obtain—that we do not value the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:028841_0195_0FDDDBCAADC5D1B8"/>
things that we ſeem to aſk. Yet, God would have what is aſked of him, aſked with earneſtneſs; and far from taking our importunity ill, he is in ſome manner well pleaſed with it. For, in fine, He is the only debtor who thinks himſelf obliged for the demands that are made upon him. He is the only one that pays what we never lent him. The more he ſees us preſs him, the more liberal he is. He even gives that he does not owe. If we coldly aſk, he defers his liberalities; not becauſe he does not love to give, but becauſe he would be preſſed, and becauſe violence is agreeable to him.</p>
               <p>TERTULLIAN ſays ſomething like this, of the prayers that the primitive chriſtians made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. We meet together, ſays he, as if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to take by our prayers what we aſk of him; this violence is pleaſing to him. St. Paul ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly explains what Chriſt teaches in the Goſpel, that heaven is taken by violence; "do violence to God," ſays he, ſeize the kingdom of heaven. He that forbids us to touch another's goods, rejoices to have his own invaded: He that condemns the violence of avarice, praiſes that of faith.</p>
               <p>As the bones of the human frame connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, form the ſkeleton of a man, ſo repentance, faith, hope, charity, love, zeal, humility, patience, reſignation, hatred of ſin, purity of heart, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028841_0196_0FDDDBCE9113D768"/>
of life, all united together make a chriſtian; but muſt be accompanied with prayer, the breath of the new creature, or they will prove like dead corps, lifeleſs and inactive.</p>
               <p>GOING to prayer with bad affections, is like paying one's levee in an undreſs.</p>
               <p>ALL prayer muſt be made with faith and hope: He who would pray with effect, muſt live with care and piety: Our prayers muſt be fervent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, earneſt and importunate. Our deſires muſt be laſting, and our prayers frequent and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. God hears us not the ſooner for our many words, but much the ſooner for our earneſt deſire. A long prayer and a ſhort differ not in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of being accepted; for both of them take their value, according to the fervency of ſpirit, and the charity of the prayer. That prayer which is ſhort, by reaſon of an impatient ſpirit, dullneſs, ſlight of holy things, or indifferency of deſires, is very often criminal, always imperfect; and that prayer which is long out of oſtentation, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a trifling ſpirit, is as criminal and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as the other in their ſeveral inſtances.</p>
               <p>WE muſt be careful in all our prayers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our preſent work, having a preſent mind, not wandering upon impertinent things, nor diſtant from our words, much leſs contrary to them.</p>

               <p>THE man whoſe heart is replete with pure and unaffected piety, who looks upon the father of nature in that juſt and amiable light, which all his works reflect upon him, cannot fail of taſting the ſublimeſt pleaſure, in contemplating the ſtupendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and innumerable effects of infinite goodneſs. Whether he looks abroad on the natural or the

moral world, his reflections muſt ſtill be attended with delight; and the ſenſe of his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo far from leſſening, will increaſe his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, while it places the forbearing kindneſs and indulgence of his creator in a ſtill more intereſting point of view. Here his mind may dwell upon the preſent, look back to the paſt, or ſtretch forward into futurity with equal ſatisfaction; and, the more he indulges contemplation, the higher will his delight ariſe. Such a diſpoſition as this, ſeems to be the moſt ſecure foundation on which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of pleaſure can be built.</p>
               <p>THE contemplation of the beauties of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the cordial enjoyments of friendſhip, the tender delights of love, and the rational pleaſures of religion, are open to all; and they are, all of them, capable of giving that real happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for. Theſe being the only fountains from which true pleaſure ſprings, it is no wonder that many ſhould be impelled to ſay, they have not yet found it, and ſhould ſtill cry out, "Who will ſhew us any good."

They want a heart for devotion, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, friendſhip and love, and a taſte for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is truly beautiful and admirable.</p>

               <p>EVERY man, however little, makes a figure in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>PRIDE by a great miſtake, is commonly taken for a greatneſs of ſoul, as if the ſoul was to be ennobled by vice: For that pride is one of the moſt enormous of vices, I think no reaſonable man can diſpute; it is the baſe offſpring of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, imperfection, and ignorance; ſince, were we not weak and imperfect creatures, we ſhould not be deſtitute of knowledge of ourſelves; and had we that knowledge, it were impoſſible we ſhould be proud. But, on the contrary, true humility is a certain mark of a bright reaſon, and elevated ſoul, as being the natural conſequences of them. When we come to have our minds cleared by reaſon from thoſe thick miſts that our diſorderly

paſſions throw about them; when we come to diſcern more perfectly, and conſider more nearly the immenſe power and goodneſs, the infinite glory and duration of God; and to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between theſe perfections of his, and our own frailty and weakneſs and the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of our beings, we ſhould humble our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even into the very duſt before him.—Titles, riches, and fine houſes, ſignify no more to the making of one man better than another, than the finer ſaddle to the making of the better horſe. And it truly ſhews a poor ſpirit, for one man to take theſe paltry advantages of another; it muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic worth in any creature, that muſt give it the preference to another. If he is ambitious to excel his fellows, let it be in ſomething that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to himſelf, ſomething that demonſtrates him to be a better creature. Let him contend in vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which alone is capable to put a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between man and man; and whoever gains the advantage there, has reaſon to value it, though it will never make him proud.</p>

               <p>NONE are ſo invincible as your half witted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who know juſt enough to excite their pride, but not ſo much as to cure their ignorance.</p>
               <p>THE little ſoul that converſes no higher than the looking glaſs, and a fantaſtic dreſs, may help to make up the ſhew of the world; but cannot be reckoned among the rational inhabitants of it.

               <p>MEN of fine parts, they ſay, are proud; I anſwer, dull people are ſeldom ſo, and both act upon an appearance of reaſon.

               <p>THE man of ſhew is vain; the reſerved man is proud more properly. The one has greater depth, the other a more lively imagination. Perſons of proud yet abject ſpirits, will deſpiſe you for thoſe diſtreſſes, for which the generous mind will pity, and endeavour to befriend you; a hint to whom only you ſhould diſcloſe, and from whom you ſhould conceal them.</p>

               <head>READING.</head>
               <p>READING is to the mind what exerciſe is to the body, as by one, health is preſerved, ſtrenghened and invigorated; by the other, virtue, (which is the health of the mind) is kept alive, cheriſhed and confirmed. There are perſons who ſeldom take a book in their hand, but to diſcover the faults it may in their opinion contain; and merit of the work is the leaſt of their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they can paſs over many ſine ſentiments, and rhetorical expreſſions, without the leaſt regard, but to whatever they think obſcure, abſurd, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, they are ſure to afford no quarter: Many perfections cannot atone for a few imperfections with them, they muſt have a perfect piece or none; ſuch perſons ought not to read at all, they are not fit to judge of what they do read. For
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:028841_0205_0FDDDBDA69D025B8"/>
everyman of ſenſe and candour, who reads in order to reap the benefit of reading, will give merit its due, wherever he finds it, and be cautious how he commends. When I meet with a great many beauties in a piece, I am not offended with a few faults, which might have eſcaped the author through inadvertency, or which the impotence of human nature could not ſo well provide againſt. Sometimes too, what is very clear in a book, ſeems to us obſcure, for want of reading it with ſufficient attention.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould not read a book on purpoſe to find its faults; but, purely to underſtand it.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whoever thinks a faultleſs piece to ſee,</l>
                  <l>Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er ſhall be;</l>
                  <l>In every work regard the writer's end,</l>
                  <l>Since none can compaſs more than they intend.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>OF all the diverſions of life, there is none ſo proper to fill up its empty ſpaces, as the reading of uſeful and entertaining authors; and with that the converſation of a well choſen friend.</p>
               <p>BY reading we enjoy the dead, by converſation the living, and by contemplation ourſelves. Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enriches the memory, converſation poliſhes the wit, and contemplation improves the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:028841_0206_0FDDDBDDD40722E0"/>
Of theſe reading is the moſt important, which furniſhes both the other.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be allowed, that ſlow reading is the quickeſt and ſureſt way to knowledge. A frequent peruſal of a few well choſen books, will tend more to the improvement of the underſtanding, than a multifarious reading of all the ſuperficial writers, who have attempted to acquire literary fame.</p>
               <p>IF we would perpetuate our ſame or reputation, we muſt do things worth writing, or write things worth reading.</p>
               <p>I THINK a perſon may as well be aſleep—for they can be only ſaid to dream—who read any thing, but with a view of improving their morals, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating their conduct. Nothing in this life, after health and virtue, is more eſtimable than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge—nor is there any thing ſo eaſily attained, or ſo cheaply purchaſed—the labour only ſitting ſtill, and the expence but time, which if we do not ſpend we cannot ſave.—In the world, you are ſubject to every fool's humour.—In a library you can make every wit ſubject to yours.</p>
               <p>MANY great readers load their memories, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exerciſing their judgments; and make lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrooms of their heads, inſtead of furniſhing them uſefully.</p>

WERE the BIBLE but conſidered impartially and attentively, in its moſt advantageous lights; as it contains all the written revelation of God's will now extant; as it is the baſis of our national relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and gives vigour and ſpirit to all our ſocial laws: as it is the moſt ancient, and conſequently curious collection of hiſtorical incidents, moral precepts, and political inſtitutions; as the ſtyle of it is, in ſome places, nobly ſublime and poetical, and in others, ſweetly natural, plain, and unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

It is to be hoped that a cool reflection or two of this ſort, might induce the more ingenious and rational among them, to let the BIBLE take its turn, their riper years, among thoſe volumes which paſs through their hands, either for amuſement or inſtruction.

               <head>RELIGION.</head>
               <p>RELIGION is a thing much talked of but little underſtood; much pretended to, but very little practiſed; and the reaſon why it is ſo ill practiſed, is, becauſe it is ſo little underſtood; knowledge, therefore, muſt precede religion, ſince it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be wiſe, in order to be virtuous, it muſt be known to whom, and upon what account duty is owing, otherwiſe it never an be rightly paid. It muſt therefore be conſidered, that God is the object of all religion, and that the ſoul is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject wherein it exiſts and reſides. From the ſoul it muſt proceed, and to God it muſt be directed, as to that Almighty Being whoſe power alone could create a rational ſoul, and whoſe goodneſs only could move him to make it capable of an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity, which infinite bounty of God has
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:028841_0209_0FDDDBE366F655B0"/>
laid a perpetual obligation upon the ſoul to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant love, obedience and adoration of him. And to an undoubted aſſurance, that the ſame power and goodneſs that created man, will for ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him and protect him, if he perſeveres in the ſincere performance of his duty. The body can have no other ſhare in religion, than by its geſtures to repreſent and diſcover the bent and inclination of the mind, which repreſentations alſo are but too often falſe and treacherous, deluding thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, into the opinion of a ſaint, but truly diſcovering a notorious hypocrite to God, who fees how diſtant his intentions are from his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. People are as much deceived themſelves, as they deceive others, who think to uſe religion as they do their beſt clothes, only wear it to church and on ſundays, to appear fine, and make a ſhew, and with them, as ſoon as they come home again, lay it aſide carefully, for fear of wearing it out: That religion is good for nothing that is made of ſo ſlight a ſtuff, as will not endure wearing, which ought to be as conſtant a covering for the ſoul, as the ſkin is to the body, not to be divided from it; diviſion being the ruin of both. Nor muſt it be thought that religion conſiſts only in bending the knees, which is a ſitting poſture of humility; but in the ſervent and humble adoration of the ſoul
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:028841_0210_0FDDDBE68FBF1120"/>
Nor in the lifting up of the hands and eyes, but in the wormth of the affection. Outward geſtures and decent behaviour are things very ſit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, being all that the body can pay; but it is inward ſincerity alone that can render them both acceptable. Much leſs does religion conſiſt in diſmal looks and ſour faces, which only ſhews that it is very unpalatable to thoſe who make them; and it ſeems as if they were ſwallowing of ſomething that went grievouſly againſt their ſtomachs. 'Tis likewiſe to be conſidered, the frequency and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency of prayers gives it acceptance, not the length of them. That one prayer rightly addreſſed to God from a well diſpoſed mind, is more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than ten ſermons careleſsly heard, and more careleſsly practiſed. But hearing being a much eaſier duty then praying, becauſe it can often change into ſleeping, is therefore preferred to it, by a great many people. But if, in the end, their profound ignorance will not excuſe them, I am ſure their ſtupid obſtinacy never will. But there are ſo many virtues required in order to praying rightly, that people think, perhaps, that it would take up too much time and pains to acquire them. And they are much in the right, if they think their prayers will be inſignificant without them, and that an ill man can never pray well, and to purpoſe, for the
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:028841_0211_0FDDDBE7F43DFE30"/>
ſtream will always partake of the fountain. And if the mind, which is the fountain of all our addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God, be vitious and impure, the prayers which proceed from it, muſt needs be ſullied with the ſame polutions. But, on the contrary if the mind be once made virtuous, all that proceeds from it will be pleaſing and accepted. And as to dejected looks and a ſorrowful countenance, they are no wiſe graceful in religion, which is ſo far from being a melancholy thing, that it can never appear diſpleaſing, or tireſome to a mind where wiſdom and virtue do not firſt ſeem troubleſome; for wiſdom inſtructing the ſoul to act reaſonably, inſtructs it likewiſe to ſerve and obey God readily and chearfully; for that which appears reaſonable to a wiſe man, will always appear delightful; and religion is that very ſame reaſon and wiſdom, whoſe ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all whoſe paths are peace.</p>
               <p>WERE men ſenſible of the happineſs that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from true religion, the voluptuous man would there ſeek his pleaſure, the covetous man his wealth, and the ambitous man his glory.</p>
               <p>MEN who are deſtitute of religion are ſo far from being learned philoſophers, that they ought not to be eſteemed ſo much as reaſonable men.</p>

RELIGION is ſo far from debarring men of any innocent pleaſure or comfort of human life, that it purifies the pleaſures of it, and renders them more grateful and generous. And beſides this, it brings mighty pleaſures of its own, thoſe of a glorious hope, a ſerene mind, a calm and undiſturbed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which do far outreliſh the moſt ſtudied and artificial luxuries.</p>
               <p>NEITHER human wiſdom, nor human virtue—unſupported by religion, are equal to the trying ſituations that often occur in life.</p>
               <p>AS little appearance as there is of religion in the world, there is a great deal of its influence felt in its affairs—nor can any who have been religiouſly educated, ſo root out the principles of it, but like nature, they will return again, and give checks and interruptions to guilty purſuits.—There can be no real happineſs without religion and virtue, and the aſſiſtance of God's grace and Holy Spirit to direct our lives, in the true purſuit of it. Happineſs, I contend is only to be found in religion—in the conſciouſneſs of virtue—and a ſure and certain hope of a better life, which brightens all our proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and leaves no room to dread diſappointments,—becauſe the expectations of it are built upon a rock, whoſe foundations are as deep as thoſe of heaven or hell.—So ſtrange and unaccountable

a creature is man! he is ſo framed, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but purſue happineſs—and yet, unleſs he is made ſometimes miſerable, how apt is he to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the way, which can only lead him to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of all his wiſhes.—What pity it is that the ſacred name of religion ſhould ever have been borrowed and employed in ſo bad a work, as in covering over pride—ſpiritual pride, the worſt of all pride—hypocriſy, ſelf love, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, extortion, cruelty and revenge—or that the fair form of virtue ſhould have been thus diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and forever drawn into ſuſpicion, from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy uſes of this kind, to which the artful and abandoned have often put her.—Some people paſs through life, ſoberly and religiouſly enough, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing why, or reaſoning about it—but from force of habit merely.—Again, ſome think it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to be good Chriſtians, without being good men—To ſpend their lives in—drinking, cheating—and praying.</p>
               <p>TRUE religion gives an habitual ſweetneſs and complacency, which produces genuine politeneſs, without injury to ſincerity; it preſerves the mind from every unfair bias, and inclines it to temper juſtice with mercy in all its judgments upon others.</p>

               <p>DIVINE meditations do not only in power ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all ſenſual pleaſures, but far exceed them in ſweetneſs and delight.</p>
               <p>To be furious in religion is to be irreligiouſly religious. Perſecution can be no argument to perſuade, nor violence the way to converſion.</p>

The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's walk of a wiſe man is more illuſtrious in their ſight, than the march of a general, at the head of a hundred thouſand men. A contemplation of God's works, a generous concern for the good of mankind, and unfeigned exerciſe of humility only—denominates men great and glorious.</p>
               <p>WHAT can be more ſuitable to a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to employ reaſon to contemplate that divine Being, which is both the author of its reaſon,

and nobleſt object about which it can poſſibly be employed.</p>
               <p>ALL our wiſdom and happineſs conſiſts ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in the knowledge of God and ourſelves. To know, and to do, is the compendium of our duty.</p>
               <p>WE have a great work on our hands, the goſpel promiſes to believe, the commands to obey, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to reſiſt, paſſions to conquer; and this muſt be done, or we are undone; therefore look to heaven for the power.</p>

               <head>REPENTANCE.</head>
               <p>TRUE repentance is that ſaving grace wrought in the ſoul, by the ſpirit of God, whereby a ſinner is made to ſee, and be ſenſible of his ſin, is grieved and humbled before God on account of it, not ſo much for the puniſhment to which ſin has made him liable, as that thereby God is diſhonoured and offended; his laws violated, and their own ſoul polluted and defiled: And this grief ariſes from love to God, and is accompanied with a hatred of ſin, a fixed reſolution to forſake it, and expectation of favour and forgiveneſs through the merits of CHRIST; this is evangelical repentance. The
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028841_0217_0FDDDBF6AF414270"/>
inſenſibility of a ſinner, the want of regret and penitence, after having finned provokes God more than the ſin itſelf.</p>
               <p>WHEN God is angry with us, it is not through a principle of hatred, that he ſhews his anger, it is to draw us to him, even in the time of his anger. Salvian gives the following ingenious deſcription of repenting ſinners, who, far from converſion are always relapſing into ſin.</p>
               <p>THEY act every thing in ſuch a manner, that one may ſay, they do not ſo much repent of their ſins, as they afterwards do of that repentance. They ſeem by their behaviour, not to be ſo ſorry for their ill life, as that they have promiſed to live a good one.—How terrible is conviction and guilt, when they come too late for repentance.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,</l>
                  <l>(Tho' but endeavoured with ſincere intent)</l>
                  <l>Mine ear ſhall not be ſlow, mine eye not ſhut,</l>
                  <l>And I will place within them as a guide</l>
                  <l>Mine umpire conſcience, whom if they will hear,</l>
                  <l>Light after light well us'd they ſhall attain;</l>
                  <l>And to the end perſiſting, ſafe arrive.</l>
                  <l>This my long ſuff'rence, and my day of grace,</l>
                  <l>They who neglect and ſcorn, ſhall never taſte;</l>

But hard be harden'd, blind be blinded more;</l>
                  <l>That they may ſtumble on, and deeper fall:</l>
                  <l>And none but ſuch from mercy I exclude.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>IT is better to be affected with a true penitent ſorrow for ſin, than to be able to reſolve the moſt difficult caſes about it.</p>
               <p>THE time preſent is the only time we have to repent in, to ſerve God, to do good to men, to improve our knowledge, to exerciſe our graces, and to prepare for a bleſſed immortality.</p>
               <p>WE may ſtrike up bargains, and make contracts by proxy, but all men muſt work out their own ſalvation in perſon. How irrational is a late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Muſt the body be beſieged with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, before the work be done on which eternal life depends.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Who ſets about, hath half perform'd the deed.</l>
                  <l>Dare to be wiſe, and—if you would ſucceed.</l>
                  <l>Begin. The man who has it in his power</l>
                  <l>To practiſe virtue, and protracts the hour,</l>
                  <l>Waits till the river paſs away; but lo!</l>
                  <l>Ceaſeleſs it ſlows—and will forever flow.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>HE who repents truly, is greatly ſorrowful for his paſt ſins; not with a ſuperficial ſigh or tear,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:028841_0219_0FDDDBFBC09C1120"/>
but a pungeant afflictive ſorrow; ſuch a ſorrow as hates the ſin ſo much, that the man would rather chuſe to die than act it any more. A holy life is the only perfection of repentance, and the firm ground upon which we can caſt the anchor of our hopes, in the mercies of God through Jeſus Chriſt. A true penitent muſt all the days of his life pray for pardon, nor think the work compleated till he dies.</p>

               <p>SECRECY is the cement of friendſhip. When Ulyſſes departed to repair the ſiege of Troy; in his charge to his friend reſpecting the care of Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emachus, who was then in his infancy, he, among other things thus entreats them, "above all forget not to render him juſt, beneficient, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, and faithful in keeping ſecrets." And it is
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028841_0231_0FDDDC1AE8EA3288"/>
afterwards made a great part in the character of Telemachus, that he knew how to keep a ſecret, without telling any untruths, and yet could lay aſide that cloſe myſterious air ſo common to people that are reſerved. He did not ſeem oppreſſed with the burden of the ſecret he kept; he always ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eaſy, natural, open, as one that carried his heart upon his lips. But at the ſame time, that he would tell you every thing that was of no conſequence, he knew how to ſtop juſt in the proper moment, and without proceeding to thoſe things which might raiſe ſome ſuſpicion, and give a hint of his ſecret. By this means his heart was impenetrable and inacceſſible.</p>
               <p>A MAN without ſecrecy is an open letter for every one to read.</p>
               <p>THE itch of knowing ſecrets is naturally attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with another itch of telling things.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>A PROPER ſecrecy is the only myſtery of able men, myſtery is the only ſecrecy of weak and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ones. The man who tells nothing, or who tells all, will equally have nothing told him. If a fool knows a ſecret, he tells it becauſe he is a fool; if
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028841_0232_0FDDDC1E5C28F818"/>
a knave knows one, he tells it wherever it will be his intereſt to tell it. There are ſome occaſions in which a man muſt tell half his ſecret, in order to conceal the reſt; but there is ſeldom one in which a man muſt tell all. Great ſkill is neceſſary, to know how far to go, and where to ſtop.</p>

               <p>SLANDERERS are a ſpecies of creatures, ſo great a ſcandal to human nature as ſcarce to deſerve the name of men.

               <p>CALUMNY is a filthy and pernicious infection of the tongue, for it is generally aimed, by the moſt wicked and abandoned part of mankind, againſt the moſt worthy, and moſt deſerving of eſteem, and wounds them unexpectedly. And to whom is it pleaſing? To the moſt vile and perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, the talkative. But what is its ſource? From what origin does it proceed? From falſhoood for its father, and envy for its mother, and from curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity for its nurſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:028841_0237_0FDDDC2929E61300"/>
NOR is calumny itſelf without an offſpring; for it not only begets ſtrife and contention, hatred and malice, bloodſhed and murder; but nouriſhes other deſtructive evils. And now let us enquire, what is the antidote to this diſeaſe? Innocence and patience. Innocence enables us to bear it, and patience blunts its edge.—When you hear any one ill ſpoken of in your company, which happens but too often, mingle not the poiſon of your malignant reflections, nor bid higher than the reſt in the auction of ſlander, much leſs be the meſſenger of ſuch abuſes to the perſon concerned.</p>

               <p>TEN thouſand are the vehicles in which the deadly poiſon of ſlander is prepared and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the world—and by ſome artful hands, it is done by ſo ſubtle and nice an infuſion, that it is not to be taſted or diſcovered but by its effects. How frequently is the honeſty and integrity of a man diſpoſed of, by a ſmile or ſhrug.—How many good generous actions have been ſunk into obliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, by a diſtruſtful look—or ſtamped with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of proceeding from bad motives, by a myſterious and ſeaſonable whiſper. Look into the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:028841_0238_0FDDDC2D0D47A0B0"/>
companies of thoſe whoſe gentle natures ſhould diſarm them, we ſhall find little better account.—How large a portion of chaſtity is ſent out of the world by diſtant hints—nodded away, and cruelly winked into ſuſpicion, by envy. How often does the reputation of a helpleſs creature, bleed from report—which the party who is at the pains to propagate it—hopes in God it is not true, but in the mean time is reſolved to give the report her paſs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome wounds given to reputation, that are like the wounds of an envenomed arrow; where we irritate and enlarge the orifice while we extract the bearded weapon; yet cannot the cure be compleated otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>WHEN a man of diſtinguiſhed worth ſuffers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited calumny, it often has the ſame effect as an eclipſe of the ſun; which ſerves only to make it admired the more. While it ſhines in unvaried light and ſplendor, it ſhines unnoticed; but when it is obſcured by ſome ſudden and unexpected darkneſs, it attracts our attention, and emerges with an unuſual and ſuperior eclat.</p>
               <p>IN this age, in ſome companies, there remains nothing, when you have done with public affairs, and public diverſions, but private anecdotes—pulling down, or gently undermining characters,
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:028841_0239_0FDDDC304AD5B650"/>
ſitting in judgment upon thoſe tranſactions, which, though of a private nature, are, by the newly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed cuſtom of the times, laid before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic—or producing freſh accounts of them from private hands. I hardly ever hear a converſation of this kind carried on for half an hour, without ſome flagrant inſtance of ſlander and injuſtice. It is amazing to obſerve the courage with which, upon mere common report, facts are repeated, which tend to the utter ruin of a character, and even motives confidently aſſigned, which, it was impoſſible ſhould be known.</p>
               <p>THE heavieſt misfortune will not ſhelter you from cenſure, when the converſation takes this turn. If you have loſt your deareſt friend, we pity you indeed; but we cannot help obſerving, either that you have very litte feeling, and do not grieve enough, or that you are highly blameable in feeling too much, and grieving too violently; or elſe, that there is ſomething very ridiculous in your manner of ſhewing your griefs, or in ſome circumſtance of your behaviour under it. If you are ſtripped of your whole fortune, 'tis a terrible thing to be ſure, but it can't be diſſembled, that your own impudence was in a great meaſure the cauſe of it.</p>

               <p>NO virtue, no prudence, no caution, no gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity can preſerve us from miſrepreſentation.

envy, and who affect to deſpiſe him. Theſe will ſee his actions with a jaundiced eye, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them to others in the colours in which they themſelves behold them.</p>
               <p>LET the weak and ill natured enjoy the poor pleaſure of whiſpering calumny and detraction, and let the man of ſenſe diſplay the wiſdom and dignity of diſregarding them.

               <p>LET us duly learn to prize and value our ſoul; is the body ſuch a valuable piece? what then is the ſoul? the body is but a huſk, or ſhell; the ſoul is the kernel; the body is but the caſk; the ſoul is the precious liquor contained in it. The body is but the cabinet, the ſoul is the jewel. The body is but the dwelling, the ſoul the inhabitant. The body is but the lanthorn, the ſoul or ſpirit the candle of the Lord, that burns in it. And ſeeing there is ſuch difference between the ſoul and the body in reſpect of excellency, ſure our better part challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges our greater care and diligence, to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it. Bodily proviſion is but half proviſion; it is but one part, and that the meaner and more ignoble too, if we conſider only the time of this life; But if we conſider a future ſtate of endleſs duration after this life, then bodily proviſion will

appear to be but no proviſion at all, in compariſon, there being no proportion between ſo ſhort a period of time, and the infinite ages of eternity. Our great partiality towards our bodies, and neglect of our ſouls, ſhews clearly what part we prefer; we are careful enough in not wounding or maiming our bodies; but we make bold to laſh and wound our ſouls daily. We are induſtrious enough to preſerve our bodies from ſlavery, &amp;c. but we make nothing of ſuffering our ſouls to be ſlaves and drudges to luſt, and to live in the vileſt bondage to the moſt degenerate of creatures, the devil.</p>
               <p>WE arm and defend our bodies, and our ſouls have as much need of armour as they, for the life of a Chriſtian is a continual warfare, and we have potent and vigilant enemies to encounter withal, the devil, the world, and this corrupt fleſh we carry about with us. We had need therefore, to put on the whole armour of God that we may be able to ſtand in the evil day, and having done all may ſtand, having ourſelves girt with truth, and having the breaſt plate of righteouſneſs; above all, taking the ſhield of faith, and for a hemlet, the hope of ſalvation, and the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God.—Ephes. vi. 13, 14.</p>

SINCERITY of heart, and integrity of life, are the great and indiſpenſible ornaments of human nature.</p>
               <p>THAT kind of deceit which is commonly laid, and ſmootly carried on under diſguiſe of friendſhip, is of all others the moſt impious and deteſtable.</p>
               <p>NOR to intend what you ſpeak, is to give your heart the lie with your tongue; not to perform what you promiſe, is to give your tongue the lie with your actions.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can be more unjuſt or ungenerous, than to play upon the belief of a harmleſs perſon; to make him ſuffer for his good opinion, and fare the worſe for thinking me honeſt.</p>
               <p>IT would be more obliging to ſay plainly, we cannot do what is deſired, than to amuſe people with fair words; which often put them upon falſe meaſures.</p>
               <p>GREAT men muſt go and meet truth, if they are deſirous to know it; for none will carry it to them.</p>
               <p>THERE is no vice that doth ſo cover a man with ſhame, as to be falſe and perfidious.</p>
               <p>IT is eaſy to tell a lie, hard to tell but a lie. One lie needs many more to maintain it.</p>
               <p>SINCERITY is to ſpeak as we think; to do as we pretend and profeſs; to perform and make good our promiſe, and really to be what we would appear to be.</p>

LYING is a vice ſo very infamous, that even the greateſt liars cannot bear it in others.</p>
               <p>THE Egyptian princes, were uſed to wear a golden chain, beſet with precious ſtones, which they ſtiled truth, intimating that to be the moſt illuſtrious ornament.</p>
               <p>NOTHING is more noble, nothing more vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than fidelity. Faithfulneſs and truth are the moſt ſacred excellencies and endowments of the human mind.</p>
               <p>MOST of us are aware of, and pretend to deteſt the barefaced inſtances of that hypocriſy, by which we deceive others; but few of us are upon our guard, to ſee that fatal hypocriſy by which we deceive and over reach our own heart. It is a dangerous and flattering diſtemper, which has undone thouſands.</p>

               <p>HOW ſpeedily will the conſummation of all things commence! for yet a very little while, and the commiſſioned Arch Angel lifts up his hand to

heaven, and ſwears by the Almighty name, that "<hi>time ſhall be no longer.</hi>" Then abuſed opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities will never return, and new opportunities will never more be offered. Then ſhould negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent mortals wiſh ever ſo paſſionately for a few hours—a few moments only—to be thrown back from the opening eternity; thouſands of worlds would not be able to procure the grant.</p>
               <p>A WISE man counts his minutes. He lets no time ſlip, for time is life; which he makes long, by the good huſbandry, of a right uſe and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
               <p>MAKE the moſt of your minutes, ſays Aurelius, and be good for ſomething while you can.</p>
               <p>KNOW the true value of time; ſnatch, ſeize and enjoy every moment of it. No idleneſs no lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no procraſtination; never put off till tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row what you can do to day.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould read over our lives as well as books, take a ſurvey of our actions, and make an inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the diviſion of our time. King Alfred (that truly great and wiſe monarch) is recorded to have divided the day and night into three parts: Eight hours he allotted to eat and ſleep in, eight for buſineſs and recreation, and eight he dedicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtudy and prayer.</p>

TO come but once into the world, and trifle away our right uſe of it, making that a burthen which was given for a bleſſing is ſtrange infatuation.</p>
               <p>TIME is what we want moſt, but what we uſe worſt; for which we muſt all account, when time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>THERE is but little need to drive away that time by fooliſh divertiſements, which flies away ſo ſwiftly of itſelf, and when once gone, can nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be recalled.</p>
               <p>AN idle perſon is a kind of monſter in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; all nature is buiſy about him. How wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is it to hear people complain, that the day hangs heavy upon them, that they do not know what to do with themſelves. How monſtrous are ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions among creatures, who can apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the duties of religion and meditation; to the reading of uſeful books; who may exerciſe themſelves in the purſuits of knowledge and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and every hour of their lives, make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſer and better.</p>
               <p>SHOULD the greateſt part of people ſit down, and draw a particular account of their time, what a ſhameful bill would it be? So much extraordinary for eating, drinking and ſleeping, beyond what nature requires; ſo much in revelling and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo much for the recovery of laſt night's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance; ſo much for gaming, plays and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querades;
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:028841_0251_0FDDDC4BB7BB6908"/>
ſo much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent viſits, in idle and fooliſh prating, in cenſuring and reviling our neighbours; ſo much in dreſſing, and talking of faſhions; and ſo much loſt and waſted in doing nothing.</p>
               <p>THERE is no man but hath a ſoul, and, if he will look carefully to that, he need not complain for want of buſineſs. Where there are ſo many corruptions to mortify, ſo many inclinations to watch over, ſo many temptations to reſiſt, the graces of God to improve, and former neglects of all theſe to lament, ſure he can never want ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient employment. For all theſe require time, and ſo men at their deaths find; for thoſe who have lived careleſsly, and waſted their time, would then give them all to redeem it.</p>
               <p>IT was a memorable practice of Veſpaſian, thro' the whole courſe of his life; he called himſelf to an account every night for the actions of the paſt day, and ſo often as he found he had ſkipped any one day without doing ſome good, he entered upon his diary this memorial, "<hi>I have loſt a day.</hi>"</p>
               <p>IF time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not uſing it—there might be ſome excuſe for the idleneſs of half the world—but yet not a full one; for even this would be ſuch an economy, as the living on a principle ſum, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making it purchaſe intereſt.</p>

TIME is one of the moſt precious jewels which we poſſeſs; but its true value is ſeldom known till it is near a cloſe, and when it is not in our power to redeem it. The right improvement of time is of the greateſt conſequence to mankind. The preſent moment is only ours. The preſent moment calls for diſpatch; and, if neglected, it is a great chance if ever we get another opportunity. To day we live, tomorrow we may die. Beſides, we have a great work to do, and an appointed time in which it muſt be done. The uncertainty of this time adds much to its brevity; the velocity of it urges its improvement the more. Seneca obſerves, We all complain of the ſhortneſs of time, but ſpend it in ſuch a manner, as if we had too much.</p>
               <p>THE time we live ought not to be computed to by the number of years, but by the uſe which has been made of it: It is not the extent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the eſtate. Wretched and thoughtleſs creatures! in the only place where covetouſneſs were a virtue, we turn prodigals! nothing lies upon our hands with ſuch uneaſineſs, nor has there been ſo many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly and to no purpoſe. A ſhilling ſhall be hoarded up with care whilſt that which is above the price of an eſtate, is flung away with diſregard and contempt.</p>
