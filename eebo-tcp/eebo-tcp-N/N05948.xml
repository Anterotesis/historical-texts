            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="2">2. We have then on the other Hand, in the Rest of the Verse, a moving Excitation, to <hi>follow them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</hi>

            <p>And in introducing his Excitation, we may observe the Contrast between the forementioned <hi>Vice</hi> of <hi>Negligence</hi> he had been just de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orting from, and the <hi>following Duty</hi> he is going to excite them to; implied in the transitive Particle—<hi>But</hi>—as if the Apostle had said—In Opposition to such a remiss and negligent Temper and Carriage in the Christian Life, we beg you to keep in View and imitate those exemplary Saints who have gone to Heaven before you. They who have obtained the Prize did set you no such negligent Example; they led no such careless Lives, but quite the contrary: they in their Places and Times were diligent in the Christian Course; and so must you, if you ever mean to come and join them in the same Inheritance.</p>
            <p>But the farther Explication of the Text, I leave to be attempted under this general Doctrine. That in order to make a Progress and to persevere in the Christian Life, we should be careful Followers of those, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises.</p>
            <p>And to illustrate this, there are these four Heads to be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To take a general View of <hi>the Promises</hi> they had in their Eye, and whereby they were animated.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Those eminent Graces of <hi>Faith and Patience,</hi> in the Exercise whereof they brightly shone, they set a lovely Example, and through which they persevered to the promised Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The blessed Issue of their Faith and Patience in <hi>their inheriting</hi> the Promises.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007548_0006_102D7859737412C8"/>
IV. And lastly, The great Duty we are here excited to, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> to <hi>be Followers of them,</hi> if we would ever arrive at the same Inheritance.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To take a general View of <hi>the Promises</hi> they had in their Eye, and whereby they were animated.</p>
            <p>These indeed are the last Things mentioned here; but they were first in View, and are here intended as the principal Objects of their active Faith, and the principal Motives of their persevering Patience. They had Promises of glorious and eternal Things in View, which they believ'd and realiz'd; which they kept their Eyes upon continually, and which inspir'd them with a persevering Patience under all their Trials.</p>
            <p>By these <hi>Promises</hi> are meant in general, the Promises of GOD revealed and given in the <hi>inspired Scriptures,</hi> to true <hi>Believers.</hi> They are no where else to be found, and they are comprehensive of these two Things in general; (1) <hi>All the Good</hi> comprized in them; (2) The divine <hi>Word of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> which God has given Believers of its being bestowed on them.</p>
            <p>And these Promises contain both <hi>earthly, spiritual</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Blessings. For our Apostle assures us, 1 Tim. iv. 8. <hi>Godliness is profitable unto all Things; having the Promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> i. e. <hi>Real Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in Union with the <hi>Subject</hi> of it: or whoever is <hi>truly godly,</hi> as every <hi>true Believer</hi> in CHRIST JESUS is, hath the Promise both of the Continuance of the <hi>present Life,</hi> with all the imperfect Good therein, as far as the Love and Wisdom of God see fittest for them; as also of the <hi>Life to come,</hi> including all the perfect and et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nal Blessedness thereof. And all the Promises are made over to them in the <hi>everlasting Covenant</hi> of Grace, <hi>well ordered in all Things and sure,</hi> comprehending <hi>all their Salvation, and all their Desire.</hi> 2 Sam. xxiii. 5.</p>
            <p>Of these <hi>Promises</hi> we read in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. beginning; That, <hi>To them who have obtained precious Faith, through the Righteousness of</hi> GOD <hi>and our Saviour</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>are given exceeding great and precious Promises; that by these they might be Partakers of the divine Nature, having escaped the Corruption that is in the World through Lust.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this we see that these <hi>great</hi> and <hi>precious Promises</hi> are given to those who have obtained <hi>precious Faith,</hi> through the Righteousness of GOD and our Saviour JESUS CHRIST: And that their <hi>principal End</hi> is, that by their Influence, those who
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007548_0007_102D71487415F048"/>
have precious Faith <hi>might be Partakers of the divine Nature;</hi> i. e. may grow more and more like the Nature even of GOD himself, in his moral Excellencies, Views, Designs, Actions and Blessedness; even in some Degree in the present Life, and in as perfect a Degree as possible, in the future: <hi>Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing escaped the Corruption in</hi> this earthly <hi>World through Lust;</hi> i. e. having by the Influence of these Promises escaped this Corruption more and more, as they went on in their Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Course; and in the Hour of Death escaped it intirely and for ever.</p>
            <p>And those Promises may well be called <hi>exceeding great and precious,</hi> for these five <hi>Reasons;</hi> (1) Because of the exceeding great and precious <hi>Things</hi> contained in them; (2) Because they were purchased by the exceeding great <hi>Price,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> of the SON of GOD; (3) Because of the great, precious, absolute <hi>Security</hi> of their being accomplished; (4) Because they are justly exceeding great and precious, <hi>in the Esteem and Eye</hi> of every true Believer; (5) and lastly, Because of the exceeding great and precious <hi>Influence</hi> they have on those who are entitled to them, or by Faith embrace, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ive upon them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>What exceeding great and precious Promises are these?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I answer—They are almost innumerable in the Holy Scriptures: But they may all be ranked under such general Heads as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> has given, in 2 Cor. vi. and the three last Verses—<hi>As</hi> GOD <hi>has said; I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their</hi> GOD, <hi>and they shall be my People—And I will receive you, and be a Father to you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the</hi> LORD <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</hi> These the Apostle stiles by the Name of <hi>Promises,</hi> and shows the excellent Use and Influence of them in the following Verse: <hi>Having therefore these Promises, dearly Beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all Filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit, perfecting Holiness in the Fear of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>I might mention a great Variety of <hi>other Promises:</hi> But they are all comprized in <hi>These:</hi> For to have the infinite and all-sufficient GOD for <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>and Father,</hi> and for him <hi>to receive us,</hi> and <hi>dwell in us</hi> for ever, is plainly comprehensive of all the Good that our largest Hearts can wish, or our most capacious Natures can receive: and they comprehend both all the imperfect Good of the <hi>present</hi> World, and all the perfect Good of the <hi>other.</hi> But as the <hi>other</hi> is immensely more great and excellent than the <hi>present;</hi> so is the View and Purport of these comprehensive Promises: they most

eminently look to the <hi>other:</hi> they reach unto, and thro' the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There, in <hi>that other World,</hi> the Perfection of their Natures and Capacities; their perfect Likeness to the blessed GOD; their clearest Knowledge of their perfect and eternal Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, Conformity to Him and Interest in Him; with the most intimate, endless, satisfying Manifestations, Visions and Enjoyments of Him, as He appears in CHRIST, are by <hi>many Promises</hi> ensured to true Believers.</p>
            <p>Included in these Promises, is <hi>the Promise of Life which is in</hi> CHRIST JESUS, 2 Tim. i. 1. <hi>The Crown of Life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him,</hi> Jam. i. 12. <hi>And this is the Promise that he hath promised us, even eternal Life,</hi> 1 Joh. ii. 25. <hi>The Kingdom which he hath promised to them that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. <hi>The Promise of eternal Inheritance,</hi> Heb. ix. 15: and many others.</p>
            <p>They who rightly <hi>love</hi> the blessed GOD, and who <hi>believe</hi> aright in CHRIST, are the very same Persons. For they who rightly <hi>love</hi> Him, love Him as He appears in CHRIST perfectly and eternally reconcilable and amiable to them: and on the very same Account it is, that in CHRIST they view Him with intire Approbation and Complacency, <hi>believe</hi> in CHRIST to receive and reconcile them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and embrace <hi>Him</hi> as their blessed Reconciler. And one great Reason why the <hi>Promises</hi> belonging to them, sometimes describe them by their <hi>Love,</hi> and sometimes by their <hi>Faith,</hi> is because these Graces, when they look to GOD in CHRIST, in their very Nature, Motives, and Operations, ever mix together.</p>
            <p>I say, that <hi>all these</hi> and <hi>every other Promise</hi> which Respects the <hi>future</hi> and <hi>heavenly World,</hi> as well as <hi>this,</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in <hi>this one;</hi> of GOD's <hi>being our</hi> GOD <hi>and Father, and dwelling with and in us for ever;</hi> who is the only and eternal Fountain of all that's good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and every other Promise is only of some particular Stream of Good deriving from Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>This most great and perfect Good is the comprehensive Good of all the Promises. In all the Promises the glorious GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially as revealed in CHRIST, is All in All. And the Promises of <hi>this,</hi> especially as enjoyed in Perfection in the <hi>heavenly World,</hi> are firstly in the Heart and Eye of the true Believer.

            <p>Now this is that divine Grace, wrought in their Hearts by the SPIRIT of GOD, in their <hi>thorough Conviction</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi> whereby they clearly saw and believed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible GOD and <hi>his inspired Word:</hi> they saw and believed the wonderous Things contained in his Law and Gospel: they saw and believed his <hi>Being</hi> and revealed <hi>Perfections:</hi> they had high and realizing Apprehensions of Him: they saw and believ'd the vast Extent and Excellence of his <hi>Commands</hi> and <hi>Prohibitions:</hi> they believ'd his <hi>Threatnings,</hi> and had awful Views of his destroying Displeasure and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments denounced in them: they believ'd his <hi>Promises,</hi> and had enlarged, lively Views of the trans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>endent and eternal Good ensured by them: they believ'd his universal and perfect <hi>creating, upholding,</hi> and <hi>ruling</hi> the World; saw his wonderous <hi>Influence</hi> in the Works of Nature and Providence: And thereby they realized his universal and perpetual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, his all-seeing Eye, and his future Judgment.</p>
            <p>By Faith, they saw the Emptiness of Creatures, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of earthly Things, the incomparable Glories and Amiableness of GOD, especially as appearing in the Face of CHRIST; with his only all-suitableness and all-suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, fully and for ever to save and make them happy, in giving them a perfect Conformity to Him, Communion with Him, Vision and Enjoyment of Him.

            <p>By Faith, they looked into the <hi>eternal World,</hi> they were hastening to and are since entered in. They looked down
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007548_0011_102D776F64C9ADC8"/>

                  </gap> Spirits,</hi> until the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Resurrection of their vile Bodies; their rising then in Sin, in Shame, and in unsufferable Horror; the open Discovery of all their Wickedness in the View of the World; their extreme Confusion before their Judge, and that vast Assembly; their dreadful Condemnation; their being driven down to <hi>Hell,</hi> with most vile and cruel <hi>Devils,</hi> and their suffering there with them the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</p>
            <p>And by Faith they also looked up and view'd the <hi>Paradise above;</hi> the Spirits of the Just made perfect, the blessed Angels, and CHRIST the glorified Mediator there; the perfect Entertainments, Satisfactions and Delights of all the Saints and Angels in that finstless, lightsome and joyous World, until CHRIST descends with them, and the Bodies of Believers rise in Glory like Him, and mount to meet Him. And then, by Faith they view their admired HEAD in his surpassing Glories, owning every true Believer, assembling them in one vast Company, placing them at his Right Hand in the Air above, acquiting them before the World; and then, with most endearing Looks and ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Complacency, blessing them, and carrying them to Heaven with Him; there to view the amazing Wisdom of all his Works, the amazing Revelations of his Kindness to them, and the Fulness of his Excellence, and the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of GOD in him for ever.</p>
            <p>In such Views as these, their Faith was conversant: They more or less beheld them every Day. These were the great and principal Objects of their believing Contemplations. They had a clear, strong, lively, realizing View of these invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Things; were persuaded of their Truth and Certainty: And by believing them, were bro't to believe in the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble GOD as reveal'd in CHRIST; to believe in his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Promises;</hi> to embrace him in them; to believe in his All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency, Faithfulness and fixed Resolution to fulfil them; to believe in CHRIST to reconcile them to his DIVINE FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER; to believe in the FATHER to be reconciled to them by CHRIST; to believe in the DIVINE SPIRIT, to possess, dwell in, and reign over them for ever, to enlighten and sanctify; to strengthen, excite and comfort them; to guide and fit them for all this Glory, and then to be received into it.</p>
            <p>In short; their <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>the Substance of Things hoped for, the Evidence of Things not seen;</hi> Heb. xi. 1. i. e. it was that vital Grace which viewed Things hoped for as <hi>substantial</hi> or <hi>real,</hi> and

on them, too heavy for the meer Power of Nature to sustain. But their <hi>Faith</hi> then looked upward to the invisible, but absolutely sovereign, wise and holy GOD, as their covenant, kind and faithful Father and Friend in CHRIST; then looked forward to unseen and eternal Things; realiz'd the Promises in their most glorious and sure Accomplishment; saw them hastening to be fulfilled to them; yea, saw the most afflicting Providence promoting their Fulfilment; by the lively Contemplation made these Things as evident and present to them: and when their <hi>Faith</hi> beheld them, and compar'd them with their present Troubles; their Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions seem'd but light and momentany, in Proportion to the vastly far more exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, which they saw them working for them: and these believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Views bro't in an answerable Degree of <hi>Patience,</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to support them under, and sufficient for their Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, through all their Trials.</p>
            <p>I might mention a Multitude of <hi>other</hi> Trials: but must omit them, and only observe; that sometimes they were so great, so many, so grievous and so long continued, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their Prayers, and Prayers of others; that their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> were ready to fail them: But then, as the Apostle directed them in <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2, 3, They <q>looked unto JESUS, the Author and Finisher [both] of their Faith [and Patience, and whole Salvation;] who for the Joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, despising the Shame, and is set down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD; [and they] consider'd Him that endured such Contradiction of Sinners against himself, that [they] might not be wearied and faint in [their] Minds:</q> And then a fresh Supply of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> came into them, afresh uniting them in View with HIM their HEAD, in his passed Sufferings and present Glory.</p>
            <p>And see how they then exulted in a rising Flight of Joy and Triumph—as in <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1—5. <q>Being justified by Faith, we have Peace with GOD thro' our LORD JESUS CHRIST: By whom also we have Access by Faith into this Grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in Hope of the Glory of GOD: and not only so, but we glory in Tribulation also; knowing that Tribulation worketh Patience; and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—Experience; and Experience—Hope; and Hope maketh not ashamed, because [we experience, or expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally feel] the Love of GOD is shed abroad in our Hearts by the HOLY GHOST which is given unto us.</q>

            </p>
            <p>There are various Sorts of <hi>Promises,</hi> which look to the <hi>present State</hi> of Believers in the <hi>invisible World,</hi> to their <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing State</hi> at the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and universal <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>thence along</hi> to the ceaseless Ages of Eternity: And we should carefully therefore distinguish between the Promises belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them in these several States of theirs exceeding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and wherein their Bliss appears to rise and grow, above all Conception. But they are the <hi>Promises</hi> only referring to their <hi>present State</hi> in the <hi>invisible World</hi> which they are <hi>now inheriting,</hi> and we are now to view them in the Enjoyment of: Tho' at the same Time they are absolutely sure, and exceedingly rejoice in the certain View of their enjoying <hi>all the other</hi> in their full Perfection.</p>
            <p>But how do they <hi>now inherit</hi> the <hi>Promises?</hi> Or what <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment</hi> of them is it they are <hi>now possessing?</hi> Why,</p>

                  </gap>ad Bodies</hi> are even very precious, as was the <hi>Body</hi> of CHRIST while it lay in the Grave bereaved both of Life and Beauty. Tho' then there appear'd no Comeliness in it to the sensitive Eye, it yet belong'd to a <hi>Soul</hi> most glorious in the Eyes of GOD. On this Account es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, the <hi>dead Body</hi> of CHRIST was exceeding dear to HIM, as well as for the Labours, Pains, Indignities and Death it had endured for his Glory. Yea, on these Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it had a certain <hi>Right</hi> to his watchful Care, and to a glorious Resurrection to immortal Life: and under this watchful Care it rested safe, in full Assurance of that joyous Day.</p>
            <p>And so the <hi>Bodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Nor are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated only to their perfect <hi>Spirits</hi> in the World above, but most nearly also to the most glorious <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> of CHRIST himself, in whom the FATHER is perfectly pleased; and therefore He looks on <hi>their Bodies,</hi> as united to the SON of his Love, with a dear Affection.</p>
            <p>Lastly, these <hi>dead Bodies</hi> of theirs were purchas'd also by CHRIST for a Crown of Glory to himself in the heavenly Kingdom: they are his purchased Propriety, most dearly purchased, by pouring out his most precious Blood and Life and Soul to Death; and therefore <hi>their Bodies</hi> are most dearly valued. Yea, by the <hi>same Price</hi> He <hi>jointly</hi> purchas'd eternal Life for <hi>their Bodies,</hi> as well as for <hi>his own:</hi> He has invested them with the unfailing Title: He has promised it to them: He is able and faithful to fulfil his Word: and therefore carefully watches over their dusty Remains; and will certainly raise and fashion them like his own glorious Body, at his second Appearance. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2.) They are especially <hi>their separate Spirits,</hi> that are <hi>now inheriting</hi> the Promises.</p>

But <hi>the Rest of Believers</hi> from the Death of <hi>Abel</hi> to the present Day, are enjoying the Promises only in <hi>their separate Spirits;</hi> but this in a very high Degree, and a Manner exceeding happy above all that we can now conceive: And <hi>this</hi> is <hi>the inheriting</hi> the Promises we are <hi>now considering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon their <hi>Spirits</hi> being loosed from their Bodies, they are at once released intirely from a vile and dark Prison of sinful Flesh and Blood; and their <hi>Spirits</hi> enter into perfect Light and Liberty, into the glorious Liberties of the Sons of GOD. Their Spirits are intirely freed from Sin and Weakness; from Corruption, Error and Temptation; from Trouble, Fear and Doubt; and they are perfected in Strength and Holiness. Their Faculties and Powers are raised to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Height: They see the holy and mighty <hi>Angels</hi> their joyful Friends and Guardians round about them, as <hi>Elijah</hi> did, and with Transport hear their congratulating Voices. Yea, no doubt, like <hi>Stephen,</hi> they see the Heavens opened to them, and CHRIST himself at the Right Hand of the Glory of GOD, with all the shining Hosts adoring him and triumphing in him. By their Guardian <hi>Angels</hi> they are soon transported to, and welcom'd with the highest Joy by that happy Company.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There</hi> they see the amazing <hi>Glories</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> shining forth in the Face of CHRIST: They see themselves in a wonderous Manner like him: They see him looking on them with perpetual Love and Pleasure: They receive most admirable Revelations from him: They feel transporting Emanations flowing continually from his perpetual Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them: They feel themselves to the <hi>filled with all the Fulness of</hi> GOD himself, as far as they can possibly receive and bare. And who among us can conceive a thousandth Part of this Felicity? But with all the Saints they join, in singing that triumphant Song to JESUS CHRIST, <hi>the faithful Witness, the first begotten</hi> or raised <hi>from the Dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> in Rev. i. 5, 6; <hi>Unto</hi> HIM <hi>that loved us and washed us from our Sins in his own Blood, and has made us Kings and Priests unto</hi> GOD <hi>and</hi> HIS FATHER; <hi>To</hi> HIM <hi>be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>There are no doubt continual Changes and Varieties in their happy Visions and Enjoyments: But they are rather Improvements, and not Losses; they are Increases, and not Diminishings.

But our Time obliges us to come to the IMPROVEMENT.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence then we see of what great Importance tis, that we as <hi>fully as possible acquaint</hi> ourselves with <hi>the divine Promises, sec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Promises</hi> being the principal Foundation of our Faith and Patience, and the powerful Motives of our Perseverance, we need be well acquainted with them; that by a believing, realizing Prospect of them we may be prevailingly excited to a patient and persevering Suffering and Well-doing, till we come to enjoy them in Perfection in the World above.</p>
            <p>O! They are incomparably precious! They include all Good on Earth and Happiness in Heaven: they ensure them to every true Believer: they are made by HIM who is absolutely sovereign, absolute in Foresight, Wisdom, Truth and Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>O! How studiously should we enquire into them, study their extensive Fulness, gladly and gratefully embrace them; earnestly endeavour to secure an Interest in them, and to make it most clear and certain; and then abound conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the realizing Views of the glorious Things they ensure to us; chearfully improve them; and aspire to live and die in the full Assurance of their compleat Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment to eternal Ages.</p>

            <p>And the <hi>Patience</hi> whereby we come to inherit the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, is also a holy Grace or Principle wrought at first and continued in the Heart by the same SPIRIT; and from the Exercise of this lively <hi>Faith,</hi> by <hi>his Help</hi> excited into Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereby we submissively and meekly bare every Trial, and go through every Service in the Way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>And 'tis in the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>these Graces</hi> in their l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. Would we be sure of <hi>inheriting</hi> the Promises; we must not only labour to get <hi>these Graces</hi> in us, but also to gain <hi>their eminent Degrees,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> in as <hi>high</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> an <hi>Exercise</hi> of them as possible.</p>
            <p>For the livelier and stronger is our <hi>Faith</hi> in GOD and CHRIST, the holy Scriptures, the invisible World, and the divine Promises; the more earnest and lively will be our Labours to secure an Interest in them; the higher will be our Consolations, and Encouragements; the clearer and more satisfying will be our Views of the various Dispensations of divine Providence; we shall view them in Connection with the Promises and with their full Accomplishment hereafter; and the more will our Views be raised to the promised In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; the more Deligent in our Course of Obedience; the more resolute in our Contest with Temptations; and the more <hi>submissive, meek</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> under all our Sufferings in our Way to Glory.</p>

               <hi>This,</hi> indeed has also been the <hi>pious Practice</hi> of <hi>great Numbers</hi> of <hi>good Women</hi> in <hi>this Land</hi> from <hi>the Beginning,</hi> and has been a Glory to us and our pure Religion: though, as the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi> decays, I fear <hi>this exemplary Practice</hi> of our holy Ancestors is decaying therewith: and yet I hope there will be <hi>some,</hi> who will keep it up from Age to Age, to the <hi>second Coming</hi> of CHRIST; and that when ever He comes, He will find <hi>some Praying with their Children</hi> among us, and lifting up their Voice with Joy—LORD, <hi>Here am I, with the Children thou has graciously given me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) And lastly, For the <hi>Excitation</hi> of her <hi>Relatives, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants,</hi> and indeed of <hi>every one of the Audience;</hi> I shall mention some of her <hi>dying Speeches;</hi> and so conclude.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>Saturday</hi> before she died, she <hi>renew'd</hi> her <hi>Covenant</hi> with GOD in a verbal Manner; saying—<q>I dedicate myself afresh to GOD, the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST; to whom I have often given up myself in Secret with all my Heart. I praise GOD the FATHER; who has made and preserv'd me all my Life long: I praise GOD the SON; who has redeem'd and bought me with his precious Blood; who is infinitely precious to my Soul: I praise also GOD the HOLY GHOST; who sanctifies and makes me meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. And this <hi>one</hi> GOD in <hi>three Persons</hi> is my GOD, and will be my Portion for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same Day, her eldest Son coming to see Her, ask'd Her, <hi>Whether She thought She should Die?</hi> She answer'd—<hi>Yes.</hi> He ask'd, <hi>How Death appeared to Her?</hi> She answer'd,—<hi>Not as the King of Terrors.</hi> He ask'd, <hi>Whether She knew in whom She believed,</hi> and <hi>whether She could commit her Soul into his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Hands?</hi> She answer'd,—<q>Yes, Yes: tho' I die repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and my humble Trust is in the Righteousness and Merits of CHRIST alone, for my Acceptance with GOD: I have no Merit or Righteousness of my own: CHRIST is my All and in All. He has in his Word declared—<hi>All that the</hi> FATHER <hi>giveth me, shall come to me; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out:</hi>And GOD has enabled me to come to Him by his Grace and SPIRIT.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Her elder Daughter telling Her, <hi>She need not be afraid of Death;</hi> She answer'd, <q>No, I am not afraid to die: tho' Death be the King of Terrors, yet my JESUS has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Gospel.</q>

She <q>charg'd her <hi>Children</hi> to seek an Interest in CHRIST;—to seek Him early and earnestly:—and don't dare to have one repining Thought of GOD, tho' I shall leave you: For what He does is in infinite Wisdom; best for <hi>me,</hi> and best for <hi>you</hi>—Be in Subjection to the FATHER of Spirits, and live.</q> And when they wept, She said;—<q>Weep not for me: your Weeping hurts me: but rather rejoice, because I am going to the FATHER.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this, She broke out, saying,—<q>I pity my poor <hi>Girls:</hi> But be not dismayed; for my dear SAVIOUR in whom I have trusted, is the Rock of Ages; and will not fail you, if you do but seek Him and trust in Him; tho' Father and Mother forsake you, He will take you up.</q>

            <p>On the <hi>Approach</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Day Morning,</hi> as soon as the <hi>Day dawned,</hi> she thus express'd herself in Triumph and Praise to GOD—<q>Have I liv'd to see another of the Days of the Son of Man!

            </p>
            <p>At another Time, she said—<q>I long for a fuller Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of GOD's Love: LORD, lift up the Light of thy blessed Countenance upon my Soul: it will put Joy and Gladness in my Heart, more than if Corn and Wine were increased: LORD JESUS, receive my Spirit: LORD JESUS, come quickly! I am going to Glory: It is better to be with CHRIST, than to be here: I am just going: And I say with Thankfulness and Humility; that I have that Hope in me, that maketh not ashamed, the Love of GOD being shed abroad in my Soul by the HOLY GHOST: I have trusted in the LORD GOD of Truth: I have Remission through the Blood of CHRIST, even the Forgiveness of my Sins: The Blood of CHRIST cleanseth from all Sin: The Chastisement of my Peace was laid upon him; and thro' his Stripes I am healed.</q>

A <hi>Friend</hi> of hers coming in at the <hi>Evening</hi> and asking Her, <hi>Do you know me?</hi> She readily answered—<q>Yes, and I hope and trust, I shall know you in the Kingdom of Heaven, and that we shall rejoice together in Glory for ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the hearing of this, her <hi>Children</hi> wept: On which she said—<q>Do you weep or cry for me? You should rather rejoice on my Account; and I have given You all to HIM, who has said; <hi>Cast thy Fatherless Children upon me:</hi> He will never leave you, nor forsake you, if you put your Trust in him: Do my Children, as I would have you; Be in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the FATHER of Spirits!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Being ask'd—<hi>How</hi> CHRIST <hi>now appear'd,</hi> and <hi>whether she had Faith still in Exercise?</hi> She readily answer'd—<q>CHRIST is precious to me, CHRIST is infinitely precious to me: Yea, he is in me the Hope of Glory: I say again, I have that Hope that maketh not ashamed, because the Love of GOD is shed abroad in my Heart: CHRIST is the Giver of Faith: It is the Gift of GOD: My Flesh and my Heart faileth; but CHRIST is the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</q>

            <p>And now—How lovely is such a Believer as <hi>This,</hi> both in her early and later Days, in Life and Death! How ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and alluring does CHRIST, the Spirit of CHRIST, the Religion of CHRIST, the Grace of CHRIST and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations appear in such Believers, both Living and Dying!
