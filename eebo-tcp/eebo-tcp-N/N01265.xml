            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of the ESSAY we are upon, is, <hi>To Do Good in the world;</hi> and very Particularly, among <hi>Younger Perſons of the Female Sex;</hi> whoſe Improvement in Piety, would not be <hi>too much</hi> Studied, if there were <hi>much more</hi> Study Employ'd than there is upon it.</p>
            <p>I am able to ſay, on the behalf of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> That I have a ſmall Army of Neighbours Importunately calling upon me for it; A good number who tell me, tis pity ſuch <hi>Piety</hi> ſhou'd have <hi>two Burials;</hi> one in the <hi>Grave;</hi> 'tother in <hi>Oblivion:</hi> And it is a very allowable thing to gratify their <hi>Importunity.</hi> But this is a ſort of a <hi>Thread-bare Apology,</hi> which I have no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue for; I have caſt it off a great while ago. It ſignifies nothing, if the Things Publiſhed upon it, are not for <hi>the Service of Mankind.</hi> And if they are <hi>ſo,</hi> [as, Reader, I hope, what thou haſt before thee, will be!] there needs neither <hi>That,</hi> nor any other Apology at all, for their Publication.</p>
            <p>I have not Complemented the Memory of the Deceaſed Perſon; or treated her, as a <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> his <hi>Julitta,</hi> a <hi>Nyſſen</hi> his <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> a <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> his <hi>Pelagia,</hi> and a <hi>Jerom</hi> his <hi>Marcella.</hi> Nor have I been labouring to make an Addition unto <hi>Beverovicius</hi>'s Catalogue, of, <hi>Women that
<pb facs="unknown:001508_0003_0FB380365E266A10"/>
have been Conſiderable.</hi> I have only <hi>Shown</hi> ſome of the <hi>Garments of Righteouſneſs;</hi> I will not ſo much ſay, <hi>Made</hi> by a Younger <hi>Dorcas;</hi> (only that the <hi>Needle-work</hi> of her <hi>Pen</hi> was Employ'd thereupon:) but <hi>Worn</hi> by her, and <hi>Made,</hi> I ſhould rather ſay, by the <hi>Good Spirit of Grace,</hi> whoſe internal <hi>Raiment of Needle-work,</hi> renders the <hi>Daughters</hi> of the LORD, <hi>all Glorious within.</hi> The Account, I hope, is <hi>Modest;</hi> and without <hi>Flouriſh;</hi> And every thing in the world for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, but what was thought might be <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Lamp</hi> found in <hi>Tulliola</hi>'s Tomb, was not of ſo much uſe, as that <hi>Shining Piety,</hi> which is in ſuch Papers, as we find in a little Trunk of a Young <hi>Agatha</hi> departed from us. We are with a mighty Advantage told, <hi>what ſhould be done,</hi> when we are at the ſame time ſhown, <hi>what has been done,</hi> in a courſe of Piety.</p>
            <p>The Sorrow on the Death of ſuch a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is marvellouſly Extinguiſhed, by ſuch <hi>Reliques!</hi> O <hi>Rome,</hi> How preferrible to thy boaſted <hi>Reliques!</hi> I had almoſt ſaid, Every <hi>Sorrowful Tear</hi> is a ſort of a <hi>Sadducee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſatisfaction of having <hi>Done Good,</hi> by Exhibiting the <hi>Memorials of Piety</hi> left by ſuch a <hi>Christian,</hi> will be an abundant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, for all the Obloquy, of ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious People, who are of another, and a well known Character.</p>
            <p>It was a peculiar Honour to <hi>Shallum,</hi> Neh. III. 12. That <hi>he and his Daughters,</hi> did more than a little to build up the <hi>City of God.</hi>

               <hi>MEMOIRS</hi> OF <hi>Mrs.</hi> Jeruſha Oliver, Who Died, 30. <hi>d.</hi> 10. <hi>m.</hi> 1710.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. ABOUT the middle of the former Century, there died at <hi>Norwich</hi> in Great <hi>Britain,</hi> one of the Female Sex, &amp; of no very conſiderable Quality, in the Thirtieth Year of her Age; who left behind her a <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of her <hi>Faith,</hi> and a <hi>Relation</hi> of her <hi>Experience,</hi> with ſome other grateful &amp; uſeful Remembrances of her Piety. The famous Dr. <hi>John Collings,</hi> thought it worth his while, to Publiſh thoſe <hi>Memorials,</hi> with a Sermon of his own, which he Entitles; <hi>The Life and Death of a true Chriſtian; deciphered
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001508_0005_0FB3803DD2A59328"/>
in a Sermon, at the Burial of</hi> Mary Simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>a Religious Young Maid, lately Living in the City of Norwich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There has lately Died in <hi>Boſton,</hi> one of the Female Sex, as conſiderably Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced; who had not attained unto that Age by ſeveral Years; but who has left behind her, as Memorable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of her Piety, which may prove as Grateful and Uſeful to many Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivers; and I am deſired by many, to make a brief <hi>Collection</hi> of them. Tho' the <hi>Collector</hi> ſhould be ſuppoſed never ſo nearly Related unto the Perſon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, yet while he forbears every thing that looks like Flouriſh and Applauſe upon her Character, and gives but a bare Tranſcript, and Extract of thoſe <hi>Memoirs,</hi> which her own Pen had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, it is to be hoped, that many, eſpecially Young Perſons, and of the Female Sex, may Enjoy the Benefit of theſe things, without any Invidious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches upon the offer of them. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> began his Funeral Oration upon his Deceaſed Siſter <hi>Gorgonia,</hi> with a ſhort Anſwer to all Cavil againſt ſo <hi>Domeſtick

                  </gap>, They being things that I am ſo nearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto, they are not the leſs True, but the more known, for That; and it is but the more Juſt for me to give an Account concerning them.</hi> What was Good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Twelve Hundred Years ago, ſhould ſtill be ſo!</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. THE Young Gentlewoman, who is now (as I have told you,) to <hi>Write,</hi> rather than to be <hi>Written</hi> of, was Born at <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>N. E. April</hi> 16. 1684. a Daughter of Dr. IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CREASE MATHER; And in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have ſufficiently intimated, what Education was beſtow'd upon her. The Reverend Mr. <hi>Richard Mather</hi> of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> and (by the Mothers ſide) Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> the for ever Famous Teacher of the Church firſt in <hi>Boſton,</hi> were her Grand-fathers. She wanted not for good Senſe; and as ſhe was betimes a <hi>Good Reader,</hi> ſo by being a <hi>Great Reader</hi> ever ſince, Four Years Old, in <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Books, as well as <hi>Theological,</hi> ſhe furniſhed her mind with a ſtock of many Valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001508_0007_0FB38045CEAB7288"/>
Treaſures. But the <hi>Early Fear of God,</hi> was the moſt Valuable of all the things that Enriched her; and not the leaſt Obſervable. <hi>Secret Prayer</hi> was an Exerciſe of her <hi>Infancy;</hi> The <hi>Fear of Sin,</hi> had a ſtrong Influence upon her; And eſpecially ſhe ſo fear'd a <hi>Lye,</hi> that ſhe then began a Cuſtom ſhe never left off; to Avoid <hi>Poſitive</hi> Expreſſions, but rather to ſay, <hi>I think,</hi> or, <hi>It may be,</hi> or, <hi>Tis likely;</hi> even in things that ſhe was moſt aſſured of. So <hi>Dutiful</hi> ſhe was to her <hi>Parents,</hi> that I have ſeen it aſſerted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hand; <hi>She never gave occaſion to them, to be once Angry with her, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Courſe of her Life!</hi> What ſhe was in her <hi>Infancy,</hi> one might a little infer, from a <hi>Catalogue of her Sins,</hi> which her Penitent Soul drew up, as ſhe was paſſing out of that Age, and yet ſcarce Entring into the Years which we call the <hi>Teens.</hi> Her <hi>Catalogue</hi> does conſiſt of ſuch ſtrokes as theſe; <hi>What Sins have I been guilty of! O my Sins have been very many! — My Prayers have been ſleighty: And I have ſpent my Time very unprofitably, And I have Read the Holy Word of God ſleightily. And I have Heard the Word
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001508_0008_0FB3804755ABA738"/>
of God ſometimes, not with ſo much Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence as I ſhould have done. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have not attended upon Hearing of Prayer as I ſhould have done. And I have been Proud. And I have been Unthankful. And ſometimes I have not Obeyed my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and my Mother as I ought to have done. And I have Eaten things, which were hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to Eat; And I have Eat more than I have had need to have done. And I have been afraid to go alone to Pray. I uſed to Pray, when I was a bed. Thoſe were Lazy Prayers indeed! I have omitted thoſe Duties of Meditation and Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And I have ſometimes omitted to ask a Bleſſing of God, when I have been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Eat; and to give Thanks, when I had done Eating. And I have Performed this Duty ſleightily. And I have been Guilty of one Sin, which is greater than all theſe; That is, Unbelief. And beſides all this, there is that Sin of Sins, my Original Sin; My Nature is Sinful.</hi> Thus wrote <hi>Jeruſha,</hi> while her <hi>Infancy</hi> was hardly yet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired. Theſe were the worſt Things that ſhe could Charge upon her ſelf, when ſhe was then making her Eſſays
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001508_0009_0FB38048594ECE38"/>
towards the <hi>well-grown Devotions,</hi> of no leſs than <hi>Whole Days,</hi> of Retirement, for the <hi>Humiliations</hi> of a Repenting Soul. O more Aged Profeſſors of Religion; To what a <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> in your <hi>walk with God,</hi> will you be Awakened; when you ſee a <hi>Child,</hi> Reflecting with all the Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Repentance,</hi> on miſcarriages which few, few among the Children of men, have any <hi>Trouble</hi> for, take any <hi>Notice</hi> of!</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. WHen ſhe was Twelve Years old, the <hi>Reſolutions of Piety</hi> in her were arrived unto ſuch a Fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſtabliſhment, that ſhe came to a very Solemn Tranſaction with the Glorious GOD. She Entred into His COVENANT; and ſhe did with all poſſible Solemnity ſet her Hand unto an Inſtrument for that purpoſe, which appears to have been very much her own Drawing up: tho' ſhe had a well-known Copy of another before her. Here it is.</p>

Creature. I have Great Cauſe to Love and Serve ſo Gracious a God. What can I do leſs, than give up my ſelf wholly to the Lord, to be for Him, and not for any other? And, O moſt Holy Lord God, wilt thou be pleaſed to Accept of me? Yea, Lord, I know, thou wilt accept of me, if I do Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely Give my ſelf to Thee in CHRIST. Then, O Lord, I Pray thee, for the Sake of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, Be at Peace with me. O Lord, I have fallen from thee, by my Sins, and I am by Nature, a Child of Hell. But thou, O Lord, of thy Infinite Mercy haſt offered to be my God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come unto thee, and I Renounce my Sins; and, with thy Grace inabling me, I will Forſake them. I have been Serving thine Enemies, and Forgetting the God that has dealt very Mercifully with me. But now, O Lord, I will Endeavour to Serve thee; And I will not allow my ſelf in any known Sin; and I will uſe the Means, which I know, thou haſt appointed ſo the Deſtruction of my Corruptions. I here give my Heart unto thee; O Lord, I Pray thee to give me a New Heart. And I deſire Grace from thee, that when thou ſhalt call me thereto, I may part with all that is dear unto me in the World, rather than turn from thee to the ways of Sin. O Lord, I have not any Hopes of being
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001508_0011_0FB3804B711FD228"/>
Saved upon the account of any Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my own. I acknowledge, that of my ſelf, I am Helpleſs and Undone, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Righteouſneſs. And whereas, thou doſt offer to be my God thro' Chriſt, I do here take the Lord JEHOVAH, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for my Portion. And I do give my ſelf Body and Soul, for thy Servant. I do here alſo Accept of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as the only way, by which Sinners may have Acceſs to thee. And I do here joyn my ſelf in a <hi>Marriage-Covenant</hi> with Him. O Lord, JESUS, I come unto thee, a moſt lothſome Creature. Who am I, that I ſhould be <hi>Married</hi> unto the King of Glory! I Accept of thee for my Head &amp; Husband; and Embrace thee in all thy Offices. I chuſe thee, the Lord my Righteouſneſs. Grant that thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be my Guide; I deſire, that thy Will may be my Will, and thy Word my Law. I put my Neck under thy Yoke, I Subſcribe to thy Laws as Holy and Juſt and Good; and I do Promiſe to take them, at the Rule of my Life.</p>

            <p>This Tranſaction was on a <hi>Twentieth Day of February,</hi> 1696. And in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Years of her Life, conſtantly, as the <hi>Twentieth Day of February</hi> arrived.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001508_0012_0FB3804CD8950F70"/>
it was her Practice, to Review her COVENANT, and Bewayl her Sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and Fly to the <hi>Blood of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant</hi> for the Pardon of them, and Renew her Holy Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Live yet more Watchfully and Fruitfully, &amp; Implore the Aſſiſtences of Heaven to perform what ſhe Reſolved.</p>
            <p>I will only Single out One or Two of thoſe Commemorations, from her Memorials: February 20. 1703. <hi>It is this Day Seven years, ſince I did make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; in which Covenant, I did take the Lord Jehovah, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for my Portion and Best Good; and did Promiſe to Forſake Sin, and to Endeavour to Serve God; And did Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, for my Head &amp; Husband, and did Embrace Him in all His Offices. The Lord Pardon my not being ſo Sincere in, and ſo Faithful to, that Covenant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere in it, and Faithful to it; And Pardon all my Sins; keep me from Sin; and that for the Sake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another time. Feb. 20. <hi>This Day Twelve years ago, I did very Explicitely
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001508_0013_0FB38052D0AE5708"/>
enter into Covenant with God. The Lord Pardon my not being ſo Sincere in, and ſo Mindful of, and ſo Faithful to, that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as I ought to have been, and make me Sincere, and Mindful, and Faithful; And make me very Thankful unto that God, who has not cut me down for my Unfruitfulneſs, but has ſpared me, not for Three Years only, but Four times Three Years, notwithſtanding my Covenant-breaking. And the Lord ſpare me ſtill, for the Sake of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, and grant that I may receive thoſe continual Supplies of Grace and Strength from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, that I want, and grant, that the Holy Spirit may Poſſeſs me, and fill me with Good Thoughts, and Good Deſires, and Good Reſolutions, and Good Actions; and grant that I may Glorify God as long as I Live; and grant that my Death may be Happy &amp; Joyful; and that for the Sake of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That She might go on, with a more <hi>Confirmed Piety,</hi> when ſhe was near Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old, She joyned unto the Church, of which her Father and her Brother are the <hi>Paſtors;</hi> and Exhibited unto the Church, an Acceptable <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001508_0014_0FB380551255AE08"/>
of her Faith &amp; Repentance; and at the Table of the Lord, <hi>Seal'd</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> in the way of His Appointment.</p>
            <p>I think it my Duty to interpoſe my Advice unto the Young Readers, on this occaſion. I fear, I fear, that the Action of <hi>Entring into Covenant with God,</hi> is too often done, with a little too much of the Strain of the <hi>Old Covenant.</hi> And for this very Cauſe, the Lord often leaves His <hi>Covenanting,</hi> and really Regenerate Children, to Some Remarkable <hi>Falls into Sin</hi> afterwards, that He may drive them into more <hi>Evangelical Terms,</hi> and make them ſenſible that it is not a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works,</hi> but a <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein they are to draw near unto Him. I make no doubt, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of the Two Pious <hi>Alleines,</hi> and <hi>Janeway,</hi> and <hi>Guthry,</hi> and others, for, <hi>Explicit Covenanting with God,</hi> yea, <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>Signing</hi> the Inſtrument, have been a mighty Service to Religion, in very many Thouſands of Chriſtians, as they were in our <hi>Jeruſha.</hi> Yet <hi>I will ſhew you mine Opinion.</hi> The <hi>Form</hi> uſed by thoſe Men of God, is hardly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001508_0015_0FB3805736A2A220"/>
quite <hi>Evangelical</hi> enough. I would propoſe, that the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is all over, <hi>Grace, Grace;</hi> be thoroughly conſidered by them who do this Action; and that the Terms of, <hi>I Confeſs,</hi> and, <hi>I Conſent,</hi> and, <hi>I Deſire,</hi> be preferred, unto, <hi>I Will;</hi> as Language beſt Suiting the Nature &amp; the Tenour of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> in which, tis not by <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but by <hi>Receiving,</hi> that we arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bleſſedneſs, and that our Holy <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions</hi> be form'd, as points of <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to the Lord from whom we <hi>Receive</hi> the Gift of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and as parts of our Promiſed Bleſſedneſs; and the ſtyle thereof be, <hi>O my God, I ask of thee, that thou wilt give me the Grace to do ſuch and ſuch things!</hi>

            <p>On <hi>Febr.</hi> 20. 1709. She remembers that it was then Thirteen years ſince ſhe had thus given her ſelf to God, and has ſerious and holy Reflections on it: She did not Live to another <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>February.</hi>

ſharpneſs in her <hi>Eye Sight,</hi> being able to Read by ſuch a dim light as others could not, for which ſhe was Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, and made a good improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. She became from her Childhood a notable Miſtreſs of her <hi>Pen;</hi> wrote a Fair Hand, and rarely Miſs ſpelt a Word in all that Paſſed her Hand. She was to her Father his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuenſis,</hi> could read his ordinary hand and characters: Tranſcribed ſeveral of his Printed Books for the Preſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the many other Good Things, wherein ſhe employ'd her <hi>Pen,</hi> One was her <hi>Diary,</hi> wherein ſhe did, eſpecially for the Laſt Ten Years of her Life, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch Paſſages as concern'd her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior State;</hi> and indeed ſeldome let a Day paſs without entring Something or other, that was an Aſpiration of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Piety: always Ending with that clauſe; <hi>For the Sake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All that I propoſe now to do, is only to make a few faithful <hi>Extracts</hi> from, and uſeful <hi>Remarks</hi> on, theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <hi>Memorials.</hi> And the firſt thing, which I will mention, before I Proceed
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001508_0017_0FB3805C70C71368"/>
unto any thing elſe in the World ſhall be, a Notable Proof, That the Doctrines of <hi>Grace,</hi> have no Tendency to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the <hi>Zeal of Good Works,</hi> and that <hi>Juſtification</hi> by a <hi>Precious Faith in the Righteouſneſs of God</hi> our Saviour, is no Enemy to the moſt Conſcientious and Elevated <hi>Purity.</hi> In her <hi>Diary,</hi> ſhe very often makes her Flight unto the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of the Bleſſed JESUS, as the only <hi>Refuge</hi> of her Soul, the only Hope of her Acceptance with God. Very, very often her Language is this; <hi>The Lord Enable me, Sincerely to Renounce all my own Righteouſneſs, and enable me Sincerely to Accept of the Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and to depend on that alone, for my Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And the Lord be Reconciled to me through</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and Pardon all my Sin, <hi>and keep me from Sin;</hi> and that for the Sake of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the conſtant Strain! But now, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Didſt thou not obſerve one clauſe in her Prayer; <hi>And keep me from Sin!</hi> This is what I am now to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Such a <hi>Dread and Hatred of Sin,</hi> there was in the Soul thus relying upon
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001508_0018_0FB3805D52424930"/>
the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the Sinleſs JESUS a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to <hi>Juſtify</hi> her, that it is a clauſe for ever occurring in almoſt every Prayer, Let the Subject ſhe is upon be what it will: <hi>And keep me from Sin!</hi> I believe, the clauſe occurs many more than a Thouſand times.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. EAch Book of her <hi>Diary,</hi> ſhe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally began on her Birth-day. Then ſhe noted her Age; Her <hi>Thanks</hi> to Heaven for <hi>Obtaining the Help</hi> which <hi>continued her to this Day;</hi> Her <hi>Griefs</hi> for the paſt Sins of a Life rolled away in ſo much <hi>Unfruitfulneſs;</hi> And her <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that the <hi>Next Year</hi> might be under the Bleſſing of God, and better ſpent, than any that had gone before it.</p>
            <p>When ſhe heard any <hi>Sermons</hi> Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (yea, or but the <hi>Repetition</hi> of them at a more <hi>Private Meeting</hi>) She would mention the Preacher, and the Subject; and there-upon add the <hi>Principal Wiſhes,</hi> which were enkindled in her Soul, by what ſhe had been entertained withal. O our Hearers, If we were ſure, that you were generally Such <hi>Attentive</hi> and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001508_0019_0FB3805ED12B0CD0"/>
Such <hi>Improving</hi> Hearers, how much would it Encourage our moſt Exquiſite <hi>Preparations</hi> for the <hi>Offerings</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If ſhe were Detain'd from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſhe would in her <hi>Diary</hi> bewayl it, as a Chaſtiſement upon her former Deficiences. And ſhe would write down, her <hi>Wiſhes</hi> fetch'd out of the Books, that ſhe Read at home.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Comfortable Diſpenſations</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards her, She mention'd, with her <hi>Thankful Remarks</hi> upon them. Yea, tho' it were but in being Safely carried out and home, as far as <hi>Roxbury;</hi> She ſees the Mercy of God in it.</p>
            <p>If any <hi>Afflictive</hi> Thing befel her, She mention'd it, with her <hi>Uſeful Remarks</hi> upon it. Eſpecially, if it were an Ill Turn upon her Health; tho' it were but a <hi>Cold,</hi> or a Fit of the <hi>Toothach;</hi> There's a Prayer on the occaſion.</p>
            <p>She Remarks the Dealings of God with <hi>Others;</hi> Eſpecially if any thing either Good or Bad were obſervable in the condition of the <hi>Town;</hi> But moſt of all what occurr'd Joyful or Grievous,

unto her neareſt <hi>Relatives,</hi> and their <hi>Families;</hi> and ſhe employes agreeable <hi>Meditations</hi> &amp; <hi>Supplications</hi> there-upon.</p>
            <p>When ſhe underſtood that her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>England</hi> had been Sick and was Recovered, ſhe poured out her Soul in Praiſes to the Lord; and in Prayer for that Brother on that Occaſion. It is not then to be wondred at, if ſhe was deeply affected with the ſtate of ſuch of her near Relations as ſhe had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Converſation with, and was at all times Acquainted with their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It would make this Account too large, ſhould all ſuch particulars of that Nature be inſerted. Nor would we trouble the World with private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Only as a Monument of her Piety and Prayerfulneſs one Inſtance ſhall be taken notice of. She thus wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in her <hi>Diary, July,</hi> 10. 1708. <q>This Day my Siſter <hi>Sarah,</hi>
[She is Conſort to Mr. <hi>Walter,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Roxbury;</hi>] who had been Ill almoſt a Month; was in very Dangerous circumſtances. A Meſſenger came to inform her Friends of it. I was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001508_0021_0FB38064EBEAC088"/>
much concerned for her, and much afraid that ſhe would have Died. But the Gracious and Almighty GOD, who can do every thing; and who has granted great Deliverances to me, and to all my Brothers and Siſters, and who did ſome Years ago won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drouſly, and even beyond Humane Expectation, deliver my Siſter from Death, did again hear Prayers for her, and did grant her to be ſafe Delivered this Afternoon. The Lord Sanctify to my Siſter, and to all Concerned, and to me in a ſpecial manner, the great Danger ſhe was in, and the great and gracious Deliverance ſhe has had this Day. The Lord perfect her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and grant that ſhe and I too may Live while we are fit and willing to Dye.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In her Diary, <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. 1710. which was Two Years after the former, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Siſter; her words are, <q>She has lately Experienced ſignal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I was concerned for her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Pray that ſhe might have a better Lying-in than ſhe uſeth to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001508_0022_0FB3806664C56420"/>
have. My Good God heard me; ſhe has had a much better Travail than ſhe uſes to have. The Lord preſerve her Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> reſtore her to Health, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy all Divine Diſpenſations to her; make her Thankful, and make me Thankful for Mercies vouchſafed to her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such as theſe were the breathings of her Pious Soul. It is ſurely a great Loſs to them that ſurvive, when ſuch a Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation is taken from them: Yet it is a Comfort that their Prayers Live after they themſelves are gone out of this Sinful &amp; Sorrowful World.</p>
            <p>She <hi>Oftentimes</hi> (and <hi>Conſtantly</hi> before the <hi>Communion,</hi>) ſet apart a Time, for Solemn <hi>Self-Examination.</hi> Many <hi>Books of Piety</hi> ſerved her in this moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and Profitable Exerciſe. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly Mr. <hi>Doolittle</hi>'s; and of late years, Mr. <hi>Henries</hi> Diſcourſe of the Lord's Supper: But ſhe had none more at hand than one Entituled, <hi>A Companion for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</hi> The Reſult is entred ſtill in her <hi>Diary,</hi> I don't find the Triumphs of Aſſurance; a frequent Reſult: but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001508_0023_0FB38100101514A8"/>
tis, a Modeſt and Humble <hi>Hope,</hi> That ſhe has had a <hi>True Converſion,</hi> and that ſhe <hi>is a True Believer</hi> on her Saviour.</p>
            <p>In one of her Diaries her words are, <hi>This Day I ſpent ſome time in Self-Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; The Lord grant that I might have the infallible Marks of a ſincere Chriſtian; and grant that I may diſcern thoſe Marks</hi> In another her words are, <hi>I hope God has made me a true Believer on Chriſt. I have given my ſelf to Him; and I deſire to have Him for my Portion.</hi> Very often ſhe writes, <hi>This Day I ſpent ſome time in Examining my ſelf.</hi> And frequently Concludes upon it; <hi>I hope I am a Believer! I hope I am Converted!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. SHE was no ſtranger to that great Article of the <hi>Chriſtian Aſceticks,</hi> To Retire whole DAYES, for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God! To ſet apart <hi>Whole Dayes,</hi> for <hi>Prayer</hi> with <hi>Faſting,</hi> (at leaſt ſo much <hi>Faſting,</hi> as the Feeble ſtate of her Health would allow;) in Secret, before the Lord. On which <hi>Dayes,</hi> it was her uſage, to <hi>Pour out her Soul unto the Lord,</hi> in the moſt Extended
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001508_0024_0FB3810191A7F178"/>
Supplications; Confeſs her own Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and Implore the Favours of God for her ſelf and others; And between thoſe Devotions, intermix the <hi>Reading</hi> of ſuch Things, as might blow up the Flame of Piety. The Firſt Time that I find her Employed in the <hi>Faſt of the Cloſet,</hi> is, when ſhe was but Thirteen Years of Age. A marvellous way, for a <hi>Child</hi> to grow Grave, and Wiſe, and Holy; For a <hi>Child</hi> to be an <hi>Hundred Years Old.</hi> The laſt time ſave one, that I find any Diſtinct Record of her being thus Engaged, was upon the Propoſal of her <hi>Marriage</hi> to a Vertuous Young Man, Mr. <hi>Peter Oliver,</hi> a Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith in <hi>Boſton.</hi> One in Good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for a Skilful Artiſt in his Calling, as well as for his Piety. With whom ſhe was like to have Lived Happily, he being very Tender of her. When her Marriage with that Perſon was like to proceed, ſhe then writes, among other things; <hi>I would keep a Day of Prayer, to Deſire the Direction and Bleſſing of God, and that every Circumſtance of that Affair may be ordered in much Mercy. And that I may
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001508_0025_0FB38103123B4450"/>
be provided with the ſupplies I now want. And I would Repent of all the ſins of my Single ſtate before I Marry. And I would ſeek unto God, for Grace and Wiſdom, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Temporal Affairs with Diſcretion; And to Glorify and Serve God, in all Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Conditions. The Lord hear me, and grant that my Soul may be Married unto</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and that both in Life &amp; Death, I may be the Lord's.</hi> The laſt Time of all was juſt before ſhe Removed from her Fathers Houſe, to Houſe-keeping, and about three or four Months before her Death.</p>
            <p>When Publick Dayes of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> arrived, her manner was to write down in her Diary, the things which 'twas her Deſire, to be <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> for; and the Things to be <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for. Here ſhe conſidered not only her own <hi>Sins,</hi> and her own <hi>Sorrows,</hi> but thoſe alſo of the Family whereto ſhe was Related; and thoſe of the <hi>Church</hi> whereof ſhe was a Member; and thoſe of the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Land.</hi> Yea, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations reached as far as the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our whole Nation, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001508_0026_0FB381048FDECE20"/>
the Afflictions of the People of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World. It is very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to ſee what will be done this way, by a <hi>Child,</hi> that has an Heart poſſeſſed by the Holy Spirit of God! And, when the <hi>Mercies</hi> of God were to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, ſhe not only took Notice of the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> that ſhe had her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but alſo of the Inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord had Bleſs'd her ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives; (eſpecially, in the <hi>Services</hi> which He honoured her Father, and her Two Brothers to do for Him:) and the Things wherein the Town &amp; Land, and Great <hi>Britain</hi> alſo were favoured of the Lord. Her Pious <hi>Methods</hi> are enough <hi>Explained,</hi> without our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing at large many Paragraphs of her <hi>Memorials;</hi> only one or two of them.</p>

                  <hi>November</hi> 23. 1709. To-morrow a Publick Thanksgiving is to be attended in this Province. The Lord Pardon my not deſiring a Thankful Heart ſo much as I ought, &amp; give me a Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart; and grant that I may on the morrow attend both on Publick and Private Duties as I ought.

Mercies to this Land; To this Town; To this Family, To my Relations, and to me. There has been no Breach made in the Family by Death a great while. The Health of the Family has been preſerved in a Gracious meaſure. My Parents are yet Living, and enjoy Health. My Father is favoured with a very Happy Old Age. My Brothers are both Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the work of the Miniſtry; and I hope have obtained Grace to be Faithful therein. My Siſters have I hope all of them Grace in their Hearts, and they have all of them had great Temporal Bleſſings beſtowed on them at one time or other. My Siſter <hi>Greens</hi> Husband has in the Year paſt, Experienc'd an Eminent Sea-delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The Lord make me Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for all theſe Mercies. As to my ſelf, I am Alive. I have had many Deliverances from Death. I have had many Reſtorations from Sickneſs,

and one a few Months ago. I have had Friends about me; and ſuitable Medicines when I have been Sick. I enjoy things not only for Neceſſity, but for Conveniency. I have been preſerved from Painful Diſeaſes, which ſome better than I have been afflicted with. I have been kept both at Home and Abroad, from many Evils which would have befallen me, if my God had not preſerved me. My Fears have been many times prevented. I enjoy a far greater meaſure of Health and Strength now, than I did a while ago. I ought to be Thankful for my Memory, and Underſtanding, and Speech; and for my Eye-ſight, which I have in greater meaſure than many others. I ought to be Thankful for Temporal, much more for Spiritual Bleſſings. I was Born of Pious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and my Grand-Parents all of them were Pious. I have had a Pious Education. I enjoy the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and live under a Lively Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. I have many Good Books. I enjoy Sabbaths &amp; Sacraments. And

I hope God has given me Grace in my Soul. I think I Love CHRIST; I am ſure I deſire to Love Him, and to Live to Him. I have had ſenſible Anſwers of Prayer; and one this Week. The Lord grant that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God to me, may cauſe me to Devote my Body, my Soul, my All to my God; and grant that I may Praiſe, and Love, and Glorify Him as long as I Live; and grant that my Death may be Happy and Joyful; and <hi>keep me from Sin,</hi> and aſſure me that my Sins are Forgiven; and grant that I may Rejoyce in the Lord, and Joy in the God or my Salvation, and that for the ſake of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</q>

            <p>Theſe were her Meditations by way of Preparation for a Day of Publick Thanksgiving. We ſhall only further inſert what is found among the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> of her walking with God, relating to a Day of Secret Prayer, between God and her own Soul. An Exerciſe of Piety, in which ſhe was (as has been ſaid) very frequent. The laſt of them was <hi>September</hi> 16. 1710. <q>This being

(ſaith her <hi>Diary</hi>) the Day that I uſe to ſpend ſome time of it in Self-Examination; and in probability tis (if not the laſt) one of the laſt ſuch Dayes that I ſhall have before I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to Houſe keeping, where it may be I ſhan't have that Leiſure Time, nor that Opportunity of a Convenient Private Place, that now I have. I would feign ſpend as much of this Day as my Bodily Infirmities will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, in Self-Examination, (though my Health won't ſuffer me to Faſt) Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, Repentance and Prayer. I have Experienc'd Gracious Anſwers of Prayer. When I was about to Marry, I ſet a Day apart in a ſpecial manner to ſeek unto my God, for a Bleſſing on that Affair. My God did Graciouſly Anſwer my Prayers then. Now I am to remove from this Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I would ſeek unto God that He would order every Circumſtance of that Affair in much mercy; that He would Pardon the Sins I have been Guilty of here; and that He will give me Grace to Glorify Him in all Places,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001508_0031_0FB38113906BEF08"/>
and in all Relations, and that He will give all that wiſdom I ſhall want to guide all my affairs with diſcretion, and that He will alſo, if it be His ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will, preſerve my Life and Health. I am (I think) above five Months gone with Child, which has occaſioned my being much indiſpoſed at times. I would in a very ſpecial manner this day prepare for my Lying-in, and would therefore prepare for Death. I am of a very fearful diſpoſition na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, and am much afraid of Death, and therefore afraid what will be the iſſue of my being with Child; but I deſire to commit my whole ſelf, Soul and Body, and all the concerns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto my God, and my Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and particularly that affair of my Travail and Lying-in. My God has prevented my fears ſometimes. I deſire to truſt in him that He will do ſo concerning this alſo. The Lord grant that I may be aſſured that my Sins are pardoned, and grant that I may through Chriſt obtain the victory over Death, &amp; over my fears of Death.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001508_0032_0FB38115D0C66348"/>
And let the bleſſing of God be on me while I am with Child. If it be His holy Will preſerve me from hurtful falls and blows and frights, and from every evil accident, and grant that I may go out my Time, and when my Travail comes, Let it be eaſy, ſafe, and ſhort if it be the Will of God, even far better than my fears, and that for the Sake of my Redeemer, who was born of a Woman. And let the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God be on the fruit of my Womb. Let it be a perfect Child, and let it be the Lord's. I would devote my ſelf and my unſeen Offspring unto God. And I do through the Grace of Chriſt reſolve, and in His Strength promiſe, that if God will ſpare my Life, and the Life of my Offspring, I will endeavour to bring it up in the fear of God, and will endeavour that it may betimes Serve God, and Believe in Chriſt. The Lord accept of me and mine thro' Chriſt and give me a renewed and reſigned will, and fit me for whatever may be the Will of God concerning me, <hi>and keep me from Sin,</hi>

            <p>I was going on; — But the <hi>Swell</hi> of the work, which will be Loſt if it be not Confined unto <hi>Narrow Limits,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids my proceeding any further. So much of the <hi>Oyl in the Veſſel,</hi> may ſuffice to anſwer the preſent Intention. I only ſay; Firſt, I do very Solemnly Declare, That I have been careful not to <hi>Add One Word,</hi> unto the Writings from which I have been thus Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing. It muſt alſo be Remembred, that it is not an <hi>Able Divine,</hi> but a <hi>Little Damſel,</hi> whoſe Writings are here Tranſcribed. Furthermore, In theſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001508_0047_0FB3813490576920"/>
Few Paſſages, there are the main <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments</hi> of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and of a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in a Mind Renewed, and Sanctified, and Purified by the Spirit of God. They that have the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> will Rejoyce when they ſee theſe things, and Read them with an Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcence of Heart, as finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wound up to an <hi>Uniſon</hi> with them. Finally. The <hi>View</hi> of theſe Diſpoſitions, may by the Bleſſing of God, be helpful, and be honoured with ſome Inſtrumentality, to produce, or maintain the like in others; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Perſons of the ſame <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Sex</hi> with her, from whom we have the Diſpoſitions of Piety, in ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Exhibitions of it. An Effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrible to the beſt Cure ever affirm'd to be wrought by <hi>Macrina,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Baſil,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory Nyſſen</hi> hath ſo <hi>Panegyrized</hi> unto! And if it ſhould be ſo; a <hi>Deſire</hi> of hers, more than Once or Twice occurring in her <hi>Diary,</hi> will be happily anſwered. <hi>There,</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Hopes of her own <hi>Converſion;</hi> ſhe adds, <hi>Enable me to do what I ought,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001508_0048_0FB381360FF21B88"/>
that others may be Converted alſo!</hi> Having mention'd her Hopes of having her own Soul <hi>Wun</hi> to and by her Saviour, She adds; <hi>Enable me to do what I ought, that Others may be Wun to Serve Chriſt!</hi> Ah, Dear Child; It is now doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what thy Humble Soul could have Imagined! There is one thing more, not improper to be mentioned, She had an heart ſet to <hi>do Good</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the utmoſt of her Capacity: and more particularly, She was of a <hi>Liberal diſpoſition;</hi> She <hi>Deviſed Liberal Things.</hi> When ſhe ſent (as now and then ſhe did) her Little <hi>Ventures to Sea,</hi> at the return ſhe would be ſure to lay aſide the <hi>Tenth</hi> of her gain for <hi>Pious Uſes.</hi> After ſhe was in a <hi>Married Eſtate</hi> ſhe was according to her ability very Liberally Charitable to the Poor; <hi>Conſidered the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. IT is Evident from her Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, that ſhe received many and Wondrous <hi>Anſwers of Prayer.</hi> There is no need of their being ſo Publickly Expoſed, as they muſt be, if they make
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001508_0049_0FB381378FF78E10"/>
any part of this Relation. Only, Let <hi>Young Perſons</hi> be Encouraged from her Example and Experience. <hi>Children,</hi> You will doubtleſs find what ſhe did; <hi>The Lord is Good unto them that Wait for Him, unto the Soul that Seeks Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, One Important Article, ſhall not be left unmentioned. I find it an Article of <hi>Prayer,</hi> frequently Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated with her; <hi>That I may Dy Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly, Willingly, and Joyfully.</hi> And elſe-where, <hi>That I may thro' Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Victory over Death, and over my Fears of Death.</hi> Yea, Sometimes it ſoars to this. <hi>The Lord grant, that I may have ſuch Fore-ſights and Fore-taſts of the Joyes of Heaven, as may cauſe me to long to be there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Reader, Expect a very Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing Iſſue!</p>
            <p>Her <hi>Travail</hi> drew nigh; and ſhe had been ſo Indiſpoſed, that her Friends were doubtful of the Conſequences. The laſt Words, that ever ſhe Wrote were theſe.</p>
            <p>Dec. 16. 1710. <hi>I am Every Day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting my Travail. The Lord keep me
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001508_0050_0FB381390FB23BF8"/>
from Sin; And be with me, when my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail comes, and Deliver me for the Sake of Chriſt, who was born of a Woman. Grant, that I may put my Truſt in Chriſt, and not Fear. Let my Fears be Prevented, for the Sake of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prayer-hearing Lord, was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly Gracious to her. The Day following, ſhe was Delivered; and there has rarely been known a more <hi>Eaſy Travail,</hi> of a <hi>Firſt-born Infant.</hi> The Lord alſo anſwered her Prayers in giving her the comprehenſive Mercy of a <hi>Perfect Child;</hi> which when Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized had her <hi>Mothers Name</hi> given to her, but dyed the Week after her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and now Sleeps in the ſame Tomb with her.</p>
            <p>After her Comfortable Travail, all that Week, there was great Hope of her being Shortly &amp; Safely Recovered. But on the next Lords-Day, a Sudden <hi>Change</hi> appeared on her.</p>
            <p>And a <hi>Change</hi> indeed!</p>
            <p>She had been of a Timerous and Melancholy Conſtitution; which might ſomewhat contribute, unto that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:001508_0051_0FB3813A92D94970"/>
               <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> which had all her <hi>Life-time</hi> very much kept her in <hi>Bondage.</hi> But now, to our Aſtoniſhment, ſhe told thoſe who attended her; <hi>She was ſure, the Time for her Death was now come; And ſhe was now above that Fear of it, that ſhe had heretofore been Subject to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the Portion of all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to Dy with Triumphant <hi>Joyes.</hi> Very Eminent Servants of God, have, with Holy <hi>Bains,</hi> declared on their Death-beds, that tho' they have Enjoy'd a <hi>Calm</hi> of Soul, yet they had no uncommon <hi>Joyes.</hi> Yea, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they have rather Suffered ſome Dejection, ſome Deſpondency of Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pious <hi>Throgmorton</hi> when Dying, asked the famous <hi>Dod,</hi> What <hi>ſhall be thought of a Dying man, who has not the Light of the Countenance of God ſhining on him?</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> replied, What <hi>ſhall be thought of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who when He was a Dying Said,</hi> My God, My God, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> This Thought revived him. On the other ſide, It is the Portion of Some, to go away Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing unto the Heavenly World.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001508_0052_0FB3813C1087EF00"/>
So did our Great <hi>Ames,</hi> unto the Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a Popiſh Phyſician; who asked, <hi>Whether Proteſtants did uſe to Dy after that manner!</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Holland,</hi> thus Dr. <hi>Winter,</hi> had ſuch <hi>Views</hi> and <hi>Joyes</hi> of Heaven in their Dying Hours, That they Scarce knew, whether they were <hi>in the Body, or out of the Body.</hi> Yea, Some Handmaids of the Lord have had ſuch Experiences; The <hi>Fearful Sex</hi> have Triumphed over the <hi>King of Fears.</hi> Dying Mrs. <hi>Stubbs</hi> ſaid unto thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, <hi>O that you did but ſee what I ſee! I ſee Millions of Angels; whom God has appointed to carry my Soul to Heaven.</hi> Dying Mrs. <hi>Brettergh</hi> ſaid, <hi>O the Joyes! the Joyes! the Joyes that I feel! They are Wonderful, they are Wonderful, they are Wonderful!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo our Dying JERUSHA!— When ſhe certainly knew, that ſhe was to Dy, ſhe ſaid unto thoſe about her; <hi>Here is a Strange Thing! when I was in Health, Death was a Terror to me. But now I know, I ſhall Dy. I am not at all afraid of it.</hi> She ſaid, <hi>This is a Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work of God! I know, that I am going
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001508_0053_0FB3813D8FAB69E0"/>
to Chriſt: That I ſhall ſhortly be in the Heavenly Jeruſalem, with an Innumerable Company of Angels, and among the Spirits of Juſt Men made Perfect.</hi> Said ſhe; <hi>I ſee things that are Unutterable!</hi> Then ſhe Sang for Joy. And yet in her whole Diſcourſe had nothing that Look'd at all Delirious. Her Father, at her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire coming to her, found her in an Ecſtaſy of Joy; Saying, <hi>O the Glory of Heaven! O the Glory of Heaven! O the Glory of Heaven! I ſee a Glory, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Expreſs'd; Perſons and Things, which I want a Language to declare what they are!</hi> She deſired a Meſſage to be carried from her, unto her Siſter at <hi>Roxbury;</hi> That <hi>ſhe ſhould be ſure, not to be afraid of Dying.</hi> Her Father ſaid unto her; <hi>Why? Are not you afraid of Death?</hi> She replied with great Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs; <hi>Not in the Leaſt! Not in the Leaſt! Not in the Leaſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can readily Suppoſe, that the Force of <hi>Imagination</hi> will ſometimes carry People into Strange Tranſports. And I can heartily Subſcribe to the Words of our <hi>Jeruſha's</hi> famous Uncle, Mr.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001508_0054_0FB3813F105361E0"/>
               <hi>Samuel Mather,</hi> late Paſtor of a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and the firſt Preacher in the North Congregation in <hi>Boſton,</hi> (in his Book of, <hi>The Types.</hi> p. 42.) <hi>I had rather have a little Solid Comfort, in that Good old plain Scripture way of Faith and Repentance, and Labouring with my own Heart to apply the Promiſes; And I value this more than if an Angel ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me out of Heaven, to tell me, that I am a Child of God. I am ſure, that if I walk cloſely with God, if I exerciſe my ſelf unto Godlineſs, and unto Communion with Him, in Faith and Prayer, and in Seeking of Him, and Humbling my ſelf before Him daily, I am ſure, that in this way I cannot miſcarry.</hi> Yet the ſame Judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon adds, <hi>I would not adviſe Believers, utterly to reject all Comforts, where there is poſſibly ſomething of Enthuſiaſm inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, if there be a Suitableneſs to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Promiſes brought to their Hand in ſuch a way, and there be a Reliſh of the Goſpel, and the Promiſes and Bleſſings of it.</hi> And ſometimes theſe <hi>Raptures</hi> are ſo circumſtanced as to carry upon them the plain <hi>Signatures</hi> of an <hi>Angelical
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001508_0055_0FB3814092157888"/>
Operation.</hi> Eſpecially when they are in Perſons never known to be on the leaſt ſubject to <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> or to any thing of a Rapturous Nature, but much the contrary, as it was with our <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Raptures did not continue many Hours. Her Flights were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated. The <hi>Solid Comfort</hi> her Uncle Speaks of, contented her; yet ſhe never had any <hi>Dread of Death</hi> on her Spirit after this Day. Some Days afterwards her Father asked her, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe were ſtill <hi>Willing to Dy?</hi> Her Anſwer was; <hi>Tis Natural to deſire Life; but I am willing to be at Gods Diſpoſal, Whether it be for Life, or Death.</hi> As ſhe drew near her End, She Signified, both unto her Father, and unto her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That ſhe <hi>Hoped ſhe was now going to Heaven.</hi> On Dec. 30. in the Night, after ſhe had been for ſome time Speechleſs, her Speech unexpectedly Returned ſo far, that ſhe deſired, Her Father might Pray with her, <hi>That ſhe might be quickly in the Kingdom of God.</hi> He did ſo; and bleſs'd God for giving
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001508_0056_0FB38142DC582E08"/>
him ſuch a Daughter, and gave her back unto the Lord. She continued above the Fear of Death; and One of her Laſt audible words was, <hi>I am in Diſtreſs to be gone!</hi> So ſhe <hi>fell Aſleep</hi> in JESUS.</p>
            <p>It is no Unuſual Thing, for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ones, who have been much <hi>Afraid of Death,</hi> in the time of their Health, to be Strangely carried above it, as their <hi>Death</hi> approaches. Our <hi>Jeruſha</hi> had an Excellent Grand-mother, (her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Mother,) who was One Remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Inſtance of this Obſervation. She was a Gentlewoman of rare Piety; and One who ſpent much Time in Reading, and in Meditation and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and Communion with God. Nevertheleſs, She was for many years much afraid of Dying; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly fearful, that the <hi>Pangs of Death</hi> would prove terrible, and very grievous and painful. It pleaſed God, that the Event proved much otherwiſe than ſhe feared She dyed Eaſily; and fill'd with Divine and Holy Joy. She
