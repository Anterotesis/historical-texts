            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That your Honours Reſpondant, according to the purport of the ſaid Writ, did ſummons the Free-holders of the County of <hi>Orange,</hi> which he conceived by the Writ to him directed, to be within his Baylwick; but the Mayor, and other of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> together with ſeveral other of the Citizens of the ſaid City, alledging it to be an Infringement upon the Right of the ſaid City, to admit any Perſons of a Forreign County to be Chuſers or Electors of the four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, which by the firſt Conſtitution of Aſſemblies in this Province were allotted and appropriated to <hi>New-York</hi>; and that they conceived, That the Writ could not change the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Government, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Act of Aſſembly. Therefore he, with the Advice &amp; Conſent of the majority of the Electors, did not admit of the Free-holders of <hi>Orange County</hi> to vote, but their Names to be put in a Liſt by themſelves, that what may be offered againſt the Right of the City, might be better conſidered afterwards, if there ſhould be any need of diſputing the ſame.</p>
            <p>Your Honours Reſpondant, for the juſt obſerving of his Duty, by the aforeſaid Writ required, he did in open Field, after the Publication of his Writ, appoint twelve of the Electors to be Witneſſes of the faithful Execution of his Writ, if an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The ſaid Reſpondant on the ſaid twelfth Day of <hi>May,</hi> according to the Requeſt of the Electors, that were then in the Field, upon the Nomination of ſeveral Candidates that were propoſed to repreſent the ſaid Electors in Aſſembly, did agree to the Poll that was demanded, but the Diſorder of the People was ſo great, and the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency in the Field for the taking the ſaid Poll, did adjourn the ſame to the Town Hall of the ſaid City, as he humbly conceives by the aforeſaid Statutes, he hath Power

            <p>And as for the Witneſſes that were appointed for the Scrutiny the Poll, and the returning of the Perſons elected, they were the moſt Reputable I could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as for the Reproachful Allegation of the Petitioners, <hi>That they had the majority of Votes,</hi> the Return under the Hands and Seals of the Electors, will evidence it to be groſly falſe; for in the Examination or ſcrutiny of the Poll, the Rules obſerved and agreed by the Witneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were ſuch, That no Perſon ſhould be admitted to elect on either ſide, but ſuch as had a Freedom Free-hold in the City or County, or enrolled Free-men, and were of Age, Natural born Subjects, Denizens or Naturalized, and that all thoſe that were A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ens, under Age, or had not their Freedoms, or were not enrolled, nor had any Free-hold, ſhould not have the liberty of Choice. Whereupon the Witneſſes, upon the ſcrutiny, did refuſe forty eight Perſons that were in the Poll, in right of thoſe that I returned, and excluded them from their Vote; and upon the ſcrutiny of the Candidates of the Petitioners, there were in like manner eighty eight Perſons refuſed, who according to the agreement aforeſaid, were not qualified to give their Votes; and time was allowed for the Perſons excepted to juſtifie their Right of Voting, if any they had, which not being done, they were excluded; by which means, at the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſing of the ſcrutiny, there did appear to be Fifty Eight Electors more for thoſe that I have returned, than there were in favour of the other Candidates, or the Contumelious Petitioners. And there being but twenty one of the Free-holders of <hi>Orange</hi> County, who did Vote, if they had been allowed by the City, yet ſtill there ſhould be Thirty Seven more Votes for thoſe whom I did Return by my inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſealed and lawfully executed by ſeven of the principal Free-holders of the ſaid City. Which Return I know to be juſt and true, and thereupon, according to my Oath and Duty I did it, and am ready, upon the Oathes of the Witneſſes to make appear. And therefore humbly pray to be from this <hi>Calumnious</hi> and <hi>Vexatious Complaint</hi> diſmiſt.</p>

               </gap>neral Aſſembly, were fairly and duely elected, and accordingly the Witneſſes appointed to ſee that the Election was fair, ſigned the Indentures.</p>
            <p>And whereas the ſaid Complainants have declared, <hi>That ſeveral Perſons that voted for the ſaid Repreſentatives returned, were not Free-holders of the ſaid County</hi>; which is a Columnious Aſſertion, as will appear by the Names of the Free-holders that made the ſaid Election. That any Artifices were uſed to diſturb and hinder the Freedom of the Choice, is wholly erronious And the time appointed for the ſaid Election was at ten of the Clock in the Fore-noon of the ſaid 5<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> at which hour the Free-holders of the ſaid County met upon the Green (the place appointed) and elected the ſaid Perſons returned; and that there might be no diſpute for want of time, it was about 4 or 5 a Clock in the after-noon before the Indentures of the ſaid Return were ſigned.
