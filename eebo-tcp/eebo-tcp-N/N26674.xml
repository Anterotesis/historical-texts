            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ORATION.</head>
            <p>JUST twenty three years have rolled on, since the patiotic HANCOCK pressed the sacred seal of our Independence: Nor trembled his hand, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiled his soul at the bold deed, "big with fate."</p>
            <p>THE affairs of our revolution, abound with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, and the beautiful: but every part of this amplefield has been explored—every important plant gathered, and every flower cropt: To dwell, therefore, on that which has been so often and minutely detailed, would be but a dry repetition; and is a sufficient reason for my not following the common track and converting the history thereof into an ORATION: I shall but sketch the out-lines, by observing—that if the first glow of our patriotism—the unanimity, firmness and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance which succeeded—the deeds of valour per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035483_0005_1004DBECE6AE0DC8"/>
in the field, without discipline, &amp; almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms—the wisdom of our councils—the renowned INSTRUMENT which gives immortality to the DAY WE NOW CELEBRATE—the treaty of PEACE—the orderly return of the army to their several homes &amp; domestic employments—the Government,<note n="*" place="bottom">Federal.</note> plenty and happiness which followed—all these great acts and events, I say, if they had happened but a few centuries ago, would have been ascribed to inspiration and miracle. Indeed, the ignorant and the learned, the believer, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, unite in this, that fortune or providence were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly propitious. Eternal praise and gratitude to the GOD of HEAVEN, who ordained, that we were born and do exist at a time when HE thus pours a profusion of His blessings on <hi>the land we live in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the treat of human prosperity and happiness is never served up without mixture. Our most eligible condition could not last forever. It is not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and constitution of things. Man was not made for complete felicity here below—he participates the changes of all things with which he is conversant; continually revolving on the <hi>axis</hi> of FATE; whose ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations bring him alternately Health and Sickness, Prosperity &amp; Adversity, Respectability and Contempt; to-day he is riding triumphantly on the clouds of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, to-morrow the buoyant <hi>gas</hi> is exhausted, and he sinks to disgrace and infamy. Thus revolve EM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIRES
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035483_0006_1004DBEEAAA2D350"/>
—thus revolve WORLDS—nothing is permanent, nothing certain; we know that there are some natural bodies, and some moral or political ones, which have constitutions favorable to longevity: There are also means to be used with success for their preservation; as temperance and exercise for the human body; knowledge &amp; wisdom for the body politic—but soon or late they both must have an end. Again, as in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, so in Government, there are many unskilful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, quacks and mountebanks, who sometimes lull their patients with opiates, at other times fire them with stimulents, which produce lethargy or inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and premature death; but if every earthly thing contains the inherent principles of its own dissolution, what occasion is there for wars and fightings to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the work?</p>
            <p>WAR, in general, is not only one of the most extraordinary and wicked, but is one of the most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous things in the world; and it affords abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant incitement both to the laughing and crying phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher. Who could have commanded his risibles, when an infatuated <hi>Bohemian</hi> General, who, that he might animate his party, when dead, ordered that his skin should be dressed and made into a <hi>drum!</hi> A furious war between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans,</hi> and which ended in the extirpation of the latter, was on account of an individual woman. An important change in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government was once produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because the wife of a Plebeian was not treated
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035483_0007_1004DBF4CCD71FE8"/>
with so much respect (perhaps in a company of gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips) as her sister, the wife of a public officer; what a glorious cause for revolution! Nine tenths of the bloody contests between <hi>citizens</hi> and <hi>nations,</hi> have as frivolous a beginning. A sovereign affronted in the person of a contemptible minion, his horse, his mistress, or her favourite lap-dog, kindles the flame, and the whole realm smokes like a fiery furnace: The military reden and quake with very rage; the peasantry rave in paroxisms of madness; they arm with clubs and stones to beat out the brains of their neighbours, or that of the peasantry of another country, who know no more of the quarrel than the inhabitants of the moon! If any should be dilatory, the despot drives them to their duty and loyalty; for he claims an exclusive property in his subjects, as well as in the earth they tread, and the air they breathe; he thinks the man sunk in turpitude, who will not come forward with his person and purse, (tho' he should lose his life, and starve his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) when his sovereign has a passion to gratify; the value of ten thousand groveling lives is nothing in his estimation, but as they minister to his pleasures. How long shall mankind be made the tool of mean revenge, and at the same time despised by him who makes use of them? O shame! O scandal to the human character!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:035483_0008_1004DBF7643C36F0"/>
IF mankind had always been at peace, the earth is large enough to have supported them all, 'till Death in his own natural way should have taken them off one by one. If there be any who doubt the truth of this position, let them consider the sumptuary economy of the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> Their whole nation would feed on less than would satisfy one <hi>epicure;</hi> yet their frugal fare afforded sufficient nutriment to produce the greatest strength and vigour of body and mind. A <hi>Roman,</hi> on less than four acres of land, supported himself, and reared a family of heroes; let any one acquainted with these facts, cast his eyes on the map of the world; see the thousands of uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated acres in <hi>Europe;</hi> the tens of thousands in <hi>New Holland,</hi> and other islands; the millions in <hi>Asia;</hi> the millions in <hi>Africa;</hi> the thousands of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in <hi>America!</hi>—Many of these lands invite man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to come and live on their spontaneous produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; almost all of them would yield abundantly by cultivation. Surely we are not stinted with a scanty pittance. Man need not clear himself a <hi>place</hi> with the <hi>sword</hi> and the <hi>bayonet;</hi>—the axe and the hoe are sufficient.—War, therefore, does not arise from neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, but from the turbulence of man.—Moroover, the bulk of mankind derive no advantage from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest after they have atchieved it. What have the <hi>French</hi> soldiery gained by their conquests in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elsewhere? Not an acre, or a dollar, falls to their lot: Duped by a few over-bearing avaricious cowards, who, secure themselves, do gasconade, cry havoc, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035483_0009_1004DBFA2C15B888"/>
urge the <hi>dogs of war</hi>—then let them lose on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, that they may share the spoils of the dead, or have their spacious domains enriched with blood.</p>
            <p>THERE is no war justifiable, but an unavoidable defensive war. Such an one is founded in nature; and such an one, my fellow <hi>citizen-soldiers,</hi> we are likely soon to have on hand. <hi>"We contend not for conquest or glory"</hi>—we want <hi>not</hi> the lands of <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>—we want none of their goods or money, except on the fair principles of commerce, and where the advantages would be mutual. But this <hi>"worm-eaten"</hi> method of doing business is too ceremonious; they have therefore adopted the more expeditious mode of <hi>requisition.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This new system of commerce may be explained in few words:—BCONAPAPTE offers to release the <hi>Maltese</hi> from their "ancient tyrants"—they close with his generous proposal, and "submit to the <hi>Yoke,</hi>" (these were his own words)—he plunders the public treasury, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to emancipate the oppressed <hi>Egyptians,</hi> obliges the merchant, of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to give specie for his bullion. Soon after writes from <hi>Cairo</hi> to Gen. KLEBER, who was at <hi>Alexandria.</hi> 
                     <q>There is here an excellent mint—we shall again have occasion for all the Ingo's. Call the merchants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and re-demand the metal. I shall not fail to pay them in produce at a future day.</q>

on a spacious plain of principle; the prospect is charming; the trees large and fair; here grew the benevolent CAPET, (tho' entwined with the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous ivy of MARIA ANTONIETTA)—here grew NECKER, FAYETTE, and their associates; proceed but a little further, and we are entangled in the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and underwood of envy and conspiracy.

there the envenomed spider weaves her net for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent victims—there the wily serpent sings to the harmless bird, and charms it to destruction—there the wolf and fell Hyena rush openly to drink the blood of the lamb—there the tiger and catamount conceal themselves among the fern and brakes, to spring upon the prey—and there the ruthless croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile "weeps and then devours." A most treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sanguinary and carniverous scene! When lo!

            <p>BUT let us descend to plain language, and contrast the beginning with their succeeding conduct:—This revolution was planned and prosecuted at first, (ostensibly at least) on the principles of humanity and the rights of man: Their "Constitution renounce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all wars undertaken with a view of conquest."

            <p>WE hear much of the liberty and equality of this <hi>regenerated nation.</hi> Pray what is the emblem of this renowned liberty?—I will tell you—it is a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of a cubit's length, called a dagger, decor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with the best blood of her own citizens—with that of <hi>Lombardy</hi>—with that of half <hi>Europe;</hi>—The Goddess of Gallic liberty wields in her own right hand this murderous steel! She is a goblin of infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal origin, and takes possession of the heart, not thro' the proper medium of the <hi>head,</hi> but thro' the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the breast—she outstrips the savage cannibal in cruelty—the dying shrieks of infants snatched from the mother's breast, is music to her accursed ears—her reign is equivalent to severing the heart-strings with red-hot pincers!—Is this the Government, the liberty to be wished for by you? Yet you must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it, or support your own: Choose you, therefore, which you will have—there is no halting here between two opinions—defend your rights or surrender them.

            <p>WHAT possible advantage can a man propose to himself by upsetting his own government and laws: If they are as free and perfect as the nature of such institutions will admit; more liberty would place us in a state of licentiousness: Indeed, we border on it now. Hear the sentiments of a celebrated author, (MILLOT): "If the abuse of authority is dangerous, rebellion against that authority is more so. Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious liberty is worse than the transitory despotism of a monarch. In modern States, the laws and opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the public are a powerful barrier against the excess of tyranny." If these maxims and doctrines are true as it respects <hi>Europe,</hi> how much more forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do they apply in our country? How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years of sad experience must mankind have, ere they will be convinced, that the abuse of liberty is the very cause why the reins of Government must be drawn tighter and tighter? The predominant vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and crimes of any particular nation may be

known by their <hi>penal code.</hi>—If we had had no seditious Jacobins in this country, there would have been no necessity for the <hi>"Sedition Act."</hi> If we therefore are obliged from time to time to relinquish more of our individual rights to society, we may thank, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther execrate, our licentious democrats for the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.—<hi>These</hi> are the animals who have the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate effrontery to denominate themselves <hi>exclusive patriots,</hi> and who, at the same time, would persuade us to give up our country, and all that is honorable, to <hi>France,</hi> and become their "hewers of wood and drawers of water," without a single effort to retrieve our insulted character.</p>
            <p>BUT I hear some very <hi>honest</hi> people <hi>whine</hi> and say, it is madness to venture on a war, when our coasts are defenceless, our militia undisciplined, and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute in a great measure, of experienced officers.

Who, do they ask?—Where were our Generals before <hi>seventy-five?</hi> They were employed in the arts and professions of peace; some steered the honorable plow; the same arts and professions employ our undeveloped heroes now, but let a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opportunity offer, and <hi>they</hi> will find the same souls which animated our former Generals, shine
