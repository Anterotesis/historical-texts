            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>OUR own happineſs, my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and the happineſs of our poſterity, will in a great meaſure depend upon our conduct in the preſent criſis: let that conduct therefore be ſuch as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the event demands; and let not prejudice, immediate ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or that proneneſs to novelty and change, too often predominent in ſtates as well as individuals, lead us into ſuch meaſures as will bring deſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ourſelves, and induce future ages to execrate the folly and madneſs of their infatuated forefathers.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of theſe colonies, (notwithſtanding thoſe acts of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Parliament which are complained of, as too grievous and oppreſſive to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013772_0003_0F91AC43267EA510"/>
be borne, and againſt which our patriots raiſe ſuch a terrible and tremendous cry) are the freeſt people upon the globe, and if we were ſenſible of the bleſſing, I might add the happieſt alſo. Survey the different nations of the world, compare their ſituation with your own, and you will ſoon become ſenſible of the ineſtimable advantages you enjoy over them. Do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inadvertantly ſacrifice them to the viſionary ſchemes of miſtaken or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men. By prudence, firmneſs and moderation, we ſhall inſure the continuance of theſe bleſſings to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and be enabled to tranſmit them pure, and unadulterated to our child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren: but if we aim at too much, if we ſuffer ourſelves to be led away with vain notions of <hi>grandeur</hi> and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> we may loſe the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> while we graſp at the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> and this our fair ſtructure of liberty and happineſs, which ſeems calculated to endure thro'
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013772_0004_0F91AC4762150578"/>
a long ſucceſſion of ages, will moulder into nothing, and like the <hi>baſeleſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric of a viſion, leave not a wreck be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</hi> Great Britain is the baſis upon which it ſtands. In union with her, we may riſe ſuperior to the reſt of the world, and ſet all the kingdoms of the earth at defiance. But if by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful treatment of her, ſhe ſhould be induced to withdraw her protection, and give us over to our own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nothing but anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt enſue, the flames of civil diſcord would inſtantly blaze forth, and deſolate the land, and amidſt the dreadful and unnatural conflict, ſome internal tyrant, more fortunate than the reſt would eſtabliſh his dominion; or ſome bold invader from abroad ſeize upon us an eaſy and devoted prey, and deprive us of our liberties and boaſted independence for ever.</p>
            <p>Such are the ſcenes that will preſent themſelves to our view, and ſuch the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013772_0005_0F91AC4955611560"/>
calamities we muſt undergo when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined from our mother country; and deprived of that protection which nouriſhed, ſupported, and eſtabliſhed us in this once inhoſpitable wilderneſs, and which hath at length raiſed us to our preſent happy and flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Believe not therefore ſuch men as tell you that Great Britain would enſlave you; Great Britain wiſhes to ſee us free and happy; ſhe is the land of liberty, and would gladly diſpenſe that bleſſing to her children, and to all the world. But her miniſters are men, and as ſuch may err; they may ignorantly or inadvertantly adopt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are injurious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and ſubverſive of its liberties. But the people can ſurely never be juſtified in proceeding to open rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, at leaſt, till all peaceful, legal and conſtitutional means of redreſs have proved ineffectual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013772_0006_0F91AC4AC4FCB008"/>
We complain of grievances, my countrymen; we ſay that our liberties are invaded; but what ſteps have we hitherto taken for our relief? Have we not acted in all reſpects more like fools, to ſay no worſe, than like reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beings, warmed with the pure and ſteady flame of liberty? Have we not purſued ſuch meaſures as muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably increaſe the evil; and if longer adhered to, make the breach between us, and our mother country IRREPA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RABLE? while we have neglected ſuch as common ſenſe and common pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence dictated to us as the moſt eaſy and effectual. Are not our ASSEMBLIES the proper guardians of our rights and liberties? are they not conſtituted our Repreſentatives for that very purpoſe? can there be more effectual mediators between us and Great Britain than they are? I am certain there cannot. TO THEM therefore we ought to have applied, we ſhould then have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013772_0007_0F91AC4CB2728530"/>
legally and conſtitutionally, and might have had the faireſt proſpect of ſucceſs. But alas! ſo ſtrangely have we been infatuated. we have reſumed the power into our own hands, and every man is become a judge and a ruler among us. The whole ſyſtem of government is overturned, and all order and ſubordination loſt. In this unruly and diſorderly manner we are making our attack upon Great Britain; like the giants of old warring againſt heaven, <hi>piling Oſſa upon Pelion, and Pelion upon Oſſa,</hi> fully determined to <hi>force</hi> her to ſubmiſſion. Our conduct is too dreadful to be ſported with; yet ſo ridiculous, that it tempts us to laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 'Tis like the unaccountable freaks of a madman, we cannot forbear ſmiling at them, though our hearts bleed inwardly for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſufferer.</p>
            <p>One meaſure I muſt confeſs has been adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which ſeemed to promiſe ſome ſucceſs, and which at <hi>firſt</hi> view, appeared to be dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpirit of wiſdom, and that was the appointment of delegates to meet in general congreſs. Thoſe gentlemen, it was hoped would fall upon ſome ſcheme to accommodate the diſpute between Great Britain and America, and mark out a line of government, that would ſufficiently aſcertain, and eſtabliſh the right of juriſdiction in the one, and ſecure the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the other. Which <hi>plan,</hi> when well
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013772_0008_0F91AC4D0D977A18"/>
digeſted, the few reaſonable and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men that were among us, imagined they would have had the modeſty to have ſubmitted to the legiſlatures of the different provinces, for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and <hi>ſanction.</hi> This is what they ought to have done; this is what all honeſt and wiſe men would have done. But mark the conduct of theſe diſtinguiſhed perſonages, ſelected from among their fellow ſubjects, for the ſalvation of their country. They met; and while the attention of all Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was fixed upon them, in eager, anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious expectation, a reſolve, unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered into by them, was promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to the public, adopting and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the infamous and rebellious reſolves of the county of Suffolk, in the Maſſachuſetts government.</p>
            <p>I am bound in honour and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to do ſo much juſtice to thoſe gentlemen of the Congreſs who were delegated by this province, as to ſay,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013772_0009_0F91AC4DB5B4B010"/>
that I have been aſſured, and I verily believe it to be the truth, that they did oppoſe the violent meaſures enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into by the General Congreſs, and more particularly the adoption of the Suffolk reſolves, which I know is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrent to their thoughts, and which I am perſuaded (to make uſe of a ſmuggling phraſe) has been artfully run upon them.</p>
            <p>This was effectually throwing off the maſk; and their ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has convinced the world, that from that time forward they acted without diſguiſe. They have addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of <hi>England,</hi> they have addreſſed the people of <hi>Quebec,</hi> they have addreſſed the people of the other Colonies; but for what purpoſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be to excite tumults and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in all parts of the Britiſh Empire, I defy the moſt ſagacious to diſcover. 'Tis true they have addreſſed the King alſo; but I am told, and I can eaſily
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013772_0010_0F91AC4E667CB4F8"/>
believe it, in a dictatorial manner, and in ſure and certain hopes of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded. But amidſt all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, the legiſlature of Great Britain, and the legiſlatures of America have been totally neglected and treated with contempt. This however is not the full meaſure of their <hi>iniquity;</hi> a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>importation, and, after a lapſe, of ſome months, a non-exportation, and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſumption agreement, muſt take place, in conſequence of their reſolves; and to be enforced by their <hi>High Mightineſſes</hi> the MOB, to the utter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of all <hi>Law,</hi> and the total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all LIBERTY.</p>
            <p>The fatal and dreadful effects of this non-importation ſcheme, &amp;c. upon all ranks of people; but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon the inſulted and unhappy <hi>Farmers</hi> (who it ſeems muſt bear the heat and burden of the day) have been ſufficiently delineated by an abler hand. I ſhall therefore ſay nothing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013772_0011_0F91AC4F413E8310"/>
further upon that ſubject, although, they cannot be too often cautioned, and admoniſhed of the danger, and deſtruction that is coming faſt upon them.</p>
            <p>One thing however I will venture to do, and that, becauſe I conceive it to be my duty, as a good ſubject. I will give my free and candid opinion upon what ought to be done in this alarming juncture; upon what I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the only meaſure that can prove effectual, or that can ſave us from political perdition: it is what ought to have been done at firſt, and what, thank <hi>God,</hi> 'tis not yet too late to do.</p>
            <p>We muſt leave the government of this province to the conſtitutional ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers thereof; we muſt ſubmit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our affairs to our <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> our hopes (under heaven) muſt reſt in them. And notwithſtanding the ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged and unjuſt aſperſions, thrown
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013772_0012_0F91AC5133FFF360"/>
upon that <hi>honourable body,</hi> by weak and wicked men, I am convinced they will have virtue and ſpirit enough to vindicate the cauſe of their country, and to reſcue from the hands of <hi>arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance</hi> and <hi>preſumption,</hi> that authority which has been delegated to them for the moſt valuable and important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>Liſten, my countrymen, to the voice of reaſon; be no longer blind to your happineſs. The <hi>Aſſembly</hi> are a body of men compoſed of your own Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, Perſons placed in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and important ſtation, by your own choice, freely and publicly made, and you have the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, that they will faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and invariably conſult your welfare and proſperity, in all their delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They are all of them Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reſident among you: you muſt be perſonally acquainted with their views, their tempers, and their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013772_0013_0F91AC5167F18A48"/>
characters; it is almoſt impoſſible you can be miſtaken: but if at any time you ſhould chance to be ſo, you may correct the error by a better choice at the next election; or if upon any occaſion they ſhould miſtake your true intereſt; or be ſo abandoned (which is next to impoſſible) as willfully to betray it; you have the ſame remedy, and a better cannot be deviſed. You will likewiſe have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in our preſent extremely dangerous condition, when ruin ſeems almoſt inevitable, that theſe your conſtitutional repreſentatives will have due weight with the government at home; their petitions, their remonſtrances you may aſſure yourſelves will be heard, and if they proceed with prudence, and firmneſs, of which I cannot entertain a doubt, your griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, if there are any, they will be redreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and you will again be reſtored to that peace and good government with which till lately you have been ſo ſingularly bleſſed. But if you ſuffer the power to be wreſted from their hands, by men whom you are entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with, and for whoſe honour and honeſty you can poſſibly have no ſecurity. If you ſuffer <hi>Republicans, diſaffected perſons, ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, men of no character,</hi> and <hi>deſperate fortunes,</hi> to aſſume the reins of government, to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over you, and to dictate to you upon all occaſions; what can you expect but ſlavery
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013772_0014_0F91AC5236524000"/>
and deſtruſtion? Where can you fly for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs? How will you remedy the evil?</p>
            <p>Be not deceived, my countrymen, order is in every reſpect more eligible than confuſion. 'Tis Heaven's firſt law, 'tis the <hi>baſis</hi> of <hi>liberty.</hi> Let us therefore reſtore order and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among ourſelves; for, until we do that, it is impoſſible to be FREE.</p>
