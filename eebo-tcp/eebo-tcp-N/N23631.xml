            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>I DOLLY TAYLOR, of Reading, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that my diſſolution draws very nigh, have requeſted the following line to be publiſhed after my deceaſe in my name, as from a dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>I was born in Chelmsford, near Boſton, June 16th, 1755; was brought up from my infancy by a kind brother, who took care of my mother (as my father died one month to a day before I was born, and had been deprived of his ſight from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, ſo that he was ſtone blind.)—My mother and brother gave me a good education; but my mind, however was given to vanity and civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, ſo that I was introduced to the beſt of company among my young companions.</p>
            <p>In early life I enjoyed my health, and a fine flow of animal ſpirits, but lived without God in the world, and thought myſelf happy in the good eſteem of all my friends and acquaintance.—I had no great concern about the welfare of my immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul, until the day I was ſeventeen years of age. Having ſpent the night before in company, I was looking that morning on the bright and rolling flame of an heating oven, when the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thoughts of a burning Hell ſtruck my mind with horror and amazement!—I ſaw I had been dancing over the brink of deſtruction. Having never before put this queſtion home to myſelf — What would become of my poor ſoul? I was now convinced that my reputation among my compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions would never be any ſecurity for me, in the day of God's fiery anger. I ſaw I had offended Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031269_0003_0FEBF062161C08C0"/>God, by giving myſelf up to vanity. My diſtreſs of mind encreaſed under this conviction, until I took to my chamber by myſelf and muſt leave it to thoſe whoſe terrors of conſcience have been very great, to judge of my caſe by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.—The ſame company I had been with but a few hours before, in all the ſprightlineſs of youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful vanity, made application to me, to know when we ſhould have another ſet dance; but I bid them a final adieu, and never joined myſelf in ſuch company ſince; and it is my earneſt deſire, that all my young friends and acquaintance might be as effectually weaned from the love of ſuch ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying company, as I was at that time, and have ever ſince been.</p>
            <p>My diſtreſs of mind, however, continued for ſome conſiderable time—the friendly admonitions of my affectionate mother and kind brother, to whom I had turned a deaf ear, from time to time, were now to me like ſo many thunder bolts from heaven, ſo that I was almoſt afraid to cry to God for mercy, fearing that I had, young as I was, ſinned away the day of God's grace. The firſt gleam of comfort I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was in reading the fortieth Pſalm, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire every reader to turn to, and read for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I then thought I could praiſe God for his glorious excellency, and viſited ſeveral godly miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and chriſtian friends, with a view to diſcover what God had done for my ſoul; and in a little time I began to ſcruple my eaſy ſtate, upon which I concluded myſelf to be in a more dangerous ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation than I was before. Under theſe ſcruples, in the utmoſt anguiſh of mind, I fell ſick of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and my life was deſpaired of. Being aſked one Sabdath day morning, if I did not deſire to have prayers put up for me, while it was tho't I was juſt leaving the world? I anſwered, yes,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031269_0004_0FEBF064C7D0B3B0"/>but was under ſtrong temptations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen I ſuddenly perceived the purity of divine juſtice in caſting me off forever; and found an immediate ſenſible ſubmiſſion to God's will: Upon which I had a clear diſcovery of my bleſſed Saviour plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interceding for me at the right hand of his Father; when there was a new ſong put into my mouth, ſo that I called out to my friends to praiſe God on my behalf, as a monument of rich grace and undeſerved mercy. My bodily maladies were ſoon removed and I enjoyed ſenſible communion with the Father of Spirits. From this time I was eſtabliſhed, and have never been exerciſed with like fears nor ſcruples ſince, although I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times let down my watch, and have reaſon to lament my failings and imperfections, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy member of Chriſt's church on earth, but ſtill I have a ſtrong hope, through the merits of my bleſſed Redeemer, that I ſhall ſoon be out of the reach of ſin and Satan, and ſhall have my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments waſhed in the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Having experienced, ſince that time, a great deal of God's goodneſs, in carrying me through ſcenes of adverſity, the moſt remarkable; I think I may truly ſay, that had not God been pleaſed to bring me up out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, I never ſhould have been enabled (as I have) to endure my temporal afflictions with that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and ſubmiſſion which I aſcribe to the grace of God alone, and not to any virtue or goodneſs in my natural conſtitution and temper; for I was naturally inclined to be thought of in this world, as much as any other perſon; but God has taught me to be contented with my lot and condition, and to ſuffer with my family as I ought to do, through ſcenes of calamity, trials and afflictions
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031269_0005_0FEBF06890A53330"/>of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               </gap> nature; thoſe who are acquainted with the circumſtances of our family, are ſenſible, that by means of an extraordinary infirm conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution on my huſband's part, together with long and repeated fits of ſickneſs on my part, having been bedrid for a great part of my time, for a whole year at once, ſeveral times, and wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do ſcarce any houſhold work for ſeveral years together; conſidering the extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences that have ariſen, the oppreſſions and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have been practiſed upon us with reſpect to our intereſt—and the tongues of wicked men let looſe upon us, at a time when our whole fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily was diſperſed—a great number of emiſſaries en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to prevent chriſtian charity from being beſtowed upon us; certainly thoſe who are truly ſenſible of theſe things, muſt be led to adore the good hand of God upon me, that I have not been caſt down nor diſcouraged, but that I endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe trials with patience and have now reaſon to expect they will all work for my ſpiritual good.</p>
            <p>With humility, therefore, I deſire the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing addreſs, together with the above narrative, might be printed (as ſoon as may be) after my deceaſe, not having been able to riſe out of my chair, nor get out of my bed, for ſeveral months paſt, without aſſiſtance; and having no expectation of ſeeing my relations in this world, I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſirous of calling upon my friends, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who read this narrative.—All you that are young, and in the bloom of life, more eſpecially; and my prayer to God is, that my experience, my ſickneſs, and my ſufferings, may have a proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon your minds</p>
            <p>And now dear reader, whoever you be, of what ever age, in whatever ſituation, whether you be a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031269_0006_0FEBF06BC5691608"/>familiar acquaintance of mine, or not ſo, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreat you to ſee to it, that your peace is made with God. Let not the ſolemn truth if you being unable to change your own hearts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent you from rational and laborious attempts to call upon the Almighty God, for the gift of his holy Spirit to accompany the means of ſalvation until you come to live in actual and daily prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ernity.</p>
            <p>I rejoice to leave many of my relations abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the good things of this life, who have been very kind to me in my adverſity, for which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire God to reward them with ſpiritual bleſſings.— May thoſe who are poor in this world, ſee to it above all things, that they become rich towards God in good works: For the poor may do honor to the chriſtian religion, by cultivating all the graces of divine Spirit, as well as the rich, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir deeds of charity.</p>
            <p>I would further exhort all neceſſitous perſons, in a particular manner, not to neglect every law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful endeavor to ſupport themſelves by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; but, if after all their endeavors, they ſhould ſtill remain neceſſitous, let them not be aſhamed to make known their wants to thoſe who are lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally and charitably diſpoſed — for I have found relief from ſuch chriſtian benevolence in times of extremity, while our family was diſperſed. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that a graceful &amp; a becoming deportment, with a real diſpoſition to hearken to the advice of your beſt friends, is neceſſary in ſuch caſes.</p>
            <p>My unuſual afflictions have been a profitable ſchool to me, and I wiſh the remembrance of them may be ſo to many of my readers; for we muſt all appear before the bar of an all perfect ſovereign, to be judged according to our works: Then, if we have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031269_0007_0FEBF06DD93794E8"/>the ſick, and thoſe that are in priſons; and if we have been careful to entertain ſtrangers for Chriſt's ſake, we ſhall meet with an open and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant admittance into the kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. I once more exhort you that are parents, to cultivate the principles of humanity and piety in the tender minds of your children, towards the poor and the needy—and to put the moſt favorable conſtruction on the means and occaſions of poverty and wretchedneſs among your acquaintance, and eſpecially among your relations; for the heart of man is apt to be miſled in childhood, by the example of wicked parents, who are uncharitable and unkind.</p>
            <p>Being deſirous of dying in peace with all men, I heartily forgive and aſk the forgiveneſs of all that are concerned among my acquaintance; and now I commit myſelf to God, hoping that he will provide for my children, whom I leave with my huſband, and with thoſe who have the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate care of them, by his directions, under the protection of God's grace.</p>
            <p>Such of my children as are able to read this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and remember their Creator in the days their youth; may they receive inſtruction from him who took little children in his arms to bleſs them.</p>
            <p>My brethren and ſiſters of this church will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my laſt and beſt wiſhes, that God would ſanctify repeated inſtances of mortality among us, and eſpecially the death of our late Paſtor —for he had done his work, and finiſhed his courſe among us; and while I myſelf expect ſoon to follow him, may thoſe who ſurvive me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Living Teſtimony of <hi>AMOS TAYLOR,</hi> of Reading, in reſpect to the foregoing Narrative.</head>
            <p>THIS is to teſtify, in the ſolemn fear of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that ſome time in the month of Jan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, 1793, my tender and affectionate wife inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated a ſtrong deſire that I would write a ſmall narrative of her chriſtian experience, together with an addreſs to all her friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; in which I endeavored to anſwer her mind, as fully as if ſhe had been able to write herſelf.</p>
            <p>She did not expect to live, at that time, and was earneſtly importunate with me, that I ſhould do my endeavor to ſee that the ſame was ſent to the preſs, in her name, as ſoon as might be after her death.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God however, to continue her life until the 19th of May, 1794, when ſhe died with the pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rid fever, about one fortnight after ſhe was put to bed of a living child, which is now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and well.— Her deportment, in her laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was as became her profeſſion. ſhe appeared to be wholly reſigned to the will of God, and to have the terrors of death removed.</p>
            <p>I further teſtify, that in her life time, ſhe was always ſo far from murmuring and repining at any adverſe diſpenſation of divine Providence, that ſhe uſually calmed my temper, as an happy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God, to a becoming reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>She oftentimes expreſſed, and of late years
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031269_0009_0FEBF074831FE958"/>more than ever, an earneſt deſire to ſee profeſſors of religion acquaint themſelves more with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of one another's minds in ſpiritual things. She had a great value for the privileges of private conferences, and family meetings, ſo called.</p>
            <p>She wiſhed to ſee a greater freedom among chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in their enquiry into one another's welfare. She frequently intimated the great neceſſity of being on our own watch, leſt we ſhould go aſtray. She was ſenſible of her own imperfections, and ready to forgive private injuries. She was very liberal, in the latter part of her life, towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of other denominations; although in her younger years ſhe had imbibed a certain degree of rigidneſs and uncharitableneſs towards thoſe who were not of her ſentiments.</p>
            <p>She highly valued the privilege of a goſpel min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtry, although deprived, a great part of her time, for ſeveral years together, from attending to the word preached; which was, to her, grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned, although accompanied with a reſignation to the divine will.</p>
            <p>May her example, wherever ſhe followed Chriſt, be imitated by all profeſſors of religion, and may her addreſs, which now ſpeaks, while ſhe is gone to receive her reward, be the mean of quickening all to a becoming deportment, through our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST.</p>
