            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author had no deſign originally of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the following diſcourſe, but a petition having been preſented to the Presbytery, deſiring their opinion, whether Dr. Watts's pſalmody might with ſafety be uſed in the churches: and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery having appointed him to give his ſentiments upon the ſubject; and ſeveral perſons who heard it, having earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it might be printed, urging, that it would be of uſe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſerious enquirers: deſirous to ſerve the beſt intereſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he ſends it abroad into the world.</p>
            <p>He will, probably, be cenſured, by readers who have not been teaſed with this controverſy as a tautological trifler, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this apology, that many of thoſe he had chiefly in view, having imbibed from their youth, a ſet of contracted ſentiments on this head, and for want of better information were ſurprizing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bigoted to their notions, ſuppoſing it criminal to ſing any other ſongs of praiſe to God, but <hi>Rouſe's verſion</hi> of <hi>David's pſalms;</hi> and being full of objections, which thoſe of better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements would judge too trifling to deſerve an anſwer: the author thought fit to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to remove their ſcruples, by <hi>line upon line, line upon line, and precept upon precept, precept upon precept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is ſenſible there are many pious and worthy miniſters and private chriſtians who conſcientiouſly ſcruple to ſing any other than the old verſion; and while this is the caſe they ſhould not be moleſted. Whether they are incapable of throwing off the prejudices of education ſo as to examine the matter fairly; or have not had opportunity enough to examine and compare evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical compoſitions with that they uſe; or imagine, that that alone is of divine appointment, and therefore to be continued in the church through all its viciſſitudes and improvements; or that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009524_0003_0F76EC2802C05C68"/>
it was compoſed by <hi>David</hi> himſelf; therefore to uſe any other would be to oppoſe a human to a divine compoſure; or what ever elſe may determine them: the Author is very far from judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or patronizing the narrow ſentiments of ſuch as would make the ſinging of either a term of communion, or an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to either a mark of grace; nor would he embroil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations or families; but join with either, rather than ſpread the fire of contention where there is a majority zealouſly attached to either: he heartily wiſhes that ſuch wretched bigotry were dead and buried, never to riſe again.</p>
            <p>His deſign is to introduce more of the ſpirit of the goſpel into chriſtian worſhip, and moſt earneſtly recommends it to all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, to exerciſe that tenderneſs, forbearance and charity, that is the ornament of the chriſtian character; and to uſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the gentle arts of reaſon and perſuaſion, till with the moſt cordial union of hearts and voices, we all join in ſongs to the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that waſhed us from our ſins in his blood.</p>
            <p>That the divine bleſſing may render the following diſcourſe very ſerviceable to thy immortal intereſt, is the prayer of,</p>

            <p>But how much more exalted is it under the influence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements of the chriſtian religion? It animates, refines, and exalts the ſoul; and throws off the load that hangs heavy upon it. When we are ſilled with divine thankfulneſs, the moſt pious affections naturally vent themſelves this way, according to the divine direction, <hi>Is any one merry, let him ſing pſalms.</hi> It is alſo one means of inſtruction, we muſt <hi>teach and admoniſh one another, in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs; ſinging with grace in our hearts unto the Lord.</hi> Nothing ſo much enlivens and promotes our devotion as this, the matter of which, is generally taken from the divine excellencies. Our <hi>tongue,</hi> the <hi>glory of our frame,</hi> is never ſo much our glory, as when it is employed in praiſing and adoring the great <hi>parent</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>Pſalmody has a powerful tendency to kindle and keep alive in the ſoul the beſt affections. <q>How exceedingly moved and affected have I been, ſaid St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> at the hymns, and ſongs, and harmonious voices of the church!</q> theſe voices <q>pierced my ears, the truth entered my ſoul, devout affections were raiſed, and tears flowed.</q> It bears indeed the neareſt reſemblance to the more refined and exalted employment of the heavenly inhabitants; who <hi>ſing the ſong of Moſes the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lamb, ſaying, great and marvelous are
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009524_0004_0F768BB60F284B78"/>
thy works, Lord, God, Almighty; juſt and true are thy ways, thou king of Saints!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their harmonious voices break out with celeſtial extacy, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah, ſalvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God! They reſt not day, nor night, crying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Happy for us, could we even bear ſome diſtant reſemblance to their ſtrains! but how far alas! do we fall below them! the prejudices of our education, the langour, and indiſpoſition of our ſouls, and the want of celeſtial fire; miſlead or diſqualify us for the heavenly work: and that part of our religion that is the neareſt a-kin to heaven, ſuffers moſt, in this <hi>grovelling, unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> clime of life.</p>
            <p>This was remarkably verified in the church of Corinth, in its infant, favourite ſtate. The ſpirit from on high was poured out upon them, in his immediate, extraordinary influences, to aſſiſt them in the ſeveral parts of divine worſhip; to enable them the more expeditiouſly and effectually to improve in the religion of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and ſpread it abroad among the nations that then lay in the gloomy ſhades of death. But the richeſt favours of heaven are not exempt from the abuſe of degenerate mankind: the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians perverted theſe heavenly bleſſings from their original deſign; and made them the occaſion of diſorder and confuſion among themſelves.</p>
            <p>Our context contains many excellent inſtructions to regulate theſe abuſes: and in the text we have St. Paul's reſolution rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that of Pſalmody; which he ſet before the Corinthians as a ſacred rule for them to walk by. And, as what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, was written for our learning, on whom the ends of the world are come: it will, doutleſs be allowed a fit pattern for our imitation in the glorious work of ſinging praiſes to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My preſent deſign is, to explain and determine the ſenſe of the text; ſhew how we may beſt comply with the duty recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in it; anſwer the moſt plauſible objections; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to explain and determine the ſenſe of the text. This ſacred paſſage has ſuffered the fate of many others, to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rack and tortured to ſpeak what it never intended. It has been argued from the words, <hi>I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo;</hi>
               <q>That the apoſtle would
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009524_0004_0F768BB60F284B78"/>
ſing nothing but divinely inſpired matter; that there were no ſongs of divine inſpiration but the pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> therefore, the apoſtle would uſe none but them; nor tolerate any other to be ſung in the church of Corinth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is certainly a very wild interpretation, and as foreign from the deſign of St. Paul as any thing that can well be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is hard to invent how the wildeſt fancy, or the moſt deſperate dearth of reaſon, ſhould force a man upon it: as it has not the leaſt ſhadow of connexion either with the text, or with the ſcope of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> reaſoning. It betrays ignorance of the ſcriptures, which abound with examples of ſacred ſongs, both in the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new teſtament,</hi> that are as divinely inſpired as thoſe of <hi>David;</hi> and many of them better ſuited to the goſpel-church; as I ſhall ſhew hereafter: ſo that it aſſerts what is really not true, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are no divinely inſpired ſongs but thoſe of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame method of reaſoning from the text, would oblige us to uſe nothing but divinely inſpired matter in our <hi>prayers,</hi> as well as <hi>praiſes:</hi> or confine us in prayer, to the exact words of inſpiration, and bind us up to forms that would not ſuffer us to pour out our requeſts to God in our own language, or ſenſe of divine things, in the language of the new-teſtament; however agreeable to our own caſe, or to the ſenſe of ſcripture. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle connects both together, and aſſerts the ſame of the one as of the other, and lays down the very ſame rule for our conduct in both. <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the underſtanding alſo: I will ſing with the ſpirit, and I will ſing with the underſtanding alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That you may take up the ſenſe of the apoſtle, in the words before us, you muſt obſerve, that the ſpirit of God impreſſed upon the minds of the primitive chriſtians the knowledge of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign languages unknown to them before; and enabled them to compoſe and ſing <hi>new ſongs of praiſe to the redeemer,</hi> agreeable to antient prophecies.

inſpiration of the holy ſpirit. God was pleaſed to bleſs them in this extraordinary manner, to illuſtrate his divine power; to put the ſeal of a miracle to the ſeveral parts of chriſtian worſhip; to convince the infidel world; and to confirm the church: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to ſpread the glorious goſpel with greater expedition through the world, than it could otherwiſe be done.</p>
            <p>Had the Corinthians ſpread themſelves among the nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and preached and explained the prophecies concerning Chriſt, to ſhew their exact accompliſhment in him: had they aſſiſted the devotion of theſe nations, by compoſing evangelical ſongs to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> upon his incarnation, life, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, aſcention, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the apoſtle had wiſhed them ſucceſs, and the pleaſure of the Lord would have proſpered in their hands. But they were full of themſelves, and eager to ſhew their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary powers, perverted their gifts, and came into their own church, and inſtead of edifying one another, in their own tongue, ſpoke in a language the hearers did not underſtand: neither would they wait for the permiſſion or direction of him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in the aſſembly: but ſeveral began ſpeaking, or ſinging in the ſame minute, and ſome began while others were ſpeaking. In this diſorderly manner they uſed their gifts; one had a <hi>pſalm,</hi> or ſong, as it ſignifies in the Greek, to ſing; one had a <hi>doctrine</hi> to inculcate; had a <hi>tongue</hi> in which he preached or prayed; had a <hi>revelation</hi> of ſome myſtery; had an <hi>interpretation,</hi> which he probably began before <hi>he</hi> had done ſpeaking from whom he was to interpret: and thus five, or ſix, if not more, were ſpeaking at the ſame time; and the aſſembly was thrown into a kind of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous riot.</p>
            <p>St. Paul expoſes their behaviour to ridicule, tells them, that to ſpeak in an unknown tongue in the church, was to ſpeak in the air, to make themſelves <hi>Barbarians</hi> to the people; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

a pſalm of David and ſing it in a chriſtian church to put an end to their diſorder? This was no more than any common clerk could do. The apoſtle labours in his epiſtles to the ſeveral churches, with the warmeſt zeal, to bring them off from the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, carnal, jewiſh diſpenſation, as he calls it; into the more glorious ſpiritual diſpenſation of the goſpel: and can we think he would have them covered again with a jewiſh vail, which he had laboured ſo much to take off? That he who had ſo much love to Chriſt, that had ſo much of his ſpirit, that under all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of goſpel-light, would <hi>ſing the praiſes of God with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> could poſſibly intend to involve the goſpel church again in <hi>jewiſh darkneſs;</hi> and compel them to ſing the dark ſayings of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which not one in an hundred could underſtand? It would be to compel them to break the command of God by <hi>David</hi> himſelf. Pſalm xlvii. 7. <hi>Sing ye praiſes with underſtanding.</hi> It is directly contrary to what he labours ſo much to illuſtrate in the text and context, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ſhould be worſhiped with knowledge, and with the ſpirit; whoſe influences ſhould be cheriſhed and improved for the good of others.</p>
            <p>I will venture to affirm, there is not a church on earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to ſing the pſalms of David all through, even in the <hi>Scotch</hi> verſion, as it is called, but muſt break the command of God by David himſelf, and alſo this of St. Paul, that requires us to <hi>ſing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That we are authorized from the text to compoſe and ſing ſpiritual evangelical ſongs to the redeemer in chriſtian aſſemblies. The Corinthians were furniſhed with gifts and graces to compoſe and ſing ſuch ſongs, ſuitable to the ſtate of the goſpel. God from on high inſpired them for the work, and approved it by the ſanction of a miracle: which he never wrought but when there was real neceſſity; much leſs would he ſet his ſeal to what was wrong. Infinite wiſdom ſaw that ſuch ſongs were neceſſary for the goſpel church; and his grace aſſiſted in compoſing, and ſinging them; and though they made a wrong uſe of this, and the other gifts of the ſpirit, for which the <hi>apoſtle</hi> reproved them; yet the gift itſelf, and the right uſe of it, muſt not be rejected: it cannot be done without ſinning againſt the expreſs command. Col. iii. 16. <hi>That the word of Chriſt, i.e.</hi> the doctrines of the goſpel, or the <hi>new-teſtament,</hi> goſpel diſcoveries and doctrines, <hi>dwell in you richly, in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs;</hi> which under

the influence of the ſpirit ye may be enabled to compoſe, the <hi>new diſcoveries</hi> of goſpel grace required <hi>new ſongs;</hi> and ſince the apoſtle and others made uſe of theſe gifts, and have taught us by their example to do ſo too; we are not only permitted, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to uſe goſpel ſpiritual ſongs.</p>
            <p>The dictates of reaſon, and the ſenſe and experience of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind confirm this. The power of ſinging was implanted in us chiefly for this purpoſe, that our warmeſt affections ſhould break out into natural and divine melody; and that the tongue of the worſhiper might expreſs his own heart. One great end of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to preſent our own ſenſe of divine things in ſongs addreſſed to God, expreſſing our own caſe: though we may lawfully ſing the hiſtory of God's dealings with others: but in general, the matter of our <hi>Pſalmody</hi> ſhould, as far as poſſible, be adapted to the general ſtate of the worſhipers. The reaſon and experience of intelligent worſhipers will tell you, Their devotion is never ſo much raiſed, as when they ſpeak in their own perſons, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their own ſenſe of divine things. When the ſong ſpeaks our own deſires, hopes, faith, love, and zeal; our ſouls take wing, and mount to God in holy melody. When it ſpeaks our repentance, fears, and ſorrows, our vileneſs and ingratitude; we diſſolve into goſpel mourning. In praiſing the <hi>moſt high,</hi> we deſign to ſpeak our own hearts, and our own words to him: our ſongs are chiefly expreſſions of our own experience, or of his glories; we tell him the ſenſe we have of his greatneſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and chiefly in inſtances that have ſome relation to us: we breathe out our ſouls to him, and make addreſſes to him of praiſe and acknowledgments. And therefore ſuch parts of ſcripture as cannot in their proper ſenſe be applied to our congregations, or be made to ſuit theſe ends of <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> ſhould not be uſed, at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt, not chiefly, for the pattern or matter of <hi>goſpel Pſalmody.</hi> It cannot be done <hi>with underſtanding,</hi> agreeable to the genius of the goſpel, or to the frame of our own ſpirit, when moſt ſuitably diſpoſed by the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures abound with goſpel bleſſings, and wonders of redeeming love: the incarnation, life, death, reſurrection, and aſcention of our <hi>bleſſed Lord Jeſus.</hi> Many rich materials are ſcattered through the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new</hi> teſtament, moſt intereſting, and fit materials for our praiſe to God. And ſince theſe moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant diſcoveries are ſcattered through the bible; which are the fitteſt matter for goſpel ſongs; and are divinely inſpired as well

as the <hi>pſalms of David:</hi> there can be no reaſon why they may not warrantably be made uſe of for this purpoſe; in eaſy flowing verſe, ſuited to the goſpel ſtate. I grant</p>
            <p>Many of the pſalms of <hi>David</hi> have ſcarce any thing in them peculiar to <hi>himſelf,</hi> or to the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general: theſe being ſuitable to the caſe of believers in every age, contain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per materials for praiſe in all times and places.</p>
            <p>But many of his pſalms are quite foreign to any other perſon but himſelf; and could never be deſigned for the ſtated worſhip of the <hi>Jews;</hi> much leſs for <hi>a chriſtian church.</hi> Others of them are ſo peculiarly fitted to the ſtate of the <hi>jewiſh church,</hi> that they are quite improper for that of the <hi>goſpel;</hi> eſpecially, without great alteration.</p>
            <p>I have as high eſteem of the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> perhaps, as thoſe who will ſing nothing elſe: and I read them as a rich, ſacred treaſure of divine inſtruction, more than any book in the old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament: yet I think it no diſhonor to the <hi>royal Pſalmiſt,</hi> to affirm, that much of the glory of the goſpel was hid from him, and that <hi>he that is leaſt in the kingdom of heaven,</hi> or the <hi>goſpel church,</hi> is greater than he; knows more of the peculiarities of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than he did.</p>
            <p>If the brighteſt genius on earth, or an Angel from heaven, ſhould give us the moſt exact tranſlation of <hi>David's</hi> pſalms; we ſhould have a bright copy of the devotions of the <hi>jewiſh king;</hi> but it would never make the fitteſt <hi>pſalm-book</hi> for chriſtians at this day.

            <p>Many have imbibed a fond opinion that nothing ſhould be ſung in divine worſhip but <hi>Rouſe's</hi> verſion of <hi>David's pſalms:</hi> this they have borrowed from education, cuſtom, or human authority; but if well examined, will appear to have a feeble foundation: and implies a manifeſt inconſiſtency in thoſe who ſcruple to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs God in proſe, in any pre-compoſed forms whatſoever, for this reaſon, <q>that they cannot be fitted to all our preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</q> yet, in verſe confine their addreſſes to God in forms fitted to the peculiar ſtate of the <hi>Jews in general,</hi> or to <hi>David</hi> their <hi>king</hi> in particular: and that in <hi>deep myſterious</hi> expreſſions, and <hi>obſcure hebraiſms,</hi> related in the perſon of a <hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Soldier,</hi> a <hi>King;</hi> ſo peculiar to that ſtate that a <hi>chriſtian church</hi> cannot poſſibly ſing <hi>with underſtanding,</hi> unleſs it conſiſt in ſinging one

            <p>I will be bold to maintain, becauſe ſcripture and reaſon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me in it, that God never intended to confine the <hi>goſpel church,</hi> to ſing the <hi>pſalms of David</hi> only; and that the beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved church on earth, if confined to them all through, cannot <hi>ſing the praiſes of God with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> agreeably to the apoſtolic direction.</p>

There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Zebulon, and the princes of Naphtali.

Let any miniſter that has tied down his congregation to ſing theſe and ſuch like paſſages, go and examine his congregation; and when they have ſung theſe ſongs for twenty, forty, or fifty years; let him be convinced, when he finds ſcarce two peſons in his whole charge, but will give dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent interpretations of them, and one or both of them wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the greateſt part can give no tolerable meaning at all.</p>

            <p>It has been often urged, <q>that we ſhould ſing nothing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worſhip but divinely inſpired matter, and that we have no divinely inſpired materials for praiſe to God but the pſalms of David; therefore they only ſhould be ſung.</q> In anſwer to this plauſible, groundleſs objection, I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be intended in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, then nothing is to be ſung but the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> originals; and we muſt ſearch out the <hi>Hebrew</hi> muſic and language, and teach them to the churches before they can praiſe God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they mean the <hi>Hebrew</hi> pſalter tranſlated literally into engliſh, which in a larger ſenſe may be called, divinely inſpired matter; then our pſalmody muſt be ſuch as we have in proſe in our bibles, which we read; and every ſyllable muſt have a particular muſical note, and be ſet to muſic all through; as in <hi>Anthems;</hi> and we muſt ſing as the choriſters do in cathedral churches: for theſe are the only perſons that ſing in the words of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>ſaph.</hi> This mode of ſinging would probably exceed the capacity of the objectors themſelves: it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be too difficult for our congregations to learn and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: and were it ſtrictly enjoined, would render them incapable to obey the command of God, to ſing his praiſe. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. If they intend that we ſhould ſing <hi>Rouſe's</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Scotch verſion,</hi> the <hi>New-England,</hi> or <hi>Sternhold and Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins;</hi> it is quite foreign to the purpoſe, and is a much greater diſcovery of <hi>weakneſs,</hi> than <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and makes no more for the ſinging of <hi>David's Pſalms;</hi> than for ſinging the ſenſe of any other divine materials from ſacred ſcripture.</p>
            <p>It is agreed that our pſalmody muſt be put into verſe, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſuit the goſpel church; the lines muſt be confined to a certain number of ſyllables; the ſtanzas to a certain number of lines, to fit them for church muſic. The greateſt poets that ever attempted this, have found it impoſſible to form any tolerable engliſh verſe, without frequently omitting original words, and adding to them; and ſometimes altering and changing a whole ſentence into another a-kin to the original; and it muſt undergo
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009524_0009_0F768BBA914C3900"/>
a much greater change, if turned into rhyme. One of the greateſt maſters of this kind, ſays, <q>that thoſe who have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the utmoſt toil to keep cloſe to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> have found it impoſſible; and when they have attained it moſt, have made but very poor muſic for a chriſtian church.</q> He adds, with great reaſon, that the verſions mentioned above, cannot be called divinely inſpired matter. At beſt, they are but the ſenſe of the original, as near as the authors could give it, which is far from a literal tranſlation: in <hi>dull, low</hi> verſe, that have little as ſuch, to recommend them to a <hi>perſon</hi> of <hi>taſte,</hi> unleſs it be that they are the moſt unlike what they ſhould be, or what they pretend to be. It is therefore at beſt, very far from the purpoſe, to imagine the above verſions are divinely inſpired matter; ſince there is no engliſh verſion in rhyme extent nor poſſibly can be, that ſtrictly deſerves that denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>Since there are other Compoſitions of chriſtian pſalmody, as much the ſenſe of ſcripture as any of the above; much more intelligible, fuller of goſpel light; and therefore more ſuitable to the goſpel; and that in eaſy flowing, elegant verſe, fit for the moſt refined taſte, and condeſcending to the meaneſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; there can be no reaſon why we ſhould deny ourſelves the uſe of theſe evangelical ſongs. We ſhould certainly give the preference to the moſt evangelical <hi>ſongs</hi> of praiſe to the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as well as to the moſt evangelical <hi>ſermons,</hi> and <hi>prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, when we preach or pray agreeable to ſcripture, and our materials are taken from that ſacred fountain, ſuch preaching and praying are with juſtice call'd the word of God, or of Chriſt: and plaſms, and hymns, or ſpiritual ſongs, from the ſame ſource, are equally the word of God. In this ſenſe, and in this only, can the matter of our pſalmody be called the word of God. In this ſenſe we are authorized to collect the materials of our pſalmody, as well as <hi>ſermons,</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> from all parts of ſacred ſcripture: improving the darker parts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, by the glorious light of the goſpel, which is as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired as the pſalms of <hi>David.</hi> We may collect mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſongs of praiſe out of many of <hi>David's pſalms,</hi> as that book is on many accounts the moſt excellent part of the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and is all profitable to the church, in one way or other: but as it was compoſed for a <hi>jewiſh pſalm-book</hi> originally, it cannot, as ſuch, be the moſt proper for the <hi>goſpel church.</hi> This brings me,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:009524_0009_0F768BBA914C3900"/>II. To ſhew how we may beſt comply with the duty recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Text, viz. <hi>to ſing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo.</hi> Here I would have it carefully conſidered, without prejudice, that if we would ſing the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in the goſpel church, they muſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be tranſlated in ſuch a manner as we have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>David</hi> would tranſlate them, were he now among us. It is manifeſt, that neither <hi>God himſelf,</hi> nor the <hi>royal pſalmiſt,</hi> ever intended them as the preciſe invariable matter of our ſongs of praiſe, but as a pattern for us to imitate in our compoſures. It is the excellency of <hi>David's pſalms,</hi> That the matter, the ſtile, the ornaments, are exactly ſuited to his deſign: hence, every thing is painted in the moſt lively manner, and deeply affected the heart of the <hi>jewiſh worſhiper.</hi> His language is adapted to the <hi>jewiſh ſtate</hi> and <hi>worſhip.</hi> He mentions his own particular occaſions of joy and ſorrow; the places of his baniſhment, his troubles, ſalvations, victories; the perſons or nations that were enemies to himſelf, or to the church. He leads them to praiſe God upon the harp, with the ſound of a trumpet, with the pſaltery, and harp, with timbrel in the dance, with ſtringed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and organs, and high ſounding cymbals; thus the ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> lead the <hi>jewiſh church</hi> to worſhip and praiſe God. It was peculiar to them to worſhip God with all this variety of muſical inſtruments, with legal pomp and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and nothing could be more fit, than that they ſhould follow <hi>David</hi> in theſe directions. It exactly ſuited their ſtate and circumſtances, to lead them to the court of burnt-offerings, and to bind the ſacrifices with cords to the horns of the altar, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But can any man imagine, that if <hi>David</hi> ſhould ariſe from the dead, or leave his ſeat in glory, to join the ſongs of the goſpel church on earth, to God and the Lamb, he would do it in the language of his own pſalms? if he would ſuffer them to be ſung at all; would he not make conſiderable alterations in them, ſuitable to the ſtile, the ſentiments, the genius of the goſpel church? Would he not introduce the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as <hi>crucified for us,</hi> and ſing his <hi>dying love</hi> upon a <hi>croſs,</hi> Inſtead of <hi>jewiſh ſacrifices?</hi> Would he not mention the <hi>Lamb that was ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> and ſing the glories and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the redeemer over the powers of earth and hell? No doubt, he would ſoar above all the types and darkneſs of his own day, and triumph in the glories of goſpel light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:009524_0010_0F768BBB53BADF70"/>All the ſongs in ſacred ſcripture are a confirmation of this; for they are clearer and brighter, as their ſeveral authors were favoured with increaſing light; as you may ſee if you conſider the ſong of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Exod. xv. the ſongs of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Zacharias, Simeon,</hi> the <hi>Angels,</hi> the dox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologies of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and the ſongs of the chriſtian church, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the revelation. Every beam of light that ſhone upon the church, gave freſh occaſion of joy; they all ſung in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of advancing light that adorned the church, and improved each beam of glory in their ſongs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> and all that ſucceeded him, praiſed God with all the light they had, and improved every beam of glory that gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhone upon the church, from its infancy to its more mature, and perfect ſtate under the goſpel. Holy men of old, longed to ſee the glories of the goſpel, <hi>David,</hi> as well as others; and had he ſeen them, would certainly have introduced them into his ſongs of praiſe to the redeemer, who waſhed him from his ſins in his own blood. This will appear in a clearer light if you conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>examples we have in ſcripture, in tranſlating the pſalms of David,</hi> the diſciples and primitive chriſtians had many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for praiſe; and yet I don't recollect more than two pieces of ſongs which they borrowed from the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David;</hi> and they ſung theſe with additions and improvements ſuitable to the goſpel. The firſt is in Luke xix. 37, 38. and taken from Pſalm cxviii. 26. the words are, <hi>Bleſſed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</hi> The occaſion of the ſong was, our Lord's triumphant entrance into <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> On this extraordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>the whole multitude of the diſciples</hi> began to rejoice and to praiſe God, with a loud voice, for all the mighty works which they had ſeen: and as the words of David were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to expreſs the joyful ſentiments of their hearts; they added thoſe enlargements and improvements that were ſuitable to their own caſe; and ſung, <hi>bleſſed be the king,</hi> the <hi>king Jeſus, that cometh in the name of the Lord:</hi> and after this paraphraſe, they enlarged the ſong, in theſe words, <hi>peace in heaven,</hi> and <hi>glory in the higheſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Watts has a moſt agreeable imitation of the diſciples, in theſe words,

            <p n="2">2. Paſſage is in Acts iv. 23, 24. taken from Pſalm ii. 2, 3. The words are, <hi>Why did the heathen rage, and the people ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a vain thing? the kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</hi> Here you find Peter and John with the reſt of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, praiſing God for goſpel bleſſings. They took part of a <hi>pſalm of David</hi> into the ſong; but alter the words of <hi>David;</hi> they explain, and make additions, in the beginning and end of the ſong; and accommodate the pſalmiſt to the goſpel day: as you may ſee by reading the ſong. The whole company of the diſciples lift up their voice to God, with one accord, in the following words, <note n="*" place="bottom">If it ſhould be objected, "the diſciples did not ſing, but pray", I anſwer, If I ſhould grant it, the argument is equally ſtrong; ſince it is certainly as warrantable to alter, enlarge, and accommodate the pſalms to the goſpel, in praiſes as in prayers; and no reaſon can be ſhewn to the contrary. But as they took a <hi>pſalm,</hi> and raiſed their united voices to God, which beſt agrees to praiſe, it is the moſt eaſy and natural to allow that they ſung praiſes to God on that occaſion.</note> 
               <hi>Lord thou art God, which haſt made heaven and earth, and the ſea, and all that in them is; who by the mouth of thy ſervant David haſt ſaid, why did the heathen rage; and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth ſtood up, and the rulers were gathered together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi> Here you ſee the diſciples enlarge the ſong of <hi>David</hi> at the beginning of theirs, in their own words; and alter and explain the words of <hi>David</hi> ſuitable to their own caſe, in theſe words, The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael, Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and <hi>the holy Child Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe alterations made the ſong ſuitable to the goſpel day in general, and to their preſent circumſtances in particular; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the pious breathings that followed to the end of the ſong. <hi>And now Lord, behold their threatnings, and grant unto thy ſervants, that with all boldneſs they may ſpeak thy word, that ſigns and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Child Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Watts has a beautiful imitation of this evangelical turn, given by the diſciples to <hi>David</hi> in his ſecond Pſalm.</p>
            <p>Thus are we taught how to improve and uſe the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in order <hi>to ſing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>porate the goſpel with them, give them an evangelical turn, and as far as poſſible, give the ſenſe of them in goſpel language and ſentiments. This Doctor Watts has aimed at in his excellent imitation of the <hi>pſalms;</hi> and this has given it ſo much credit in the world, among the beſt judges. It is an undoubted truth, which will ſhine with greater luſtre in the world, that the <hi>goſpel church</hi> is not confined to the <hi>pſalms of David</hi> in their ſongs of praiſe; and that the <hi>ſenſe of ſcripture,</hi> the <hi>old,</hi> but eſpecially, the <hi>new teſtament,</hi> wherever we find the moſt agreeable matter for our ſtate and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, turned into eaſy verſe, is the moſt ſuitable to the goſpel day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we ſhould introduce all the light that can be derived from the goſpel into our <hi>pſalmody,</hi> if we would <hi>ſing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> will, I think, appear manifeſt to every unprejudiced mind that will duly conſider the following things, and give them their proper weight.</p>
            <p>The <hi>pſalms of David</hi> muſt have an evangelical turn, in order to render them fit for the goſpel church; the extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit beſtowed on the primitive chriſtians, to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to compoſe, and ſing, evangelical ſongs; the nature of the new teſtament diſpenſation; our numerous occaſions of praiſe under the goſpel; the great advantage believers have found by goſpel ſongs; and the ſanction of human teſtimony.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what has been already ſaid it muſt, I think, appear, that the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> ſhould be ſtripped of every thing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and accommodated to the goſpel church. The language of <hi>judaiſm,</hi> muſt be changed into that of the goſpel; and the compoſure and form of them muſt be greatly altered. The ſenſe may then be called the word of God, being founded upon it, agreeable to it, or borrowed from it; in the ſame ſenſe that our ſermons and prayers are the word of God. We may, we ought, to take the divine ſenſe and materials from any part of ſcripture that is moſt ſuitable to promote the great ends of pſalmody; eſpecially as there are not any pſalms yet penned that anſwer all our preſent circumſtances, which are ſo very different from the <hi>jewiſh church.</hi> To confine the <hi>goſpel church</hi> to the pſalms of David ſtrictly, is certainly one of the greateſt abſurdities that can be imagined; and ſo injurious to it, that nothing ſhort of the moſt unaccountable prejudices, could influence men of reaſon and religion to ſubmit to it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009524_0011_0F768BBC112177B0"/>2. The extraordinary gifts of the ſpirit beſtowed on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians, to compoſe and ſing evangelical ſongs, from goſpel materials, put this beyond any rational ground of diſpute.</p>
            <p>God never beſtowed a precious gift in vain; he never wrought a miracle but when there was great and manifeſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; and it was undoubtedly ſo in this caſe. It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the <hi>new teſtament</hi> church ſhould be furniſhed with new ſongs to celebrate the praiſes of <hi>God and the Lamb,</hi> for his <hi>new diſcovered glories.</hi> The old teſtament had nothing clear and full enough to celebrate the wonders of goſpel grace. The new converts had not time to acquire and improve the divine art with expedition ſuitable to the neceſſity of the church; and the divine power interpoſed to aſſiſt them to compoſe and ſing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſongs to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> for his grace that lay hid before; and God owned and confirmed this part of divine worſhip, as well as others, with the ſeal of a miracle.</p>
            <p>Seeing theſe ſongs are <hi>the off ſpring of God;</hi> have the ſanction of a miracle to give them credit; and the bible contains a rich variety of excellent materials for ſuch ſacred <hi>anthems</hi> for the uſe of the church; it is plain they are the moſt acceptable to God, as well as to his people who have been bleſt with the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>On this head, that excellent man Doctor Doddridge, has a remark full to my purpoſe; his words are, <q>It would be very abſurd to ſuppoſe that when there was ſuch a gift, in the church, as we are ſure there was. 1 Cor. xiv. 15.16. Col. iii. 16. they ſhould be confined to the words of <hi>David</hi> in all their devotions. It would certainly be as reaſonable for us in thoſe later ages, to explode all kinds of <hi>prayer</hi> in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, but liturgies collected from the <hi>words</hi> of ſcripture, as all ſacred ſongs in divine worſhip but literal tranſlations from the <hi>book of pſalms;</hi> as numberleſs paſſages of the <hi>old</hi> and <hi>new teſtament,</hi> are equally capable of furniſhing us with ſacred <hi>anthems.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſeveral ends and deſigns of chriſtians in ſinging the praiſes of God, throw farther light upon this ſubject. Neither the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> nor any other ſongs in ſcripture, already compoſed, are ſufficient to expreſs all the language of a pious heart in ſongs of divine melody. The moſt marvelous diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of divine wiſdom, and power, of vengeance and mercy; the incarnation, life, death, reſurrection and aſcenſion of Chriſt;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009524_0012_0F768BBD06D9FF70"/>
are the glorious diſcoveries of the goſpel. And as David did not clearly and fully know theſe; ſo he did not, he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in a manner ſublime and rapturous enough, the ſenſe which a warm-hearted, devout believer has of the divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhining in the face of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The paſſion of Chriſt is a favourite ſubject of the ſaints in glory, and ſaints on earth. <hi>Moſes and Elias</hi> talked of it when they paid a viſit to our world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we ſhould make it the matter of our higheſt praiſe. Our Lord inſtituted a ſignificant <hi>memorial</hi> of his death, and when he had done, he ſung a hymn, as Mr. Williſon and many other divines think, relating to it, which is highly probable at leaſt: and is it not robbing God of his glory, to ſpeak now of his <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>dying love,</hi> only in the language of <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> and <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> The doctrine of the Trinity; Chriſt ſmitten by the ſword of juſtice and hung on a croſs for a rebel ſinner; the graves opening; the dead raiſed to life; the ſound of the laſt trumpet; and ſaints ſpringing to life, meeting the Lord in the air, are glorious diſcoveries of the goſpel, or have received additional luſtre from it, which has brought life and immortality to light: and can the <hi>goſpel church</hi> make melody to God ſuitable to theſe themes, with <hi>weak and beggarly elements;</hi> or in the dull language of proſe? No, ſurely; the words of Chriſt ſhould <hi>dwell in us richly, in all wiſdom;</hi> in <hi>pſalms and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> ſuitable to theſe diſcoveries and events. Hence it is</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God has expreſsly commanded us to ſing goſpel ſongs. Col. iii. 16, 17. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly, in all wiſdom; teaching and admoniſhing one another, in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> By <hi>the word of Chriſt,</hi> in this place, we are not to underſtand, the <hi>old teſtament,</hi> though it may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to be the word of Chriſt, but the <hi>new.</hi> It doubtleſs intends, <q>Doctrina evangelica, Chriſti dictata, &amp; quod a Chriſto revelata, ac praedicata eſt, &amp; quod de Chriſto loqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</q>

               </q> And to interpret this paſſage, and Eph. v. 19.20. with a confinement to <hi>David's pſalms,</hi> would be to make the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> guilty of a groſs tautology, not to be found in any of his writings. Now if theſe evangelical doctrines muſt <hi>dwell in us richly,</hi> is it not natural to ſuppoſe, they ſhould be the principal matter of our ſongs of praiſe to God? Can any thing be plainer and fuller to my purpoſe than this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to ſing goſpel ſongs? To deny the church this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, would be to hood-wink, and remand it to <hi>jewiſh dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> to deny it the light of the goſpel in this part of worſhip; to compel it to ſing without the grace of the goſpel in the hearts of its members; to put darkneſs for light. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and holy men of old, ſearched diligently; they longed and earneſtly deſired to ſee the things which we <hi>now ſee,</hi> and did not ſee them. 1 Pet. i. 10. And had dark apprehenſions afar off, through the obſcure medium of types and ſhadows, of things now unvailed, and fully accompliſhed: and are we not here bound by an expreſs command to give thanks for theſe things, in the glorious light and language of the goſpel?</p>
            <p>In Eph. v. 19, 20. we are commanded to praiſe God with the ſame variety, <hi>in pſalms, and hymns, and ſpiritual ſongs, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melody in your heart to the Lord,</hi> i. e. to the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the redeemer and mediator, giving thanks always for all things, unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

Muſt we preach in the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus;</hi> muſt Chriſt be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the life of our <hi>ſermons;</hi> muſt we offer up our prayers <hi>in his name;</hi> yea do all, <hi>whatſoever we do in his name;</hi> and yet be doomed to ſilence, and forbid to make mention of him in our ſongs of praiſe, contrary to his plain, poſitive command, when we owe him the higheſt praiſe? Would it not be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable hardſhip to forbid us to mention that <hi>all-important name</hi> in rapturous praiſes to the <hi>moſt high?</hi> When it was death to call upon the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the primitive chriſtians would riſe before day, to ſing a hymn of praiſe to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God,</hi> which hymn declared him to be God: and muſt we be enſlaved, and doomed at this day of light, of liberty, of <hi>goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel liberty,</hi> to take no more notice of our <hi>redeemer</hi> in holy ſongs, than <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>David</hi> did? Does it not evidence a want of due veneration for the ſacred ſcriptures, or a want of underſtanding in them, to reject ſuch plain, expreſs, poſſitive commands of God? If we would <hi>ſing with the ſpirit,</hi> ſhould we not follow the dictates of the ſpirit?</p>
            <p n="5">5. The new and ſpiritual diſpenſation of the goſpel requires goſpel ſongs, in order to ſing <hi>with the ſpirit, and with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alſo.</hi> You may obſerve, that where we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>new teſtament</hi> to ſing divine ſongs. The word <hi>ſpiritual</hi> is uſed to denote ſomething peculiarly ſuitable to the <hi>goſpel ſtate.</hi> St. Paul uſes it in all his epiſtles, as a diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word between the <hi>goſpel</hi> and the <hi>jewiſh</hi> ſtate. The <hi>Jews</hi> had carnal ordinances and commandments, and their ſtate is called <hi>fleſh.</hi> But the goſpel is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſtate, a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> houſe, endowed with ſpiritual bleſſings. We are required to worſhip God in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, and ſing <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009524_0013_0F768BBD8E10EBF0"/>
ſongs,</hi> in the words of Chriſt, or the language of the <hi>new teſtament. Jeſus</hi> has revealed many glorious things, worthy of praiſe; he has commanded, that his <hi>word dwell in us richly;</hi> that it abide in us, &amp;c. And muſt it be engraven on our hearts; fill our ſermons our prayers, our meditations; and not our ſongs of praiſe? He has promiſed the <hi>holy ſpirit of truth, to lead us into all truth, and ſhew us things to come:</hi> and has the ſpirit of God revealed many glorious peculiarities of the religion of Jeſus; and ſhed the meridian glory of the goſpel on theſe later days; from which all the other parts of divine worſhip recieve infinite improvement; and muſt our <hi>pſalmody</hi> recieve none at all. In what part of the ſacred volume has God fixed the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar mark of his diſpleaſure on this part of worſhip? muſt the peculiar tender mercies of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> lie buried in unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs? muſt we reject all the benefit of goſpel light, in this one only branch of chriſtian worſhip; without reaſon, without a command from God; nay, contrary to both? No, ſince we are bleſt with theſe ſpiritual privileges in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> let us not be covered with a <hi>jewiſh vail,</hi> nor force ourſelves or others, to ſing in IGNORANCE, <hi>the dark ſayings of David upon the harp.</hi> Let us rejoice in the light, and praiſe its heavenly author, in the moſt agreeable ſpiritual ſongs. Let us follow the favourite <hi>St. John,</hi> and ſing <hi>unto him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and prieſts unto God, and his father; to him be glory and dominion, for ever, and ever. Amen.</hi> So ſhall we imbibe the genius, the ſpirit, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and ſtile of the goſpel; cheriſh the influences of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit upon our own hearts; and our devotion ſhall kindle and aſcend to glory.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Chriſtians have numberleſs occaſions to praiſe God in the courſe of life. We experience a rich variety in the providence and grace of God, which merits our grateful aſcriptions of praiſe: and as we ſhould praiſe God for all his mercies in ſongs of poetry as well as in proſe, our <hi>Pſalmody</hi> ſhould be adapted to theſe occaſions. It muſt be owned, there is not a ſet of <hi>pſalms</hi> in the bible to anſwer all theſe occaſions of praiſe; though there are materials from which they may be taken. Can it be thought that God would have us confined to any ſet form of his own compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in <hi>this,</hi> more than in our preaching, or prayers? It is thought by many, a good reaſon, why we ſhould reject the impoſition of a prayer-book, that no number of compoſed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009524_0014_0F768BBF28F0E178"/>
can be found to expreſs every future want or difficulty of a chriſtian, or be exactly ſuitable to every occaſion in life. The reaſon is equally ſtrong in this caſe; as there is no collection of divine ſongs in the <hi>bible,</hi> much leſs in <hi>David's pſalms,</hi> that can anſwer all our occaſions of praiſe, we ſhould therefore reject the impoſition of that imperfect <hi>pſalm-book</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> fitted chiefly for <hi>Jews.</hi> It cannot reaſonably be thought that God ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſongs of <hi>David</hi> for a univerſal <hi>pſalm-book;</hi> as they could not extend to all the caſes of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle or ſocial capacity. Let any unprejudiced mind conſider the 132 <hi>pſalm,</hi> for inſtance, in <hi>Rouſe's verſion,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Watts's imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation,</hi> ſuited to the goſpel church, at the ſettlement of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and let him judge which is beſt ſuited to the temper of a chriſtian congregation on ſuch an occaſion; and he will, I doubt not, eaſily ſee reaſon to give a great preference to the latter. In the one, the people may eaſily expreſs the ſentiments of their hearts, with underſtanding: which, I doubt, was hardly ever done in the other, by any congregation of chriſtians.</p>
            <p>The deſtruction of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt, the victory of <hi>Barak</hi> and <hi>Siſera,</hi> the troubles and ſucceſſes of <hi>David,</hi> with all their particular circumſtances, are celebrated in the ſongs of <hi>Moſes, Deborah</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> All the mournful ſongs that were compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, were not fit to repreſent the condition of the <hi>captive Jews,</hi> by the <hi>rivers</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> till that admirable poem, the 137 Pſalm, was compoſed, to paint the language of their hearts in a <hi>divine ſong.</hi> There was not a <hi>pſalm</hi> in all the <hi>old teſtament</hi> pertinent enough to expreſs the new diſcoveries of goſpel grace, in a holy ſong, that were made to <hi>Mary, Zacharias, Simeon,</hi> the <hi>Angels,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>primitive Chriſtians:</hi> therefore God put new ſongs into their mouths, to anſwer the ſeveral occaſions which they had to praiſe him for his mercy. Their prayers, and ſermons, were new; ſuitable to their new diſcoveries; and ſo were their ſongs of praiſe new. Had they not uſed this liberty, they could not preach, or pray, or <hi>ſing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding alſo:</hi> but their ſpirits, and ſongs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> united in the ſweet melody and joy.</p>
            <p>To preach, and pray in generals, and wander remote from the caſe of thoſe that hear us, is well known to be dull, unaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unprofitable: it does not reach the heart, or conſcience; no; if we would do this, we muſt come cloſe to their caſes, and ſo touch the heart. The ſame muſt be done in Pſalmody, if we
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009524_0014_0F768BBF28F0E178"/>
would have it the moſt uſeful to mankind. And can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined God would put a freſh ſong into the mouths of his people under the <hi>old taſtament</hi> ſuitable to their particular caſe; and in the beginning of the <hi>new teſtament</hi> to ſuit theirs; and yet deny us the advantage of compoſing and ſinging new ſongs from goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſubjects, ſuitable to our occaſions of praiſe, in this more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ſtate of the goſpel? The ſuppoſition would ſink this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of liberty, of the ſpirit, of joy, and glory, below the <hi>bondage of judaiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. The great advantages, of joy, comfort, and edification, which the people of God have found in the uſe of goſpel ſongs ſuited to their caſes, in various parts, and various ages of the chriſtian church, add conſiderable force to what has been ſaid. They that have not taſted, will not perhaps, feel the force of this argument: but if you regard the teſtimony of thouſands, many of them eminent in the <hi>chriſtian church,</hi> the argument will riſe and ſtrengthen apace. I ſhall only add,</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſanction of human teſtimony. This I have in too great abundance for my narrow limits. I ſhall only give a ſpecimen from the early and later Days of the goſpel, from undiſputable authority. <hi>Pliny,</hi> about 71 years after the death of Chriſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the emperor, <q>That the Chriſtians met before day, it was a time of perſecution, to ſing together a hymn to Chriſt as God.</q> 
               <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the beginning of the third century, relates, <q>That after the Chriſtians had eaten and drank the Lord's ſupper by night,</q> which they were forced to do, for fear of their enemies, <q>every one was uſed to ſing unto God publicly, either out of the holy ſcriptures, or according to their own genius and ability.</q> 
               <hi>Origen,</hi> in the middle of the third century, tell us of the chriſtian church, <q>ſinging hymns of praiſe to the father, in or by Chriſt, in good rhyme, tune, metre, and harmony.</q> 
               <hi>Dioniſius</hi> ſays, <q>I heartily love <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos,</hi>
               </q> one of the fathers, <q>for his faith, his ſtudy of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the holy ſcriptures; as well as for various <hi>pſalms</hi> and <hi>hymns</hi> compoſed by him, which are uſed to this day.</q> 
               <hi>Spanheim</hi> relates of the fourth century, <q>That beſides <hi>hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſongs,</hi> and private <hi>pſalms,</hi> of which there was a great number in their ſolemn aſſemblies; the <hi>pſalm-book</hi> of David was brought into the weſtern church, in this age.</q> The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy of <hi>Artemon,</hi> who denied the divinity of Chriſt, was confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only by the ſcriptures, and writings of the precedent
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009524_0015_0F768BBFCED87DC8"/>
fathers, but alſo by the <hi>pſalms,</hi> and <hi>hymns</hi> of the brethren, which were formerly compoſed by them, wherein they ſung praiſe to the <hi>word</hi> of God, declaring Chriſt to be God. Sometimes we find in the primitive fathers, that they made uſe of the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> though very little, but chiefly, other ſongs compoſed out of the ſcripture, adapted to the peculiar ſtate of the <hi>goſpel church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a brief view of the conduct of the earlieſt chriſtian church, in general; who it muſt be allowed, ventured their lives, and their all, to follow the example of Chriſt, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and no doubt, in this, as well as in other branches of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Pſalmody</hi> was undoubtedly, moſtly <hi>pſalms</hi> and <hi>hymns,</hi> which they compoſed themſelves, from goſpel ſubjects, ſuited to the ſtate of the goſpel church. They continued in the uſe of them till <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> a heretical biſhop of <hi>Antioch</hi> roſe up, and aboliſhed theſe <hi>pſalms,</hi> that were wont to be ſung to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and appointed women to ſing his own praiſe, on <hi>Eaſter days</hi> in the church: for which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and condemned by the council of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And it is worth notice, that this was an <hi>oecumenical council,</hi> the only one that was of that ſort for the firſt 300 years after Chriſt, that I can find, conſiſting of <hi>biſhops, preſbyters,</hi> and <hi>deputies,</hi> of as many churches as were pleaſed to come from all parts of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goſpel ſongs</hi> were afterwards uſed in the church in ſucceeding ages, and continued to our day. The churches of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Eaſtland,</hi> without pretending to extraordinary gifts, make uſe of divine hymns compoſed on goſpel ſubjects. The church of England approves of ſuch; as appears by the ſongs they have added to the end of their old <hi>pſalms;</hi> and by the uſe which is made of <hi>Doctor Watts's Pſalmody,</hi> in ſome particular churches, at this day.</p>
            <p>They are uſed in moſt, if not all the diſſenting churches in England; eſpecially thoſe that are the moſt eminent for <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>learning;</hi> and in many of the churches in <hi>America.</hi> It muſt give conſiderable force to this argument, that the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the church of Scotland, are warm advocates for evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical ſongs in chriſtian worſhip; as their own words inform you. They ſay, <q>It <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to the hymns.</note> has been <hi>often</hi> and <hi>earneſtly</hi> deſired, by pious and devout perſons, to have our Pſalmody enlarged, by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009524_0015_0F768BBFCED87DC8"/>
with the <hi>pſalms of David,</hi> ſome other ſpiritual ſongs out of the <hi>new</hi> teſtament, as well as the <hi>old.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>That the church of Scotland had this deſign in view not long after the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it has been at different times under their deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as appears by ſeveral acts and recommendations of <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſemblies.</hi>
               </q> At laſt, in the year 1742, a committee was appointed to prepare theſe ſongs. In 1744, more were added to the number, and the appointment renewed. In 1740, we have publiſhed, by order of the general aſſembly, a third eddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſacred, evangelical ſongs. They inform us, they <q>chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aimed at having the ſenſe of ſcripture expreſſed in eaſy verſe; ſuch as might be fitted to raiſe devotion, might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible to all, and might riſe above contempt from perſons of better taſte.</q> And, <q>That the materials for this pious deſign, are partly collected from the pious and ingenious <hi>Dr. Watts,</hi> and ſome other writers, and by ſome miniſters of their own church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Synod of New-York</hi> have alſo recommended the uſe of Doctor Watts's pſalmody, in a caſe debated before them, where the miniſter and a great majority of the people earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired them.</p>
            <p>I am informed, that the <hi>Synod of Ulſter in Ireland</hi> have alſo introduced them into their churches of late, by a ſynodical act.</p>
            <p>If pious and devout perſons have often and earneſtly deſired ſuch evangelical ſongs to be uſed in the church; if the vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſembly in Scotland have given the ſanction of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, after many years deliberation, of goſpel pſalmody in general, and <hi>of Doctor Watts's</hi> in particular; if the chriſtian church have uſed ſuch in early and later ages; and they have obtained ſuch general approbation: I hope we ſhall not be <hi>flared</hi> at, as acting without precedent; nor charged with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,</hi> by any that regard the credit of their own reading or underſtanding.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to anſwer objections,</p>
            <p n="3">III. 1ſt. It is objected, that the directions and examples of ſcripture confine us to ſing <hi>the inſpired ſongs of David.</hi> Deut. xxxi. 16. and ix. 21. Pſal. lxxxi. 1.—4. 1 Chron. xvi. 17. 2 Chron. xxix. 27—30. 1 Sam. xxiii. 1, 2. Anſ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A little attention to theſe paſſages will convince you they refer to the ceremonious worſhip of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> that paid their worſhip at the new-moon, and other <hi>jewiſh feſtivals,</hi> with timbrels, and trumpets, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009524_0016_0F768BC0C4EFD310"/>2. They no more oblige us to ſing the ſongs of David than that in Hoſ. xiv. 2. confines us to pray in inſpired forms. Both commands run in the ſame manner; and as we are not bound in the one, ſo we are not in the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They do not prohibit the Jews themſelves the uſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate compoſures in their ſynagogues, and why ſhould not chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſing evangelical compoſures to ſuit their caſe; eſpecially, as moſt of the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are fitted for <hi>Jews,</hi> and not for Chriſtians?</p>
            <p n="2">2d <hi>Objection.</hi> No man can pretend to make or ſing better ſongs than the ſpirit of God has left us in the bible; and to neglect theſe, and ſing human compoſures, expoſes to the curſe. Mal. i. 13, 14. Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We cannot pretend to make better prayers or ſermons, than thoſe of <hi>Moſes, Solomon,</hi> the <hi>Prophets, Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and why ſhould we not be confined to theſe forms of <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>preaching,</hi> as well as <hi>ſinging?</hi> If we may compoſe prayers, and ſermons, ſuitable to our own caſe, without falling under the <hi>curſe;</hi> doubtleſs we may compoſe and ſing <hi>pſalms</hi> and <hi>hymns</hi> in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho' we can't pretend to make better prayers, and ſermons, than <hi>Ezra, Daniel,</hi> or <hi>our Lord,</hi> for that day, and the occaſions for which they were prepared: yet as God accommodates his gifts and revelations to ſpecial ſeaſons and occaſions of the church; a divine ſong, ſermon, or prayer, compoſed agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the word of God, that expreſſes our own wants, duties, and mercies, is certainly much fitter for us, than thoſe that do not reach our caſe; and cannot ſo well aſſiſt our graces, nor raiſe our devotion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I grant that nothing can be more proper than inſpired lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, in our prayers, ſermons, and ſongs of praiſe: and God has often teſtified his approbation of it, in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but it has been when theſe phraſes have been clear, and pertinent to our own caſe, and ſenſe of divine things. We are not therefore to dreſs up our prayers, ſermons, or praiſes, in the ſtile of <hi>judaiſm,</hi> when we would expreſs goſpel doctrines, This would be to darken counſel by words without knowledge; to amuſe and confound the ignorant worſhipers.</p>
            <p>We may as well read a ſermon of <hi>Moſes, Iſaiah,</hi> or the royal preacher <hi>Solomon,</hi> to our congregations, inſtead of preaching the goſpel, as ſing many of the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that are peculiar to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009524_0016_0F768BC0C4EFD310"/>
               <hi>David</hi> the <hi>king,</hi> the <hi>ſhepherd,</hi> the <hi>fugitive,</hi> the <hi>jewiſh muſician.</hi> In brief, the ſermons, prayers, or ſongs, recorded in ſcripture, are not given us for forms, to which we muſt be invariably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; but as patterns, by which we are taught to adjuſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of worſhip to our caſe. And as ſermons, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſo adjuſted, are properly called the word of God, ſo are ſuch ſongs of praiſe; and therefore proper materials for <hi>chriſtian Pſalmody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we have as much reaſon to expect the divine bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſuch ſongs,</hi> as in tranſlating the ſcriptures into our tongue; writing tracts of divinity, or reading them when written; or in turning the <hi>pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> into any kind of <hi>rhyme,</hi> and ſinging them afterwards.</p>
            <p>Search and examine the ſcriptures, and you will find, that whenever any ſpecial diſplay of divine grace or providence gave occaſion, the ſaints made uſe of a <hi>new ſong,</hi> ſuitable to the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And if it be ſaid, "They were better fitted, by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts, for ſuch compoſures than we are;" I anſwer, We have greatly the advantage of them, in having the cannon of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcripture compleat, and many excellent helps and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which they had not; and equal reaſon to depend upon the divine bleſſing and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="3">3d <hi>Objection.</hi> To uſe any <hi>Pſalmody</hi> but what God has given us for this purpoſe by immediate inſpiration, is will-worſhip, and the inventions of men. Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To alter the pſalms of David, and confine them to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act number of ſyllables or rhymes, to ſing in our churches, may equally be called will-worſhip, and human inventions: and yet this muſt be done, or the churches cannot obey the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>g his praiſes. We have no more divine warrant to ſing the expreſs words of the <hi>old verſion,</hi> or <hi>Sternhold and Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi> than we have to ſing any other divine ſongs compoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the goſpel. The truth is, this is one among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which God has left to the wiſdom and diſretion of the churches, to uſe thoſe pſalms that are moſt agreeable to their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and moſt for their edification.</p>
            <p n="4">4th <hi>Objection.</hi> How can the compoſers of goſpel pſalmody, omit, alter, or tranſpoſe, the inſpired ſongs, from the order in which the holy ſpirit has placed them, without falling under the curſe denounſed againſt thoſe that add too, or take from the word of God. Rev. xxii. 18.19.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:009524_0017_0F768BC154DFDB58"/>1. By the very ſame authority that goſpel miniſters, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chriſtians, alter and tranſpoſe, or omit any parts of inſpired writings; to render them more pertinent materials for ſermons, or prayers, for themſelves or others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many pious and judicious perſons that have been confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſing the verſions of <hi>Rouſe</hi> or <hi>Sternhold and Hopkins,</hi> have found from experience, that when their ſouls have been quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd and enlarged in ſinging one ſtanza ſuitable to their caſe; the very next verſe has given a ſudden check to the ſweetneſs and harmony of their devotion, by ſomething peculiar to the <hi>Jew,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Fugitive;</hi> or dark, and unintelligible at this day, or remote from their own caſe. They could go no farther with the ſong, <hi>with underſtanding;</hi> nor cheriſh the ſweet influence of the ſpirit upon their hearts. And they muſt ſeek out ſome other pſalmody, or, have David in a different form, or diſobey the apoſtolic injunction in my text. <hi>Dr. Watts's excellent imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> has relieved the chriſtian worſhiper from this diſtreſs; in the judicious tranſpoſition of <hi>David's</hi> pſalms in ſuch a manner, that we have 5, 6, or 8 ſtanzas together, that may be applied to our own caſe or ſubject. And this is certainly one of his great excellencies, wherein he has done more ſervice to the church than any poetical tranſlators that have gone before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The beſt ſermons, and prayers, are collected from various parts of the ſcripture ſuitable to the deſign, and circumſtances of thoſe for whom they are prepared, tho' far from the natural order in which they ſtand in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> originals, yet we never ſuſpect the authors of falling under the curſe, mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: no: It is counted an excellence in a goſpel miniſter, to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the moſt pertinent materials for ſermons or prayers; however far from the natural order in which the holy ſpirit has placed them in the bible. The good <hi>Dr. Watts</hi> himſelf has favoured the world with <hi>ſermons</hi> and <hi>prayers,</hi> that are, by ſome perſons, thought good and excellent, though not <hi>verbatim</hi> in the original order: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has indulged his poetical talents, as he has his capacity to preach and pray, for the benefit of the church, muſt he be bltoted out of the book of life, and fall under the heavieſt curſe?</p>
            <p n="5">5th <hi>Objection.</hi> We ſhould uſe no pſalmody but what is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the aſſembly of the kirk of Scotland, or by the ſynod. <hi>Anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It would ſeem agreeable to ſee all the churches unite in the uſe of the beſt compoſed pſalmody, fit for the goſpel day. But it ſhould be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:009524_0017_0F768BC154DFDB58"/>2. That God has only enjoined the duty of praiſe, without giving us an exact form, to which we ſhould be invariably confined. And ſince the education, the prejudices, the circumſtances, the very make and diſpoſitions of men, are ſo vaſtly different one from another; the ſentiments of mankind are very different on this head; and God may be worſhiped ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in different modes, though not with equal advantage to the worſhiper: it is evident, God has condeſcended to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conditions of mankind; that variety, in this particular, is neceſſary, to ſuit the variety there is among pious worſhipers. And that this is left by infinite wiſdom, to the conduct of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and prudence, under the general directions of ſcripture. And ſhould a <hi>general aſſembly,</hi> or <hi>ſynod</hi> interpoſe and order, that ſuch or ſuch a verſion, or collection of <hi>pſalms</hi> or <hi>hymns,</hi> ſhould be ſung in all the churches, and no other, it would be an arbitrary incroachment upon the rights of chriſtians; who are certainly at liberty to preach, pray, or praiſe the Lord, as they ſhall judge moſt for edification, or agreeable to the direction in my text. I have no more notion of eccleſiaſtical, than civil tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. There is no ſynod, aſſembly, or council on earth, that hath, or ought to have, power to impoſe any one verſion of pſalms on the chriſtian churches.</p>
            <p>If the objector means, that our pſalmody ſhould have the approbation, or the recommendation of the <hi>aſſembly,</hi> or <hi>ſynod;</hi> I have ſhewn that this has been done, by both; in a manner ſufficient to anſwer our purpoſe, and engage our thankfulneſs to God, that we have the countenance of ſo good example, and authority to ſupport us.</p>
            <p>There have been in every age, men of high-flying, arbritary principles, whoſe unlimitted notions of church power would prompt them to impoſe the decrees of councils, and ſynods, &amp;c. upon the church, and cut off the right of private judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liberty to call in queſtion their authority, and the laity muſt be doomed to the loweſt ſlavery. Theſe men generally ſet up their own opinion as the teſt of orthodoxy, and judge the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of others to be a <hi>crime,</hi> or <hi>duty,</hi> which they judge to be ſo in themſelves, without the leaſt allowance for their different circumſtances or ſentiments. From this principle the <hi>antichriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> ſpirit of impoſition and perſecution had its original. And when this <hi>horrid monſter</hi> ſtalks abroad in the world, dreſſed up in the garb of <hi>zeal</hi> for the mild and gentle religion of Jeſus; it
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009524_0018_0F768BC21072D4A8"/>
is more to be abhorred than the tyrant, that had a bed of his own ſize, and was ſaid to ſtretch men of low ſtature upon a rack, to the full length of it; and cut off the legs of all he found too long for it. What injuries has the church of Chriſt ſuſtained from this principle in former ages! thanks be to God, it is more out of countenance now, by numbers whom God in his infinite mercy has raiſed up, who are of candid and chriſtian ſentiments, and would not ſtretch eccleſiaſtical power beyond the limits that are ſet by the great head of the church. And I have the pleaſure to hope, that we ſhall ſhew to the world, we are poſſeſſed of the ſame chriſtian ſentiments.</p>
            <p>Judicatures have a right to judge of the ſoundneſs or unſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our pſalmody, as well as of our ſermons, or prayers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to countenance or diſcountenance accordingly: but they have no power to impoſe a verſion of <hi>David's pſalms</hi> by <hi>Mr. Rouſe,</hi> upon churches that think they can praiſe God more to edification and improvement in <hi>Doctor Watts's</hi> imitation, or any other ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox collection of pſalms; than they have to impoſe ſet forms of ſermons, or prayers, from which we muſt never deviate.</p>
            <p>There are many eminent chriſtians who cannot uſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſing any other than the <hi>Scotch</hi> verſion; it has been ſo long bound up in our bibles that ſome are of opinion, it is as divinely inſpired as if it had been made by David himſelf. Others cannot ſing this verſion with ſatisfaction, while they have others more agreeable and improving: ſome can ſing both as occaſion requires; and to impoſe in either caſe would be a tyrannical incroachment upon the rights of chriſtians.</p>
            <p>In anſwer therefore to the petition laid before us, requeſting our judgments, whether Doctor Watts's pſalmody may be ſung to chriſtian improvement and edification, we may, I think, eaſily determine, without any injury to churches or individuals. You may eaſily gather from what has been ſaid, the judgment of the general aſſembly, and others; and I believe ſhould we judge otherwiſe, it would contribute nothing to the credit of our underſtandings, in a world where their evangelical beauties and excellencies have been ſo generally admired.</p>
            <p>We are not to form an abſolute determination that one ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be uſed in the churches, and the other rejected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may as well arrogate the power of impoſing <hi>liturgies,</hi> or <hi>ſet forms</hi> of <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>ſermons.</hi> But ſince we cannot bear impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the one, let us equally abhor it in the other; yea in every caſe where there are manifeſt reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:009524_0018_0F768BC21072D4A8"/>7th. <hi>Objection.</hi> If we admit Watts's pſalmody into the church, it will open a door for error and hereſy; as others may be emboldened by ſuch a liberty, to introduce erroneous pſalms, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſwer.</hi> By the very ſame argument, as I have often hinted, you ſhould forbid all preaching and praying, but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed forms;</hi> there is as great, yea greater dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the one caſe than in the other; as the number that preach and pray is greater, than of thoſe who attempt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe divine ſongs; and hereſy in preaching and praying is as injurious to the church, as in ſinging. Since it is judged moſt for edification that we uſe our own judgments, our own ſenſe of divine things, in our own language, though we are liable to err, in prayer and preaching; it is equally edifying and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in our ſongs of praiſe; and equally ſafe from hereſy; and more ſo in this caſe, as the Doctor's and other goſpel ſongs are known and approven by the <hi>wiſe</hi> and learned; which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and prayers cannot be till they have ſpread their contagion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If at any time hereſy ſhould be introduced into the church by ſpiritual ſongs; it will then be fit that the church interpoſe and ſuppreſs it: they may at any time exert the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of their power againſt proper objects of it. But there is a thouſand times more danger of hereſy from preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than from ſinging praiſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8th <hi>Objection.</hi> Doctor Watts has left out ſome of the pſalms of David, therefore he has thrown away part of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The Doctor himſelf informs us, he eſteems the pſalms an excellent part of holy writ: but that ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar pſalms, or part of pſalms, are not the fitteſt materials for goſpel ſongs; and does he hence reject them from the ſacred canon?</p>
            <p>The ſcriptures are a rich treaſure of materials for various oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; and can a man be charged with rejecting ſcripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not apply particular parts of it to purpoſes for which it was never intended? Does a miniſter reject all the parts of ſcripture which he does not think ſuitable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, or various occaſions: Would it be fair reaſoning to ſay, I reject all the ſcriptures, I do not judge pertinent to my deſign in this ſermon?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Does not the ſame objection lie againſt Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, if they ſung a hymn at the inſtitution of the Lord's
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009524_0019_0F768BC2D4FD4698"/>
ſupper, as is generally thought they did? and againſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Diſciples, when they took part of David, and left out other parts, not ſo applicable to their day; explained, and added goſpel matter to them as they thought beſt? And is not every miniſter of the goſpel as guilty every time he preaches or prays, as the good Doctor was when he compoſed his ſongs?</p>
            <p n="9">9th <hi>Objection.</hi> Shall we change the pſalms of <hi>David</hi> for Dr. <hi>Watts's</hi> pſalms? <hi>Anſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. If you would ſing the pſalms of David in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, you muſt ſing <hi>Hebrew,</hi> or at leaſt, a literal tranſlation of them into Engliſh. But if you mean the <hi>Scotch verſion,</hi> done by Rouſe, the objection ſerves to diſcover weakneſs, or a bad cauſe, the competition is not between <hi>Watts</hi> and <hi>David;</hi> but between <hi>Watts</hi> and <hi>Rouſe.</hi> Since <hi>Rouſe's</hi> is far from an exact tranſlation; has many ideas added to the original, or taken from it: has given us the ſublimeſt poetry in <hi>low</hi> and <hi>dull</hi> verſe, that in ſome places can hardly be called good ſenſe. Beſides when you ſing it, you join ideas that were not ſo much as known to <hi>David</hi> or the <hi>Jews:</hi> therefore it is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pſalms of David. If you ſing Dr. <hi>Watts's imitation,</hi> you have more honor done to the royal pſalmiſt, as he is made more intelligible; and ſpeaks the language, and gives the ideas which he longed to uſe, and only touched at darkly, which he would have ſpoke fully had he lived in our day; and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable compoſures give light and joy to the ſaints that live two thouſand years after him. To ſing David's pſalms ſtrictly, you muſt have the ſame ideas and meaning which he had: you muſt go into the temple at Jeruſalem, and praiſe the Lord with a <hi>harp,</hi> and <hi>trumpet;</hi> and ſometimes hang your uſeleſs harps upon the willows by the rivers of Babylon. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But you reject this and ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. You only intend to ſing <hi>Rouſe's verſion,</hi> and that not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally; you will give it a ſpiritual meaning; or, you will worſhip God according to his appointment <hi>now,</hi> as David did according to his appointment <hi>then.</hi> This I take to be your true ſenſe, then you are involved in theſe difficulties; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine yourſelves to the uſe of words that cannot be addreſſed to God in their proper ſenſe; to ſing one thing and mean ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to make your hearts and your lips go contrary one to the other; to make every private chriſtian ſpeak to God in the language of a <hi>jewiſh king, captain, jewiſh muſician,</hi> &amp;c. to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009524_0019_0F768BC2D4FD4698"/>
to turn the ſong to his own caſe every time he joins in it, and give it a ſenſe quite different from its original deſign; and in a word, to labour in the moſt diſadvantagious manner to do what I am pleading for; <hi>i. e.</hi> to give an evangelical turn to the pſalms, in order to <hi>ſing with the ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>with the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo.</hi> You throw this burthen upon the multitude every time they ſing; you leave the divine oracles to be tortured by every ignorant and illiterate perſon. The wiſe may probably be able in this manner to give a ſpiritual ſenſe to <hi>David</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſhonor to the pſalmiſt: but the multitude cannot. We all agree <hi>David's</hi> pſalms are not to be ſung in a literal ſenſe; we agree, they muſt have a ſpiritual meaning. Now I appeal to common ſenſe,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether it be not infinitely beſt to have this evangelical turn given to the pſalms by ſome able skilful hand? Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> has given them that turn we all agree they ſhould have; his ſuperior genius, learning, piety, and poetical talents rendered him fit for the work. He looked upon it as of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the church; called in all the aſſiſtance of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, ſtudy, and prayers, for the divine bleſſing; he calls it the greateſt labour of his life; and the beſt judges highly eſteem and admire it, as an excellent ſervice done to the church: we have an evangelical turn given to David, in goſpel lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guge, plain, eaſy, ſmooth, and elegant; level to the loweſt capacity; and above the contempt of a politer taſte. If you plead that every miniſter may explain the pſalm before ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to enable the people to ſing with underſtanding; it is not one in a hundred that is ſo well qualified to do it as the Doctor was; and the learned themſelves cannot pretend to do it ſo well in the very time of ſinging: but to leave this to be done by crouds of illiterates; to ſubmit an extempory <hi>imitation</hi> of <hi>David's pſalms</hi> to be made by every vulgar hearer, every time he ſings; which he could not do to any purpoſe in an age; is as unreaſonable as any thing can be imagined; to leave theſe to explain and accommodate the obſcurities of a <hi>jewiſh pſalter</hi> to the goſpel day; who are ſo ignorant, that they are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of wreſting the moſt plain dictates of the goſpel to their own deſtruction; and to maintain that they are well qualified for it, and had better do it themſelves than ſing in the language of the excellent Doctor's imitation; is one of the greateſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities that can be maintained; and carries its own refutation
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009524_0020_0F768BC38E23D3C8"/>
in the bare mention of it. Since then there is no congregation in the world that can be ſaid literally to ſing <hi>David's pſalms;</hi> and it is agreed that in order to <hi>ſing with underſtanding,</hi> we muſt give them a ſpiritual turn, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſing an imitation of <hi>David's pſalms;</hi> and ſince Dr. <hi>Watts's</hi> imitation, and ſeveral other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, are greatly preferable to all extempory ones that can be made; and it is impoſſible the vulgar ſhould do it to any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable purpoſe; it follows that you ſhould ſing the Doctor's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itation, or one done by ſome skilful hand, if you would ſing in a manner the moſt agreeable to the text.</p>
            <p n="10">10th <hi>Obj.</hi> The introduction of goſpel Pſalmody is the occaſion of debates and diviſions, and alienation among chriſtians. <hi>Anſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. So was the reformation of the proteſtant churches from that of Rome: and had this objection been attended to, the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world muſt have been immerſed in the horrid gulph of popiſh darkneſs to this day! Nay, it would have deprived us of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion intirely, and ſhut us up in <hi>jewiſh</hi> or <hi>heathen</hi> darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The advocates for goſpel ſongs do not deſire to impoſe the uſe of them upon others; but only to be allowed the peaceable enjoyment of them; and the liberty they deſire, they are willing to allow others, without any contention or alienation; and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will be contentious, the charge lies againſt themſelves.</p>

               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="4">IV. Thus according to appointment, my Rev. Fathers and Brethren, I give my thoughts on this ſubject; I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do it in that manner which would do the greateſt juſtice to the ſubject; be leaſt liable to exception; and give the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any that might differ from me in ſentiments upon this head: with this view I have oppoſed ſentiments rather than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I am ſenſible that men of eminent learning and piety think very differently one from another on this as well as other points. I abhor the notion of condemning thoſe that differ from me, as I do of thoſe that condemn me, becauſe I differ for them. Perſons of great merit may vary in their opinions of this as well as other things; their ſentiments may be as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified as their faces. But ſince I am at liberty, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as I am required, I give my ſentiments, and the reaſons of my conduct. Though I had rather ſit at your feet and learn from you on this occaſion, yet I am not aſhamed to declare to you and to the world, that I believe we ſhould ſing the praiſes of God and the Lamb, that waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood; and that in the ſentiments and language of the goſpel;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009524_0020_0F768BC38E23D3C8"/>
or that our <hi>pſalm-book</hi> ſhould contain all the advantages of the goſpel, as well as our ſermons, prayers, or any other chriſtian duties; <hi>if we would ſing with the ſpirit, and with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo.</hi> That to confine the church to the <hi>Scotch verſion,</hi> i. e. to the ſtile and ſentiments of <hi>Jews,</hi> or in other words, to a <hi>jewiſh pſalm-book,</hi> for <hi>goſpel worſhip;</hi> to be ſung in their literal ſenſe, or left to be tortured and mangled by every illeterate in the promiſcuous croud, to give them a ſpiritual meaning, or goſpel turn to his own caſe, according to his knowledge or rather igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; i. e. to make vulgar imitations of David's pſalms, extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, every time he ſings; is far, very far from being the beſt way to ſing with the underſtanding: that no goſpel church on earth that is confined to it all through, ever has, or poſſibly can <hi>ſing with the ſpirit and underſtanding,</hi> in the ſenſe of the text; and therefore that it is a very great injury, to confine the church to ſuch a form. I think no one will plead the pſalms ſhould be ſung ſtrictly in their literal meaning; with all the ideas of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and in the manner that he worſhiped God in jewiſh ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues; for then we muſt go into their land, their ſynagogues, and uſe all their pompous concert of jewiſh muſic, &amp;c. and if not, they muſt put a goſpel meaning or turn to them as they ſing: this is the very thing I plead for; herein we all agree; only, I would have this done to our hand by a ſkilful perſon, well furniſhed for the undertaking; and not left to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the vulgar croud. Such a practice, I will maintain, is manifeſtly contrary to the ſcriptures, and the plaineſt dictates of reaſon, without a divine warrant. If there be any notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that will ſing the <hi>Scotch</hi> verſion, and nothing elſe; let them enjoy their liberty, and never be moleſted but by rational and chriſtian arguments. I am not a bigot to any one verſion: I uſe that of Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> becauſe I think it the beſt now extant that I know of: but do not take his <hi>pſalms</hi> and <hi>hymns</hi> to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſet of Pſalmody for all the occaſions of Chriſtians, even in our colonies. But I am fully perſuaded the churches in theſe parts have received very great advantage from his excellent compoſitions; eſpecially his ſacramental hymns. And I take this opportunity to acknowledge myſelf indebted to him for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſentiments I have laid before you on this occaſion. And cannot but hope they will have conſiderable weight with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very candid ſearcher after truth. Yet I could wiſh to ſee a more compleat ſyſtem collected from approven authors, to ſuit all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and caſes: and this might be done to much greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

than ever yet has been; I could wiſh alſo to ſee it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the church; as thoſe others have been which we now uſe. The ſubject is copious, and have been confined only to touch on the ſeveral topics of argument to ſupport the doctrine; each of which well handled would make a ſermon. In ſhort, if my time, eſpecially my talents, were equal to my ſubject, I ſhould pour out a reſiſtleſs torrent of argument, from ſcripture, and reaſon, of human and divine, of antient and modern, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that would make the ſubject glare with meridian luſtre; and cauſe the inveterate obſtinacy of prejudice itſelf, to confeſs that <hi>goſpel Pſalmody</hi> is undoubtedly the propereſt for <hi>goſpel worſhipers;</hi> and that ſuch, and ſuch only ſhould be uſed in the chriſtian church.</p>
               <p>I am perſuaded, that if the more pious, and judicious ſort of Chriſtians, that have confined themſelves to ſing <hi>Rouſe's verſion,</hi> and have thought they ſhould ſing nothing elſe; would throw aſide their prejudices, and lay themſelves open to conviction; and read, compare, and examine, by reaſon and ſcripture, the different ſpirit that breathes in theſe evangelical ſongs, from thoſe which they have uſed: they would ſoon find them abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more ſuitable to the goſpel, and to a chriſtian frame of ſpirit. And I can't but urge you to do this ſervice to yourſelves, as your own ſpiritual advantage is at ſtake: and doubt not but that you will find your very great advantage in ſo doing. You will find them peculiarly ſuitable to goſpel ſermons, ſacraments, and prayers; having a happy tendency to render them more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all that heartily deſire to imbibe more and more of the heaven-born religion of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and to paſs on from ſongs of praiſe here, to <hi>him that loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> to join in the higher aſcriptions of praiſe, with the heavenly Hoſts, ſaying, <hi>Hallelujah, ſalvation, and glory, and honor, and power, unto the Lord our God! and to the Lamb that was ſlain, and that redeemed us to God by his blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation. Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honor, and glory, and bleſſing; when every creature in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and ſuch as are in the ſea, and all that are in them, ſhall ſing, Bleſſing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto him that ſitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.</hi> Amen. God grant, it may be our eternal employment, mingled with the bleſſed millions on high, to aſcribe to him, glory, and dominion, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
