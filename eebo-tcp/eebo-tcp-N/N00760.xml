            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Challenge to <hi>Caleb Puſey,</hi> and a Check to his Lyes &amp; Forgeries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is three years ſince I publiſhed a Book, called, <hi>News of a Trumpet, &amp;c.</hi> which has vext and gall'd the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to ſee their vile Errors and Hereſies further diſcover'd to the World; and ſome Conſultations there has been among 'em as I am told, to bring forth an Anſwer, which accordingly, I have long expected &amp; at laſt have met with a right Scarrilous Pamphlet, ſigned by one <hi>Caleb Puſey, Satan's Harbinger</hi> by Title, wherein he pretends to anſwer [here and there a bit of] my ſaid Book: He leaps over 4, 5 or 6 pages at a time with ſilence; and what he does ſpeak to, he in many places Tares my Sentences to pieces, and leaves out the ſubſtance of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to make me ſpeak what I never intended [the true method of <hi>G. Fox</hi>] to render me odious. To prove this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'll cite but one Paſſage, even the very firſt Quotation he brings of mine in the top of his firſt page where he leaves out theſe woods, <hi>According to what was made manifeſt to them,</hi> and ſo makes it ſpeak as he has a mind But he having ſucked ſuch Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the founder of their Religion, he canot leave it till he ceaſes to be a <hi>Quaker</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For great part of thoſe confuſed ſayings which I quote, he ſends me to a <hi>Quakers</hi> Book for an anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>G K</hi>'s Books while he was one with them. Alas poor man! is the <hi>Quakers</hi> cauſe ſo drooping that he is forced to ſupport it with one <hi>Quakers</hi> Book to help another, which duely conſidered, no ways helps him neither.</p>
            <p>I have not read above half his Pamphlet, yet meet with between thirty and forty Lyes, Perverſions, Forgeries, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Lyes of all ſorts, double and ſingle; in order to prove this I'll

not enter his Book neither, but take that one Paſſage, that he quotes in his Preface, where he charges me of ſhamefully abuſing a ſaying of <hi>W. Penn</hi> in his <hi>Sandy Foundation.</hi> p. 20. There he denys that <hi>W. Penn</hi> calls Chriſt, as Man, <hi>The finite impotent Creature.</hi> This I charge on <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> as a Lye; Nay, 'tis a double Lye; for he adds, that <hi>W. P.</hi> meant it of us ſinners; whereas the only Subject that <hi>W. P.</hi> there treats on, is Jeſus Chriſt as the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, whom he calls <hi>The finite &amp; impotent Creature,</hi> and denys him to have ſatisfied the offended infinite Juſtice of his Father for mans ſin, for that very reaſon, and calls it an abſurdity ſo to believe or affirm. I have this Book of <hi>W. Penns</hi> by me, and I do deſire and intreat all modrate People that want to be ſatisfied in the Truth of this to come and ſee it; for I deſign to keep the Book for that purpoſe, to diſcover the baſeneſs of this <hi>Caleb Puſey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, I admire at <hi>W. Penn,</hi> being a Man of Wit, Parts and Learning, that he ſhould be ſo deeply mired in the Bog of Quakeriſm, as to ſuffer, nay, countenance ſuch palp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Lyes to be publiſhed in print, of his Writings, it being not only his place but in his Power to have prevented it; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he believes he ſhall hereafter give account of his Stewardſhip to Almighty God, he muſt needs believe this thing will riſe in Judgment againſt him, which is pupoſely done to deceive and delude poor ignorant People. — But as for <hi>C. Puſey</hi> I have no reaſon to expect better friuts from him, for he is not honeſt in Morals, he unjuſtly with-holds part of an Eſtate from the Executor of <hi>Thomas C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </hi>; but be it known to him I can force him ſo far to be honeſt, provided his Brethren are no Judges in the caſe. However he's a fit Tool to ſerve the <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe he can lye &amp; abuſe men without ſhame. But to the matter.</p>
            <p>Let this one paſſage in his Preface, which he eſteems a capital Crime againſt me [by repeating it divers times over

and over in his Book and calls it an <hi>abominable Lye</hi>] be the Rule and Touch ſtone of Tryal between us in the caſe, and to try the reſt of his wordy ſtuff in his Book. Therefore I here challenge him in the face of the World to let us chuſe four, ſix or more judicious Men to judge of this Paſſage, and if they find me wrong, and he right, I'll be bound to print what ſort of Condemnation <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> ſhall aſſign. But if they find me right and he wrong, he ſhall be bound to print what Condemnation I ſhall aſſign him.</p>
            <p>Now with this Mill-ſtone, through Gods aſſiſtance, will I grind this Miller, and by this Token it ſhall be known to the World that his caſe is Naught, that he makes Lyes the <hi>Quakers</hi> Refuge, and dare not refer it to any but his own Party, who are his encouragers in this wicked Work, and at whoſe Charge he prints, and not at his own; for <hi>New-Rome</hi> has a Publick Stock to carry on her under-ground Deſigns; but tis otherwiſe with me, I muſt print at my own Charge. Therefore till he accepts my Challenge, this is all the Anſwer I think to give him. Mean time, my Book does its Service appointed by divine Providence in <hi>England,</hi> the Land of my Nativity, where it has been Re-printed and ſpread for the benefit of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men in Defyance of Cart loads of his <hi>S<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
