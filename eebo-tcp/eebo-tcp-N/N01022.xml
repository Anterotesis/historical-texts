            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">II. In the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of a CHRIST Appearing to us, as the <hi>Work,</hi> the <hi>Glorious Work</hi> of God, there is laid up the Great Blessedness desired by every Godly Christian. Two Instructions ly plainly before us.</p>
            <p>First. Our <hi>Enjoying</hi> of a CHRIST, is in His Appearing to us. Tis by the <hi>Seeing</hi> of a CHRIST, that we come to the <hi>Having</hi> of a CHRIST. Some <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of a CHRIST is to be attained
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001219_0019_0FB130C4FB0596B0"/>
in <hi>this world.</hi> But this <hi>Enjoyment</hi> lies in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Fiducial Sight</hi> of him. Hence we read, Psal. 9. 10. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> does Reveal much of a CHRIST unto us; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> which indited the <hi>Scripture</hi> does assist us to <hi>Receive</hi> What the <hi>Scripture</hi> does <hi>Reveal.</hi> We Enjoy a <hi>CHRIST.</hi> when we <hi>Receive</hi> him, and Apprehend the <hi>glorious work</hi> of God in him, as he is tendred unto us, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Revelation. But the whole and full <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of a <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is not attained, until we come unto <hi>the world that is to come.</hi> And this <hi>Enjoyment</hi> will be in the <hi>Immediate Sight</hi> of him. Hence we read, 1 Joh. 3. 2. <hi>We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</hi> There will a Day come, when the <hi>Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> will Irradiate us with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectest Influences. We shall one Day be in the <hi>presence of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>walk all the Day long in the light of His Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:</hi> A Day, when we shall be <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Faultless before the presence of His Glory with exceeding Joy;</hi> A Day, when we shall <hi>see His Face,</hi> and <hi>the Lord God

               </hi> We shall than indeed <hi>Enjoy</hi> a CHRIST, and be <hi>forever with the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. Every <hi>Godly Christian</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects his Great and Chief Blessedness in this Enjoyment. <q>Here, <hi>he sayes,</hi> here, Even this is <hi>all my Salvation and all my Desire;</hi> If HE that shall be <hi>the Just Ruler over men,</hi> will please to <hi>shine as the light of the Morning</hi> upon me.</q> As the Prophet said unto the person that Entertained him, <hi>What shall be done for thee?</hi> I will say it unto the Believer; Christian, <hi>What shall be done for thee?</hi> Wouldest thou have all the <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Pleasures</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> of the Earth heaped upon thee? I know the Reply that such an one will make It is the guise &amp; mark of every Godly Christian, to Cry out with a flaming Soul, as the Martyr did in the Flames, <hi>None but CHRIST! None but CHRIST!</hi> A Godly Christian looks upon <hi>Acquaintance</hi> with a CHRIST, as the <hi>Inchoation</hi> of his Blessedness. He is of that Judgment; Phil. 3. 8. <hi>I count all things but loss, for the Excellency of the

To <hi>be with Christ, is by far the best of all.</hi> A CHRIST, he is the <hi>light of God.</hi> The Real Christian sayes, <hi>Lord, In thy light, I shall see light: all the light, and all the good, that my Soul can wish for.</hi> A CHRIST, He is the ALL of every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christian. He subscribes to that; Col. 3. 11. <hi>Christ is ALL.</hi> His Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is, <hi>Christus meus et Omnia;</hi> If CHRIST be mine, ALL is mine. The <hi>Alsufficiency</hi> of a CHRIST, is most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately Celebrated by every serious Christian. We read, Col. 1. 19. <hi>It pleased the Father, that in him should all Fulness dwell.</hi> And it <hi>Pleases,</hi> it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, it Revives the Christian, to see that <hi>Fulness</hi> in him. He sees that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency</hi> in a CHRIST, which will yield him Everlasting Satisfaction; that <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Redemption,</hi> which will answer all of his Necessities.

But they also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That none but a CHRIST can deliver them; Tis <hi>JESUS,</hi> who <hi>Delivers from the wrath to come.</hi> Good men remember, That their <hi>Children</hi> are the woful <hi>Slaves</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> who <hi>Leads them Captives to do his will.</hi> But they also remember, That none but a

Secondly. Good men are very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, That by <hi>their Means,</hi> their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> are become so very <hi>Miserable.</hi> It was the Law of Equity, Exod. 21. 19.

My Child, my Child: It is I that have so cruelly Wounded it!</hi> This Awakens them to study, what they may do, that these <hi>Children</hi> may have a CHRIST, for to heal them of their <hi>Wounds.</hi> Good men see <hi>Original Sin</hi> in their <hi>Children,</hi> which is a <hi>Spring</hi> of all Wickedness and Confusion; An <hi>Evil Frame;</hi> An <hi>Evil Heart;</hi> An <hi>Heart of Stone.</hi> But Good men see, and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. Good men are very sensible, That if their <hi>Children</hi> have a CHRIST, they are then sure of <hi>Blessedness;</hi> they have <hi>Blessedness</hi> enough; they are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently and admirably provided for. We read; Rom. 8. 32. <hi>How shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</hi> Thus will Good men say; <hi>O my God; If thou wilt give thy CHRIST unto my Children, thou wilt in Him give them all things, and what is more than all?</hi> That worthy man <hi>Claviger,</hi> would say, If I may see the <hi>Fear of God</hi> in my Children, <hi>Satis mih<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

They that have the <hi>Fear of God</hi> in them, will say concerning their Children; <q>If I may see my <hi>Children</hi> possessed of a CHRIST, I shall not be very sollicitious what other <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session</hi> I may leave unto them.</q> Good men should not be sollicitous to lay up the Great Things of this world for their <hi>Children. Seekest thou Great things
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001219_0027_0FB130D312A73CF0"/>
for them? Seek them not.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> are very often undone, by having too Large Portions of these Bewitching and Perishing Vanities. It had been well for many <hi>Children,</hi> if they had not been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with such large Portions, to be the <hi>Fuel</hi> of their Debaucheries. But Good men know, that if their <hi>Children</hi> have a CHRIST, they then have the <hi>Promise, both of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> They know, That if their <hi>Children</hi> have a CHRIST, whatever <hi>changes</hi> or <hi>sorrows</hi> come upon them, they shall <hi>all work together for their good.</hi> They know, that if their <hi>Children</hi> have a CHRIST, they shall most certainly be <hi>kept by the mighty Power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</hi> This, this causes them to be in an inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Travail of Soul for their <hi>Children,</hi> that an Interest in a CHRIST, an Union with a CHRIST, may be obtained for them.</p>

               <p>Charge the Children, <hi>Charge</hi> them, to <hi>Learn</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>Prize</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>Give</hi> themselves up to CHRIST. Set before them the Tenders of a CHRIST; and ask them to Accept what is Tendred; Leave them not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they have declared unto you their Acceptance of it.</p>

Bring the <hi>Children</hi> to CHRIST. We read, Mat. 19. 13. <hi>There were brought unto Him little Children.</hi> Oh! Bring every one of them unto him, and Cry unto him with a wondrous Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; <q>
                     <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> Let my Children be thine. Cause them to Know thee, Love thee, Glorify thee! Be thou Precious to them; Do thou take them under thy Conduct; Guide them by thy Counsel; Bring them to thy Glory.</q> And bring the <hi>Children</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Word</hi> of CHRIST. See that they <hi>Read</hi> the Word, see that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently attend on the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> After the <hi>Word</hi> has been <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> unto them, do you speak to them of it, and mind them, what they should now go alone, and beg of God in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent supplications. Restrain them from those Licentious Practices, to which our Young People so much abandon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, on the Evening after the Lords Day; the most Criminal Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they say, in all the Week.

Licentious Practices be retrenched and reformed.</p>
               <p>I Bless God; some of our Young People, do make a more Profitable and Commendable Improvement of that Evening.

               <p>AND now, <hi>Come, ye Children, Hearken to me, and I will Teach you that Fear of the Lord,</hi> that shall bring you to the Enjoyment of Him. The Inference will now be Irresistible. If <hi>Godly Persons</hi> desire above all things, the Enjoyment of a CHRIST, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Blessedness for themselves, and for their <hi>Children,</hi> certainly it becomes, it concerns our <hi>Children</hi> to desire this Blessedness for themselves. Yea, if ever they become <hi>Godly Children</hi> their Godliness will first show it self, in their Desiring of this Blessedness. Oh! If once our Children were come to this Language, <hi>A Christ, A Christ, for a Perishing Soul!</hi> Then should we begin to hope, that they will not <hi>Perish,</hi> Then, and never till then, should we see upon them, the Hopeful Beginning of those things <hi>that accompany Salvation.</hi>

But how shall they be prevailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al? Nothing that we can say, tho' we should <hi>speak with the Tongue of Angels,</hi> will be prevalent upon the Blinded and Hardned Minds of Sinners. But,—</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Thou Almighty Spirit of Grace; Thou art stronger than all the Powers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which holds the Minds of our Young People in such a deplorable Captivity. Oh! Do thou Exert thy Strength, and Glorify thy</hi> CHRIST, <hi>and conquer and perswade our Young People, to Embrace Him as the Greatest Blessedness, and awaken them into those Agonies, that shall never give them any Rest, until they are Blessed with an Interest in Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Expectation of what the Holy Spirit of God breathing in His Word, may do upon the Souls of our <hi>Young People,</hi> we will now set before them, <hi>Why</hi> they should pursue such a <hi>Blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> as the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST, and <hi>How</hi> they shall obtain such a Blessed Enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Will you be advised, O our <hi>Young People,</hi> Why you should look after the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST?</p>

First; Methinks, In that Expression, <hi>A Glorious</hi> CHRIST, you may see that intimated, which may admonish you, that you cannot have a Greater <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,</hi> than the <hi>Enjoyment</hi> of Him. <hi>Glorious things are to be spoken of thee, O thou blessed Enjoyment!</hi> Children, you have GOD for yours, if you have CHRIST for yours. As CHRIST is, the <hi>True God,</hi> the <hi>Great God,</hi> the <hi>Most High God;</hi> so, to Enjoy Him, is the <hi>Truest,</hi> the <hi>Greatest,</hi> the <hi>Highest</hi> Blessedness, And his <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Offer</hi> is, to bring you unto GOD. How Joyfully may you now sing, Lam. 3. 24. 25. <hi>The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul; therefore will I hope in Him: The Lord is good unto them that wait for Him, to the Soul that seeks Him.</hi> Good! Yea, An Infinite Good! There is enough in Him, to suffice Himself, and enough to suffice &amp; fulfil the Desires of all the Souls that come unto Him. The <hi>Knowledge</hi> of GOD, you have it if you know JESUS CHRIST, <hi>whom to know is Life Eternal.</hi> The <hi>Favour</hi> of GOD, you have it, if you are Favoured and <hi>Accepted in His

Beloved</hi> CHRIST. <hi>Fellowship</hi> with GOD; <hi>Truly our Fellowship is with the Father,</hi> if it be <hi>with His Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>The CHRIST proposed unto your Enjoyment, as He is the <hi>Manna</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> thus He is the <hi>Wonder</hi> of <hi>Angels;</hi> And may we not imagine, that our Contempt, of Him, is the <hi>Wonder,</hi> and the <hi>Anger</hi> of <hi>Angels?</hi> Oh! Could we look into the City of God!—<hi>You are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished, O ye Heavens, and you are very Disdainful at our Infidelity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A CHRIST; Who, who shall declare His Excellency? <hi>Children,</hi> If there were proffered unto you, the Enjoyment of <hi>this World,</hi> in all the <hi>Glory</hi> of it, a little Time were enough to <hi>Relate</hi> all that you are to <hi>Enjoy.</hi> We read, The <hi>Tempter</hi> show'd our Saviour, Luk. 4. 5. <hi>All the Kingdoms of the world in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Time.</hi> It is a moral and witty Gloss, that <hi>Ambrose</hi> has upon it; <hi>In mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento enim cuncta illa praetereunt.</hi> They last but <hi>for a Moment;</hi> If they are not <hi>shown in a Moment,</hi> they cannot be shown at all. Oh! But the Enjoyment of a CHRIST; An <hi>Eternity,</hi> an <hi>Eternity,</hi> is
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001219_0037_0FB130E4F42DE130"/>
little enough, to <hi>Relate</hi> all the <hi>Glory</hi> that is contained in it. God the <hi>Father</hi> is forever Beholding His CHRIST, with a Divine Contemplation &amp; Satisfaction. The Object of the <hi>Contemplation</hi> is the SON of God. The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in that Object, is the SPIRIT of God. Arise, my dear <hi>Young People,</hi> Arise to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, Ravishing, Heavenly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the adorable <hi>Trinity;</hi> You do it, when the SPIRIT of God, affects you with a prospect of what you shall Enjoy in having the SON of God for yours!</p>
               <p>My Errand unto you, is, to <hi>Espouse</hi> your <hi>Young</hi> Souls unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And what <hi>Objection</hi> can you have, against being <hi>Espoused</hi> unto such a <hi>Glorious</hi> ONE? <hi>Oh! Could we see that King in His Beauty!</hi>—Either take up with Him, and be wondrously taken with Him; or say, He that <hi>made the world,</hi> is not so Good an Enjoyment as <hi>the world;</hi> say, He that <hi>fills Heaven and Earth,</hi> is not an Enjoyment that will Fill the Soul of man.

               <p>Sollicited Souls; Look thro' the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse; Who who, is there so worthy of your Esteem, as the <hi>Glorious</hi> Lord JESUS CHRIST! Can <hi>Mammon</hi> stand in Competition, with him that is the <hi>King of Heaven?</hi> Can <hi>Satan</hi> be as desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a Master, as he that is the <hi>Lord of Angels?</hi> Bring all other things, and lay them in the Ballance with the Lord JESUS CHRIST; they will all be found less than the <hi>light Dust of the Ballance,</hi> and lighter than Vanity it self: They will but help to set off an inestimable JESUS.</p>
               <p>My Children: I cannot give over pleading with you, till a <hi>Glorious</hi> CHRIST appear unto you, as he does to the <hi>Holy Myriads,</hi> which are in his Realms of Light attending on him.</p>
               <p>I will go on.</p>

               <p>Be assured of it, <hi>Children;</hi> The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a Glorious CHRIST, will bring you to an <hi>Inheritance,</hi> beyond all Humane Comprehension. For, if you become <hi>United</hi> unto the <hi>Son of God,</hi> you do your selves become the <hi>Children of God.</hi> And then! What followes? Rom. 8. 17. <hi>If Children, then Heirs; Heirs of God, and Joint-Heirs with Christ.</hi> The <hi>Inheritance</hi> which the Great GOD will bestow upon his <hi>Children,</hi> can be no small Inheritance. No, <hi>Children,</hi> You shall <hi>Inherit all things;</hi> yea, the Great GOD Himself will be your <hi>Inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What shall I say? You have no <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of your own, wherein you may dare to appear before <hi>God the Judge of all.</hi> But come to the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST; From that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001219_0041_0FB130EA8AE70FB8"/>
you become Owners of a spotless and splendid and glorious <hi>Righteousness;</hi> A <hi>Righteousness</hi> more acceptable to God, than the Obedience of all the Angels in heaven; A <hi>Righteousness</hi> wherein you may venture to stand before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-seat of God.</p>
               <p>You have grievous <hi>Maladies</hi> on your Souls; None can <hi>Cure</hi> your Maladies. But come to the Enjoyment of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious CHRIST; From that moment, the <hi>Cure</hi> is begun. The <hi>Lord our Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> takes you into his hands; He will never Desert what his healing hands have undertaken, till he present you <hi>Glorious, without spot, wrinkle or blemish,</hi> before his Father.</p>
               <p>You are to <hi>Dy</hi> in a little while; and you are by <hi>Death</hi> to be stript of all that you Enjoy in this world. But come to the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST; Then <hi>Death</hi> it self will be your <hi>Gain;</hi> By <hi>Death</hi> you shall <hi>Gain</hi> a Deliverance from all Pain, and all Sin, and all Temptation; You shall <hi>Gain</hi> a <hi>Paradise,</hi> where the Blessed JESUS will visit you with his Consolations.</p>

In a word; In the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST, you will have, what will make up the want of every other Enjoyment! It is a memorable passage, Isa. 9. 1. <hi>At the First time, He made Vile the Land of</hi> Zabulon, <hi>&amp; the Land of</hi> Naphtali; <hi>so in the latter time He shall make it Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; Even the way of the Sea, beyond</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Galilee <hi>of the Gentiles.</hi> The People of the Countrey here described, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with an Early Captivity; The <hi>Assyrian</hi> Captivated them, and committed fearful and bloody Depredations upon them. Well, but sayes our God, I will make them <hi>Amends</hi> for these Afflictions. What <hi>Amends?</hi> It follows, <hi>The People that sat in Darkness have seen a Great Light.</hi> A CHRIST, a CHRIST, coming and shining upon a wretched Countrey makes <hi>Amends</hi> for the most severe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; The Countrey is <hi>Glorified</hi> in such a rare Enjoyment! Are you <hi>Poor?</hi> In a CHRIST, you Enjoy a <hi>Goodly He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage.</hi> Are you <hi>Sick?</hi> In a CHRIST you Enjoy the <hi>Saving Health</hi> of God. Are you <hi>Reproached?</hi> In a CHRIST you Enjoy an <hi>Advocate,</hi> Have your

                  <hi>friends</hi> forsaken you? In a CHRIST, you Enjoy a <hi>Friend</hi> of more Value, than all the Friends in the Universe. How, how can you subsist without Him?</p>
               <p>If you are Deaf to all these Charms, I will go on, Thirdly, to tell you; That except and until a Glorious CHRIST be yours, you are infinitely miserable. I tell you truly; The most horrible Article of Misery that ever was uttered, is that; Eph. 2. 12. <hi>Without CHRIST.</hi> And I will tell you <hi>Something</hi> about the Misery of them that are <hi>Without</hi> CHRIST: I say, <hi>Something</hi> of it; For, truly to be <hi>without CHRIST,</hi> is to be <hi>beyond all Expression Miserable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh! That the God of all Grace, would cause these things to sink down into the hearts of our <hi>Young People,</hi> and therewith infuse a concern for a CHRIST into them!</p>
               <p>First; By our <hi>Fall</hi> from God, we are all become very <hi>Miserable:</hi> And, O my <hi>Young People,</hi> Who but a Glorious CHRIST can Deliver you from the Numberless and Exquisite <hi>Miseries,</hi> into which you
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001219_0044_0FB130F05E2BA9D0"/>
are Fallen? It is most sure, that by our <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Fall,</hi> we have made our selves miserable Creatures. We have <hi>Sinned;</hi> and our Lamentation may be that; Lam. 5. 16. <hi>Wo unto us, that we have Sinned. Children;</hi> You have Sinned, and you are <hi>Estranged</hi> from God, you are <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred</hi> by God; surely, this is to be very <hi>Miserable!</hi> You have Sinned, and you are sunk into an <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God, into an <hi>Enmity</hi> to God; surely this is to be very <hi>Miserable!</hi> You have Sinned, and your <hi>Minds</hi> are Infected, your <hi>Wills</hi> are Depraved, your <hi>Affections</hi> are all out of Order; the <hi>Powers of Darkness</hi> hold you in <hi>Chains of Darkness.</hi> And is not this to be very <hi>Miserable?</hi> Every one of you is a <hi>Sinner;</hi> and the Voice of every <hi>Sinner</hi> may be that; Rom. 7. 24. <hi>Oh! Wretched one that I am; who shall Deliver me!</hi> Now, if you have a CHRIST, you have a <hi>Deliverer.</hi> But if you are without a CHRIST, <hi>Oh! Wretched Ones that you are; you have none to Deliver you!</hi> Could you Deliver your selves from your Miseries, or could any one else Deliver you; Then to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001219_0045_0FB130F1CE182F50"/>
be without a CHRIST, would not be so Miserable. But, Isa. 10. 3. <hi>What will you do in the Day of Visitation? To whom will you flee for Help?</hi> Saith the Lord; <hi>Without me</hi> they shall Perish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Prisoners</hi> of Desperation. What will become of a stung <hi>Israelite,</hi> if he look not unto the healing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? We read, Act. 4. 12. <hi>There is not Salvation in any other.</hi> None of all your Miseries would ly upon you, if you had a CHRIST concerned for the relieving and removing thereof. But while you are without a CHRIST, all your Miseries continue unrelieved and unremoved World without end. All our <hi>Help</hi> is laid upon a CHRIST. Ah, Christless One! Ah, Helpless One! What will become of thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly. To be without a Glorious CHRIST, is to be under the <hi>Guilt of Sin,</hi> But then, Behold, my Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Behold, how <hi>Miserable!</hi> If it could be said, Psal. 32. 1. 2. <hi>Blessed is the man whose Transgression is Forgiven, and whose Sin is Covered; Blessed is the man
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001219_0046_0FB130F499A48788"/>
unto whom the Lord Imputeth not Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> Then it must be said, <hi>Undone</hi> is the man, to whom the Lord <hi>Imputeth Iniquity.</hi> But so <hi>Undone</hi> art thou, O Young Man, if thou art a <hi>Christless</hi> one. It is a <hi>Miserable</hi> thing to be under the <hi>Guilt</hi> of sin. But he that is <hi>Christless</hi> cannot be <hi>Guiltless.</hi> It was said, 1 Cor. 15. 17. <hi>If Christ be not Raised, ye are yet in your Sins.</hi> And it may be said, <hi>If Christ be not yours, ye are yet in your Sins.</hi> While a man is without a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous CHRIST, he is <hi>Unjustified;</hi> for every Unbeliever is <hi>Unjustified;</hi> We are <hi>Justified by Faith.</hi> We read, Joh. 3. 18. <hi>He that Believeth not, is Condemned already.</hi> The Violated Law of God, has passed a sentence of Condemnation upon the sinner. None but a CHRIST can make satisfaction to the Violated <hi>Law;</hi> And he has done it for those that are in him. He that is without a CHRIST, is himself under obligation to satisfy the <hi>Law</hi> of God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; he is obliged in dreadful Bonds to become a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> unto the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Justice of God. Oh! <hi>Miserable
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:001219_0047_0FB130F6577CD140"/>
Plight!</hi> We read Rom. 8. 1. <hi>There is no Condemnation to those that are in CHRIST.</hi> But horribly <hi>Condemned</hi> are they that are without a CHRIST. There is no way for a sinner to come at a <hi>Pardon,</hi> but by the <hi>Atonement</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. His only Plea is, That the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST has made <hi>Atonement</hi> for him. A sinner has no way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Righteous,</hi> but by having the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST placed unto his Account. He must plead, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST has <hi>fulfilled all Righteousness</hi> on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. He that is without a <hi>CHRIST,</hi> is without that <hi>Atonement,</hi> without that <hi>Righteousness.</hi> O Young People, If you are <hi>Christless,</hi> Let these Thoughts force themselves in upon you, <q>Any <hi>One Sin</hi> lying upon me, were enough to make me for ever <hi>Miserable.</hi> But, What shall I do? Where shall I fly? That have been Guilty of Thousands of <hi>Sins,</hi> and every one of them all <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned</hi> unto this moment! Oh!

               <p>Thirdly. Can the dreadful <hi>Wrath</hi> &amp; <hi>Curse</hi> of God, make any person <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable?</hi> Then, O Young People, To be without a CHRIST, is to be <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. Sin, Sin,</hi> has laid us all under the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> of God. While we are without a CHRIST, we are without Him, who bore the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> for His People, and who alone can Redeem us from that <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Curse.</hi> A <hi>Christless</hi> person is under the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God. We read, Joh. 3. 36. <hi>The Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> He is under the <hi>Curse</hi> of God. We read, Deut. 28. 15. <hi>All the Curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Miserable sinner; The <hi>Wrath</hi> of God like a Consuming Fire, is burning against him. The Great GOD is <hi>every Day Angry</hi> at him. There is the Anger of God, in all His Dispensations towards him. Nothing that he does is pleasing to God. He Languishes perpetually under the Displeasure of God. He is
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:001219_0049_0FB130F9527572D8"/>
a <hi>Child of Wrath;</hi> he is obnoxious to that Wrath, at which, you Quake, <hi>O ye Mountains,</hi> you Melt, <hi>O ye Hills,</hi> you are Thrown down, <hi>O ye Rocks;</hi> And, <hi>Who can stand before that Indignation?</hi> The <hi>Curse</hi> of God haunts him; There is a <hi>Curse</hi> in all that happens unto him. There is a <hi>Curse</hi> Embittering all his Enjoyments. The <hi>Curse</hi> makes him the worse for every thing. He may have some <hi>Temporal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Nothing does him Good! <hi>Prosperity</hi> beguiles him; <hi>Adversity</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens him. <hi>Ordinances</hi> make him no better than he was before, <hi>Oh! Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serble Sinner!</hi> How canst thou hear of any <hi>Miseries,</hi> and thy Heart not Faint, and even Dy away within thee?</p>
               <p>Fourthly. He that is without a CHRIST, is a <hi>Slave</hi> of the <hi>Devil:</hi> But certainly, O Young People, to be such a Slave, is to be very <hi>Miserable.</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:001219_0050_0FB130FAF7956690"/>
Until a man get into the Hands of the <hi>Saviour,</hi> he is in the hands of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer.</hi> We are in the <hi>Kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> till we are translated into the <hi>Kingdom of our Saviour.</hi> [See, Col 1. 13.] Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til a man be in CHRIST, he is not a <hi>Child of God.</hi> And he that is not a <hi>Child of God,</hi> who's is he? We may tremble to speak it; but we find it spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the mouth of God; 1 Joh. 3 10 Either the <hi>Children of God,</hi> or the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil.</hi> Yea, but every <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> is a <hi>Slave</hi> to him. How <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable</hi> is Sinner without a CHRIST? <hi>Satan</hi> has Possession of him; <hi>Satan</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaves him; <hi>Satan</hi> Deceives him; <hi>Satan</hi> Befools him. He is Blinded by <hi>Satan; Satan</hi> hinders him from a true sight of <hi>Sin</hi> as it is, and from seeing the things of his Everlasting Peace. He is always at work for <hi>Satan;</hi> and at last <hi>Satan</hi> payes him his wages. he can't resist the motions of <hi>Satan;</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> that has been his <hi>Tempter,</hi> at last becomes his <hi>Tormentor.</hi> He is in the <hi>Snare of Satan,</hi> and <hi>led Captive by Satan to do his will,</hi> Oh! Miserable Captivity! Worst
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:001219_0051_0FB130FDC7CEA458"/>
than any Captivity among the <hi>Monsters</hi> of <hi>Africa!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly; Will you be sensible of it, O Young People? The <hi>Christless</hi> are under the Dominion of a worse <hi>Tyrant</hi> than the <hi>Devil</hi> himself: Sin, <hi>Sin,</hi> has Dominion over them that are without a CHRIST. It was said, Rom. 6. 14. <hi>Sin shall not have Dominion over you, for you are under Grace.</hi> But if you are not under CHRIST, you are not <hi>under Grace,</hi> and <hi>Sin will have Dominion over you,</hi> They that are without a CHRIST, say concerning Him, <hi>They will not have Him to Reign over them.</hi> God in His just Vengeance then sayes, <hi>If it be so, then let Sin Reign over them. Sin</hi> Swayes the Scepter in every Unconverted and Unsanctified Sinner. The filthy Lusts of <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Desires</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Desires</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> are not only Raging but also Reigning in the Sinner, until he submit unto the Scepter of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. He is, Tit. 3. 3. <hi>Serving diverse Lusts.</hi> A <hi>Miserable Vassal!</hi> He has no <hi>steps ordered in the Word of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001219_0052_0FB131002B5EEF90"/>
God,</hi> but, <hi>Iniquity has Dominion over him.</hi> He is alwayes toyling to Gratify his Loathsome <hi>Lusts;</hi> his <hi>Lusts</hi> precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him into Criminal and Multiplied Follies; he feels himself ruined by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Dictates of his <hi>Lusts,</hi> and yet he can't help it, he must follow them. He knowes that his <hi>Lusts</hi> damnify him in all his Interests, and yet he is hurried on unto Evident Confusion. Or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his <hi>Lusts</hi> put out his Eyes; but still he grinds for them, till he dies upon the spot. Judge, O all Young People that have come to any Exercise of Reason, Judge, whether this be not to be very <hi>Miserable?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly: Certainly, my <hi>Young People,</hi> Tis a <hi>Miserable</hi> thing, to be in hourly Danger of Easeless and Endless <hi>Miseries.</hi> In the <hi>Damnation</hi> that waits for the sleeping Sinner in the other world, <hi>and slumbers not,</hi> there are incomprehensible <hi>Miseries;</hi> which cannot without horror be thought upon.

They are struck with a Flame entring into their Souls, and a stroke that cannot be cured in Eternal Ages.
