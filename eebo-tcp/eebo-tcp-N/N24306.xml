            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AN unuſual ſenſation poſſeſſes my breaſt; a ſenſation, which I once thought could never pervade it on any occaſion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. It is <hi>pleaſure;</hi> pleaſure, my dear Lucy, on leaving my paternal roof! Could you have believed that the darling child of an indulgent and dearly beloved mother would feel a gleam of joy at leaving her? but so it is. The melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the gloom, the condolence, which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded me for a month after the death of Mr. Haly, had depressed my ſpirits, and palled every enjoyment of life. Mr. Haly was a man or worth; a man of real and ſubstantial merit. He is therefore deeply, and juſtly regreted by <hi>his</hi> friends; he was chosen to be a future guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032142_0004_0FF153CBA0675960"/>
and companion for me, and was, therefore, beloved by <hi>mine.</hi> As their choice; as a good man, and a faithful friend, I eſteemed him. But no one acquainted with the diſparity of our tempers and diſpoſitions, our views and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, can ſuppoſe my heart much engaged in the alliance. Both nature and education had inſtilled into my mind an implicit obedience to the will and deſires of my parents. To them, of courſe, I ſacrificed my fancy in this affair; determined that my reaſon ſhould concur with theirs; and on that to riſk my future happineſs. I was the more encouraged, as I ſaw, from our firſt acquaintance, his declining health; and expected, that the event would prove as it has. Think not, however, that I rejoice in his death. No; far be it from me; for though I believe that I never felt the paſſion of love for Mr. Haly; yet a habit of converſing with him, of hearing daily the moſt virtuous, tender, and affectionate ſentiments from his lips, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired emotions of the ſincereſt friendſhip, and eſteem.</p>
               <p>He is gone. His fate is unalterably, and I truſt, happily fixed. He lived the life, and died the death of the righteous. O that my laſt end may be like his! This event will, I hope, make a ſuitable and abiding impreſſion upon my mind; teach me the fading nature of all ſublunary enjoyments, and the little depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which is to be placed on earthly felicity. Whose ſituation was more agreeable; whoſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032142_0005_0FF15450486F12A8"/>
proſpects more flattering, than Mr. Haly's? Social, domeſtic, and connubial joys were fondly anticipated, and friends, and fortune ſeemed ready to crown every wiſh! Yet ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by ſtill brighter hopes, he cheerfully bid them all adieu. In converſation with me, but a few days before his exit; "There is" ſaid he, "but one link in the chain of life, undiſſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered; that, my dear Eliza, is my attachment to you. But God is wiſe and good in all his ways; and in this, as in all other reſpects, I would cheerful ſay, His will be done."</p>
               <p>You, my friend, were witneſs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding ſcene; and therefore, I need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, on the ſubject, that if I have wiſdom and prudence to follow his advice and example; if his prayers for my temporal and eternal welfare be heard and anſwered, I ſhall be happy indeed.</p>
               <p>The diſpoſition of mind, which I now feel, I wiſh to cultivate. Calm, placid, and ſerene; thoughtful of my duty, and benevolent to all around me, I wiſh for no other connection than that of friendſhip,</p>
               <p>This Letter is all egotiſm, I have even neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to mention the reſpectable, and happy friends, with whom I reſide; but will do it in my next. Write ſoon, and often; and believe me ſincerely yours,</p>

               <p>TIME, which effaces every occaſional impreſſion, I find gradually diſpelling the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penſiveneſs, which the melancholy event, the ſubject of my laſt, had diffuſed over my mind. Naturally cheerful, volatile, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflecting, the oppoſite diſpoſition, I have found to contain ſources of enjoyment, which I was before unconſcious of poſſeſſing.</p>
               <p>My friends, here, are the picture of conjugal felicity. The ſituation is delightful. The viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iting parties perfectly agreeable. Every thing tends to facilitate the return of my accuſtomed vivacity. I have written to my mother, and received an anſwer. She praiſes my fortitude, and admires the philoſophy which I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, under, what ſhe calls, my heavy bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Poor woman! She little thinks that my heart was untouched; and when that is unaffected, other ſentiments and paſſions make but a tranſient impreſſion. I have been, for a month or two, excluded from the gay world; and, indeed, fancied myſelf ſoaring above it. It is now that I begin to deſcend, and find my

natural propenſity for mixing in the buſy ſcenes and active pleaſures of life returning. I have received your letter; your moral lecture rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and be aſſured, my dear, your monitorial leſſons and advice ſhall be attended to. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ſhall never again reſume thoſe airs, which you term <hi>coquettiſh,</hi> but which I think deſerve a ſofter appellation; as they proceed from an innocent heart, and are the effuſions of a youthful, and cheerful mind. We are all envited to ſpend the day, to morrow, at Col. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

our country, and religion allow it. I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured yeſterday to throw aſide the habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mourning, and to array myſelf in thoſe more adapted to my taſte. We arrived at Col. Farington's about one o'clock. The Col. handed me out of the carriage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced me to a large company aſſembled in the Hall. My name was pronounced with an <hi>emphaſis;</hi> and I was received with the moſt flattering tokens of reſpect. When we were summoned to dinner, a young gentleman in a clerical dreſs offered me his hand, and led me to a table furniſhed with an elegant, and ſumptuous repaſt, with more gallantry, and addreſs than commonly fall to the ſhare of ſtudents. He ſat oppoſite me at table; and whenever I raiſed my eye, it caught his. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe, and politeneſs of his manners, with his particular attention to me, raiſed my curioſity, and induced me to aſk Mrs. Laiton who he was? She told me that his name was Boyer; that he was deſcended from a worthy family; had paſſed with honor and applauſe through the univerſity where he was educated; had ſince ſtudied divinity with ſuccess; and now had a call to settle as a miniſter in one of the firſt pariſhes in a neighbouring ſtate.</p>
               <p>The gates of a ſpacious garden were thrown open, at this inſtant; and I accepted with avid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity an invitation to walk in it. Mirth, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity prevailed, and the moments fled on downy wings; while we traced the beauties of art

and nature, ſo liberally diſplayed, and ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily blended in this delightful retreat. An enthuſiaſtic admirer of ſcenes like theſe, I had rambled ſome way from the company, when I was followed by Mrs. Laiton to offer her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence on the ſuppoſed loſs, which I had ſuſtained, in the death of Mr. Haly.

               <p>The abſurdity of a cuſtom, authoriſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at a firſt interview to revive the idea of griefs, which time has lulled; perhaps obliter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, is intolerable. To have our enjoyments arreſted by the empty compliments of unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, for no other reaſon, than a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with faſhion is to be treated in a manner, which the laws of humanity forbid.</p>
               <p>We were ſoon joined by the gentlemen, who each ſelected his partner, and the walk was prolonged</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer offered me his arm, which I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted; happy to be relieved from the impertinence of my female companion. We returned to tea, after which the ladies ſung, and played by turns on the Piano Forte; while ſome of the gentlemen accompanied with the flute, the clarinet, and the violin, forming in the whole a very decent concert.

after it, cloſed the evening; when we returned home, delighted with our entertainment and pleaſed with ourſelves and each other.

               <p>YOU aſk me, my friend, whether I am in purſuit of truth, or a lady? I anſwer, both. I hope and truſt they are united; and really expect to find truth and the virtues and graces beſides in a fair form. If you mean by the firſt part of, your queſtion, whether I am ſearching into the ſublimer doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of religion? To these I would by no means be inattentive; but to be honeſt, my ſtudies of that kind have been very much inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted of late. The reſpectable circle of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances with which I am honored here, has rendered my viſits very frequent and numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In one of theſe I was introduced to Miſs Eliza Wharton; a young lady whoſe elegant perſon, accompliſhed mind, and poliſhed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have been much celebrated. Her fame has oft<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032142_0012_0FF153BACA1B14F8"/>
an enthuſiaſtic devotee. No, I mean to act upon juſt and rational principles. Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon to ſettle in an eligible ſituation, if ſuch a companion as I am perſuaded ſhe will make me, may fall to my lot, I ſhall deem myſelf as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as this ſtate of imperfection will admit. She is now reſident at Gen. Richman's. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and his lady are her particular friends. They are warm in her praiſes. They tell me, however, that ſhe is naturally of a gay diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. No matter for that; it is an agreeable quality, where there is diſcretion ſufficient for its regulation. A cheerful friend, much more a cheerful wife is peculiarly necessary to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſtudious and ſedentary life. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the gloom of retirement, and exhilerate the ſpirits depreſſed by intenſe application. She was formerly addreſſed by the late Mr. Haly of Boſton. He was not, it ſeems, the man of her choice; but her parents were extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partial to him, and wiſhed the connection to take place. She, like a dutiful child, ſacrificed her own inclination to their pleaſure, ſo far as to acquieſce in his viſits. This ſhe more eaſily accompliſhed, as his health, which declined from their firſt acquaintance, led her to ſuppoſe, as the event has proved, that he would not live to enter into any laſting engagements. Her father, who died ſome months before him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him to reſide at his houſe, for the benefit of a change of air, agreeably to the advice of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

last illneſs, with all the care and aſſiduity of a nurſe; and with all the ſympathiſing tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſiſter.</p>
               <p>I have had ſeveral opportunities of converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her. She diſcovers an elevated mind, a ready apprehenſion, and an accurate knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the various ſubjects which have been brought into view. I have not yet introduced the favorite ſubject of my heart. Indeed ſhe ſeems ſtudiouſly to avoid noticing any expreſſion which leads towards it. But ſhe must hear it ſoon. I am ſure of the favor and intereſt of the friends with whom ſhe reſides. They have promiſed to ſpeak previouſly in my behalf. I am to call as if accidentally this afternoon, juſt as they are to ride abroad. They are to refer me to Miſs Wharton for entertainment, till their return. What a delightful opportunity for my purpoſe! I am counting the hours, nay, the very moments. Adieu. You ſhall ſoon hear again from your moſt obedient,</p>

Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, flattered, and careſſed; I have cards and compliments in profuſion. But I muſt try to be ſerious; for I have, alas! one ſerious lover. As I promiſed you to be particular in my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſuppoſe I muſt proceed methodically. Yeſterday we had a party to dine. Mr. Boyer was of the number. His attention was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately engroſſed; and I ſoon perceived that every word; every action, and every look was ſtudied to gain my approbation. As he ſat next me at dinner, his aſſiduity and politeneſs were pleaſing; and as we walked together af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, his converſation was improving. Mine was ſentimental and ſedate; perfectly adapted to the taſte of my gallant. Nothing, however, was said particularly expreſſive of his apparent wiſhes. I ſtudiouſly avoided every kind of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032142_0015_0FF1542DD402E108"/>
which might lead to this topic. I wiſh not for a declaration from any one, eſpecially from one whom I could not repulſe and do not intend to encourage at preſent. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſo ſimilar to what I had often heard from a ſimilar character, brought a deceaſed friend to mind, and rendered me somewhat pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. I retired directly after ſupper. Mr. Boyer had juſt taken leave.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Richman came into my chamber as ſhe was paſſing to her own. Excuſe my intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Eliza, ſaid ſhe; I thought I would juſt ſtep in and aſk you if you have paſſed a pleaſant day?</p>
               <p>Perfectly ſo, madam; and I have now retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to protract the enjoyment by recollection. What, my dear, is your opinion of our favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite Mr. Boyer? Declaring him your favorite, madam, is ſufficient to render me partial to him. But to be frank, independent of that, I think him an agreeable man. Your heart, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, is now free? Yes, and I hope it will long remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

You, madam, who have ever known my heart, are ſenſible, that had the Almighty ſpared life, in a certain inſtance, I must have ſacrificed my own happineſs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred their cenſure.

had impoſed on my mind. Let me then enjoy that freedom which I ſo highly prize. Let me have opportunity, unbiaſſed by opinion, to gratify my natural diſpoſition in a participation of thoſe pleaſures which youth and innocence afford. Of ſuch pleaſures, no one, my dear, would wiſh to deprive you.

The round of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable diſſipation is dangerous. A phantom is often purſued, which leaves its deluded votary the real form of wretchedneſs. She ſpoke with an emphaſis, and taking up her candle, wiſhed me a good night. I had not power to return the compliment. Something ſeemingly prophetic in her looks and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, caſt a momentary gloom upon my mind! But I deſpiſe thoſe contracted ideas which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine virtue to a cell. I have no notion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a recluſe.

               <p>I HAD ſcarcely ſeated myſelf at the breakfaſt table this morning, when a ſervant entered with a card of invitation from Major Sanford, requeſting the happineſs of my hand this evening, at a ball, given by Mr. Atkins, about three miles from this. I ſhewed the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to Mrs. Richman, ſaying, I have not much acquaintance with this gentleman, madam; but I ſuppoſe his character ſufficiently reſpectable to warrant an affirmative anſwer. He is a gay man, my dear, to ſay no more, and ſuch are the companions we wiſh, when we join a party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowedly formed for pleaſure. I then ſtepped into my apartment, wrote an anſwer, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the ſervant. When I returned to the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>lour, ſomething diſapprobating appeared in the countenances of both my friends. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored without ſeeming to obſerve, to diſſipate it by chit chat; but they were better pleaſed with each other than with me; and ſoon riſing, walked into the garden, and left me to amuſe myſelf alone. My eyes followed them through the window. Happy pair, ſaid I. Should it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032142_0018_0FF1543BAEB536E0"/>
ever be my fate to wear the hymenial chain, may I be thus united! The pureſt and moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection, the greateſt conſonance of taſte and diſpoſition, and the moſt congenial virtue and wiſhes diſtinguiſh this lovely couple. Health and wealth, with every attendant bleſſing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over their favored dwelling, and ſhed their benign influence without alloy. The conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of exciting their diſpleaſure gave me pain; but I conſoled myſelf with the idea that it was ill founded.</p>
               <p>They ſhould conſider, ſaid I, that they have no ſatisfaction to look for beyond each other.</p>
               <p>There every enjoyment is centered; but I am a poor ſolitary being, who need ſome amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond what I can ſupply myſelf.

But imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, it has proved; and that daſhed with the bitter ranklings of jealousy and ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>But to reſume my narrative. I reached the manſion of my friend about four. I was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably ſtruck with the appearance of a carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032142_0020_0FF15461C9670B20"/>
at the door, as it raiſed an idea of company which might fruſtrate my plan; but ſtill more diſagreeable were my ſenſations, when, on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the parlour, I found Major Sanford evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in a waiting poſture. I was very polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received; and when Eliza entered the room with a brilliance of appearance and gaiety of manner, which I had never before connected with her character, I roſe, as did Major Sanford who offered his hand, and led her to a chair. I forgot to ſit down again, but ſtood transfixed by the pangs of diſappointment. Miſs Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton appeared ſomewhat confuſed; but ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming her vivacity, deſired me to be ſeated; inquired after my health, and made ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon place remarks on the weather. Then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologizing for leaving me, gave her hand again <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Major Sanford, who had previouſly riſen, and reminded her that the time and their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made it neceſſary to leave the good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; which, indeed, they both appeared very willing to do. General Richman and lady took every method in their power to remove my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin, and atone for the abſence of my fair one, but ill did they ſucceed. They <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> me that Miſs Wharton had not the moſt diſtant idea of my viſiting there, this afternoon; much leſs of the deſign of my viſit; that for ſome months together, ſhe had been lately confined by the ſickneſs of Mr. Haly, whom ſhe attended dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of his laſt illneſs; which confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had eventually increaſed her deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032142_0021_0FF1548ED5DC4870"/>
her natural diſpoſition for gaiety. She had, however, they ſaid, an excellent heart and reflecting mind, a great ſhare of ſenſibility, and a temper peculiarly formed for the enjoyments of ſocial life. But this gentleman, madam, who is her gallant this evening—is his character unexceptionable? Will a lady of delicacy aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate with an immoral, not to ſay profligate man? The rank and fortune of Major Sanford, said Mrs. Richman, procure him reſpect.</p>
               <p>His ſpecious manners render him accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in public company; but I muſt own that he is not the perſon with whom I wiſh my cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin to be connected, even for a moment. She never conſulted me ſo little on any ſubject as on that of his card this morning. Before I had time to object, ſhe diſmiſſed the ſervant; and I forbore to deſtroy her expected happineſs, by acquainting her with my diſapprobation of her partner. Her omiſſion was not deſign; it was juvenile indiſcretion. We muſt, my dear ſir, continued ſhe, look with a candid eye on ſuch excentricities. Faults, not foibles, require the ſeverity of cenſure. Far, madam, be it from me to cenſure any conduct, which as yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Miſs Wharton; ſhe has too great an intereſt in my heart to admit of that.</p>
               <p>We now went into more general converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Tea was ſerved; and I ſoon after took leave. General Richman, however, inſiſted on my dining with him on Thurſday, which I promiſed. And here I am again over head
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032142_0022_0FF1546F7557CAD0"/>
and ears in the hypo. A diſeaſe, you will ſay, peculiar to ſtudents. I believe it peculiar to lovers; and with that claſs I muſt now rank myſelf, though I did not know, until this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I was ſo much engaged as I find I really am. I knew, indeed, that I was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with this amiable girl; that I was intereſted in her favor; that I was happier in her company than any where elſe, with innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other circumſtances, which would have told me the truth, had I examined them. But be that as it may; I hope, and truſt that I am, and ever ſhall be a reaſonable creature; and not ſuffer my judgment to be miſled by the operations of a blind paſſion.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now lay aſide this ſubject, endeavor to diveſt even my imagination of the charmer, and return until Thurſday, to the contemplation of thoſe truths and duties, which have a happy tendency to calm the jarring elements which compoſe our mortal frame. Adieu.</p>

muſt be the man who claims admiſſion to her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. But I fancy this young lady is a coquette; and if ſo, I ſhall avenge my ſex, by retaliating the miſchiefs, ſhe meditates againſt us. Not that I have any ill deſigns; but only to play off her own artillery, by uſing a little unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gallantry. And let her beware of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. A young clergyman came in at Gen. Richman's yeſterday, while I was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Eliza, who was much more cordially received by the general and his lady, than was your humble ſervant: but I lay that up.</p>
               <p>When ſhe entered the room, an air of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al embarraſment was evident. The lady recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her aſſurance much more eaſily than the gentleman. I am juſt going to ride, and ſhall make it in my way to call and inquire after the health of my dulcinea. Therefore, adieu for the preſent.</p>

               <p>I AM not ſo happy to day in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of laſt evening's entertainment, as I was in the enjoyment.</p>
               <p>The explanation which I promiſed you from Mrs. Richman yeſterday, I could not obtain. When I went down to dinner, ſome friends of General Richman's had accidentally dropped in, which precluded all particular converſation. I retired ſoon so dreſs, and ſaw Mrs. Richman no more, till I was informed that Major Sanford waited for me. But I was ſurpriſed on going into the parlour to find Mr. Boyer there. I bluſhed and ſtammered; but I know not why; for certain I am, that I neither love nor fear the good man yet, whatever I may do ſome future day. I would not be underſtood that I do not reſpect and eſteem him; for I do both. But theſe are calm paſſions, which ſooth rather than agitate the mind. It was not the conſciouſneſs of any impropriety of conduct; for I was far from feeling any. The entertainment for which I was prepared was ſuch as virtue would not diſapprove, and my gallant was a man of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032142_0026_0FF1545972509998"/>
fortune, faſhion, and for ought I knew, of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſhed character.</p>
               <p>But Mr. Boyer was much more diſconcerted than myſelf. Indeed he did not recover his philoſophy while I ſtaid. I believe, by ſome hints I have received ſince, that he had ſome particular views, in which he was diſappointed.</p>
               <p>Our ball had every charm which could ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ball delightful. My partner was all eaſe, politeneſs, and attention; and your friend was as much flattered and careſſed as variety itſelf could wiſh. We returned to General Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's about two. Major Sanford aſked leave to call and inquire after my health, this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I am now expecting him. I roſe to breakfaſt. The late hour of retiring to reſt had not depreſſed, but rather exhilerated my ſpirits. My friends were waiting for me in the parlor. They received me ſociably, inquired after my health, my laſt evening's entertainment, the company, &amp;c. When, after a little pauſe, Mrs. Richman ſaid, and how do you like Major Sanford, Eliza? Very well indeed, madam: I think him a finiſhed gentleman. Will you, who are a connoiſieur, allow him that title? No, my dear: in my opinion, he falls far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; ſince he is deficient in one of the great eſſentials of the character, and that is, <hi>virtue.</hi> I am ſurpriſed, ſaid I: but how has he incurred ſo ſevere a cenſure? By being a profeſſed liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; by having but too ſucceſsfully practiſed the arts of ſeduction; by triumphing in the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of innocence and the peace of families!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032142_0027_0FF1548D301FD6E8"/>
O, why was I not informed of this before? But, perhaps theſe are old affairs; the effects of juvenile folly; crimes of which he may have repented, and which charity ought to obliterate. No, my dear, they are recent facts; facts which he dares not deny; facts for which he ought to be baniſhed from all virtuous ſociety. I ſhould have intimated this to you before, but your precipitate acceptance of his invitation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of an opportunity, until it was too late to prevent your going with him; and we thought it beſt to protract your enjoyment as long as poſſible, not doubting but your virtue and delicacy would, in future, guard you againſt the like deception.</p>
               <p>Muſt I then become an avowed prude at once; and refuſe him admiſſion, if he call, in compliance with the cuſtomary forms? By no means. I am ſenſible, that even the falſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of the world muſt be complied with in a degree. But a man of Major Sanford's art can eaſily diſtinguiſh between a forbidding, and an encouraging reception. The former may, in this caſe, be given without any breach of the rules of politeneſs. Aſtoniſhed, and mortified, I knew not what further to ſay. I had been ſo pleaſed with the man, that I wiſhed to plead in his favor; but virtue and prudence forbade. I therefore roſe and retired. He is this moment, I am told, below ſtairs. So that I muſt bid you adieu, until the next poſt.</p>

               <p>UPON cloſing my laſt, I walked down, and found Major Sanford alone. He met me at the door of the parlor; and taking my hand with an air of affectionate tenderneſs, led me to a ſeat, and took one beſide me. I believe the gloom of ſuſpicion had not entirely forſaken my brow. He appeared, however, not to notice it; but after the compliments of the day had paſſed, entered into an eaſy and agreeable converſation on the pleaſures of ſociety: a converſation perfectly adapted to my taſte, and calculated to diſſipate my chagrin, and paſs the time imperceptibly. He inquired the place of my native abode; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him, he ſaid he had thoughts of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing the ſeat of Capt. Pribble, in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, for his reſidence; and could he be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of my ſociety and friendſhip, his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be fixed. I anſwered his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only by a ſlight bow. He took leave, and I retired to dreſs for the day, being engaged to accompany my couſin to dine at Mr. Laurence's,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032142_0029_0FF153D3A7B27DA8"/>
a gentleman of fortune and faſhion, In this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity. Mr. Laurence has but one daughter, heireſs to a large eſtate, with an agreeable form, but a countenance, which to me, indicates not much ſoul. I was ſurpriſed in the afternoon to ſee Major Sanford alight at the gate. He entered with the familiarity of an old acquaintance; and, after accoſting each of the company, told me, with a low bow, that he did not expect the happineſs of ſeeing me again ſo ſoon. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his compliment with a conſcious awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs. Mrs. Richman's morning lecture ſtill rung in my head; and her watchful eye now traced every turn of mine, and every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the major's. Indeed, his aſſiduity was painful to me; yet I found it impoſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage myſelf a moment from him, till the cloſe of the day brought our carriage to the door; when he handed me in, and preſſing my hand to his lips, retired.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay about this extraordinary man? Shall I own to you, my friend, that he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me? His perſon, his manners, his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all combine to charm my fancy; and to my lively imagination, ſtrew the path of life with flowers. What a pity, my dear Lucy, that the graces and, virtues are not oftner united!

               <p>WELL, Charles, I have been man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeuvring to day, a little revengefully. That, you will ſay, is out of character. So baleful a paſſion does not eaſily find admiſſion among thoſe ſofter ones, which you well know I cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. However, I am a mere Proteus, and can aſſume any ſhape that will beſt anſwer my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>I called this forenooon, as I told you I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at Gen. Richman's. I waited ſome time in the parlor alone, before Eliza appeared; and when ſhe did appear, the diſtant reſerve of her manner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the penſiveneſs of her counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance convinced me that ſhe had been vexed, and I doubted not but Peter Sanford was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Her wiſe couſin, I could have ſworn, had been giving her a detail of the vices of her gallant; and warning her againſt the danger of aſſociating with him in future. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I took no notice of any alteration in her behavior; but entered with the utmoſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetiouſneſs into a converſation which I thought
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032142_0031_0FF15394AD05F488"/>
moſt to her taſte. By degrees, ſhe aſſumed her uſual vivacity; cheerfulneſs and good humor again animated her countenance. I tarried as long as decency would admit. She having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that they were to dine at my friend Lawrence's, I caught at t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s information; and determined to follow them, and teaze the jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mrs. Richman, by playing off all the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry I was maſter of in her preſence.</p>
               <p>I went, and ſucceeded to the utmoſt of my wiſhes, as I read in the vexation, viſible in the one; and the eaſe and attention diſplayed by the other. I believe too, that I have charmed the eye at leaſt, of the amiable Eliza. Indeed, Charles, ſhe is a fine girl. I think it would hurt my conſcience to wound her mind or reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Were I diſpoſed to marry, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe would make an excellent wife; but that you know is no part of my plan, ſo long as I can keep out of the nooſe. Whenever I do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to be ſhackled, it muſt be from a neceſſity of mending my fortune. This girl would be far from doing that. However, I am pleaſed with her acquaintance, and mean not to abuſe her credulity and good nature, if I can help it.</p>

               <p>THE heart of your friend is again beſieged. Whether it will ſurrender to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants or not, I am unable at preſent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. Sometimes I think of becoming a predeſtinarian, and ſubmitting implicitly to fate, without any exerciſe of free will; but, as mine ſeems to be a wayward one, I would counteract the operations of it, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Richman told me this morning, that ſhe hoped I ſhould be as agreeably entertained this afternoon, as I had been the preceding; that ſhe expected Mr. Boyer to dine, and take tea; and doubted not but he would be as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and ſincere to me, if not as gay and polite as the gentleman who obtruded his civilities yeſterday. I replied that I had no reaſon to doubt the ſincerity of the one, or the other, having never put them to the teſt, nor did I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine I ever ſhould. Your friends, Eliza, ſaid ſhe, would be very happy to ſee you united to a man of Mr. Boyer's worth; and ſo agreeably ſettled, as he has a proſpect of being. I hope,

ſaid I, that my friends are not ſo weary of my company, as to wiſh to diſpoſe of me. I am too happy in my preſent connections to quit them for new ones. Marriage is the tomb of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It appears to me a very ſelfiſh ſtate. Why do people, in general, as ſoon as they are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, centre all their cares, their concerns, and pleaſures in their own families? former acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are neglected or forgotten. The tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ties between friends are weakened, or diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and benevolence itſelf moves in a very lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited ſphere. It is the glory of the marriage ſtate, ſhe rejoined, to refine, by circumſcribing our enjoyments. Here we can repoſe in ſafety.</p>

                  <l>"The friendſhips of the world are oft</l>
                  <l>Confed'racies in vice, or leagues in pleaſure:</l>

                  <l>And ſuch a friendſhip ends not but with life."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>True, we cannot always pay that attention to former aſſociates, which we may wiſh; but the little community which we ſuperintend is quite as important an object; and certainly renders us more beneficial to the pubic. True benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, though it may change its objects, is not limited by time or place. Its effects are the ſame, and aided by a ſecond ſelf, are rendered more diffuſive and ſalutary.</p>
               <p>Some pleaſantry paſſed, and we retired to dreſs. When ſummoned to dinner, I found Mr. Boyer below. If what is ſometimes ſaid be true, that love is diffident, reſerved, and unaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032142_0034_0FF1547FA5232038"/>
this man muſt be tinctured with it. Theſe ſymptoms were viſible in his deportment when I entered the room. However, he ſoon recovered himself, and the converſation took a general turn. The feſtive board was crowned with ſociability, and we found in reality, "The feaſt of reaſon, and the flow of ſoul." After we roſe from table, a walk in the garden was propoſed, an amuſement we are all peculiarly fond of. Mr. Boyer offered me his arm. When at a ſufficient diſtance from our company, he begged leave to congratulate himſelf on having an opportunity which he had ardently deſired for ſome time, of declaring to me his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and of ſoliciting an intereſt in my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; or, if he might be allowed the term, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. I replied, that, Sir, is indeed laying claim to an important intereſt. I believe you muſt ſubſtitute ſome more indifferent epithet for the preſent. Well then, ſaid he, if it muſt be ſo, let it be eſteem, or friendſhip. Indeed, Sir, ſaid I, you are intitled to them both. Merit has always a ſhare in that bank; and I know of none, who has a larger claim on that ſcore, than Mr. Boyer. I ſuppoſe my manner was hardly ſerious enough for what he conſidered a weighty cauſe. He was a little diſconcerted; but ſoon regaining his preſence of mind, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated me, with an air of earneſtneſs, to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age his ſuit, to admit his addreſſes, and, if poſſible, to reward his love. I told him, that this was rather a ſudden affair to me; and that
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032142_0035_0FF15443CC2A5D58"/>
I could not anſwer him without conſideration. Well then, ſaid he, take what time you think proper, only relieve my ſuſpenſe, as ſoon as may be. Shall I viſit you again to morrow? O, not ſo ſoon, ſaid I. Next Monday, I believe will be early enough; I will endeavor to be at home. He thanked me even for that favor, recommended himſelf once more to my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and we walked towards the company, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with them to the houſe, and he ſoon took leave. I immediately retired to write this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I ſhall cloſe, without a ſingle obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation on the ſubject, until I know your opinion.</p>

you will exerciſe it yourſelf: but I am a little apprehenſive that your fancy will miſlead you. Methinks I can gather from your letters, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for this Major Sanford. But he is a rake, my dear friend; and can a lady of your delicacy and refinement, think of forming a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with a man of that character? I hope not. Nay, I am confident you do not. You mean on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exhibit a few more girliſh airs, before you turn matron. But I am perſuaded, if you wiſh to lead down the dance of life with regularity, you will not find a more excellent partner than Mr. Boyer. Whatever you can reaſonably expect in a lover, huſband, or friend, you may perceive to be united in this worthy man. His taſte is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debauched, his manners not vitiated, his morals uncorrupted. His ſituation in life is, perhaps, as elevated as you have a right to claim. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give my plainneſs, Eliza. It is the taſk of friendſhip, ſometimes to tell diſagreeable truths. I know your ambition is to make a diſtinguiſhed figure in the firſt claſs of poliſhed ſociety; to ſhine in the gay circle of faſhionable amuſements, and to bear off the palm amidſt the votaries of pleaſure. But theſe are fading honors, unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory enjoyments; incapable of gratifying thoſe immortal principles of reaſon and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, which have been implanted in your mind by nature; aſſiduouſly cultivated by the beſt of parents, and exerted, I truſt, by yourſelf. Let me adviſe you then, in conducting this affair; an affair, big, perhaps, with your future ſate, to lay aſide thoſe

After the firſt compliments were over, he ſeemed eager to improve the opportun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to enter directly on the ſubject of his preſent viſit. It is needleſs for me to recite to you, who have long been acquainted with the whole proceſs of courtſhip, the declarations, propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proteſtations, intreaties, looks, words and actions of a lover. They are, I believe, much the ſame, in the whole ſex, allowing for their different diſpoſitions, educations, and characters. But you are impatient I know for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. You have haſtily peruſed the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, and are ſtraining your eye forward to my part of the farce; for ſuch it may prove after all. Well then, not to play too long with the curioſity, which I know to be excited, and actuated by real friendſhip, I will relieve it. I think you would have been pleaſed to have ſeen my gravity, on this important occaſion. With all the candor and frankneſs which I was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aſſuming, I thus anſwered his long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, to which I had liſtened, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting him. Self-knowledge, ſir, that moſt important of all ſciences, I have yet to learn. Such have been my ſituations in life, and the natural volatility of my temper, that I have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032142_0039_0FF153A11453CBE0"/>
looked but little into my own heart, in regard to its future wiſhes and views. From a ſcene of conſtraint and confinement, ill ſuited to my years and inclination, I have juſt launched into ſociety. My heart beats high in expectation of its fancied joys. My ſanguine imagination paints, in alluring colors, the charms of youth and freedom, regulated by virtue and innocence. Of theſe, I wiſh to partake. While I own my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under obligations for the eſteem which you are pleaſed to profeſs for me, and in return, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that neither your perſon nor man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are diſagreeable to me, I recoil at the thought of immediately forming a connection, which muſt confine me to the duties of domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic life, and make me dependent for happineſs, perhaps too, for ſubſiſtence, upon a claſs of people, who will claim the right of ſcrutiniſing every part of my conduct; and by cenſuring thoſe foibles, which I am conſcious of not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prudence to avoid, may render me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely miſerable. While, therefore, I receive your viſits, and cultivate towards you ſentiments of friendſhip and eſteem, I would not have you conſider me as confined to your ſociety, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligated to a future connection. Our ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance renders it impoſſible for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide what the operations of my mind may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be. You muſt either quit the ſubject, or leave me to the exerciſe of my free will, which perhaps may coincide with your preſent wiſhes. Madam, ſaid he, far is the wiſh from me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032142_0040_0FF153B16462A6C8"/>
your perſon or mind. In your breaſt I will repoſe my cauſe. It ſhall be my ſtudy to merit a return of affection; and I doubt not, but generoſity and honor will influence your conduct towards me. I expect ſoon to ſettle among a generous and enlightened people, where I flatter myſelf I ſhall be exempt from thoſe difficulties, and embarraſſments, to which too many of my brethren are ſubject. The local ſituation is agreeable, the ſociety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and poliſhed; and if, in addition, I may obtain that felicity which you are formed to beſtow, in a family connection, I ſhall be happy indeed.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke with emphaſis. The tear of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſparkled in his eye. I involuntarily gave him my hand, which he preſſed with ardor to his lips. Then riſing, he walked to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to conceal his emotion. I rang the bell and ordered tea; during, and after which, we ſhared that ſocial, converſe, which is the true zeſt of life, and which, I am perſuaded, none but virtuous minds can participate. General Richman and lady returned with the ſhades of the evening. The penetrating eye of my couſin traced in <hi>our</hi> countenances the progreſs of the cauſe, and the ſmile of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion animated <hi>hers.</hi> Mr. Boyer aſked the favor of my company to ride to morrow morning, which was granted. He tarried to ſupper, and took his leave. I retired immediately to my chamber, to which I was followed by Mrs.

Richman. I related to her the converſation, and the encouragement which I had given to Mr. Boyer. She was pleaſed; but inſiſted that I ſhould own myſelf ſomewhat engaged to him. This, I told her I ſhould never do to any man, before the indiſſoluble knot was tied. That, ſaid I, will be time enough to reſign my freedom. She replied that I had wrong ideas of freedom, and matrimony; but ſhe hoped that Mr. Boyer would happily rectify them.</p>
               <p>I have now, my dear friend, given you an account of my preſent ſituation, and leave you to judge for yourſelf concerning it. Write me your opinion, and believe me ever yours.</p>

               <p>I CONGRATULATE you, my dear Eliza, on the ſtability of your conduct towards Mr. Boyer. Purſue the ſyſtem which you have adopted, and I dare ſay, that happineſs will crown your future days. You are indeed very
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032142_0042_0FF153B9271F4628"/>
tenacious of your freedom, as you call it; but that is a play about words. A man of Mr. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer's honor and good ſenſe will never abridge any privileges which virtue can claim.</p>
               <p>When do you return to embelliſh our ſociety, here? I am impatient to ſee you, and likewiſe this amiable man. I am much intereſted in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. By the way, I am told that Major Sanford has been to look at the ſeat of Captain Pribble, which is upon ſale. It is reported that he will prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably purchaſe it. Many of our gentry are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the proſpect of ſuch a neighbor. As an accompliſhed gentleman, ſay they, he will be an agreeable addition to our ſocial parties; and as a man of property, and public ſpirit, he will be an advantage to the town; but, from what I have heard of him, I am far from ſuppoſing him a deſirable acquiſition in either of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. A man of a vicious character cannot be a good member of ſociety. In order to that, his principles and practice muſt be uncorrupted: in his morals, at leaſt, he muſt be a man of prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and honor. Of theſe qualifications, if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, this gallant of yours cannot boaſt. But I ſhall not ſet up for a cenſor. I hope nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you nor I ſhall have much connection with him. My ſwain intereſtſ himſelf very much in your affairs. You will poſſibly think him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent; but I give his curioſity a foſter name. Should I own to you that I place great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his integrity and honor, you would, perhaps, laugh at my weakneſs; but, my dear,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032142_0043_0FF153E8D6DAD098"/>
I have pride enough to keep me above coquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or prudery; and diſcretion enough, I hope, to ſecure me from the errors of both. With him I have determined to walk the future round of life. What folly then would it be to affect reſerve and diſtance, relative to an affair in which I have ſo much intereſt? Not that I am going to betray your ſecrets. Theſe I have no right to divulge; but I muſt be the judge what may, and what may not be communicated. I am very much preſſed for an early day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation; but I ſhall not liſten to a requeſt of that kind, till your return. Such is my regard for you, that a union of love would be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if friendſhip attended not the rites. Adieu.</p>

motion. We have not tried any yet, however. We had a lovely tour this forenoon; were out three long hours, and returned to dinner in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer informed me that he ſhould ſet out to morrow morning, for his future reſidence, and ſoon put on the ſacred bands. He ſolicited an epiſtolary correſpondence, at the ſame time, as an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>We were ſomewhat interrupted in our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential intercourſe, in the afternoon, by the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of Major Sanford. I cannot ſay that I was not agreeably relieved. So ſweet a repaſt, for ſeveral hours together, was rather ſickening to my taſte. My enamorato looked a little morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the cheerful reception which I gave the intruder, and joined not ſo placidly in the ſocial converſation, as I could have wiſhed.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Boyer, after the Major took leave, preſſed me to give him ſome aſſurance of my conſtancy, I only reminded him of the terms of our engagement.

               <p>DO you know, Charles, that I have commenced lover? I was always a general one; but now I ſomewhat particular. I ſhall be the more intereſted, as I am likely to meet with difficulties; and it is the glory of a rake, as well as a chriſtian to combat obſtacles. This ſame Eliza, of whom I have told you, has really made more impreſſion on my heart, than I was aware of; or than the ſex, take them as they riſe, are wont to do. But ſhe is beſieged by a prieſt (a likely lad though.) I know not how it is,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032142_0047_0FF153EC5118A1F8"/>
but they are commonly ſucceſsful with the girls, even the gayeſt of them. This one, too, has the intereſt of all her friends, as I am told. I called yeſterday, at General Richman's, and found this pair together, apparently too happy in each other's ſociety for my wiſhes. I muſt own, that I felt a glow of jealouſy, which I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced before; and vowed revenge for the pain it gave me, though but momentary. Yet Eliza's reception of me was viſibly cordial; nay, I fancied my company as pleaſing to her as that which ſhe had before. I tarried not long, but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

O, I have another plan in my head; a plan of neceſſity, which, you know, is the mother of invention. It is this: I am very much courted and careſſed by the family of Mr. Lawrence, a man of large property in this neighborhood. He has only one child; a daughter, with whom I imagine the old folks intend to ſhackle me in the bonds of matrimony. The girl looks very well. She has no ſoul though, that I can diſcover. She is heireſs, nevertheleſs, to a great fortune; and that is all the ſoul I wiſh for in a wiſe. In truth, Charles, I know of no other way to mend my circumſtances.

But it will never do. If my fortune, or hers were better, I would riſk a union; but as they are, no idea of the kind can be admitted.

               <p>I FIND the ideas of ſobriety, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſolitude, I have been cultivating for three days paſt, ſomewhat deranged by the interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a viſitor, with whom, I know, you will not be pleaſed. It is no other than Major San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. I was walking alone in the garden yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, when he ſuddenly appeared to my view. How happy am I, ſaid he, ſeizing my hand, in this opportunity of finding you alone; an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, Miſs Wharton, which I muſt improve in expatiating on a theme, that fills my heart, and ſolely animates my frame.</p>
               <p>I was ſtartled at his impetuoſity, and diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his freedom. Withdrawing my hand, I told him, that my retirement was ſacred. He bowed ſubmiſſively; begged pardon for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion, alledged, that he found no body but the ſervants in the houſe; that they informed him, I was alone in the garden, which intelligence was too pleaſing for him to conſult any forms of ceremony for the regulation of his conduct. He then went on rhapſodically to declare his paſſion, his ſuſpicions, that I was forming a
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032142_0050_0FF1544E90EEEE30"/>
connection with Mr. Boyer, which would effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually deſtroy all his hopes of future happineſs. He painted the reſtraint, the confinement, the embarraſſments to which a woman, connected with a man of Mr. Boyer's profeſſion, muſt be ſubjected; however agreeable his perſon might be. He aſked if my generous mind could ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to cares and perplexities like theſe; whether I could not find greater ſources of enjoyment in a more elevated ſphere of life, or ſhare pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures better ſuited to my genius and diſpoſition, even in a ſingle ſtate? I liſtened to him invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily. My heart did not approve his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but my ear was charmed with his rhet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oric, and my fancy captivated by his addreſs.</p>
               <p>He invited my confidence, by the moſt ardent profeſſions of friendſhip, and labored to remove my ſuſpicions by vows of ſincerity. I was induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his importunity, gradually to diſcloſe the ſtate of affairs between Mr. Boyer and myſelf. He liſtened eagerly; wiſhed not, he ſaid, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence me unduly; but if I were not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe engaged, might he preſume to ſolicit a place in my friendſhip and eſteem; be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enjoy my ſociety, to viſit me as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and to attend my excurſions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, as a brother, if no more? I replied, that I was a penſioner of friendſhip, at preſent; that my friends were extremely refined in their notions of propriety, and that I had no right to receive viſitants independent of them. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, madam, ſaid he. You intimate that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:032142_0051_0FF1541297DCDB30"/>
my company is not agreeable to them: but I know not why. Surely my rank in life is as elevated; and my knowledge of, and acceptance in the world, are as extenſive as General Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's. I hope, ſaid I, ſince we are engaged in the converſation, that you will excuſe my frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if I tell you, that the underſtanding and virtue of this worthy couple, induce them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to rank, to beſtow their eſteem wherever it is merited. I cannot ſay that you are not a ſharer. Your own heart can beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, whether upon their principles, you are, or not! He appeared mortified, and chagrined; and we had walked ſome diſtance without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing a word, or a look. At laſt, he rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I plead guilty to the charge, madam, which they have undoubtedly brought againſt me, of imprudence and folly in many particulars; yet of malignancy and vice I am innocent. Brought up in affluence; innured from my infancy to the gratification of every paſſion; the indulgence of every wiſh, it is not ſtrange, that a life of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and gaiety ſhould prove alluring to a youthful mind, which had no care but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure what it deemed enjoyment. In this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit I have perhaps deviated from the rigid rules of diſcretion, and the harſher laws of morality.</p>
               <p>But let the veil of charity be drawn over my faults; let the eye of candor impartially exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine my preſent behavior; let the kind and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ient hand of friendſhip aſſiſt in directing my future ſtepſ; and, perhaps, I may not prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032142_0052_0FF153AD078A7B20"/>
of aſſociating with the reſpectable inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of this happy manſion; for ſuch I am ſure it muſt be, while honored with Miſs Wharton's preſence. But, circumſtanced as you and I are, at preſent, I will not ſue for your attention, as a lover; but reſt contented, if poſſible, with that ſhare of kindneſs, and regard, which your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence may afford me as a friend. I bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in approbation of his reſolution. He preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my hand with ardor to his lips; and at that inſtant General Richman entered the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. He approached us cheerfully, offered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford his hand with apparent cordiality, and told us pleaſantly, that he hoped he ſhould not be conſidered as an intruder. By no means, ſir, ſaid Major Sanford. It is I who have incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that imputation. I called this afternoon to pay you my reſpects; when being informed that you and your lady were abroad, and that Miſs Wharton was in the garden, I took the liberty to invade her retirement. She has graciouſly forgiven my crime, and I was juſt affixing the ſeal to my pardon as you entered.</p>
               <p>We then returned into the houſe. Mrs. Richman received us politely. During tea, the converſation turned on literary ſubjects, in which I cannot ſay that the Major bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After he was gone, Mrs. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſaid, I hope you have been agreeably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, Miſs Wharton? I did not chuſe my company, madam, ſaid I. Nor, ſaid ſee, did you refuſe it, I preſume. Would you not have
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032142_0053_0FF153F7233AE008"/>
me reſpect the rights of hoſpitality towards your gueſts, when you are abſent, madam? If you had acted from that motive, I own my obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you, my dear; but even that conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation can hardly reconcile me to the ſacrifice of time, which you have made to the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſeducer. I hope, madam, you do not think me an object of ſeduction! I do not think you ſeducible; nor was Richardſon's Clariſſa, till ſhe made herſelf the victim, by her own indiſcretion. Pardon me, Eliza, this is a ſecond Lovelace. I am alarmed by his artful intruſions. His inſinuating attention to you are characteriſtic of the man. Come, I preſume you are not intereſted to keep his ſecrets, if you know them. Will you give me a little ſketch of his converſation? Moſt willingly, ſaid I; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, related the whole. When I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, ſhe ſhook her head, and replied, beware, my friend, of his arts. Your own heart is too ſincere to ſuſpect treachery and diſſimulation in another; but ſuffer not your ear to be charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſyren voice of flattery; nor your eye to be caught by the phantom of gaiety and pleaſure. Remember your engagements to Mr. Boyer. Let ſincerity and virtue be your guides, and they will lead you to happineſs and peace. She waited not for an anſwer, but immediately riſing, begged leave to retire, alledging that ſhe was fatigued. Gen. Richman accompanied her, and I haſtened to my apartment, where I have written thus far, and ſhall ſend it on for your

I am again inportuned to liſten to the voice of love; again called upon to accept the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of a gentleman of merit and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. You will know the character of the man, when I tell you, it is Mr. Boyer. But his ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in life! I dare not enter it. My diſpoſition is not calculated for that ſphere. There are duties ariſing from the ſtation, which I fear I ſhould not be able to fulfil; cares and reſtraints to which I could not ſubmit. <hi>This</hi> man is not diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me; but if I muſt enter the connubial ſtate, are there not <hi>others,</hi> who may be equally pleaſing in their perſons, and whoſe profeſſion may be more conformable to my taſte?

               <p>HOW welcome to me, my dear Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, are the tidings of your return? My widowed heart has mourned your abſence, and languiſhed for the company of its now, deareſt connection. When ſtript of one dependence, the mind natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally collects, and reſts itſelf in another. Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death deprived me, for a while, of every enjoyment. But a reviving ſenſe of the duties which I owed to a riſing family, rouſed me from the lethargy of grief. In my cares I found an alleviation of my ſorrows. The expanding vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of my children ſoothed and exhilerated my drooping ſpirits; and my attention to their ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation, and intereſt, was amply rewarded by their proficiency and duty. In them, every hope, every pleaſure now centres. They are the axis on which revolves the temporal felicity of their mother. Judge then, my dear, how anxiouſly I muſt watch, how ſolicitouſly I muſt regard every circumſtance which relates to their welfare and proſperity! Exquiſitely alive to theſe ſenſations, your letter awakens my hopes
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032142_0057_0FF153F1119582B8"/>
and my fears. As you are young and charming, a thouſand dangers lurk unſeen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you. I wiſh you to find a friend and protector, worthy of being rewarded by your love and your ſociety. Such a one, I think, Mr. Boyer will prove. I am, therefore, ſorry, ſince there can be no other, that his profeſſion ſhould be an objection in your mind. You ſay, that I have experienced the ſcenes of trial, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that ſtation. I have, indeed; and I will tell you the reſult of this experience. It is, that I have found it replete with happineſs. No claſs of ſociety has domeſtic enjoyment more at command, than clergymen. Their circumſtances are generally a decent compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. They are removed alike from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing cares of want, and from the diſtracting parade of wealth. They are reſpected by all ranks, and partakers of the beſt company. With regard to its being a dependent ſituation, what one is not ſo? Are we not all links in the great chain of ſociety, ſome more, ſome leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; but each upheld by others, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the confederated whole? In whatever ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation we are placed, our greater or leſs degree of happineſs muſt be derived from ourſelves.

There was a Mr. Laurence, with his lady and daughter, and a certain Major Sanford, at the houſe. The latter, I believe, in the modern ſenſe of the phraſe, <hi>is much of a gentleman,</hi> that is, a man of ſhow and faſhion.</p>
               <p>Miſs Wharton aſked me, when I ſhould leave town, and when I ſhould return, or have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of conveyance to Hampſhire? I told her I ſhould write by the next poſt, and if ſhe had any commands, would be happy to execute them. She would ſend a line to her friend, ſhe ſaid, if I would take the trouble to incloſe it in my letter. I readily conſented; and told her, that I would call and receive her favor to mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row morning. This chit-chat was a little aſide, but I could not but obſerve, that the foreſaid Major Sanford had dropped his part in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the reſt of the company, and was attending to us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he endeavored to conceal his attention, by looking careleſsly over a play, which lay on the window by him. Yet he evidently watched every word and action of Miſs Wharton, as if he were really intereſted in her movements.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid ſhe has many admirers, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it very poſſible that this may be one of them; though, truly, I do not think that ſhe would eſteem ſuch a conqueſt any great honor. I now joined in the general topic of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was politics. Mrs. Richman and Miſs Wharton judiciouſly, yet modeſtly bore a part; while the other ladies amuſed themſelves
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032142_0062_0FF153FBE0C701A8"/>
with Major Sanford, who was making his ſage remarks on the play, which he ſtill kept in his hand. General Richman at length obſerved, that we had formed into parties. Major San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, upon this, laid aſide his book. Miſs Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſimpered; and looked as if ſhe was well pleaſed with being in a party with ſo fine a man; while her mother replied, that ſhe never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with politics; ſhe thought they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ladies. Miſs Wharton and I, ſaid Mrs. Richman, muſt beg leave to differ from you, madam. We think ourſelves intereſted in the welfare and proſperity of our country; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap> rights, but we ſhall feel for the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and ſafety of our friends and connections, who are thus employed. If the community flouriſh and enjoy health and freedom, ſhall we not ſhare in the happy effects? if it be oppreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſturbed, ſhall we not endure our proportion of the evil? Why then ſhould the love of our country be a maſculine paſſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? Why ſhould government, which involves the peace and order of the ſociety, of which we are a part, be wholly excluded from our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation? Mrs. Laurence made ſome ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and waved the ſubject. The gentlemen applauded Mrs. Richman's ſentiments as truly

               <p>I RESUME my pen, having juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Gen.

I can bear ſuch neglect, in this caſe, as I have been alike intereſted myſelf.</p>
               <p>I went to Gen. Richman's at twelve o'clock. About a mile from thence, upon turning a corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I obſerved a gentleman and lady on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, ſome way before me, riding a very mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate pace, and ſeemingly in cloſe converſation.

I kept at the ſame diſtance from them, till I ſaw them ſtop at the General's gate. I then put on, and coming up with them, juſt as they alighted, and was ſurpriſed to find them no other than Major Sanford and Miſs Wharton. They were both a little diſconcerted at my ſalutation; I know not why. Miſs Wharton invited him in; but he declined, being engaged to dine. Gen. Richman received us at the door. As I hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſs Wharton in, he obſerved jocoſely, that ſhe had changed company. Yes ſir, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, more than once, ſince I went out, as you doubtleſs obſerved. I was not aware, ſaid Mrs. Richman, that Major Sanford was to be of your party to day. It was quite acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, madam, ſaid Miſs Wharton. Miſs Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and I had agreed laſt evening, to take a little airing, this forenoon. A young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a relation of her's, who is making them a viſit, was to attend us. We had not rode more than two miles, when we were overtaken by Major Sanford, who very politely aſked leave to join our party. Miſs Laurence very readily conſented; and we had a very ſociable ride. The fineneſs of the day induced me to protract the enjoyment of it abroad; but Miſs Laurence declined riding ſo far as I propoſed, as ſhe had engaged company to dine. We therefore part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till evening, when we are to ineet again. What, another engagement! ſaid Mrs. Richman. Only to the aſſembly, madam.

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR favor of the 4th inſt. came to hand yeſterday. I received it with pleaſure, and embrace this early opportunity of contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my part to a correſpondence, tending to promote a friendly and ſocial intercourſe. An epiſtolary communication between the ſexes has been with ſome, a ſubject of ſatire and cenſure; but unjuſtly, in my opinion. With perſons of refinement and information, it may be a ſource of entertainment and utility. The knowledge and maſculine virtues of your ſex may be ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and rendered more diffuſive by the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs, vivacity, and docility of ours; drawn forth and exerciſed by each other.</p>
               <p>In regard to the <hi>particular</hi> ſubject of your's I ſhall be ſilent. Ideas of that kind are better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, on my part, by words, than by the pen.</p>
               <p>I congratulate you on your agreeable ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hope it will be productive of real and laſting happineſs. I am convinced that felicity is not confined to any particular ſtation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032142_0067_0FF153F56470C7F8"/>
in life; yet methinks ſome are better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to afford it to me, than others.</p>
               <p>Your extract from a favorite poet is charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcriptive; but is it not difficult to aſcertain what we can pronounce "an elegant ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?" Perhaps you will anſwer as ſome others have done, We can attain it by circumſcribing our wiſhes within the compaſs of our abilities. I am not very avaricious; yet I muſt own that I ſhould like to enjoy it without ſo much trouble as that would coſt me.</p>
               <p>Excuſe my ſeeming levity. You have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my cheerfulneſs by commending it; and muſt, therefore, indulge me in the exerciſe of it. I cannot conveniently be at the pains of reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſallies, when I write in confidence.</p>
               <p>Is a ſprightly diſpoſition, in your view, indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a giddy mind, or an innocent heart? Of the latter, I preſume; for I know you are not a miſanthrope.</p>
               <p>We expect the pleaſure of Mr. Selby's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to dinner. You are, certainly, under obligations to his friendſhip for the liberal enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums he beſtowed on you, and your proſpects yeſterday. Mrs. Richman rallied me after he was gone, on my liſtening ear. The General and ſhe unite in requeſting me to preſent their reſpects. Wiſhing you health and happineſs, I ſubſcribe myſelf your friend,</p>

               <p>I AM perplexed and embarraſſed, my friend, by the aſſiduous attentions of this Major Sanford. I ſhall write circumſtantially, and frankly to you, that I may have the benefit of your advice. He came here, laſt Monday, in company with Mr. Laurence, his wife, and daughter, to make us a viſit. While they were preſent, a Mr. Selby, a particular friend of Mr. Boyer, came in, and delivered me a letter from him. I was really happy in the reception of this proof of his affection. His friend gave a very flattering account of his ſituation and proſpects.</p>
               <p>The watchful eye of Major Sanford traced every word and action, reſpecting Mr. Boyer, with an attention, which ſeemed to border on anxiety. That, however, did not reſtrain, but rather accellerate my vivacity and inquiſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the ſubject; for I wiſhed to know whether it would produce any real effect upon him, or not.</p>
               <p>After Mr. Selby's departure, he appeared pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and thoughtful, the remainder of the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032142_0069_0FF153BE88823518"/>
evening; and evidently ſought an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſpeaking to me aſide; which I ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoided. Miſs Laurence and I formed an engagement to take an airing in the morning on horſeback; attended by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of hers, who is now with them. They called for me about ten, when we immediately ſet out upon our preconcerted excurſion. We had not proceeded far, before we were met by Major Sanford. He was extremely polite, and finding our deſtination was not particular, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged leave to join our party. This was granted, and we had an agreeable tour for ſeveral miles; the time being paſſed in eaſy, and unſtudied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon obvious occurrences. Maj. Sanford could not, however, conceal his particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to me, which rather nettled Miſs Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. She grew ſomewhat ſerious, and declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed riding ſo far as we had intended; alledging that ſhe expected company to dine.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford underſtanding that ſhe was going to the aſſembly in the evening with Mr. Gordon, ſolicited me to accept a ticket and form a party with them. The entertainment was alluring, and I conſented. When we had part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Miſs Laurence, Major Sanford inſiſted on my riding a little farther; ſaying, he muſt converſe with me on a particular ſubject; and if I refuſed him this opportunity, that he muſt viſit me, at my reſidence, let it offend whom it would. I yielded to his importunity; and we rode on. He then told me that his mind was
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032142_0070_0FF15400304FE3B0"/>
in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe and agitation, which was very painful to bear; and which I only could relieve; that my cheerful reception of Mr. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer's letter, yeſterday, and deportment reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, had awakened in his breaſt all the pangs of jealouſy, which the moſt ardent love could feel; that my treatment of Mr. Boyer's friend convinced him that I was more intereſted in his affairs than I was willing to own; that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw himſelf to be condemned to an eternal ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration; and the total loſs of my favor and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, as ſoon as time and circumſtances would allow.</p>
               <p>His zeal, his pathos, alarmed me. I begged him to be calm. To you, ſaid I, as a friend, I have intruſted my ſituation in relation to Mr. Boyer. You know that I am under no ſpecial obligation to him; and I do not intend to form any immediate connection. Mr. Boyer muſt have different ideas, madam; and he has reaſon for them, if I may judge by appearances. When do you expect another viſit from him? In about a fortnight. And is my fate to be then decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſo decided, as I fear it will be, through the influence of your friends, if not by your own inclination? My friends, ſir, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol; they will only adviſe to what they think moſt for my intereſt; and I hope, that my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will not be unworthy of their approbation. Pardon me, my dear Eliza, ſaid he, if I am impertinent; it is my regard for you which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels me to the preſumption. Do you intend to
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:032142_0071_0FF15416E839C678"/>
give your hand to Mr. Boyer? I do not intend to give my hand to any man at preſent. I have but lately entered ſociety; and wiſh, for a while, to enjoy my freedom, in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of pleaſures, ſuited to my age and ſex. Theſe, ſaid he, you are aware, I ſuppoſe, when you form a connection with that man, you muſt renounce; and content yourſelf with a confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the tedious round of domeſtic duties, the pedantic converſation of ſcholars, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious criticiſms of a whole town. I have been accuſtomed, ſaid I, and am therefore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to men of letters; and as to the praiſe or cenſure of the populace, I hope always to enjoy that approbation of conſcience, which will render me ſuperior to both. But you forget your promiſe, not to talk in this ſtyle; and have deviated far from the character of a friend and brother, with which you conſented to reſt ſatiſfied. Yes, but I find myſelf unequal to the taſk. I am not ſtoic enough, tamely to make ſo great a ſacrifice. I muſt plead for an intereſt in your favor, till you baniſh me from your preſence, and tell me plainly that you hate me. We had by this time reached the gate; and as we diſmounted, were unexpectedly accoſted by Mr. Selby, who had come agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to his promiſe, to dine with us, and receive my letter to Mr. Boyer.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford took his leave as General Richman appeared at the door. The General and his lady <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032142_0072_0FF1543F796F4710"/>
but very prudently concealed their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Major Sanford, while Mr. Selby was preſent. Nothing material occurred before, and during dinner; ſoon after which, Mr. Selby went away. I retired to dreſs for the aſſembly; and had nearly completed the labor of the toilet, when Mrs. Richman entered. My friendſhip for you, my dear Eliza, ſaid ſhe, intereſts me ſo much in your affairs, that I cannot repreſs my curioſity to know who has the honor of your hand, this evening. If it be any honor, ſaid I, it will be confered on Major Sanford. I think it far too great to be thuſ beſtowed, returned ſhe. It is perfectly aſtoniſhing to me, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> virtuous part of my ſex will countenance, careſs, and encourage thoſe men, whoſe profeſſion it is to blaſt their reputation, deſtroy their peace, and triumph in their infamy! Is this, madam, the avowed deſign of Major Sanford? I know not what he avows; but his practice too plainly beſpeaks his principles and views. Does he now practice the arts you mention; or do you refer to paſt follies? I cannot anſwer for his preſent conduct; his paſt has eſtabliſhed his character. You, madam, are an advocate for charity; that, perhaps, if exerciſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might lead you to think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> for him to reform; to become a valuable member of ſociety; and, when connected with a lady of virtue and refinement, to be capable of making a good huſband. I cannot conceive that ſuch a lady would be willing to riſk her all upon the ſlender proſpect of his reformation. I hope the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032142_0073_0FF15476E49C4C98"/>
one with whom I am converſing, has no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſo hazardouſ, an experiment. Why, not much. Not much! If you have any, why do you continue to encourage Mr. Boyer's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſeſ? I am not ſufficiently acquainted with either yet, to determine which to take. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhall not confine myſelf in any way. In regard to theſe men, my fancy and my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are in ſcales. Sometimes one preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, ſometimes the other. Which will finally outweigh, time alone can reveal. O my couſin, beware of the deluſions of fancy! Reaſon muſt be our guide, if we would expect durable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. At this inſtant a ſervant opened the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oor, and told me that Major Sanford waited in the parlor. Being ready, I wiſhed Mrs. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a good evening, and went down. Neither General Richman nor his lady appeared. He therefore handed me immediately into his phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and we were ſoon in the aſſembly room.</p>
               <p>I was ſurpriſed, on my entrance, to find Mr. Selby there, as he did not mention, at dinner, his intention of going. He attached himſelf to our party; and, in the intervals of dancing, took ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery opportunity of converſing with me. Theſe, however, were not many; for Major Sanford aſſiduouſly precluded the poſſibility of my being much engaged by any one elſe. We paſſed the evening very agreeably; but the Major's impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity was rather troubleſome, as we returned home. He inſiſted upon my declaring whether Mr. Boyer really poſſeſſed my affections; and whether I intended to confer myſelf on him or
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032142_0074_0FF1545F18543DB0"/>
not. It, ſaid he, you anſwer me in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, I muſt deſpair; but if you have not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely decided againſt me, I will ſtill hope, that my perſevering aſſiduity, my faithful love, may at laſt be rewarded. I told him that I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to give him any account of my diſpoſition towards another; and that he muſt remember the terms of our preſent aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to which he had ſubſcribed. I therefore begged him to wave the ſubject now, if not forever. He aſked my pardon, if he had been impertinent; but deſired leave to renew his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that I would receive his viſits, his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſits. I replied, that I could not grant this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that he muſt blame himſelf, not me, if he was an unwelcome gueſt at General Richman's. He lamented the prejudices which my friends had imbibed againſt him; but flattered himſelf that I was more liberal than to be influenced by them, without any poſitive proof of demerit; as it was impoſſible that his conduct towards me ſhould ever deviate from the ſtricteſt rules of honor and love.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay now, my friend? This man, to an agreeable perſon has ſuperadded, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manners, an amiable temper, and a fortune ſufficient to enſure the enjoyments of all the pleaſing varieties of ſocial life. Perhaps a gay diſpoſition, and a lax education may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him into ſome ſcenes of diſſipation. But is it not an adage generally received, that <hi>"a reformed rake makes the beſt huſband?"</hi> My fancy leads me for happineſs to the feſtive
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032142_0075_0FF15390E035A6B8"/>
haunts of faſhionable life. I am at preſent, and know not but I ever ſhall be, too volatile for a confinement to domeſtic avocations, and ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pleaſures. I dare not, therefore, place my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſituation where theſe muſt be indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. Mr. Boyer's perſon, and character are agreeable. I really eſteem the man. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgment, as I have obſerved before, declare for a connection with him, as a ſtate of tranquillity and rational happineſs. But the idea of relinquiſhing thoſe delightful amuſements and flattering attentions, which wealth and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage beſtow, is painful. Why were not the virtues of the one, and the graces and afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, the flattery, the careſſes of men of that character? Even the moſt virtuous of them ſeem naturally prone to gaiety, to pleaſure, and, I had almoſt ſaid, to diſſipation! How elſe ſhall we account for the exiſtence of this diſpoſition, in your favorite fair? It cannot be the reſult of her education. Such a one as ſhe has received, is calculated to give her a very different turn of mind. You muſt forgive me, my friend, for I am a little vexed, and alarmed on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I went laſt evening to the aſſembly, as I told you in my laſt that I intended. I was purpoſely without a partner, that I might have the liberty to exerciſe my gallantry, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhould invite. Indeed, I muſt own, that my particular deſign was, to obſerve Miſs Wharton's movements, being rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032142_0077_0FF15422FA5FD130"/>
to jealouſy in your behalf. She was handed into the aſſembly room by Major Sanford. The brilliance of their appearance, the levity of their manners, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt of their characters I found to be a general ſubject of ſpeculation. I endeavored to aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate with Miſs Wharton, but found it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to detach her a moment from the coxcomb who attended her. If ſhe has any idea of a connection with you, why does ſhe continue to aſſociate with another, eſpecially with one of ſo oppoſite a deſcription? I am ſeriouſly afraid, that there is more intimacy between them, than there ought to be, conſidering the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe has given you.</p>
               <p>I hope you will not be offended by my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in this matter. It originates in a concern for your honor and future happineſs. I am anxious, leſt you ſhould be made the dupe of a coquette, and your peace of mind fall a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to an artful debauchee. Yet I muſt believe, that Miſs Wharton has, in reality, all that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good ſenſe of which ſhe enjoys the rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation; but her preſent conduct is myſterious.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough (more than I ought, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) to awaken your attention to circumſtances, which <hi>may</hi> lead to important events. If they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of little, or no conſequence to you, you will at leaſt aſcribe the mention of them to motives of ſincere regard, in your friend and humble ſervant,</p>

               <p>I GO on finely with my amour. I have every encouragement that I could wiſh. Indeed my fair one does not verbally declare in my favor; but then, according to the vulgar proverb, <hi>that actions ſpeak louder than words,</hi> I have no reaſon to complain; ſince ſhe evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approves my gallantry, is pleaſed with my company, and liſtens to my flattery.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032142_0079_0FF153B4704D2C60"/>
prompt each one to imagine herſelf ſuperior to deluſion; and to anticipate the honor of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the libertine, and reforming the rake! I dont know, however, but this girl will really have that merit with me; for I am ſo much attached to her, that I begin to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I ſhould ſooner become a convert to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety than loſe her. I cannot find that I have made much impreſſion on her heart as yet. Want of ſucceſs in this point mortifies me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely, as it is the firſt time I ever failed. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I am apprehenſive that ſhe is prepoſſeſſed in favor of the other ſwain, the clerical lover, whom I have mentioned to you before. The chord, therefore, upon which I play the moſt, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diſſimilarity of their diſpoſitions and pleaſures. I endeavor to detach her from him, and diſaffect her towards him; knowing, that if I can ſeparate them entirely, I ſhall be more likely to ſucceed in my plan. Not that I have any thoughts of marrying her myſelf; that will not do at preſent. But I love her too well to ſee her connected with another for life. I muſt own myſelf a little revengeful too in this affair. I wiſh to puniſh her friends, as ſhe calls them, for their malice towards me; for their cold and negligent treatment of me whenever I go to the houſe. I know that to fruſtrate their deſigns of a connection between Mr. Boyer and Eliza would be a grievous diſappointment. I have not yet determined to ſeduce her, though, with all her pretenſions to virtue, I do not think
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032142_0080_0FF154456FD80C00"/>
it impoſſible. And if I ſhould, ſhe can blame none but herſelf, ſince ſhe knows my character, and has no reaſon to wonder if I act conſiſtently with it. If ſhe will play with a lion, let her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of his paw, I ſay. At preſent, I wiſh inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently to enjoy her ſociety: it is a luxury which I never taſted before. She is the very ſoul of pleaſure. The gayeſt circle is irradiated by her preſence, and the higheſt entertainment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its greateſt charm from her ſmiles. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have purchaſed the ſeat of Capt. Prib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, about a mile from her mother's; and can I think of ſuffering her to leave the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, juſt as I enter it?

<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032142_0081_0FF1540C2DD76D88"/>
Mrs. Richman, "Beware of the deluſions of fancy!" You are ſtrangely infatuated by them! Let not the magic arts of that worthleſs Sanford lead you, like an <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> from the path of rectitude and virtue!</p>
               <p>I do not find, in all your converſations with him, that one word about marriage drops from his lips. This is myſterious? No, it is charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of the man. Suppoſe, however, that his views are honorable; yet what can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, what can you promiſe yourſelf from ſuch a connection? "A reformed rake," you ſay, "makes the beſt huſband;" a trite, but a very erroneous maxim, as the fatal experience of thouſands of our ſex can teſtify. In the firſt place, I believe that rakes very ſeldom <hi>do</hi> reform, while their fortunes and conſtitutions enable them to purſue their licentious pleaſures. But even allowing this to happen, can a woman of refinement and delicacy enjoy the ſociety of a man, whoſe mind has been corrupted, whoſe taſte has been vitiated, and who has contracted a depravity both of ſentiment and manners, which no degree of repentance can wholly efface? Beſides, of true love they are abſolutely incapable. Their paſſions have been too much hackneyed to admit ſo pure a flame. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anticipate ſincere and laſting reſpect from them. They have been ſo long accuſtomed to the company of thoſe of our ſex, who obſerve no eſteem; that the greateſt dignity and purity of character can never excite it in their breaſts. They
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032142_0082_0FF154204A37EBC8"/>
are naturally prone to jealouſy. Habituated to an intercourſe with the baſer part of the ſex, they level the whole, and ſeldom believe any to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible. They are always hard hearted and cruel. How elſe could they triumph in the miſeries which they frequently occaſion? Their ſpecious manners may render them agreeable companions abroad; but at home the evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities of their minds will invariably predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. They are ſteeled againſt the tender affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which render domeſtic life delightful; ſtrangers to the kind, the endearing ſympathies of huſband, father, and friend! The thouſand nameleſs attentions which ſoften the rugged path of life, are neglected, and deemed unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice by perſons who have been innured to ſcenes of diſſipation and debauchery! and is a man of this deſcription to be the partner, the companion, the boſom friend of my Eliza? Forbid it heaven! Let not the noble qualities, ſo laviſhly beſtowed upon her, be thus unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily ſacrificed!</p>
               <p>You ſeem to be particularly charmed with the fortune of Major Sanford; with the gaiety of his appearance; with the ſplendor of his equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; with the politeneſs of his manners; with what you call the graces of his perſon! Theſe, alas! are ſuperficial, enſnaring endowments. As to fortune, prudence, economy, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity are neceſſary to preſerve it, when poſſeſſed. Of theſe Major Sanford is certainly deſtitute; unleſs common ſame (which more frequently
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032142_0083_0FF153D20190BDD8"/>
tells truth than ſome are willing to allow) does him great injuſtice. As to external parade, it will not ſatisfy the rational mind, when it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to thoſe ſubſtantial pleaſures for which yours is formed. And as to the graces of perſon and manners, they are but a wretched ſubſtitute for thoſe virtues which adorn and dignify human life. Can you, who have always been uſed to ſerenity and order in a family, to rational, refined and improving converſation, relinquiſh them, and launch into the whirlpool of frivolity, where the correct taſte and the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate ſenſibility which you poſſeſs muſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be wounded by the frothy and illiberal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of licentious wit?</p>
               <p>This, my dear, is but a faint picture of the ſituation to which you ſeem inclined! Reverſe the ſcene, and you will perceive the alternative, which is ſubmitted to your option, in a virtuous connection with Mr. Boyer. Remember that you are acting for life; and that your happineſs in this world; perhaps in the next, depends on your preſent choice!</p>
               <p>I called, laſt evening, to ſee your mamma. She is fondly anticipating your return; and rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the proſpect of your agreeable and ſpeedy ſettlement. I could not find it in my heart to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs her by intimating that you had other views. I wiſh her benevolent boſom never more to feel the pangs of diſappointed hope.</p>
               <p>I am buſily engaged in preparing for my nuptials. The ſolemn words "as long as ye

               <p>I BELIEVE your ſpirits need a cordial indeed, my dear Lucy; after drawing ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a portrait of my ſwain. But I call him mine no longer. I renounce him entirely. My friends ſhall be gratified. And if their predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are verified, I ſhall be happy in a union with the man of their choice. General Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and lady have labored abundantly to prove that my ruin was inevitable if I did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately break all intercourſe with Major Sanford. I promiſed a compliance with their wiſhes; and have accompliſhed the taſk, though a hard one I found it. Laſt Thurſday he was here, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired leave to ſpend an hour with me. I readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſented, aſſuring my friends it ſhould
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032142_0085_0FF154370C6E2100"/>
be the laſt hour, which I would ever ſpend in his company.</p>
               <p>He told me that he was obliged to leave town for a few days; and, as I ſhould probably ſee Mr. Boyer, before his return, he could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in peace without once more endeavoring to intereſt me in his favor; to obtain ſome token of eſteem, ſome glimpſe of hope, that I would not utterly reject him, to ſupport him in his abſence. I thanked him for the polite attention he had paid me, ſince our acquaintance; told him that I ſhould ever retain a grateful ſenſe of his partial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to me; that he would ever ſhare my beſt wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but that all connection of the kind, to which he alluded, muſt from that time, for ever ceaſe.</p>
               <p>He exerted all his eloquence to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of that ſentence, and ran, with the greateſt volubility, through all the proteſtations, prayers, entreaties, profeſſions and aſſurances which love could feel or art contrive. I had reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, however, to reſiſt them, and to command my own emotions on the occaſion, better than my natural ſenſibility gave me reaſon to expect.</p>
               <p>Finding every effort vain, he roſe precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and bade me adieu. I urged his tarrying to tea; but he declined, ſaying, that he muſt retire to his chamber, being, in his preſent ſtate of mind, unfit for any ſociety, as he was baniſhed from mine. I offered him my hand, which he preſſed with ardor to his lips, and bowing in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, left the room.</p>
               <p>Thus terminated this affair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; an affair, which, perhaps, was only the effect of mere gallantry
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032142_0086_0FF154636EA5C9A8"/>
on his part, and of unmeaning pleaſantry on mine; and which, I am ſorry to ſay, has given my friends ſo much anxiety and concern. I am under obligations to them for their kind ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, however cauſeleſs it may have been.</p>
               <p>As an agreeable companion, as a polite and finiſhed gallant, Major Sanford is all that the moſt lively fancy could wiſh. And as you have always affirmed that I was a little inclined to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry, can you wonder at my exerciſing it upon ſo happy a ſubject? Beſides, when I thought more ſeriouſly, his liberal fortune was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alluring to me, who, you know, have been hitherto confined to the rigid rules of prudence and economy, not to ſay, neceſſity in my finances.</p>
               <p>Miſs Laurence called on me yeſterday, as ſhe was taking the air, and aſked me whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford took leave of me when he left town? He was here laſt week, ſaid I, but I did not know that he was gone away. O yes, ſhe replied, he is gone to take poſſeſſion of his ſeat, which he has lately purchaſed of Captain Pribble. I am told it is ſuperb; and it ought to be, if it have the honor of his reſidence. Then you have a great opinion of Major Sanford, ſaid I. Certainly; and has not every body elſe? ſaid ſhe. I am ſure he is a very fine gentleman. Mrs. Richman ſmiled rather contemptuouſly, and I changed the ſubject.</p>
               <p>I believe that the innocent heart of this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple girl is a little taken in.</p>
               <p>I have juſt received a letter from Mr. Boyer, in the uſual ſtyle. He expects the ſuperlative
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032142_0087_0FF1542983355D88"/>
happineſs of kiſſing my hand next week. O dear! I believe I muſt begin to fix my phiz. Let me run to the glaſs and try if I can make up one that will look <hi>madamiſh.</hi> Yes, I ſucceed very well.</p>
               <p>I congratulate you on your new neighbor; but I adviſe friend George to have the guardian knot tied immediately, leſt you ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared by this bewitching 'ſquire.</p>
               <p>I have been trying to ſeduce General Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to accompany me to the aſſembly, this ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, but cannot prevail. Were Mrs. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man able to go with us, he would be very happy to wait on us together; but to tell the truth, he had rather enjoy her company at home, than any which is to be found abroad. I rallied him on his old faſhioned taſte; but my heart ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and applauded his attachment. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the married man or woman, who harbors an inclination to partake of ſeparate pleaſures.</p>
               <p>I am told, that a ſervant man inquires for me below; the meſſenger of ſome enamoured ſwain, I ſuppoſe. I will ſtep down and learn what meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he brings.—</p>
               <p>Nothing extraordinary; it is only a card of compliments from a Mr. Emmons, a reſpectable merchant of this city, requeſting the honor to wait on me to the aſſembly this evening. A welcome requeſt, which I made no heſitation to grant. If I muſt reſign theſe favorite amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let me enjoy as large a ſhare as poſſible, till the time arrive. Adieu.

She received me very civilly, thanked me for my attention, and invited me to call whenever I had opportunity; which was the very thing I wanted. I intend likewiſe, to court popularity. I don't know but I muſt accept, by

But then, this particular theme of his, is not a favorite one to me; I mean, as connected with its conſequenceſ, care and confinement.

               <p>THE day after I left your hoſpitable dwelling, brought me ſafe to that of my honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mamma; to the ſeat of maternal and filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; of ſocial eaſe and domeſtic peace; of every ſpecies of happineſs which can reſult from
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032142_0095_0FF153FE8D7893F0"/>
religion and virtue; from refinement in morals, and manners.</p>
               <p>I found my brother and his wife, with Lucy Freeman and Mr. Sumner, waiting to receive and bid me welcome. I flew with extacy to the boſom of my mamma, who received me with her accuſtomed affection, teſtified by the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive tears of tenderneſs which ſtole ſilently down her widowed cheek. She was unable to ſpeak. I was equally ſo. We therefore indulged, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the pleaſing emotions of ſympathiſing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. When diſengaged from her fond em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, I was saluted by the others in turn; and having recovered myſelf, I preſented Mr. Boyer to each of the company, and each of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to him. He was cordially received by all, but more eſpecially by my mamma.</p>
               <p>The next day I was called upon and welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral of my neighboring acquaintance; among whom I was not a little ſurpriſed to ſee Major Sanford. He came in company with Mr. Stoddard and Lady, whom he overtook, as he told me, near by; and, as they informed him that the deſign of their viſit was to welcome me home, he readily accepted their invitation to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the pleaſure which every one muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive on my return. I bowed alightly at his compliment, taking no viſible notice of any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of expreſſion either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His politeneſs to Mr. Boyer, appeared to be the reſult of habit. Mr. Boyer's ſo him, to be

forced by reſpect to the company to which he had gained admiſſion. I dare ſay, that each felt a conſcious ſuperiority; the one on the ſcore of merit; the other on that of fortune. Which ought to outweigh, the judicious mind will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily decide. The ſcale, as I once obſerved to you, will turn as fancy or reaſon preponderates. I believe the eſteem which I now have for Mr. Boyer, will keep me ſteady; except, perhaps, ſome little excentricities, now and then, juſt by way of variety. I am going to morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſpend a few days with Lucy Freeman; to aſſiſt in the preparation for, and the ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization of her nuptials. Mr. Boyer, in the mean time, will tarry among his friends in town. My mamma is exceſſively partial to him; though I am not yet jealous that ſhe means to rival me. I am not certain, however, but it might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

               <p>FROM the ſcenes of feſtive mirth, from the conviviality of rejoicing friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the diſſipating amuſements of the gay world, I retire with alacrity, to hail my beloved friend on the important charge which ſhe has received; on the acceſſion to her family, and, may I not ſay, on the addition to her care; ſince that care will be more than counterbalanced by the pleaſure it confers. Hail happy babe! Uſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered into the world by the beſt of mothers; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by birth right to virtue and honor; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by parental love, from the weakneſs of infancy and childhood, by guardian wiſdom from the perils of youth, and by affluent inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence from the griping hand of poverty, in more advanced life! May theſe animating proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectſ be realiſed by your little daughter; and may you long enjoy the rich reward of ſeeing her all that you wiſh!</p>
               <p>Yeſterday, my dear friend, Lucy Freeman gave her hand to the amiable and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. George Sumner. A large circle of congratulating friends were preſent. Her dreſs
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032142_0099_0FF15516DB1B8B70"/>
was ſuch as wealth and elegance required. Her deportment was every thing that modeſty and propriety could ſuggeſt. They are, indeed, a charming couple. The conſonance of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the ſimilarity of their taſtes, and the equality of their ages are a ſure pledge of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Every eye beamed with pleaſure on the occaſion, and every tongue echoed the wiſhes of benevolence. Mine only was ſilent. Though not leſs intereſted in the felicity of my friend than the reſt, yet the idea of a ſeparation; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of an alienation of affection, by means of her entire devotion to another, caſt an involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gloom over my mind. Mr. Boyer took my hand, after the ceremony was paſt. Permit me, Miſs Wharton, ſaid he, to lead you to your lovely friend; her happineſs muſt be heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your participation of it. Oh no; ſaid I, I am too ſelfiſh for that. She has conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another that affection which I wiſhed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs. My love was too fervent to admit a rival. Retaliate then, ſaid he, this fancied wrong, by doing likewiſe. I obſerved that this was not a proper time to diſcuſs that ſubject; and, reſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſeat, endeavored to put on the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my accuſtomed vivacity. I need not relate the remaining particulars of the evening's entertainment. Mr. Boyer returned with my mamma, and I remained at Mrs. Freeman's.</p>
               <p>We are to have a ball here, this evening. Mr. Boyer has been with us, and tried to monop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olize my company; but in vain. I am too much
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032142_0100_0FF155188B08A560"/>

                  </gap> attending to a ſubject which affords no variety. I ſhall not cloſe this till to morrow.</p>
               <p>—I am rather fatigued with the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of laſt night, which were protracted to a late hour. Mr. Boyer was preſent; and I was pleaſed to ſee him not averſe to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though his profeſſion prevented his taking an active part. As all the neighboring gentry were invited, Mr. Freeman would, by no means, omit Major Sanford, which his daughter earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicited. It happened (unfortunately, ſhall I ſay?) that I drew him for a partner. Yet I muſt own, that I felt very little reluctance to my lot. He is an excellent dancer, and well calculated for a companion in the hours of mirth and gaiety. I regretted Mr. Boyer's being preſent, however; becauſe my enjoyment ſeemed to give him pain. I hope he is not inclined to the paſſion of jealouſy, If he is, I fear it will be ſomewhat exerciſed.</p>
               <p>Lucy Freeman, now Mrs. Sumner, removes, next week, to Boſton. I have agreed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, and ſpend a month or two in her fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. This will give variety to the journey of life. Be ſo kind as to direct your next letter to me there.</p>

               <p>MY hopes begin to revive. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain permitted to aſſociate with my Eliza; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the ſame entertainment! She does not refuſe to join with me in the mazy dance, and partake the ſcenes feſtive mirth. Nay, more; ſhe allows me to preſs her hand to my lips; and liſtens to the ſighing accents of love. Love her, I certainly do. Would to heaven I could mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her! Would to heaven I had preſerved my fortune; or ſhe had one to ſupply its place! I am diſtracted at the idea of loſing her forever. I am ſometimes tempted to ſolicit her hand in ſerious earneſt; but if I ſhould, poverty and want muſt be the conſequence. Her diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the expectation of affluence and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, which I believe her ruling paſſion, would afford a perpetual ſource of diſcontent and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>She is going to Boſton with her friend, Mrs. Sumner. I muſt follow her. I muſt break the connection, which is rapidly forming, between
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032142_0102_0FF154A3849E30A0"/>
her and Mr. Boyer; and enjoy her ſociety a while longer, if no more.</p>
               <p>I have had a little intimation from New-Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, that Miſs Laurence is partial to me, and might eaſily be obtained, with a handſome prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty into the bargain. I am neither pleaſed with, nor averſe to the girl. But ſhe has money, and that may ſupply the place of love, by enabling me to purſue independent pleaſures. This ſhe muſt expect, if ſhe marries a man of my caſt. She doubtleſs knows my character; and if ſhe is ſo vain of her charms or influence, as to think of reforming or confining me ſhe muſt bear the conſequences.</p>
               <p>However, I can keep my head up, at preſent, without recourſe to the nooſe of matrimony; and ſhall, therefore, defer any particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her, till neceſſity requires it.</p>

               <p>YOU commanded me, my dear mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, to write you. That command, I cheerfully obey, in teſtimony of my ready ſubmiſſion and reſpect. No other avocation could arreſt my time, which is now completely occupied in ſcenes of amuſement.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sumner is agreeably ſettled and ſituated. She appears to be poſſeſſed of every bleſſing which can render life deſirable. Almoſt every day, ſince our arrival, has been engroſſed by viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants. Our evenings, we have devoted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany abroad; and that more generally than we ſhould otherwiſe have done, as my ſtay is limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſo ſhort a period. The muſeum, the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, the circus and the aſſemblies have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Sumner has made me ſeveral preſents, notwithſtanding which, the articles requiſite to a faſhionable appearance, have involved me in conſiderable expenſe. I fear that you will think me extravagant when you are told how much.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bover tarried in town about a week, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſineſs. He appeared a little concerned at

               <p>I was diſpleaſed with his freedom; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded him that I had the diſpoſal of my own time, as yet; and that while I eſcaped the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of my own heart, I hoped that no one elſe would preſume to arraign it. He apologiſed, and gave up his argument.</p>
               <p>I was much ſurpriſed, the firſt time I went to the play, to ſee Major Sanford in the very next box. He immediately joined out party; and wherever I have been ſince, I have been almoſt ſure to meet him.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer has taken his departure; and I do not expect to ſee him again, till I return, home.</p>
               <p>O mamma! I am embarraſſed; about this man. His worth I acknowledge; nay, I eſteem him very highly. But can there be happineſs with ſuch a diſparity of diſpoſitions?</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I BELIEVE that I owe you an apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy for my long ſilence. But my time has been much engroſſed of late; and my mind much more ſo. When it will be otherwiſe, I cannot forefee. I fear, my friend, that there is ſome foundation for your ſuſpicions reſpecting my beloved Eliza. What pity it is, that ſo fair a form, ſo accompliſhed a mind, ſhould be tarniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the ſmalleſt degree, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y the follies of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry! If this be the fact, which I am loth to believe, all my regard for her ſhall never make me the dupe of it.</p>
               <p>When I arrived at her reſidence, at New-Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, where, I told you in my laſt, I was ſoon to go, ſhe gave me a moſt cordial reception. Her whole behavior to me was correſpondent with thoſe ſentiments of eſteem and affection which ſhe modeſtly avowed. She permitted me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her to Hartford, to reſtore her to her mother, and to declare my wiſh to receive her again from her hand. Thus far, all was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032142_0106_0FF154DF483D5830"/>
and happineſs. As all my wiſhes were conſiſtent with virtue and honor, ſhe readily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged them. She took apparent pleaſure in my company, encouraged my hopes of a future union, and liſtened to the tender accents of love.</p>
               <p>But the ſcenes of gaiety, which invited her attention, reverſed her conduct. The delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hours of mutual confidence, of ſentimental converſe, and of the interchange of refined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, were no more! Inſtead of theſe, parties were formed, unpleaſing to my taſte; and every opportunity was embraced to join in diverſions, in which ſhe knew I could not conſiſtently take a ſhare. I, however, acquieſced in her pleaſure, though I ſometimes thought myſelf neglected, and even hinted it to her mother. The old lady apologiſed for her daughter, by alledging that ſhe had been abſent for a long time; that her acquaintances were rejoiced at her return, and welcomed her by ſtriving to prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               <p>One of her moſt intimate friends was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried during my ſtay; and ſhe appeared deeply intereſted in the event. She ſpent ſeveral days in aſſiſting her, previous to the celebration. I reſided, in the mean time, at her man ma's, viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iting her at her friend's, where Major Sanford, among others, was received as a gueſt. Mr. Sumner acquainted me that ſhe had prevailed on Miſs Wharton to go and ſpend a few weeks with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

and urged my accompanying them. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to excuſe myſelf, as I had been abſent from my people a conſiderable time, and my return was now expected. But their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was ſo great, and Eliza's declaration that it would be very agreeable to her, ſo tempting, that I conſented. Here I took lodgings and ſpent about a week, taking every opportunity to converſe with Eliza, ſtriving to diſcover her real diſpoſition towards me. I mentioned the inconvenience of viſiting her ſo often as I wiſhed, and ſuggeſted my deſire to enter, as ſoon as might be, into a family relation. I painted in the moſt alluring colours the pleaſures reſulting from domeſtic tranquillity, mutual confidence, and conjugal affection; and inſiſted on her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring frankly whether ſhe deſigned to ſhare this happineſs with me, and when it ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. She owned that ſhe intended to give me her hand; but when ſhe ſhould be rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly, ſhe could not yet determine. She pretended a promiſe from me to wait her time; to conſent that ſhe ſhould ſhare the pleaſures of the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able world, as long as ſhe choſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I then attempted to convince her of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken idea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of pleaſure; that the ſcenes of diſſipation, of which ſhe was ſo paſſionately fond, afforded no true enjoyment; that the adulation of the coxcomb could not give durability to her charms, or ſecure the approbation of the wife and good; nor could the faſhionable amuſements

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe friendly ſuggeſtions, I found were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the theme of a prieſt; and my deſire to detach her from ſuch empty purſuits, as the ſelfiſhneſs of a lover. She was even offended at my freedom; and warmly affirmed, that no one had a right to arraign her conduct. I mentioned Major Sanford who was then in town, and who (though ſhe went to places of public reſort with Mr. and Mrs. Sumner) always met and gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her home. She rallied me upon my jealouſy, as ſhe termed it; wiſhed that I would attend her myſelf, and then ſhe ſhould need no other gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. I anſwered that I had rather reſign that honor to another; but wiſhed, for her ſake, that he might be a gentleman whoſe character would not diſgrace the company with which he aſſociated. She appeared mortified and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined in the extreme. However, ſhe ſtudiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppreſſed her emotions; and even ſoothed me with the blandiſhments of female ſoftneſs. We parted amicably. She promiſed to return ſoon, and prepare for a compliance with my wiſhes. I cannot refuſe to believe her! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to love her! My heart is in her poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. She has a perfect command of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Perſuaſion dwells on her tongue. With all the boaſted fortitude and reſolution of our

ſex, we are but mere machines. Let love once pervade our breaſts; and its object may mould us into any form that pleaſes her fancy, or even caprice!</p>
               <p>I have juſt received a letter from Eliza, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of her return to Hartford. To morrow I ſhall ſet out on a viſit to the dear girl; for, my friend, notwithſtanding all her foibles, ſhe is very dear to me. Before you hear from me again, I expect that the happy day will be fixed; the day which ſhall unite, in the moſt ſacred bands, this lovely maid, and your faithful friend,</p>

               <p>I HAVE returned; and the day, indeed, is fixed; but Oh! how different from my fond expectations! It is not the day of union, but the day of final ſeparation; the day which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides me from my charmer; the day which breaks aſunder the bands of love; the day on which my reaſon aſſumes its empire, and triumphs over
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032142_0110_0FF155786F57A8D0"/>
the arts of a finiſhed coquette! Congratulate me, my friend, that I have thus overcome my feelings, and repelled the infatuating wiles of a deceitful girl. I would not be underſtood to impeach Miſs Wharton's virtue; I mean her chaſtity. Virtue in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the term, as applied to the ſex, is confined to that particular, you know. But in my view, this is of little importance, where all other virtues are wanting!</p>
               <p>When I arrived at Mrs. Wharton's, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Eliza, I was told that ſhe had rode out; but was ſoon expected home. An hour after, a phaeton ſtopped at the door, from which my fair one alighted, and was handed into the houſe by Major Sanford, who immediately took leave. I met her and offered my hand, which ſhe received with apparent tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>When the family had retired after ſupper, and left us to talk on our particular affairs, I found the ſame indeciſion, the ſame loathneſs to bring our courtſhip to a period, as formerly. Her previous excuſes were renewed, and her wiſhes to have a union ſtill longer delayed, were zealouſly urged. She could not bear the idea of confinement to the cares of a married life at preſent; and begged me to defer all ſolicitation on that ſubject to ſome future day. I found my temper riſe, and told her plainly, that I was not thus to be trifled with; that if her regard for me was ſincere; if ſhe really intended to form a connection with me, ſhe could not thus
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032142_0111_0FF154FCEEF2DC20"/>
protract the time, try my patience, and prefer ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery other pleaſure to the rational interchange of affection, to the calm delights of domeſtic life. But in vain did I argue againſt her falſe notions of happineſs; in vain did I repreſent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſyſtem to conduct, which ſhe now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and urge her to accept, before it was too late, the hand and heart which were devoted to her ſervice. That, ſhe ſaid, ſhe purpoſed, ere long to do; and hoped amply to reward my faithful love; but ſhe could not fix the time this evening. She muſt conſider a little further; and likewiſe conſult her mother. Is it not Major Sanford whom you wiſh to conſult, madam? ſaid I. She bluſhed, and gave me no anſwer. Tell me, Eliza, I continued, tell me frankly, if he has not ſupplanted me in your affections; if he be not the cauſe of my being thus evaſively, thus cruelly treated? Major Sanford, ſir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe, has done you no harm. He is a particular friend of mine; a polite gentleman, and an agreeable neighbor; and therefore I treat him with civility; but he is not ſo much intereſted in my concerns, as to alter my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition towards any other perſon. Why, ſaid I, do you talk of friendſhip with a man of his character? Between his ſociety and mine, there is a great contraſt. Such oppoſite purſuits and inclinations cannot be equally pleaſing to the ſame taſte. It is therefore neceſſary, that you renounce the one, to enjoy the other. I will give you time to decide which. I am going to a
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032142_0112_0FF154F651D041C8"/>
friend's houſe to ſpend the night; and will call on you to morrow, if agreeable, and converſe with you further upon the matter. She bowed aſſent, and I retired.</p>
               <p>The next afternoon I went as agreed; and found her mamma and her alone in the parlor. She was very penſive and appeared to have been in tears. The ſight affected me. The idea of having treated her harſhly, the evening before, diſarmed me of my reſolution to inſiſt on her deciſion that day. I invited her to ride with me and viſit a friend, to which ſhe readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. We ſpent out time agreeably. I forebore to preſs her on the ſubject of our future union; but ſtrove rather to ſoothe her mind, and inſpire her with ſentiments of tenderneſs towards me. I conducted her home, and returned early in the evening to my friend's, who met me at the door; and jocoſely told me, that he expected I ſhould now rob them of their agreeable neighbor. But, added he, we have been apprehenſive that you would be rivalled, if you delayed your viſit much longer. I did not ſuſpect a rival, ſaid I. Who can the happy man be? I can ſay nothing from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obſervation, ſaid he; but fame, of late, has talked loudly of Major Sanford and Miſs Wharton. Be not alarmed, continued he, ſeeing me look grave. I preſume no harm is intended. The Major is a man of gallantry, and Miſs Wharton is a gay lady; but I dare ſay that your connection will be happy, <hi>if it be

                  </gap> develop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I informed him of my emabarraſſment; and he gave me to underſtand that Eliza's conduct had, for ſome time paſt, been a ſubject of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation in the town; that formerly, her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was highly eſteemed; but that her intimacy with a man of Sanford's known libertiniſm; more eſpecially as ſhe was ſuppoſed to be engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another, had rendered her very cenſurable; that they were often together; that wherever ſhe went, he was ſure to follow, as if by appointment; that they walked, talked, ſung and danced togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in all companies; that ſome ſuppoſed he would marry her; others, that he only meditated adding her name to the black catalogue of deluded wretches, whom he had already ruined!</p>
               <p>I roſe, and walked the room in great agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He apologized for his freedom; was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry if he had wounded my feelings; but friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip alone had induced him frankly to declare the truth, that I might guard againſt duplicity and deceit.</p>
               <p>I thanked him for his kind intenſions; and aſſured him that I ſhould not quit the town till I had terminated this affair, in one way or another.</p>
               <p>I retired to bed, but ſleep was a ſtranger to my eyes. With the dawn I roſe; and after break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt walked to Mrs. Wharton's, who informed me, that Eliza was in her chamber, writing to a friend, but would be down in a few minutes. I
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032142_0114_0FF15520D6CDE7E8"/>
entered into converſation with the old lady on the ſubject of her daughter's conduct; hinted my ſuſpicions of the cauſe, and declared my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of knowing my deſtiny immediately. She endeavored to extenuate, and excuſe her as much as poſſible; but frankly owned that her behavior was myſterious; that no pains had been wanting, on her part, to alter and rectify it; that ſhe had remonſtrated, expoſtulated, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and entreated, as often as occaſion requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She hoped that my reſolution would have a good effect, as ſhe knew that her daughter eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed me very highly.</p>
               <p>In this manner we converſed till the clock ſtruck twelve; and Eliza, not appearing, I deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her mamma to ſend up word that I waited to ſee her. The maid returned with an anſwer that ſhe was indiſpoſed, and had lain down. Mrs. Wharton obſerved, that ſhe had not ſlept for ſeveral nights, and complained of the head ache in the morning. The girl added, that ſhe would wait on Mr. Boyer in the evening. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this information I roſe and abruptly took my leave. I went to dine with a friend, to whom I had engaged myſelf the day before; but my mind was too much agitated to enjoy either the company or the dinner. I excuſed myſelf from tarrying to tea, and returned to Mrs. Wharton's. On inquiry, I was told that Eliza had gone to walk in the garden; but deſired that no perſon might intrude on her retirement. The ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the requeſt awakened my curioſity, and
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032142_0115_0FF1555929BD8818"/>
determined me to follow her. I ſought her in vain, in different parts of the garden, till, going towards an arbor, almoſt concealed from ſight, by ſurrounding ſhrubbery, I diſcovered her, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in cloſe converſation with Major Sanford! My blood chilled in my veins, and I ſtood pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with aſtoniſhment, at the diſcloſure of ſuch baſeneſs and deceit. They both roſe in viſible confuſion. I dared not truſt myſelf to accoſt them. My paſſionſ were raiſed, and I feared that I might ſay or do ſomething unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming my character. I therefore gave them a look of indignation and contempt, and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the houſe. I traverſed the parlor haſtily, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelmed with chagrin and reſentment! Mrs. Wharton inquired the cauſe. I attempted to tell her, but my tongue refuſed utterance! While in this ſituation, Eliza entered the room. She was not leſs diſcompoſed than myſelf. She ſat down at the window and wept. He mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma wept likewiſe. At length ſhe recovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a degree, and deſired me to ſit down. I anſwered no; and continued walking. Will you, ſaid ſhe, permit me to vindicate my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and explain my motives? Your conduct, ſaid I, cannot be vindicated; your motives need no explanation; they are too apparent! How, Miſs Wharton, have I merited this treatment from you? But I can bear it no longer. Your indifference to me proceeds from an attachment to another; and forgive me, if I add, to one, who is the diſgrace of his own ſex, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032142_0116_0FF154F3086FAB00"/>
of yours. I have been too long the dupe of your diſſimulation and coquetry. Too long has my peace of mind been ſacrificed to the arts of a woman, whoſe conduct has proved her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of my regard; inſenſible to love, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and honor!</p>
               <p>To you, madam, ſaid I, turning to her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I acknowledge my obligations for your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, politeneſs and attention. I once hoped for the privilege of rocking for you the cradle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining age. I am deprived of that privilege; but I pray that you may never want a child, whoſe love and duty ſhall prove a ſource of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort!</p>
               <p>Farewell! If we never meet again in this life, I hope and truſt we ſhall in a better; where the parent's eye ſhall ceaſe to weep for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of a child; and the lover's heart to bleed for the infidelity of his miſtreſs!</p>
               <p>I turned to Eliza, and attempted to ſpeak; but her extreme emotion ſoftened me, and I could not command my voice. I took her hand, and bowing, in token of an adieu, went precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the houſe. The reſidence of my friend, with whom I lodged, was at no great diſtance, and thither I repaired. As I met him in the entry, I ruſhed by him, and betook myſelf to my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>The fever of reſentment, and the tumult of paſſion began now to give place to the ſofter emotions of the ſoul. I found myſelf perfectly unmanned. I gave free ſcope to the ſenſibility
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032142_0117_0FF154F4A68FDB50"/>
of my heart; and the effeminate relief of tears materially lightened the load which oppreſſed me.</p>
               <p>After this arduous ſtruggle I went to bed; and ſlept more calmly than for ſeveral nights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The next morning I wrote a farewell let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Eliza (a copy of which I ſhall incloſe to you) and ordering my horſe to be brought, left town immediately.</p>
               <p>My reſentment of her behavior has much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me in eraſing her image from my breaſt. In this exertion I have ſucceeded beyond my moſt ſanguine expectations. The more I reflect on her temper and diſpoſition, the more my gratitude is enlivened towards the wiſe Diſpoſer of all events for enabling me to break aſunder the ſnares of the delude<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. I am convinced, that the gaiety and extravagance of her taſte, the frivolous levity of her manners diſqualify her for the ſtation in which I wiſhed to have placed her. Theſe conſiderations, together with that reſignation to an overruling Providence which the religion I profeſs, and teach, requires me to cultivate, induce me cheerfully to adopt the following lines of an ingenious poet:
<q>

               <p>FEARING, that my reſolution may not be proof againſt the eloquence of thoſe charms, which have ſo long commanded me, I take this method of bidding you a final adieu. I write not as a lover. That connection between us is for ever diſſolved; but I addreſs you as a friend; a friend to your happineſſ, to your rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation, to your temporal and eternal welfare. I will not rehearſe the innumerable inſtances of your imprudence and miſconduct, which have fallen under my obſervation. Your own heart muſt be your monitor! ſuffice it for me to warn you againſt the dangerous tendency of ſo diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated a life; and to tell you that I have traced (I believe aright) the cauſe of your diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and indifference to me. They are an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the ſober, rational, frugal mode of living, to which my profeſſion leads; a fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the parade, the gaiety, not to ſay, the licentiouſneſs of a ſtation calculated to gratify
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:032142_0119_0FF1554A91B33C18"/>
ſuch a diſpoſition; and a prepoſſeſſion for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford, infuſed into your giddy mind by the frippery, flattery and artifice of that worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and abandoned man. Hence you prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a connection with him, if it could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; but a doubt, whether it could, together with the advice of your friends, who have kindly eſpouſed my cauſe, have reſtrained you from the avowal of your real ſentiments, and led you to continue your civilities to me. What the reſult of your coquetry would have been, had I waited for it, I cannot ſay, nor have I now any deſire or intereſt to know. I tear from my breaſt the idea which I have long cheriſhed of future union and happineſs with you in the conjugal ſtate. I bid a laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to theſe fond hopes, and leave you for ever!</p>
               <p>For your own ſake, however, let me conjure you to review your conduct, and before you have advanced beyond the poſſibility of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rectitude and honor, to reſtrain your ſteps from the dangerous path in which you now tread!</p>
               <p>Fly Major Sanford. That man is a deceiver. Truſt not his profeſſions. They are certainly inſincere; or he would not affect concealment; he would not induce you to a clandeſtine inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe! Many have been the victims of his treachery! O Eliza! add not to the number! Baniſh him from your ſociety, if you wiſh to preſerve your virtue unſullied, your character
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032142_0120_0FF1550952A1B6E0"/>
unſuſpicious! It already begins to depreciate. Snatch it from the envenomed tongue of ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, before it receive an incurable wound!</p>
               <p>Many faults have been viſible to me; over which my affection once drew a veil. That veil is now removed. And, acting the part of a diſintereſted friend, I ſhall mention ſome few of them with freedom. There is a levity in your manners, which is inconſiſtent with the ſolidity and decorum becoming a lady who has arrived to years of diſcretion. There is alſo an unwarrantable extravagance betrayed in your dreſs. Prudence and economy are ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, at leaſt, ſuch decent virtues, that they claim the attention of every female, whatever be her ſtation or her property. To theſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues you are apparently inattentive. Too large a portion of your time is devoted to the adorning of your perſon.</p>
               <p>Think not that I write thus plainly from reſentment. No; It is from benevolence. I mention your foibles, not to reproach you with them, but that you may conſider their nature and effects, and renounce them.</p>
               <p>I wiſh you to regard this letter as the legacy of a friend; and to improve it accordingly. I ſhall leave town before you receive it. O, how different are my ſenſations at going, from what they were when I came! but I forbear deſcription.</p>
               <p>Think not, Eliza, that I leave you with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference! The conflict is great; the trial is
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032142_0121_0FF15495802F1E80"/>
more than I can calmly ſupport! Yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of duty, affords conſolation. A du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I conceive it to be, which I owe to myſelf; and to the people of my charge, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in my future connection.</p>
               <p>I wiſh not for an anſwer; my reſolution is unalterably fixed. But ſhould you hereafter be convinced of the juſtice of my conduct; and become a convert to my advice, I ſhall be happy to hear it.</p>
               <p>That you may have wiſdom to keep you from falling, and conduct you ſafely through this ſtate of trial to the regions of immortal bliſs, is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE retirement of my native home is not ſo gloomy, ſince my return from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, as I expected, from the contraſt between them.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the cuſtoms and amuſements of this place are materially altered, ſince the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Major Sanford among us. The dull, old faſhioned ſobriety which formerly prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is nearly baniſhed; and cheerfulneſs, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity, and enjoyment are ſubſtituted in its ſtead. Pleaſure is now diffuſed through all ranks of the people, eſpecially the rich; and ſurely it ought to be cultivated, ſince the wiſeſt of men informs us, that "a merry heart doth good like a medicine." As human life has many diſeaſes, which require medicines, are we not right in ſelecting the moſt agreeable and palatable? Major Sanford's example has had great influence upon our ſociety in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and though ſome of our old dons think him rather licentious; yet, for ought I can ſee, he is as ſtrict an obſerver of decorum, as the beſt
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032142_0123_0FF1554222931300"/>
of them. True, he ſeldom goes to church; but what of that? The Deity is not confined to temples made with hands. He may worſhip him as devoutly elſewhere, if he chuſes; and who has a right to ſay he does not?</p>
               <p>His return from Boſton was but a day or two after mine. He paid me an early viſit; and, indeed, has been very attentive ever ſince. My mamma is ſomewhat preciſe in her notions of propriety; and of courſe, blames me for aſſociating ſo freely with him. She ſays, that my engagements to Mr. Boyer ought to render me more ſedate; and more indifferent to the gallantry of mere <hi>pleaſure-hunters,</hi> to uſe her phraſe. But I think otherwiſe. If I am to become a recluſe, let me, at leaſt, enjoy thoſe amuſements, which are ſuited to my taſte, a ſhort time firſt. Why ſhould I refuſe the polite attentions of this gentleman? They ſmoothe the rugged path of life, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accelerate the lagging wheels of time.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Lucy, he has an admirable talent for contributing to vary, and increaſe amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We have few hours unimproved. Some new plan of pleaſure, and ſociability is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly courting our adoption. He lives in all the magnificence of a prince; and why ſhould I, who can doubtleſs ſhare that magnificence if I pleaſe, forego the advantages and indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it offers, merely to gratify thoſe friends who pretend to be better judges of my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than I am myſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:032142_0124_0FF154FE93483BC8"/>
I have not yet told my mamma that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains me with the lover's theme; or, atleaſt, that I liſten to it. Yet I muſt own to you, from whom I have never concealed an action or idea, that his ſituation in life charms my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination; that the apparent fervor and ſincer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his paſſion affect my heart. Yet there is ſomething extremely problematical in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. He is very urgent with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                  </gap> not to marry him without his conſent; or knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, to ſay no more. He warmly applauds my wiſh, ſtill longer to enjoy the freedom and independence of a ſingle ſtate; and profeſſedly adopts it for his own. While he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connect me from another, he myſteriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals his own intentions and views. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with him yeſterday, I plainly told him that his conduct was unaccountable; that if his profeſſions and deſigns were honorable he could not neglect to mention them to my mamma; that I ſhould no longer conſent to carry of a clandeſtine intercourſe with him; that I hourly expected Mr. Boyer, whom I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed and who was the favorite of my friends; and that unleſs he acted openly in this affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his arrival, I ſhould give my hand to him.</p>
               <p>He appeared thunderſtruck at this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. All his words and actions were indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the moſt violent emotions of mind. He entreated me to recall the ſentence; for I knew not, he ſaid, his motives for ſecrecy; yet he
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032142_0125_0FF155046F84D738"/>
ſolemnly ſwore that they were honorable. I replied in the words of the poet,
<q>
                     <l>"Truſt not a man, they are by nature cruel,</l>
                     <l>Falſe, deceitful, treacherous, and inconſtant.</l>
                     <l>When a man talks of love, with caution hear him;</l>
                     <l>But if he ſwear, he'll certainly deceive you."</l>
                  </q>
He begged that he might know by what means he had provoked my ſuſpicions; by what means he had forfeited my confidence? His importunity vanquiſhed my fortitude; and before we parted, I again promiſed to make him acquainted, from time to time, with the progreſs of my connection with Mr. Boyer.</p>
               <p>Now, my dear friend, I want your advice more than ever. I am inadvertently embarraſſed by this man; and how to extricate myſelf, I know not. I am ſenſible that the power is in my hands; but the diſpoſition (ſhall I confeſs it) is wanting!
<q>
                     <l>"I know the right, and I approve it too;</l>
                     <l>I know the wrong and yet the wrong purſue!"</l>

               </p>
               <p>I have juſt received a card from Major San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, inviting me to ride this afternoon. At firſt I thought of returning a negative anſwer; but recollecting that Mr. Boyer muſt ſoon be here, I concluded it beſt to embrace this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, of talkin, further with him. I muſt now prepare to go; but ſhall not cloſe this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I intend writing in continuation, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents occur, till this important buſineſs is decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:032142_0126_0FF1554081F22F28"/>
                  <hi>Tueſday evening.</hi> The little tour which I mentioned to you this afternoon, was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of a final determination. The ſame plea was repeated over, and over again, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cloſing the cauſe. On my return I found Mr. Boyer waiting to receive me. My heart beat an involuntary welcome. I received him very cordially, though with a kind of pleaſure mixed with apprehenſion. I muſt own that his converſation and manners are much better cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to bear the ſcrutiniſing eye of a refined underſtanding and taſte, than Major Sanford's. But whether the fancy ought not to be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about our ſettlement for life, is with me a queſtion.</p>
               <p>When we parted laſt, I had promiſed Mr. Boyer, to inform him poſitively, at this viſit, when my hand ſhould be given. He therefore came, as he told me in the courſe of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with the reſolution of claiming the fulfilment of this promiſe.</p>
               <p>I begged abſolution; told him, that I could not poſſibly ſatiſfy his claim; and ſought ſtill to evade, and put off the important deciſion. He grew warm; and affirmed that I treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ungenerouſly, and made needleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays. He even accuſed me of indifference to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; and of partiality to another. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford he believed, was the man who robbed him of the affection which he had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his due. He warned me againſt any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with him, and inſiſted that I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032142_0127_0FF1554D41032F90"/>
the ſociety of the one or the other imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. He would leave me, he ſaid, this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and call to morrow to know the reſult of my determination. It was late before he bade me good night; ſince which I have written theſe particulars. It is now time to lay aſide my pen, and deliberate what courſe to take.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday Evening.</hi> Laſt night I cloſed not my eyes. I roſe this morning with the ſun, and went into the garden till breakfaſt. My mamma doubtleſs ſaw the diſorder of my mind, but kindly avoided any inquiry about it. She was affectionately attentive to me, but ſaid noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my particular concerns. I mentioned not my embarraſſment to her. She had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared herſelf in favor of Mr. Boyer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had no expectation, that ſhe would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe impartially. I retired to my chamber, and remained in a kind of reverie, for more than an hour; when I was rouſed by the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling of a carriage at the door. I haſtened to the window, and ſaw Major Sanford juſt driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away. The idea of his having been to converſe with my mamma, gave me new ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A thouſand perplexities occurred to my mind relative to the part moſt proper for me to act in this critical ſituation. All theſe might have been avoided, had I gone down and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the matter; but this I delayed till dinner. My mamma then informed me, that Major Sanford had been with her, and inquired for me; but that ſhe thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032142_0128_0FF15502613CBE48"/>
to call me, as ſhe preſumed I had no particular buſineſs with him. I knew the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by which ſhe was actuated, was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at her evaſions. I told her plainly, that ſhe would never carry her point in this way; that I thought myſelf capable of conducting my own affairs; and wiſhed her not to interfere, except by her advice, which I ſhould always liſten to, and comply with when I could poſſibly make it conſiſtent with my inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intereſt. She wept at my undutiful anger (of which I have ſeverely repented ſince) and affectionately replied, that my happineſs was the object of her wiſhes and prayers; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to which ſhe felt conſtrained, freely to ſpeak her mind, though it incurred my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. She then went through again with all the comparative circumſtances and merits of the two candidates for my favor, which have perpetually rung in my ears for months. I ſhed tears at the idea of my embarraſſment; and in this condition Mr. Boyer found us. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be affected by my viſible diſorder; and without inquiring the cauſe, endeavored to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate it. This was kindly done. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed upon indifferent ſubjects; and invited me to ride, and take tea with your mamma, to which I readily conſented. We found her at home; and paſſed the time agreeably, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the alloy of our abſence. Mr. Boyer touched lightly on the ſubject of our laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's debate; but expatiated largely on the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:032142_0129_0FF1554EE2B0CC60"/>
pleaſing power of love; and hoped that we ſhould one day both realize and exemplify it in perfection. When we returned, he obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was late, and took his leave; telling me that he ſhould call to morrow; and begged that I would then relieve his ſuſpenſe. As I was retiring to bed, the maid gave me a hint that Major Sandford's ſervant had been here and leſt a letter. I turned inſtantly back to my mamma, and telling her my information, demanded the letter. She heſitated, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on having it; and ſeeing me reſolute, ſhe reluctantly gave it into my hand. It contained the following words:</p>
               <p>"Am I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orſaken? Am I abandoned? Oh my adorable Eliza, have you ſacrificed me to my rival? Have you condemned me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual baniſhment, without a hearing?</p>
               <p>I came this day, to plead my cauſe at your feet; but was cruelly denied the privilege of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you! My mind is all anarchy and confuſion! My ſoul is harrowed up with jealouſly! I will be revenged on thoſe who ſeparate us, if that diſtracting event take place! But it is from your lips only that I can hear my ſentence! You muſt witneſs its effects! To what lengths my deſpair may carry me, I know not! You are the arbitreſs of my fate!</p>
               <p>Let me conjure you to meet me in your gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to morrow at any hour you ſhall appoint. My ſervant will call for an anſwer in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:032142_0130_0FF15555751D1B60"/>
Deny me not an interview; but have pity on your faithful — <hi>Sanford.</hi>"</p>
               <p>I wrote for anſwer, that I would meet him to morrow, at five o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>I have now before me another night for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and ſhall paſs it in that employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I purpoſe not to ſee Mr. Boyer, till I have converſed with Major Sanford.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday Morning.</hi> The morning dawns, and uſhers in the day; a day, perhaps big with the fate of your friend! What that fate may be is wrapped in the womb of futurity; that futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which a kind Providence has wiſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the penetration of mortals!</p>
               <p>After mature conſideration; after revolving and re-revolving every circumſtance on both ſides of the queſtion, I have nearly determined, in compliance with the advice of my friends, and the dictates of my own judgment, to give Mr. Boyer the preference, and with him to tread the future round of life.</p>
               <p>As to the deſpair of Major Sanford, it does not much alarm me. Such violent paſſions are ſeldom ſo deeply rooted, as to produce laſting effects. I muſt, however, keep my word, and meet him according to promiſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Boyer is below. My mamma has juſt ſent me word that he wiſhed to ſee me. My reply was that I had lain down, which was a fact.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One o'Clock.</hi> My mamma, alarmed by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, has viſited my apartment. I ſoon
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032142_0131_0FF155A46C17D398"/>
convinced her that it was but trifling, owing principally to the want of ſleep; and that an airing in the garden, which I intended towards night, would reſtore me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ten o'clock, at night.</hi>—The day is paſt! and ſuch a day it has been, as I hope never move to ſee!</p>
               <p>At the hour appointed, I went tolerably compoſed and reſolute into the garden. I had taken ſeveral turns, and retired into the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle arbor, where you and I have ſpent ſo many happy hours, before Major Sanford entered. When he appeared, a conſciouſneſs of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of this clandeſtine intercourſe ſuffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my cheek, and gave a coldneſs to my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He immediately penetrated the cauſe, and obſerved that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome gueſt to me. I aſked him if he ought ſo to be; ſince his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for ſeeking admiſſion, were unworthy of being communicated to my friends? That he ſaid was not the caſe, but that prudence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance required a temporary concealment. He then undertook to exculpate himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om blame, aſſuring me that as ſoon as I ſhould diſcountenance the expectations of Mr. Boyer, and diſcontinue the reception of his addreſs, his intentions ſhould be made known. He was enlarging upon this topic, when we heard a footſtep approaching us; and looking up ſaw Mr. Boyer within a few paces of the arbor.—Confuſion ſeized us both! We roſe involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032142_0132_0FF1556312AE8FF0"/>
from our ſeats, but were mute as ſtatues! He ſpoke not a word, but caſting a look of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignant accuſation at me, a glance which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated my very ſoul, turned on his heel, and walked haſtily back to the houſe.</p>
               <p>I ſtood a few moments, conſidering what courſe to take, though ſhame and regret had almoſt taken from me the power of thought.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford took my hand. I withdrew it from him. I <hi>muſt</hi> leave you, ſaid I. Where will you go? ſaid he. I will go and try to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve my character. It has ſuffered greatly by this fatal interview.</p>
               <p>He threw himſelf at my feet and exclaimed, leave me not Eliza, I conjure you not to leave me. Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. I flew precipitately by him, and went into the parlor, where I found Mr. Boyer and my mamma, the one traverſing the room in the greateſt agitation; the other in flood of tears! Their appearance affected me; and I wept like an infant! when I had a little recovered myſelf, I begged him to ſit down; He anſwered no. I then told him, that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unjuſtifiable my conduct might appear, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I might explain it to his ſatisfaction, if he would hear me; that my motives were inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though they doubtleſs wore the aſpect of criminality, in his view. He ſternly replied, that no palliation could avail; that my motives were ſufficiently notorious! He accuſed me of treating him ill, of rendering him the dupe of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032142_0133_0FF15583CBDED568"/>
coquetting artifice, of having an intrigue with Major Sanford, and declared his determination to leave me for ever, as unworthy of his regard, and incapable of love, gratitude, or honor!—There was too much reaſon in ſupport of his accuſations for me to gainſay them, had his impetuoſity ſuffered me to attempt it.</p>
               <p>But in truth I had no inclination to ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. My natural vivacity had forſaken me; and I liſtened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language, which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment inſpired. He took a very ſolemn and affectionate leave of my mamma; thanking her for her politeneſs, and wiſhing her much future felicity. He attempted to addreſs me, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſomewhat in the ſame way but his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility overcome him; and he only took my hand, and bowing in ſilence, departed.</p>
               <p>The want of reſt for two long nights togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the exerciſe of mind, and conflict of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which now tortured my breaſt, were too much for me to ſupport!</p>
               <p>When I ſaw that he was gone; that he had actually forſaken me, I fainted. My mamma, with the aſſiſtance of the maid, ſoon reſtored me.</p>
               <p>When I opened my eyes, and beheld this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable and tender parent, watching and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with the moſt anxious concern; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one reproachful word, without one accuſing look, my reflections upon the part I had act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in defeating her benevolent wiſhes, were
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032142_0134_0FF155718E20A360"/>
exquiſitely afflictive! But we mutually forbore to mention the occaſion of my illneſs; and I complied with her advice to take ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and retire to my chamber. I am ſo much fatigued by the exertions of the day, that reſt is abſolutely neceſſary; and I lay aſide my pen to ſeek it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday Morning.</hi> When I ſhall again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the balmy influence of ſleep, I know not. It has abſolutely forſaken me at preſent. I have had a moſt reſtleſs night. Every awakening idea preſented itſelf to my imagination; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er I had ſuſtained a real loſs in Mr. Boyer's departure; reflections on my own miſconduct, with the cenſure of my friends, and the ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured remarks of my enemies, excited the moſt painful anxiety in my mind!</p>
               <p>I am going down, but how ſhall I ſee my mamma? To her will I confeſs my faults, in her maternal breaſt repoſe my cares, and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct. Had I done this before, I might have eſcaped this trouble, and ſaved both her and myſelf many diſtreſſing emotions!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday Evening.</hi> I have had a long conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with my mamma, which has greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved my mind. She has ſoothed me with the moſt endearing tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>Mr. Atkins, with whom Mr. Boyer lodged, while in town, called here this afternoon. I did not ſee him, but he told my mamma that Mr. Boyer had returned home, and left a letter
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032142_0135_0FF154BA1BFBD568"/>
for me, which he had promiſed to convey with his own hand. By this letter I am convinced that the dye is abſolutely caſt, with reſpect to him, and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or ſucceſsful. He has penetrated the cauſe of my proceedings; and ſuch is his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, that I am inclined not much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret his avoiding another interview.</p>
               <p>My excuſes would be deemed utterly inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and truth would not befriend and juſtify me.</p>
               <p>As I know you are impatient to hear from me, I will now diſpatch this long letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other addition, than that I am your ſincere friend,</p>

               <p>WELL, Charles, the ſhow is over, as we yankees ſay; and the girl is my own. That is, if I will have her. I ſhall take my own time for that, however. I have carried my point, and am amply revenged on the whole poſſe of thoſe dear friends of her's. She was entangled by a promiſe (not to marry this prieſt without my knowledge,) which her conſcience would not let her break. Thank God, I have no conſcience. If I had, I believe it would make wretched work with me! I ſuppoſe ſhe intended to have one, or the other of us; but preferred me. I have eſcaped the nooſe, this time, and I'll be fairly hanged, if I ever get ſo near it again. For indeed Charles, I was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly alarmed. I watched all their motions; and the appearances of harmony between them awakened all my activity and zeal. So great was my infatuation, that I verily believe I ſhould have aſked her in marriage, and riſked the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, rather than to have loſt her!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="unknown:032142_0137_0FF15565CA8F8590"/>
I went to the houſe, while Mr. Boyer was in town, but her mamma refuſed to call her, or to acquaint her that I was there. I then wrote a deſpairing letter, and obtained a conference with her in the garden. This was a fortunate event for me. True, Eliza was very haughty, and reſolutely inſiſted on immediate declaration or rejection. And I cannot ſay what would have been the reſult, if Mr. Boyer had not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized us together. He gave us a pretty harſh look and retired without ſpeaking a word.</p>
               <p>I endeavored to detain Eliza, but in vain. She left me on my knees, which are always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bend on ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>This finiſhed the matter, it ſeems. I roſe, and went into a near neighbor's to obſerve what happened; and in about half an hour ſaw Mr. Boyer come out, and go to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>This, ſaid I to myſelf, is a good omen. I went home, and was informed next day, that he had mounted his horſe and departed.</p>
               <p>I heard nothing more of her till yeſterday, when I determined to know how ſhe ſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards me. I therefore paid her a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, her mamma being luckily abroad.</p>
               <p>She received me very placidly, and told me, on inquiry, that Mr. Boyer's reſentment at her meeting me in the garden was ſo great, that he had bid her a final adieu. I congratulated my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on having no rival; hoped that her favor would now be unbiaſſed, and that in due time I ſhould reap the reward of my fidelity. She
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032142_0138_0FF154A0DAB03AC8"/>
begged me not to mention the ſubject; ſaid, ſhe had been perplexed by our competition, and wiſhed not to hear any thing further about it at preſent. I bowed in obedience to her commands and changed the diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I informed her, that I was about taking a tour to the ſouthward; that I ſhould be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeveral months, and truſted that on my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn her embarraſſments would be over.</p>
               <p>I left her with regret. After all, Charles, ſhe is the <hi>ſummum bonum</hi> of my life. I muſt have her in ſome way or other. No body elſe ſhall, I am reſolved.</p>
               <p>I am making preparations for my journey; which between you and me, is occaſioned by the proſpect of making a ſpeculation, by which I hope to mend my affairs. The voyage will at leaſt leſſen my expenſes, and ſcreen me from the importunity of creditors till I can look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR ELIZA,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THROUGH the medium of my friends at Hartford I have been informed of the progreſs of your affairs, as they have tranſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The detail which my ſiſter gave me of your ſeparation from Mr. Boyer was painful; as I had long contemplated a happy union<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you. But ſtill more diſagreeable ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions poſſeſſed my breaſt, when told that you had ſuffered your lively ſpirits to be depreſſed, and reſigned yourſelf to ſolitude and dejection!</p>
               <p>Why, my dear friend, ſhould you allow this event thus to affect you? Heaven, I doubt not, has happineſs ſtill in ſtore for you — greater than you could have enjoy — connection. If the conviction of any miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct on your part, give you pain, diſſipate it by the reflection, that unerring rectitude is not the lot of mortals, that few are to be found who have not deviated in a greater or leſs degree from the maxims of prudence. Our
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032142_0140_0FF154BBBB2C5C78"/>
greateſt miſtakes may teach leſſons which will be uſeful through life.</p>
               <p>But I will not moralize. Come and ſee us; and we will talk over the matter once, and then diſmiſs it for ever. Do prevail on your mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma to part with you a month or two, at leaſt, I wiſh you to witneſs how well I manage my nurſery buſineſs. You will be charmed with little Harriot. I am already enough of the mother to think her a miniature of beauty and perfection.</p>
               <p>How natural, and how eaſy the tranſition from one ſtage of life to another! Not long ſince I was a gay, volatile girl; ſeeking ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in faſhionable circles and amuſements; but now I am thoroughly domeſticated. All my happineſs is centered within the limits of my own walls; and I grudge every moment that calls me from the pleaſing ſcenes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life. Not that I am ſo ſelfiſh as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my friends from my affection or ſociety. I feel intereſted in their concerns, and enjoy their company. I muſt own, however, that conjugal and parental love are the main ſprings of my life. The conduct of ſome mothers in depriving their helpleſs offſpring of the care and kindneſs which none but a mother can feel, is to me unaccountable. There are many nameleſs attentions which nothing ſhort of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal tenderneſs, and ſolicitude can pay; and for which the endearing ſmiles, and progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

Her parents have been ſhamefully deficient in her educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but have ſecured to her what they think the chief good; not conſidering that happineſs is by no means the invariable attendant of wealth.</p>

               <p>I AM extremely depreſſed, my dear Lucy! The agitating ſcenes, through which I have lately paſſed, have broken my ſpirits, and rendered me unfit for ſociety.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford has viſited me, and taken his leave. He is gone to the ſouthward on a tour of two or three months. I declined any further converſation with him, on the ſubject of love. At preſent, I wiſh not to hear it mentioned by any one.</p>
               <p>I have received a very friendly and conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory letter from Mrs. Richman.

               <p>It is a common obſervation, that we know not the value of a bleſſing but by deprivation.</p>
               <p>This is ſtrictly verified in my caſe. I was inſenſible of my regard for Mr. Boyer, till this fatal ſeparation took place. His merit and

               <p>Mrs. Richman adviſes me to write to Mr. Boyer, and I have concluded to act according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If it anſwer no other purpoſe, it will be a relief to my mind. If he ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

may at leaſt recal his eſteem, and that will be a ſatisfaction to my conſcious mind.</p>
               <p>I wonder what has become of Major San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford! Has he too forſaken me? Is it poſſible for him wilfully to neglect me? I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain injurious a ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>Yet, If it were the caſe, it would not affect me like Mr. Boyer's diſaffection; for I frankly own, that my fancy, and a taſte for gaity of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> induced me to cheriſh the idea of a connection with Major Sanford: while Mr. Boyer's real merit has imprinted thoſe ſentiments of eſteem and love in my heart, which time can never ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of two, or three, more than twelve months have elapſed, and I have not received a line from Major Sanford in all that time, which I fully expected, though he made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of writing; nor have I heard a ſyllable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, except a report circulated by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that he is one the point of marrying, which I do not believe. No, it is impoſſible! I am perſuaded that his paſſion for me, was ſincere, however deceitful he may have been with others. But I will not beſtow an anxious thought upon him. My deſign relative to Mr. Boyer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands my whole attention.</p>
               <p>My hopes and fears alternately prevail, and my reſolution is extremely fluctuating. How It finally terminates you ſhall hear in my next. Pray write to me ſoon. I ſtand in need of

the conſoling power of friendſhip. Nothing can beguile my penſive hours, and exhilerate my drooping ſpirits, like your letters.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is partly in compliance with your deſire, in your laſt letter to me, in which you tell me, "that when I am convinced of the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of your conduct, and become a convert to your advice, you ſhall be happy to hear it;" and partly from a wiſh to inform you, that ſuch is in truth my preſent ſtate of mind, that I now write to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:032142_0147_0FF1552ED5FF4960"/>
I cannot but hope that this letter coming from the hand which you once ſought, will not be unacceptable.</p>
               <p>Pope very juſtly obſerves, "that every year is a critic on the laſt." The truth of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is fully exemplified in my years! How ſeverely this condemns the follies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, my own heart alone can teſtify!</p>
               <p>I ſhall not offer any palliation, or apology for my miſconduct. You told me it admitted none. I frankly confeſs it; and if the moſt humble acknowledgement of my offences, with an aſſurance that they have coſt me the deepeſt repentance, can in any degree atone for them, I now make that atonement. Caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the veil of diſſimulation, I ſhall write with frankneſs; believing you poſſeſſed of more honor than to make any ungenerous uſe of the confidence repoſed in you.</p>
               <p>To ſay that I ever eſteemed you, may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, appear paradoxical, when compared with certain circumſtances which occurred during our acquaintance; but to aſſert that I loved you, may be deemed ſtill more ſo. Yet theſe are real facts, facts of which I was then ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and by which I am now more than ever affected.</p>
               <p>I think you formerly remarked, that abſence ſerved but to heighten real love. This I find by experience. Need I bluſh to declare theſe ſentiments, when occaſion like this, calls for the
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032142_0148_0FF154E21F88B160"/>
avowal? I will go even further, and offer you that heart which once you prized; that hand which you once ſolicited. The ſentiments of affection, which you then cultivated, though ſuppreſſed, I flatter myſelf are not wholly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated. Suffer me then to rekindle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent flame; to revive that friendſhip and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, which I have ſo fooliſhly neglected. The endeavor of my future life ſhall be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward your benevolence, and perhaps we may yet be happy together.</p>
               <p>But let not this offer of myſelf conſtrain you. Let not pity influence your conduct. I would have you return, if that pleaſing event take place, a voluntary act. Receive or conſent not to confer happineſs.</p>
               <p>I thought it a duty which I owed to you, and to myſelf, to make this expiation; this ſacrifice of female reſerve, for the wrongs I have done you. As ſuch I wiſh you to accept it; and if your affections are intirely alienated, or otherwiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; if you cannot again command the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and love which I would recal, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe me for the conceſſions I have made. Think as favorably of my paſt faults, and of my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſpoſition, as charity will allow. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, if poſſible, to be my friend, though you ceaſe to be my lover.</p>
               <p>Should this letter find you in the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of happineſs, let not the idea of your once loved Eliza, thus intruding itſelf again upon

               <p>AS I was ſitting laſt evening in my ſtudy, a letter was handed me by a ſervant; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I no ſooner caſt my eye, than I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized, with ſurpriſe, the hand and ſeal of my once loved, but to me long loſt Eliza! I open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it haſtily, and with ſtill greater ſurpriſe, read the contents!</p>

                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:032142_0150_0FF15543CDAB4C50"/>
You write with frankneſs. I ſhall anſwer in the ſame manner.</p>
               <p>On reviewing our former intercourſe, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that I have not an accuſing thought in my heart. The regard which I felt for you was tender and animated, but it was not of that paſſionate kind which ends in death of deſpair. It was governed by reaſon, and had a nobler object in view, than mere ſenſual gratification. It was excited by the appearance of excellent qualities. Your conduct, at length, convinced me it was miſplaced; that you poſſeſſed not, in reality, thoſe charms which I had fondly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to you. They were inconſiſtent, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, with that artifice and diſſimulation, of which you ſtrove to render me the dupe. But thank heaven, the ſnare was broken. Mr eyes were opened to diſcover your folly; and my heart, engaged, as it was, exerted reſolution and ſtrength to burſt aſunder the chain by which you held me enſlaved, and to aſſert the rights of an injured man.</p>
               <p>The parting ſcene, you remember. I reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly bade you adieu. I tore myſelf from you, determined to eradicate your idea from my breaſt! Long and ſevere was the ſtruggle. I at laſt vanquiſhed, as I thought, every tender paſſion of my ſoul, (for they all centered in you) and reſigned myſelf to my God, any my duty; devoting thoſe affections to friendſhip, which had been diſappointed in love. But they are
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032142_0151_0FF154E4D6282A38"/>
again called into exerciſe. The virtuous, the amiable, the accompliſhed Maria Selby poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my entire confidence and eſteem; and I truſt I am not deceived, when I think her highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of both. With her I expect ſoon to be united in the moſt ſacred and endearing of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man relations; with her to paſs my future days in ſerenity and peace.</p>
               <p>Your letter, therefore, came too late; were there no other obſtacle to the renewal of our connection. I hope at the cloſe of life, when we take a retroſpect of the paſt, that neither of us ſhall have reaſon to regret our ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Permit me to add, that for your own ſake, and for the ſak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For although to adopt your own phraſe, I ceaſe to ſtyle. myſelf your lover, among the number of your friends, I am happy to be reckoned. As ſuch, let me conjure you, by all that is dear and deſirable, both in this life, and another, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, with undeviating exactneſs, to the path of rectitude and innocence; and to improve the noble talents, which heaven has liberally beſtowed upon you, in rendering yourſelf ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and uſeful to your friends.

               <p>HEALTH, placid ſerenity, and every domeſtic pleaſure, are the lot of my friend; while I, who once poſſeſſed the means of each, and the capacity of taſting them, have been toſſed upon the waves of folly, till I am ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrecked on the ſhoals of deſpair!</p>
               <p>Oh my friend, I am undone! I am ſlighted, rejected by the man who once ſought my hand, by the man who ſtill retains my heart! and what adds an inſupportable poignancy to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, is ſelf-condemnation! From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward torture, where ſhall I ſlee? Where ſhall I ſeek that happineſs which I have madly trifled away?</p>
               <p>The incloſed letters, <note n="*" place="bottom">See the two preceding Letters,</note> will ſhow you whence this tumult of ſoul ariſes. But I blame not Mr. Boyer. He has acted nobly. I approve his conduct, though it operates my ruin!</p>

joy be their portion, both here and hereafter! But what are now my proſpects? what are to be the future enjoyments of my life?</p>
               <p>Oh that I had not written to Mr. Boyer! by confeſſing my faults, and by avowing my partiality to him, I have given him the power of triumphing in my diſtreſs; of returning to my tortured heart all the pangs of ſlighted love! and what have I now to conſole me? my bloom is decreaſing; my health is ſenſibly impaired.

I am therefore, obliged to conceal my diſquietude, and appear as cheerful as poſſible in her company, though my heart is ready to burſt with grief!</p>

                     <l>"To you, great gods, I make my laſt appeal;</l>
                     <l>O, clear my conſcience, or my crimes reveal!</l>
                     <l>If wand'ring through the paths of life I've run;</l>
                     <l>And backward trod the ſteps, I ſought to ſhun,</l>

                     <l>Impute my errors to your own decree;</l>
                     <l>My feet were guilty, but my heart was free."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe you will tell me, that the fate I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, through the poet, is only the reſult of my own imprudence. Well, be it what it may; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the impulſe of my own paſſions, or ſome higher efficiency; ſure I am, that I pay dear for its operation.</p>
               <p>I have heard it remarked, that experience is the preceptor of fools; but that the wiſe need not its inſtruction. I believe I muſt be content to rank accordingly, and endeavor to reap ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from its tuition.</p>
               <p>Julia urges me to reviſit the ſcenes of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and pleaſure; in which ſhe tells me, ſhe is actuated by ſelfiſh motives. She wiſhes it for her own ſake. She likes neither to be ſecluded from them, nor to go alone. I am ſometimes half inclined to ſeek, in feſtive mirth, a refuge from thought and reflection. I would eſcape, if poſſible, from the idea of Mr. Boyer. This I have never been able to accompliſh, ſince he dropped a tear upon my hand, and left me. I marked the ſpot with my eye; and

twenty times in a day, do I view it, and fondly imagine it ſtill there! How could I give him pain! I hope his happy Maria never will! I hope ſhe will reward that merit, which I have ſlighted! but I forbear. This theme carries away my pen, if I but touch upon it. And no wonder; for it is the ſole exerciſe of my thoughtſ! Yet I will endeavor to divert them, Send me ſome new books; not ſuch, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as will require much attention. Let them be plays or novels, or any thing elſe, that will amuſe and extort a ſmile.</p>
               <p>Julia and I have been rambling in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. She inſiſted upon my going with her into the arbor, where I was ſurpriſed with Major Sanford. What a croud of painful ideas ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon my imagination! I believe ſhe repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her raſhneſs. But no more of this. I muſt lay aſide my pen; for I can write nothing elſe!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU commanded me to write you reſpecting Miſs Wharton; and I obey. But I cannot deſcribe to you the ſurpriſing change, which ſhe has undergone. Her vivacity has entirely forſaken her; and ſhe has actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, what ſhe once dreaded above all things, a recluſe! She flies from company, as eagerly as ſhe formerly ſought it! Her mamma is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly diſtreſſed by the ſettled melancholy which appears in her darling child; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of us think it beſt to mention the ſubject to her. We endeavor to find means to amuſe her; and we flatter ourſelves that the proſpect of ſucceſs rather increaſes. It would add great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my happineſs, to contribute, in any degree, to reſtore her to herſelf, to her friends, and to ſociety.</p>
               <p>We are all invited to dine abroad to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and to oblige me, ſhe has conſented to go.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:032142_0162_0FF1552A7AE04FB8"/>
Pray madam, write to her often. Your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may do much for her. She is ſtill feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alive to the power of friendſhip; and none can exerciſe it upon her to greater acceptance, or with more advantage than yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford's houſe is undergoing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete repair. The report is, that he is ſoon to be married. Miſs Wharton has heard, but does not believe it. I hope, for her ſake, it will prove true. For, at any rate, he is about returning; and from her mamma's account of his paſt conduct towards Eliza, were he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unconnected, he would probably renew his attentions; and though they might end in marriage, her happineſs would not be ſecured. She has too nice a ſenſe of love and honor, to compound with his licentious principles. A man, who has been diſſolute before marriage, will very ſeldom be faithful afterwards.</p>
               <p>I went into Eliza's chamber the other day, and found her with a miniature picture in her hand. You pretend to be a phyſiognomiſt, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, ſaid ſhe. What can you trace in that countenance? I gueſſed whoſe it was; and looking wiſtfully at it, replied, I believe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal is an artful, deſigning man. He looks to me like a Cheſterfieldian. Pray who is he? Major Sanford, ſaid ſhe; and I am afraid you have hit his character exactly. Sure I am, that the appearance of thoſe traits in it has made my heart ache! She wept, as ſhe ſpoke it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:032142_0163_0FF154B4510711E0"/>
Poor girl! I wiſh he may never give you greater cauſe to weep! She is ſtrongly blind to the vices and imperfections of this man. Though naturally penetrating, he has ſome how or other, caſt a deceptious miſt over her imagination, with reſpect to himſelf. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes neither to love, nor eſteem him; and owns that his ungenerous artifice miſlead her in her treatment of Mr. Boyer. Yet ſhe has forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, and thinks him a pleaſing companion!</p>
               <p>How prone to error is the human mind! How much lighter than the breath of zephyrs the operations of fancy! Strange then, it ſhould ever preponderate over the weightier powers of the underſtanding!</p>
               <p>But I will not moralize. My buſineſs here is to diſſipate, not to collect ideas; and I muſt regulate myſelf accordingly.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I RECEIVED yours of the 24th. ult. and thank you for it; though it did not afford me thoſe lively ſenſations of pleaſure, which I uſually feel at the peruſal of your let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It inſpired me both with concern, and chagrin. With concern, leſt your dejection of mind ſhould affect your health; and with chagrin at your apparent indulgence of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. Indeed, my friend, your own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and honor, require you to diſſipate the cloud which hangs over your imagination.</p>
               <p>Riſe then above it; and prove yourſelf ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to the adverſe occurrences which have befallen you. It is by ſurmounting difficulties, not by ſinking under them, that we diſcover our fortitude. True courage conſiſts not in flying from the ſtorms of life; but in braving and ſteering through them with prudence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void

ſolitude. It is the bane of a diſordered mind; though of great utility to a healthy one. Your once favorite amuſements court your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Refuſe not their ſolicitations. I have contributed my mite, by ſending you a few books; ſuch as you requeſted. They are of the lighter kind of reading; yet perfectly chaſte; and if I miſtake not, well adapted to your taſte.</p>
               <p>You wiſh to hear from our theatre. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be well ſupplied with performers this winter. Come and ſee whether they can afford you any entertainment. Laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I attended a tragedy; but never will I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend another. I have not yet been able to eraſe the gloom which it impreſſed upon my mind. It was Romeo and Juliet. Diſtreſſing enough to ſenſibility this! Are there not real woes (if not in our own families, at leaſt among our own friends, and neighbors) ſufficient to exerciſe our ſympathy and pity, without intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing fictitious ones into our very diverſions? How can that be a diverſion, which racks the ſoul with grief, even though that grief be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary. The introduction of a funeral ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, upon the ſtage, is ſhocking indeed!</p>
               <p>Death is too ſerious a matter to be ſported with! An opening grave cannot be a ſource of amuſement to any conſiderate mind! The cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene of life can be no paſtime, when real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized! it muſt therefore awaken painful ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; in the repreſentation!</p>

The circus is a place of faſhionable reſort of late, but not agreeable to me. I think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the delicacy of a lady, even to witneſs the indecorums, which are practiſed there; eſpecially when the performers of equeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trian feats are of our own ſex. To ſee a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an depart ſo far from the female character, as to aſſume the maſculine habit and attitudes; and appear entirely indifferent, even to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals of modeſty, is truly diſguſting, and ought not to be countenanced by our attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, much leſs by our approbation. But ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide this circumſtance, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a pleaſure to ſit a whole evening, trembling with apprehenſion, leſt the poor wight of a horſeman, or juggler, or whatever he is to be called, ſhould break his neck in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to our entertainment.</p>
               <p>With Mr. Bowen's muſeum, I think you were much pleaſed. He has made a number of judicious additions to it, ſince you were here. It is a ſource of rational and refined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement. Here the eye is gratified, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination charmed, and the underſtanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. It will bear frequent reviews without palling on the taſte. It always affords ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new; and for one, I am never a weary ſpectator.</p>

               <p>GRACIOUS Heaven! What have I heard? Major Sanford is married! Yes, the ungrateful, the deceitful wretch, is married! He has forſworn, he has perjured, and given himſelf to another! That, you will ſay, is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrange. It is characteriſtic of the man. It may be ſo; but I could not be convinced of his perfidy, till now!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="unknown:032142_0168_0FF1557D67EB8F08"/>
Perhaps it is all for the beſt. Perhaps, had he remained unconnected, he might ſtill have deceived me; but now I defy his arts!</p>
               <p>They tell me, he has married a woman of fortune. I ſuppoſe he thinks, as I once did, that wealth can enſure happineſs. I wiſh he may enjoy it.</p>
               <p>This event would not affect me at all, were it not for the depreſſion of ſpirits which I feel, in conſequence of a previous diſappointment; ſince which, every thing of the kind agitates and overcomes me. I will not ſee him. If I do, I ſhall betray my weakneſs, and flatter his vanity; as he will doubtleſs think he has the power of mortifying me by his connection with another.</p>
               <p>Before this news diſcompoſed me, I had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to a good degree of cheerfulneſs. Your kind letter, ſeconded by Julia's exertions, had aſſiſted me in regulating my ſenſibility. I have been frequently into company, and find my rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh for it gradually returning.</p>

Varying the ſcene may contribute effectually o diſſipate the gloom of my imagination. I would fly to almoſt any reſort, rather than my own mind. What a dreadful thing it is to be afraid of one's own reflections, which ought to be a conſtant ſource of enjoyment! But I

               <p>WHO do you think is writing to you? Why, it is your old friend, metamorphoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>a married man!</hi> You ſtare, and can hardly credit the aſſertion. I cannot real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize it myſelf; yet, I aſſure you, Charles, it is abſolutely true! Neceſſity, dire neceſſity, forced me into this dernier reſort. I told you, ſome time ago, it would come to this.</p>
               <p>I ſtood aloof, as long as poſſible; but in vain did I attempt to ſhun the nooſe. I muſt
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:032142_0170_0FF155894DAC1B58"/>
either fly to this reſource; or give up all my ſhow, equipage, and pleaſure, and degenerate in to a downright plodding money-catcher, for a ſubſiſtance. I choſe the firſt; and who would not? yet I feel ſome remorſe at taking the girl to wife, from no better motives. She is really too good for ſuch an impoſition. But ſhe muſt blame herſelf, if ſhe ſuffer hereafter for ſhe was viſibly captivated by my external appearance; and wanted but very little ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to confer herſelf, and fortune on ſo charming a fellow. Her parents oppoſed her inclination, for a while, becauſe I was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and rather too gay for their taſte. But ſhe had not been uſed to contradiction, and could not bear it; and therefore they ventured not to croſs her. So I bore off the prize; and a prize ſhe really is. Five thouſand pounds in poſſeſſion, and more in reverſion, if I do not forfeit it. This will compenſate for ſome of my paſt miſtakes, and ſet matters right for the preſent. I think it doing much better than to have taken the little Laurence girl, I told you of, with half the ſum. Beſides, my Nancy is a handſomer, and more agreeable perſon. But that is of little conſequence to me, you know. "Beauty ſoon grows famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iar to the lover." Were I a lover, it would be of no great avail. A lover I am; yet not of my wife. The dart which I received from Miſs Wharton, ſticks faſt in my heart; and I
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032142_0171_0FF155A1C2834B98"/>
aſſure you, I could hardly perſuade myſelf even to appear unfaithful to her. O, Eliza, accuſe me not of infidelity; for your image is my conſtant companion! A thouſand times have I curſed the unpropitious ſtars, which withheld from her a fortune. That would have enabled me to marry her; and with her, even wedlock would have been ſupportable.</p>
               <p>I am told, that ſhe is ſtill ſingle. Her ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber lover never returned. Had he loved as I did, and do, he could not have been ſo precip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate. But theſe ſtoic ſouls are good for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I know of, but

               <p>I want to ſee Eliza, and I muſt ſee her; yet I dread an interview. I ſhall frankly confeſs my motives for marrying; and the reaſons of my conduct, before I went away. I ſhall own that my circumſtances would not allow me to poſſeſs her; and yet that I could not reſign her to another.</p>
               <p>When I make up the matter with her, I ſhall ſolicit her friendſhip for my wife. By this mean I may enjoy her ſociety, at leaſt, which will alleviate the confinement of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate. To my ſpouſe I muſt be as civil as poſſible. I really wiſh ſhe had leſs merit, that I might have a plauſible excuſe for neglecting her.</p>

               <p>A NEW ſcene has opened upon us to day, my dear Mrs. Sumner; a viſit from Major Sanford. My mamma, Miſs Granby, and myſelf, were ſitting together in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Miſs Granby was entertaining us by reading aloud in Millot's elements of hiſtory, when a ſervant rapped at the door, and handed in the following billet.</p>
               <p>"Will Miſs Wharton condeſcend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe a few moments with her once favored Sanford? He is but too ſenſible that he has forfeited all claim to the privilege. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſumes not to requeſt it on the ſcore of merit, or of former acquaintance; but ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits it from her benevolence, and pity."</p>
               <p>I read and ſhowed it to my mamma, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia. What, ſaid I, ſhall I do? I wiſh not to ſee him. His artifice has deſtroyed my peace
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032142_0174_0FF155990ED83B60"/>
of mind; and his preſence may open the wounds which time is cloſing. Act, ſaid my mamma, agreeably to the dictates of your own judgment. I ſee no harm in converſing with him, ſaid Julia. Perhaps it may remove ſome diſagreeable thoughts, which now oppreſs and give you pain. And as he is no longer a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate for your affections, added ſhe, with a ſmile, it will be leſs hazardous than formerly. He will not have the inſolence to ſpeak; nor you the folly to hear, the language of love.</p>
               <p>He was accordingly invited in. When I roſe to go down, I heſſitated, and even trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. I fear, ſaid I, to myſelf, it will be too much for me; yet why ſhould it? Conſcious innocence will ſupport me. This he has not. When I entered the room he ſtepped forward to meet me. Confuſion and ſhame were viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly depicted in his countenance. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me haſtily; and without uttering a word, took my hand. I withdrew it. O! Miſs Wharton, ſaid he, deſpiſe me not. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that I deſerve your diſpleaſure, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; but my own heart has avenged your cauſe. To your own heart, then, ſaid I, I will leave you! But why do you again ſeek an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with one whom you have endeavored to miſlead; with one whom you have treated with unmerited neglect? Juſtice to myſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired my appearing before you; that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing my faults, and obtaining your forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:032142_0175_0FF1555AD398E050"/>
I might ſoften the reproaches of my own mind. Will you be ſeated, ſir? ſaid I. Will you, rejoined he, condeſcend to ſit with me, Eliza? I will, ſir, anſwered I. The rights of hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity I ſhall not infringe. In my own houſe, therefore, I ſhall treat you with civility. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſaid he, you are very ſevere; but I have provoked all the coldneſs and reſerve which you can inflict!</p>
               <p>I am a married man, Eliza. So I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſaid I; and I hope you will never treat your wife with that diſſimulation and falſhood, which you have exerciſed towards me. Would to heaven, exclaimed he, that you were my wife! I ſhould not then fail in my love or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a huſband! Yet ſhe is an amiable girl; and, had I a heart to give her, I might ſtill be happy! but that, alas! I can never recal. Why, then, ſaid I, did you marry her? You were doubtleſs maſter of your own actions. No, ſaid he, I was not. The embarraſſed ſtate of my affairs precluded the poſſibility of acting as I wiſhed. Loving you moſt ardently, I was anxious to prevent your union with another, till I could ſo far improve my circumſtances, as to ſecure you from poverty and want in a connection with me. My regard was too ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere to permit me to deceive you, by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which might have proved unhappy for us both. My pride forbad my telling you the motives of my delay; and I left you to ſee if
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:032142_0176_0FF15538CD9FFDC8"/>
I could place myſelf in a ſituation worthy of your acceptance. This I could not effect; and therefore have run the riſk of my future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by marrying a lady of affluence. This ſecures to me the externals of enjoyment; but my heart, I fear, will never participate it. Yet it affords me ſome degree of ſatisfaction that I have not involved you in diſtreſs. The only alleviation of which my baniſhment from you is capable, is your forgiveneſs. In compaſſion then, refuſe it not! It cannot injure you! To me it will be worth millions! He wept! Yes, Lucy, this libertine; this man of pleaſure and gallantry wept! I really pitied him from my heart. I forgive you, ſaid I, and wiſh you happy; yet, on this condition only, that you never again pollute my ears with the recital of your infamous paſſion. Yes, infamous, I call it, for what ſofter appellation can be given to ſuch profeſſions from a married man? Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor not an idea of me, in future, inconſiſtent with the love and fidelity which you owe your wife; much leſs, preſume to mention it, if you, wiſh not to be deteſted by me; and for ever baniſhed from my preſence. He expreſſed gratitude for his abſolution even upon theſe terms; and hoped his future conduct would entitle him to my friendſhip and eſteem. That, I replied, time only can determine.</p>
               <p>One favor more he begged leave to ſolicit; which was, that I would be a neighbor to his
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032142_0177_0FF155142C12DE10"/>
wife. She was a ſtranger, he ſaid, and would deem my ſociety a particular privilege. This, I told him, I could not grant, at preſent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I might do hereafter. He did not urge it any further, but inquired after my mamma, and expreſſed a wiſh to ſee her. I rung the bell, and ordered her and Miſs Granby to be called. When they came, he was very polite to them both; and, after uſual compliments, told my mamma that he was happy in having obtained my forgiveneſs, to which he was anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to have her ſeal affixed. My daughter, ſaid ſhe, is the injured party; and if ſhe be ſatiſfied, I ſhall not complain. He thanked her for her condeſcention; informed her that he was married, and requeſted her to viſit his wife. We then converſed upon different ſubjects for a ſhort time, and he took his leave: A ſigh eſcaped him as he departed; and a gloom was viſible in his countenance, which I never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before.</p>
               <p>I muſt acknowledge that this interview has given me ſatisfaction. I have often told you that if I married Major Sanford, it would be from a predilecton for his ſituation in life. How wretched muſt have been my lot, had I diſcovered, too late, that he was by no means poſſeſſed of the independence, which I fondly anticipated. I knew not my own heart, when I contemplated a connection with him. Little did I think that my regard for Mr. Boyer was

               <p>I BEGIN to hope we ſhall come to rights here, by and by. Major Sanford has returned; has made us a viſit; and a treaty of peace, and amity (but not of commerce,) is ratified.</p>
               <p>Eliza appears to be rapidly returning to her former cheerfulneſs, if not gaity. I hope ſhe will not diverge too far from her preſent ſedate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſolidity; yet I am not without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of danger, on that ſcore. One extreme commonly ſucceeds another. She tells me, that ſhe aſſiduouſly cultivates her nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural vivacity; that ſhe finds her taſte for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and amuſements increaſing; that ſhe dreads being alone, becauſe paſt ſcenes ariſe to view which vex and diſcompoſe her.</p>
               <p>Theſe are indications of a mind not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly right. I flatter myſelf, however, that the time is not far diſtant, when her paſſions will vibrate with regularity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="unknown:032142_0180_0FF154E8965F7678"/>
I need not repeat to you any thing relative to Major Sanford's conciliatory viſit. Eliza has given you a particular, and I believe, a faithful detail. I was called down to ſee this wonderful man; and diſliked him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I am aſtoniſhed that Eliza's penetrating eye, has not long ſince read his vices in his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenance. I am told by a friend, who has viſited them, that he has an agreeable wife; and I wiſh ſhe may find him a huſband of the ſame deſcription; but I very much doubt the accompliſhment of my wiſh. For I have no charity for theſe reformed rakes.</p>
               <p>We were walking abroad the other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and met Major Sanford and lady. Eliza did not ſee them till they were very near us. She ſtarted, turned pale, and then color<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like crimſon. I cannot but think, a little envy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>kled in her heart. Major Sanford very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to a particular friend; preſenting Eliza. She received her with an eaſy dignity, and bid her welcome to this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Mrs. Sanford anſwered her modeſtly; hoped for the pleaſure of a further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and urged us, as we were not far from their houſe, to return with them to tea. We declined; and, wiſhing each other a good even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, parted. Major Sanford's eyes were rivetted on Eliza, the whole time we were together;
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032142_0181_0FF154A6D2591CF0"/>
and he ſeemed loath to remove them, when we ſeparated. I ſuſpect there is ſome truth in his tale of love. I ſhall therefore diſcourage Eliza from aſſociating with him under any pretext whatever. She appeared more pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and thoughtful than common, as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home; and ſaid little the reſt of the evening; but next morning was as chatty as ever.</p>
               <p>She is warm in the praiſes of Mrs. Sanford, thinks her an accompliſhed woman, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the major could ſuggeſt an idea of marrying her for her money. She intends, ſhe ſays, to viſit her ſoon; and wiſhes me to accompany her. This, for her own ſake, I ſhall defer, as long as poſſible.</p>

               <p>BY Julia's advice, we have neglected the repeated invitations of Major Sanford, to viſit and commence neighborhood with them, till yeſterday; when we received a polite billet, requeſting the honor of our company to dine. My mamma declined going; but ſaid ſhe had no objection to our compliance with the meſſage, if we thought proper. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia and I accordingly went. We found a large company aſſembled in a ſpacious hall, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly furniſhed and decorated. They were all very polite and attentive to me; but none more ſo than Major Sanford and his lady, who jointly ſtrove to diſſipate the penſiveneſs of my mind, which I found it impoſſible to conceal. When we were ſummoned to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the major being near me, offered his hand, and leading me into the dining room, ſeated me at a table furniſhed with all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety which could pleaſe the eye, or regale the
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032142_0183_0FF1553BB96E1278"/>
taſte of the moſt luxurious epicure. The converſation turned on various ſubjects, lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, political, and miſcellaneous. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we had a ball. Major Sanford gave the hand of his wife to a Mr. Grey, alledging that he was a ſtranger, and therefore, entitled to particular attention; and then ſolicited mine for himſelf. I was on the point of refuſing him, but recollecting that it might have the appearance of continued reſentment, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my declaration of forgiving what was paſt, I complied. He was all kindneſs, and aſſiduity; the more ſo, I imagine, with a view to make amends for his former ingratitude and neglect. Tenderneſs is now peculiarly ſoothing to my wounded heart. He took an opportunity of converſing with his wife and me together; hoped ſhe would be honored with my friendſhip, and acquaintance; and begged, for her ſake, that I would not be a ſtranger at his houſe. His Nancy, he ſaid, was far removed from her maternal friends; but I could ſupply their place, if I would gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly undertake the taſk. She joined in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the ſame ſentiments and wiſhes. Alas! Sir, ſaid I, Eliza Wharton is not now what ſhe once was! I labor under a depreſſion of ſpirits, which muſt render my company rather painful than pleaſing to my friends. The idea of what I had been, contraſted with what I then was, touched my ſenſibility;

<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032142_0184_0FF154C9746B9610"/>
and I could not reſtrain the too officious tear from ſtealing down my cheek. He took me by the hand, and ſaid, you diſtreſs me, Miſs. Wharton, indeed, you diſtreſs me! Happineſs muſt, and ſhall attend you! Curſed be the wretch, who could wound a heart like your's!</p>
               <p>Julia Granby now joined us. An inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive concern was viſible in her countenance.</p>
               <p>I related this converſation to her, after we returned home; but ſhe approved it not.</p>
               <p>She thought Major Sanford too particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attentive to me, conſidering what had previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly happened. She ſaid it would be noticed by others, and the world would make unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable remarks upon any appearance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy between us. I care not for that, ſaid I. It is an ill-natured, miſjudging world; and I am not obliged to ſacrifice my friends to its opinion. Were Major Sanford a ſingle man I ſhould avoid his ſociety; but ſince he is married; ſince his wife is young, beautiful and lovely, he can have no temptation to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure me. I therefore ſee no evil, which can ariſe from the cultivation of friendſhip with <hi>her,</hi> at leaſt. I reliſh company ſo little, that I may ſurely be indulged in ſelecting that which is moſt agreeable to my taſte, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my becoming quite a miſanthrope.</p>
               <p>I thank you, my dear Mrs. Sumner, for your kind letter. It was a ſeaſonable cordial to my mind; and I will endeavor to profit by your advice.</p>

Your remarks on the public entertainments are amuſing, and as far as I am a judge, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſt.</p>
               <p>I think it a pity they have not female man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers for the theatre. I believe it would be under much better regulations, than at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>

               <p>REJOICE with me, my friend, that I have made my peace with the miſtreſs of my heart. No devotee could have been more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in his penitence, than I was in mine. Indeed, Charles, I never knew I had ſo much ſenſibility before! Why, I was as much a woman as the very weakeſt of the ſex!</p>
               <p>But I dealt very plainly and ſincerely with her, to be ſure; and this atones for all paſt offences, and procures abſolution for many others yet to be committed.</p>
               <p>The dear girl was not inexorable; ſhe was as placable and condeſcending as I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, conſidering the nature of the crime, which was apparently ſlighting her perſon and charms, by marrying another. This you know is one of the niceſt points with the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Attack their honor, that is their chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and they conſtrue it to be the effect
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:032142_0187_0FF1558EA2EC9128"/>
of exceſſive love, which hurries you a little beyond the bounds of prudence. But touch their vanity, by preferring another, and they will ſeldom pardon you. You will ſay I am very ſevere upon the ſex. And have I not reaſon to be ſo, ſince I have found ſo many frail ones among them. This, however, is departing from my ſubject.</p>
               <p>Eliza is extremely altered! Her pale deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed countenance, with the ſedateneſs of her manners, ſo different from the lively glow of health, cheerfulneſs and activity which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly animated her appearance and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtruck me very diſagreeably.</p>
               <p>With all my gallantry, and fluency in love matters, I was unable to acquit myſelf tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; or to addreſs her with any degree of eaſe and confidence. She was very calm; and ſpoke with great indifference about my marriage, &amp;c. which mortified me exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yet I cannot conſent to believe that her preſent depreſſion of ſpirits ariſes ſolely from Mr. Boyer's infidelity. I flatter myſelf that I am of ſufficient conſequence to her, to have contributed in a degree.</p>
               <p>When I inquired after her health, ſhe told me ſhe had been indiſpoſed; but was now much better. This indiſpoſition, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was purely mental; and I am happy to obſerve her recovering from it. I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſit her, ſometimes with, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032142_0188_0FF1557A1292DA30"/>
without my wife; of whom, through my mediation, ſhe has become a favorite. I have married, and according to the general opinion, reformed. Yet I ſuſpect my refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, like moſt others of the kind, will prove inſtable as "the baſeleſs fabric of a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion;" unleſs I baniſh myſelf entirely from her ſociety. But that I can never do; for ſhe is ſtill lovely in my eyes, and I cannot control my paſſions. When abſent from her, I am loſt to every thing but her idea. My wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to rally me on my fondneſs for Miſs Wharton. She aſked me the other day if ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> fortune? No, ſaid I, if ſhe had I ſhould have married her. This wounded her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. I repented of my ſincerity, and made my peace for that time. Yet, I find myſelf growing extremely irritable, and ſhe muſt take heed how ſhe provokes me; for I do not love her; and I think the name of wife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more and more diſtaſteful to me every day.</p>
               <p>In my mind Eliza has no competitor. But I muſt keep up appearances, though I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to regain her love. I imagine that the enjoyment of her ſociety, as a neighbor and friend may content me for the preſent, and render my condition ſupportable.</p>
               <p>Farewell, Charles. I hope you will never be embarraſſed with a wife, nor lack ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite nymph to ſupply the place of one.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I INTENDED, this week, to have journeyed to Boſton with Julia Granby; but my reſolution fails me. I find it painful even to think of mixing again with the gay multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I believe the melancholy reflections, by which I am oppreſſed, will be more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, if not more eaſily ſurmounted, by tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they are rendered familiar, than by going from them awhile, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning.</p>
               <p>Julia will therefore go without me. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy her no enjoyment there, except your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtitution of friendſhip in the place of love for Major Sanford, I find productive of agreeable ſenſations. With him, he aſſures me, it is a far more calm, and rational pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. <hi>He</hi> treats me with the affection and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of a brother; and his <hi>wife,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds him in profeſſions of regard, with all the conſoling ſoftneſs, and attention of a ſiſter. Indeed, their politeneſs has greatly contributed
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032142_0190_0FF155801934A6E8"/>
to revive the cheerfulneſs of my natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>I believe the major's former partiality to me, as a lover, is intirely obliterated; and for my part, I feel as little reſtraint in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and his lady's, as in that of any other in the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>I very much regret the departure of Julia; and hope you will permit her to return to me again, as ſoon as poſſible. She is a valuable friend. Her mind is well cultivated; and ſhe has treaſured up a fund of knowledge and information, which renders her company both agreeable and uſeful in every ſituation of life. We lately ſpent the afternoon and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Mr. Smith's. They had a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of viſitants; and among the reſt, Major Sanford. His wife was expected, but did not come, being indiſpoſed.</p>
               <p>I believe, my friend, you muſt excuſe me if my letters are ſhorter than formerly. Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not ſo agreeable to me as it uſed to be. I love my friends as well as ever; but I think they muſt be weary of the gloom and dulneſs which pervades my preſent correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. When my pen ſhall have regained its original fluency and alertneſs, I will reſume and prolong the pleaſing taſk.</p>
               <p>I am, my dear Lucy, your's moſt affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>AGREEABLY to your deſire, every art has been tried, every allurement held out, every argument uſed, and every plan adopted which Mrs. Wharton and I could deviſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Eliza to accompany me to Boſton; but all in vain. Sometimes ſhe has been almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to a compliance with our united requeſt; but ſoon has reſolutely determined againſt it. I have obſerved her ſentiments to be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly changed after being in company with Major Sanford. This alarmſ us exceedingly. Indeed the major ſeems to have inſinuated himſelf into her good opinion more than ever. She is flattered into the belief that his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her is purely the reſult of friendſhip and benevolence.</p>
               <p>I have not ſo favorable an opinion of the man, as to ſuppoſe him capable of either. He
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:032142_0192_0FF154ED251001B0"/>
has become very familiar here. He calls in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every day. Sometimes he but juſt inquires after our health; and ſometimes makes long viſits. The latter is his invariable practice, when he finds Eliza alone. Mrs. Wharton always avoids ſeeing him if ſhe can. She dreads, ſhe ſays, his approaching the houſe.</p>
               <p>I entered the parlor the other day, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuddenly, and found him ſitting very near Eliza, in a low converſation. They both roſe in apparent confuſion, and he ſoon retired.</p>
               <p>When he was gone; I ſuſpect, ſaid I, that the major was whiſpering a tale of love, Eliza? Do you imagine, ſaid ſhe, that I would liſten to ſuch a theme from a married man? I hope not, ſaid I; but his conduct towards you indicates a revival of his former ſentiments, at leaſt. I was not aware of that, ſaid ſhe. As yet I have obſerved nothing in his behavior to me, inconſiſtent with the pureſt friendſhip.</p>
               <p>We drank tea not long ſince at Mr. Smith's. Late in the afternoon, Major Sanford made his appearance to apologize, as he ſaid, for Mrs. Sanford, who was indiſpoſed, and could not enjoy the pleaſure of the viſit ſhe had contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated. He was very gay, the whole even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when the company ſeparated, he was the firſt to preſent his arm to Eliza, who
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032142_0193_0FF155605A0EF1B8"/>
accepted it without heſitation. A Mr. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall attended me, and we endeavored to keep them company; but they evidently choſe to walk by themſelves. Mr. Newhall obſerved, that if Major Sanford were not married, he ſhould ſuſpect he ſtill intended a union with Miſs Wharton. I replied, that their for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> intercourſe having terminated in friendſhip, rendered them more familiar with each other, than with the generality of their acquaintance.</p>
               <p>When we reached the houſe, Mr. Newhall choſe not to go in, and took his leave. I waited at the door for Eliza and Major San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. At ſome little diſtance I ſaw him preſs her hand to his lips. It vexed me exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and no ſooner had they come up, than I ſullenly bade him good night, and walked di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in. Eliza ſoon followed me. I ſat down by the fire in a thoughtful poſture. She did the ſame. In this ſituation we both remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſome time, without ſpeaking a word. At length ſhe ſaid, you ſeem not to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed your walk, Miſs Granby; did you not like your gallant? Yes, ſaid I, very well; but I am mortified that you were not better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. I make no complaint, rejoined ſhe; I was very well entertained. That is what diſpleaſes me, ſaid I; I mean your viſible fondneſs for the ſociety of ſuch a man. Were you averſe to it, as you ought to be, there would be no danger. But he has an alluring
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032142_0194_0FF15546A83E69F8"/>
tongue, and a treacherous heart. How can you be pleaſed and entertained by his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation? to me it appears totally repugnant to that refinement and delicacy for which you have always been eſteemed.</p>
               <p>His aſſiduity, and obtruſion ought to alarm you. You well know what his character has been. Marriage has not changed his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It is only a cloak which conceals it. Truſt him not then, my dear Eliza! If you do, depend upon it, you will find his profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of friendſhip to be mere hypocricy, and deceit! I fear that he is acting over again the ſame unworthy arts, which formerly miſlead you. Beware of his wiles! Your friends are anxious for you. They tremble at your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed regard, and apparent intimacy with that unprincipled man. My friends, ſaid ſhe, are very jealous of me, lately. I know not how I have forfeited their confidence, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred their ſuſpicion. By encouraging that attention, I warmly replied, and receiving thoſe careſſes from a married man, which are due from him to none but his wife! He is a villian, if he deceived her into marriage by inſincere profeſſions of love. If he had then an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her, and has already diſcarded it, he is equally guilty! Can <hi>you</hi> expect ſincerity from the man, who withholds it from an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and deſerving wife? no, Eliza; it is not love, which induces him to entertain you with
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032142_0195_0FF1550DA7F5ACE0"/>
the ſubject! It is a baſer paſſion; and if you diſdain not his artifice; if you liſten to his flattery, you will, I fear, fall a victim to his evil machinations! If he conducted like a man of honor, he would merit your eſteem; but his behavior is quite the reverſe! Yet vile as he is, he would not dare to liſp his inſolent hopes of your regard, if you puniſhed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption with the indignation it deſerves; if you ſpurned from your preſence the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wretch, who would requite your conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion by triumphing in your ruin!</p>
               <p>She now burſt into tears, and begged me to drop the ſubject. Her mind, ſhe ſaid, was racked by her own reflections. She could bear but little. Kindneſs deceived, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſtreſſed her!</p>
               <p>I aſſured her of my good intentions; that as I ſaw her danger, I thought it a duty of the friendſhip and affection I bore her, ſolemnly to warn her againſt it before we parted. We talked over the matter more calmly, till ſhe profeſſed herſelf reſolved in future to avoid his company, and reject his inſinuations.</p>
               <p>The next day, as I walked out, I met Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford. He accoſted me very civilly. I barely bid him good morning, and paſſed on.</p>
               <p>I made it in my way to call at his houſe, and bid Mrs. Sanford adieu; not expecting another opportunity equally favorable. When
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032142_0196_0FF1550F6FEF6878"/>
I entered the parlor, ſhe was playing a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly air on the harpſicord. She roſe, and gave me a polite and graceful reception. I told her, as I was ſoon to leave town, I called to take my leave of her; a compliment, which her attention to me required. Are you going to leave us then, Miſs Granby? ſaid ſhe. I ſhall regret your departure exceedingly. I have ſo few friends in this part of the country, that it will give me ſenſible pain to part with one I ſo highly value.</p>
               <p>I told her in the courſe of converſation, that I expected the pleaſure of ſeeing her yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday at Mr. Smith's; and was very ſorry for the indiſpoſition, which prevented her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring us with her company. Indeed, ſaid ſhe, I did not know I was expected there! Were you there pray? Yes, ſaid I; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Sanford excuſed your not coming, on the account I have mentioned. Well, ſaid ſhe, this is the firſt word I ever heard about it; he told me that buſineſs led him abroad! Did he gallant any lady? O, ſaid I, he was with us all together. We had no particular gallants.</p>
               <p>Seeing curioſity excited, I heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented ſaying any thing of the matter, and waved the ſubject. Little did I ſuſpect him to have been guilty of ſo baſe an artifice! It was evidently contrived to facilitate an interview with Eliza.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="unknown:032142_0197_0FF154B18F0E62A8"/>
When I returned I related this affair to Mrs. Wharton and her daughter. The old lady and I expatiated largely on the vileneſs of this conduct; and endeavored to expoſe it to Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's view in its true colors. She pretended not to juſtify it. Yet ſhe looked as if ſhe wiſhed it in her power.</p>
               <p>I am now preparing for my journey to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; which I muſt however defer another week, for the ſake of a more agreeable paſſage in the ſtage. I regret leaving Eliza! I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at her danger! She has not the reſolution to reſiſt temptation, which ſhe once poſſeſſed. Her mind is ſurpriſingly weakened! She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſenſible of this; yet adds to it by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her own imbecility. You will receive a letter from her with this; though I had much difficulty to perſuade her to write. She has unfortunately become very averſe to this, her once favorite amuſement.</p>
               <p>As I ſhall ſoon have the pleaſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with you perſonally, I conclude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other addition to this ſcroll, than the name of your obliged</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE received your letters, and muſt own to you that the peruſal of them gave me pain. Pardon my ſuſpicions, Eliza: they are excited by real friendſhip. Julia, you ſay, approves not Major Sandford's particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to you. Neither do I. If you recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and examine his converſation in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliatory viſit, you will find it replete with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, for the avowal of which, he ought to be baniſhed from all virtuous ſociety.</p>
               <p>Does he not inſidiouſly declare that you are the only object of his affections; that his union with another was formed from intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed views; and though that other is acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged to be amiable and excellent, ſtill he has not a heart to beſtow, and expects not happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with her? Does this diſcover even the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of amendment? Has he not, by falſe pretenſions, mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ad a virtuous woman, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to form a connection with him? She
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032142_0199_0FF155E2565014F8"/>
waſ a ſtranger to his manner of life; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs allured, as you have been, by flattery, deceit, and external appearance, to truſt his honor; little thinking him wholly devoid of that ſacred tie! What is the reward of her confidence? Inſenſibility to her charms, neglect of her perſon, and profeſſed attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to another!</p>
               <p>Is he the man, my dear Eliza, whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip you wiſh to cultivate? Can that heavenly paſſion reſide in a breaſt, which is the ſeat of treachery, duplicity, and ingratitude? You are too ſenſible of its purity and worth, to ſuppoſe it poſſible. The confeſſions of his own mouth condemn him. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me that he is ſtill the abandoned liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and that marriage is but the cloak of his intrigues. His officious attentions to you are alarming to your friends. You own your mind weakened, and peculiarly ſuſceptible of tender impreſſions. Beware how you receive them from him. Liſten not a moment to his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering profeſſions. It is an inſult upon your underſtanding for him to offer them. It is derogatory to virtue for you to hear them.</p>
               <p>Slight not the opinion of the world. We are dependent beings; and while the ſmalleſt traces of virtuous ſenſibility remain, we muſt feel the force of that dependence, in a greater or leſs degree. No female, whoſe mind is
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:032142_0200_0FF155B4F5F9D730"/>
uncorrupted, can be indifferent to reputation. It is an ineſtimable jewel, the loſs of which can never be repaired. While retained, it affords conſcious peace to our own minds, and enſures the eſteem and reſpect of all around us.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed with the company of ſo diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and faithful a friend, as Julia Granby, ſome deference is certainly due to her opinion and advice. To an enlarged underſtanding a cultivated taſte, and an extenſive knowledg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the world, ſhe unites the moſt liberal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, with a benevolence, and candor of diſpoſition, which render her equally deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of your confidence and affection.</p>
               <p>I cannot relinquiſh my claim to a viſit from you this winter. Marriage has not alieniated, or weakened my regard for my friends. Come, then, to your faithful Lucy. Have you ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows? I will ſooth, and alleviate them. Have you cares? I will diſpel them. Have you pleaſures? I will heighten them. Come then, let me fold you to my expecting heart. My happineſs will be partly ſuſpended till your ſociety render it complete. Adieu.</p>

               <p>I HOPE Mrs. Sumner and you will excuſe my writing but one letter, in anſwer to the number I have received from you both. Writing is an employment, which ſuits me not at preſent. It was pleaſing to me former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore, by recalling the idea of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and events which frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied my pen in happier days, it now gives me pain. Yet I have juſt written a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory letter to Mrs. Richman. She has buried her babe; her little Harriot, of whom ſhe was doatingly fond.</p>
               <p>It was a cuſtom with ſome of the ancients, we are told, to weep at the birth of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>Often ſhould we be impelled to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with this cuſtom, could we foreſee the future incidents of their lives. I think, at leaſt, that the uncertainty of their conduct and

               <p>Our domeſtic affairs are much as when you left us. Nothing remarkable has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the neighborhood, worth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating. The company and amuſements of the town are as uſual, I ſuppoſe. I frequent neither of them. Having incurred ſo much cenſure by the indulgence of a gay diſpoſition, I am now trying what a recluſe and ſolitary mode of life will produce. You will call me ſplenetic. I own it. I am pleaſed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body; ſtill leſs with myſelf. I look around for happineſs, and find it not. The world is to me a deſart! If I indulge myſelf in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary enjoyment, the conſciouſneſs or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of doing amiſs, deſtroys my peace of mind. And, when I have recourſe to books, if I read thoſe of ſerious deſcription, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind me of an awful futurity, for which I am unprepared; if hiſtory, it diſcloſes facts in which I have no intereſt; if novels, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit ſcenes of pleaſure which I have no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of realizing!</p>

               <p>A PARADOX, indeed, is the greater part of your letter to us, my dear Eliza. We had fondly flattered ourſelves that the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly of your mind was exterminated. I hope no new cauſe has revived it. Little did I intend, when I left you, to have been abſent ſo long; but Mrs. Sumner's diſappointment, in her plan of ſpending the ſummer at Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032142_0204_0FF1563F9F2D0888"/>
induced me, in compliance with her requeſt, to prolong my reſidence here.</p>
               <p>But for your ſake, ſhe now conſents to my leaving her, in hopes I may be ſo happy as to contribute to your amuſement.</p>
               <p>I am both pleaſed and inſtructed by the conduct of this amiable woman. As I always endeavored to imitate her diſcreet and modeſt behavior in a ſingle ſtate; ſo likewiſe ſhall I take her for a pattern, ſhould I ever enter a married life. She is moſt happily united. Mr. Sumner, to all the graces and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the gentleman, adds the ſtill more important and eſſential properties of virtue, integrity and honor. I was once preſent when a perſon was recommended to her for a huſband. She objected that he was a rake. True, ſaid the other, he has been, but he has reformed. That will never do for me, rejoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe; I wiſh my future companion to need no reformation: a ſentiment worthy the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our whole ſex; the general adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, I am perſuaded, would have a happy influence upon the manners of the other.</p>
               <p>I hope neither you, nor I, Eliza, ſhall ever be tried by a man of debauched principles. Such characters I conceive to be totally unfit for the ſociety of women, who have any claim to virtue and delicacy.</p>

I intend to be with you, in about a month. If agreeable to you, we will viſit, and ſpend a few weeks with the afflicted Mrs. Richman. I ſincerely ſympathize with her, under her bereavement. I know her fondneſs for you will render your company very conſoling to her; and I flatter myſelf that I ſhould not be an unwelcome gueſt.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE arrived in ſafety, to the manſion of our once happy and ſocial friends. But I cannot deſcribe to you, how changed, how greatly changed this amiable family ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſince I left it. Mrs. Wharton met me at the door; and tenderly embracing, bade me a cordial welcome. You are come, Julia, ſaid ſhe, I hope, to revive and comfort us. We have been very ſolitary during your abſence. I am happy madam, ſaid I, to return; and my endeavors to reſtore cheerfulneſs and content, ſhall not be wanting. But, where is Eliza? By this time we had reached the back parlor, whither Mrs. Wharton led me; and the door being open, I ſaw Eliza, reclined on a ſettee, in a very thoughtful poſture. When I advanced to meet her, ſhe never mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but ſat "like patience on a monument, ſmiling at grief!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:032142_0207_0FF155BFC1E4B9D8"/>
I ſtopped involuntarily, and involuntarily raiſing my eyes to heaven, exclaimed, is that Eliza Wharton! She burſt into tears; and attempted to riſe, but ſunk again into her ſeat. Seeing her thus affected, I ſat down by her; and throwing my arm about her neck, why theſe tears? ſaid I. Why this diſtreſs, my dear friend? Let not the return of your Julia give you pain! She comes to ſooth you with the conſolations of friendſhip! It is not pain, ſaid ſhe, claſping me to her breaſt; it is pleaſure, too exquiſite for my weak nerves to bear! See you not, Julia, how I am altered? Should you have known me for the ſprightly girl, who was always welcome at the haunts of hilarity and mirth? Indeed, ſaid I, you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear indiſpoſed, but I will be your phyſician. Company, and change of air will, I doubt not, reſtore you. Will theſe cure diſorders of the mind, Julia? They will have a powerful ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to remove them, if rightly applied; and I profeſs conſiderable ſkill in that art. Come, continued I, we will try theſe medicines in the morning. Let us riſe early, and ſtep into the chaiſe; and after riding a few miles, call and breakfaſt with Mrs. Freeman. I have ſome commiſſions from her daughter. We ſhall be agreeably entertained there, you know.</p>
               <p>Being ſummoned to ſupper, I took her by the hand, and we walked into another room, where we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032142_0208_0FF1564519DB1848"/>
with her mamma waiting for us. We were all very chatty; even Eliza reſumed, in a degree, her former ſociability. A ſettled gloom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, brooded on her countenance; and a deep ſigh often eſcaped her, in ſpite of her evident endeavors to ſuppreſs it. She went to bed before us; when her mamma in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that her health had been declining for ſome months, that ſhe never complained, but ſtudiouſly concealed every ſymptom of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition. Whether it were any real diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of body, or whether it aroſe from her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſpirits, ſhe could not tell; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed they operated together, and mutually heightened each other.</p>
               <p>I inquired after Major Sanford; whether he and Eliza had aſſociated together during my abſence? Sometimes, ſhe ſaid, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on good terms; and he frequently called to ſee her; at others, they had very little, if any correſpondence at all. She told me that Eliza never went abroad, and was very loath to ſee company at home; that her chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement conſiſted in ſolitary walks; that the dreadful idea of her meeting Major Sanford in theſe walks, had now and then intruded upon her imagination; that ſhe had not the leaſt evidence of the fact, however; and indeed, was afraid to make any inquiries into the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, leſt her own ſuſpicions ſhould be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the major's character was worſe than
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032142_0209_0FF15626FB5E4DA0"/>
ever; that he was much abroad, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently entertained large parties of worthleſs bacchanalians at his houſe; that common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſaid he treated his wife with indifference, neglect, and ill nature; with many other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which it is not material to relate.</p>
               <p>Adieu, my dear friend, for the preſent. When occaſion requires, you ſhall hear again from your affectionate</p>

               <p>GOOD news, Charles, good news! I have arrived to the utmoſt bounds of my wiſhes; the full poſſeſſion of my adorable Eliza! I have heard a quotation from a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain book; but what book it was I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, if I ever knew. No matter for that;
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032142_0210_0FF156081170A920"/>
the quotation is, that "ſtolen waters are ſweet, and bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant." If it has reference to the pleaſures, which I have enjoyed with Eliza, I like it hugely, as Triſtram Shandy's father ſaid of Yorick's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and I think it fully verified.</p>
               <p>I had a long and tedious ſiege. Every meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od which love could ſuggeſt, or art invent, was adopted. I was ſometimes ready to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, under an idea that her reſolution was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable, her virtue impregnable. Indeed, I ſhould have given over the purſuit long ago, but for the hopes of ſucceſs I entertained from her parlying with me, and in reliance upon her own ſtrength, endeavoring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and counteract my deſigns. Whenever this has been the caſe, Charles, I have never yet been defeated in my plan. If a lady will conſent to enter the liſts againſt the antagoniſt of her honor, ſhe may be ſure of looſing the prize. Beſides, were her delicacy genuine, ſhe would baniſh the man at once, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to doubt, which he certainly does, who attempts to vanquiſh it!</p>
               <p>But, far be it from me to criticiſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the ſex. If I gain the rich reward of my diſſimulation and gallantry, that you know is all I want.</p>
               <p>To return then to the point. An unlucky, but not a miraculous accident, has taken place, which muſt ſoon expoſe our amour. What
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032142_0211_0FF15609CB60CFB0"/>
can be done? At the firſt diſcovery, abſolute diſtraction ſeized the ſoul of Eliza, which has ſince terminated in a fixed melancholy. Her health too is much impaired. She thinks her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rapidly declining; and I tremble when I ſee her emaciated form!</p>
               <p>My wife has been reduced very low, of late. She brought me a boy a few weeks paſt, a dead one though.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances give me neither pain nor pleaſure. I am too much ingroſſed by my divinity, to take an intereſt in any thing elſe. True, I have lately ſuffered myſelf to be ſomewhat engaged here and there, by a few jovial lads, who aſſiſt me in diſpelling the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious thoughts, which my perplexed ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion excites. I muſt, however, ſeek ſome means to relieve Eliza's diſtreſs. My finan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are low; but the laſt fraction ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in her ſervice, if ſhe need it.</p>
               <p>Julia Granby is expected at Mrs. Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's every hour. I fear that her inquiſitori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al eye will ſoon detect our intrigue, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct its continuation. Now there's a girl, Charles, I ſhould never attempt to ſeduce; yet ſhe is a moſt alluring object, I aſſure you. But the dignity of her manners forbid all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults upon her virtue. Why, the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of her eye, blaſts in the bud, every thought, derogatory to her honor; and tells you plainly, that the firſt inſinuation of the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032142_0212_0FF1563CD8ED8BC8"/>
kind, would be puniſhed with eternal baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſpleaſure! Of her there is no danger! But I can write no more, except that I am, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I want words to expreſs the emotions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and grief which oppreſs me! But I will endeavor to compoſe myſelf; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the circumſtances as they came to my knowledge.</p>

After my laſt letter, Eliza remained much in the ſame gloomy ſituation as I found her. She refuſed to go, agreeably to her promiſe, to viſit your mamma; and under one pretext or another, has conſtantly declined accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying me any where elſe, ſince my arrival.</p>
               <p>Till laſt Thurſday night ſhe ſlept in the ſame bed with me; when ſhe excuſed herſelf, by ſaying ſhe was reſtleſs, and ſhould diſturb my repoſe. I yeilded to her humor of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a different apartment, little ſuſpecting the real cauſe! She frequently walked out; and though I ſometimes followed, I very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found her. Two or three times, when I happened to be awake, I heard her go down ſtairs; and on inquiry in the morning, ſhe told me that ſhe was very thirſty, and went down for water. I obſerved a degree of heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itancy in her anſwers, for which I could not account. But laſt night, the dreadful myſtery was developed! A little before day, I heard the front door opened with great caution. I ſprang from my bed, and running to the window, ſaw by the light of the moon, a man going from the houſe. Soon after I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a footſtep upon the ſtairs, which carefully approached and entered Eliza's chamber.</p>
               <p>Judge of my aſtoniſhment, my ſurpriſe, my feelings, upon this occaſion! I doubted not but Major Sanford was the perſon I had ſeen; and the diſcovery of Eliza's guilt, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:032142_0214_0FF155BA52F71E28"/>
intrigue, almoſt deprived me of thought and recollection! My blood thrilled with horror at this ſacrifice of virtue! Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while I recovered myſelf, and put on my clothes. But what to do, I knew not; whether to go directly to her chamber, and let her know that ſhe was detected; or to wait another opportunity.</p>
               <p>I reſolved on the firſt. The day had now dawned. I tapped at her door; and ſhe bid me come in. She was ſitting in an eaſy chair by the ſide of her bed. As I entered ſhe withdrew her handkerchief from her face; and looking earneſtly at me, ſaid, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures me the favor of a viſit, at this early hour, Miſs Granby? I was diſturbed, ſaid I, and wiſhed not to return to my bed. But what breaks your reſt; and calls you up ſo unſeaſonably, Eliza? Remorſe, and deſpair, anſwered ſhe, weeping. After what I have witneſſed, this morning, rejoined I, I cannot wonder at it! Was it not Major Sanford whom I ſaw go from the houſe ſome time ago? She was ſilent, but tears ſlowed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. It is too late, continued I, to deny, or evade. Anſwer my queſtion ſincerely; for, believe me, Eliza, it is not malice, but concern for you, which prompts it. I will anſwer you, Julia, ſaid ſhe. You have diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a ſecret, which harrows up my very ſoul! A ſecret, which I wiſhed you to know, but
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032142_0215_0FF155D988142550"/>
could not exert reſolution to reveal! Yes! It was Major Sanford; the man who has robbed me of my peace; who has triumphed in my deſtruction; and who will cauſe my ſun to ſit at noon!</p>
               <p>I ſhudder, ſaid I, at your confeſſion! Wretched, deluded girl! Is this a return for your parent's love, and aſſiduous care; for your friends' ſolicitude, and premonitory ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? You are ruined, you ſay! You have ſacrificed your virtue to an abandoned, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable profligate! And you live to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and bear your infamy! I do, ſaid ſhe; but not long ſhall I ſupport this burden! See you not, Julia, my decaying frame, my faded cheek, and tottering limbs? Soon ſhall I be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to cenſure and reproach! Soon ſhall I be ſequeſtered in that manſion, "where the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the weary are at reſt!" Reſt! ſaid I, can you expect to find reſt either in this world, or another, with ſuch a weight of guilt on your head? She exclaimed, with great emotion, add not to the upbraidings of a wounded ſpirit! Have pity upon me, Oh! my friend, have pity upon me!</p>
               <p>Could you know what I ſuffer, you would think me ſufficiently puniſhed! I wiſh you no other puniſhment, ſaid I, than what may effect your repentance and reformation. But your mother, Eliza! She cannot long be ignorant of
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:032142_0216_0FF15612E4166740"/>
your fall; and I tremble to think of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs! It will break her widowed heart! How has ſhe loved; how has ſhe doated upon you! Dreadful is the requital which you have made! My mother, rejoined ſhe—Oh, name her not! The very ſound is diſtraction to me! Oh! my Julia, if your heart be not ſhut againſt mercy and compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, aid me through this trying ſcene! Let my ſituation call forth your pity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you, undeſerving as I am, to exert it in my behalf!</p>
               <p>During this time, I had walked the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. My ſpirits had been raiſed above their natural key, and were exhauſted. I ſat down, but thought I ſhould have fainted, till a copious flood of tears gave me relief. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za was extremely affected. The appearance of calamity which ſhe exhibited would have ſoftened the moſt obdurate anger. Indeed, I feared ſome immediate and fatal effect. I therefore ſeated myſelf beſide her; and aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an air of kindneſs, compoſe yourſelf, Eliza, ſaid I; I repeat what I told you before, it is the pureſt friendſhip, which thus intereſts me in your concerns. This, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of charity, induces me again to offer you my hand. Yet you have erred againſt knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge and reaſon; againſt warning and counſel. You have forfeited the favor of your friends; and reluctant will be their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs.
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032142_0217_0FF155DB282920C0"/>
I plead guilty, ſaid ſhe, to all your charges. From the general voice I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no clemency. If I can make my peace with my mother, it is all I ſeek or wiſh on this ſide the grave.</p>
               <p>In your benevolence I confide for this. In you, I hope to find an interceſſor. By the remembrance of our former affection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, I conjure you, refuſe me not. At preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, I entreat you to conceal from her this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing tale. A ſhort reprieve is all I aſk. Why, ſaid I, ſhould you defer it? When the painful taſk is over, you may find relief in her lenient kindneſs. After ſhe knows my condition, I cannot ſee her, reſumed ſhe, till I am aſſured of her forgiveneſs. I have not ſtrength to ſupport the appearance of her anger and grief. I will write to her what I cannot ſpeak. You muſt bear the melancholy meſſage, and plead for me, that her diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure may not follow me, to the grave; whither I am rapidly haſtening. Be aſſured, replied I, that I will keep your ſecret as long as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence requires. But I muſt leave you now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your mamma will wonder at our being thus cloſetted together. When opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, we will converſe further on the ſubject. In the mean time, keep yourſelf as compoſed as poſſible, if you would avoid ſuſpicion. She raiſed her claſped hands, and with a piteous look, threw her handkerchief over her face,
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:032142_0218_0FF1560F9D872888"/>
and reclined in her chair, without ſpeaking a word. I returned to my chamber, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to diſſipate every idea which might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end to diſorder my countenance, and break the ſilence I wiſhed to obſerve, relative to what had happened.</p>
               <p>When I went down, Mrs. Wharton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to ſtep up, and inform Eliza that breakfaſt was ready. She told me ſhe could not yet compoſe herſelf ſufficiently to ſee her mamma; and begged me to excuſe her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence as I thought proper. I accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for anſwer to Mrs. Wharton, that Eliza had reſted but indifferently, and being ſomewhat indiſpoſed, would not come down, but wiſhed me to bring her a bowl of choc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, when we had breakfaſted. I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtudiouſly to ſuppreſs even my thoughts concerning her, leſt the emotions they excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be obſerved. Mrs. Wharton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed much of her daughter, and expreſſed great concern about her health and ſtate of mind. Her return to this ſtate of dejection, after having recovered her ſpirits and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in a great degree, was owing, ſhe feared, to ſome cauſe unknown to her; and ſhe entreated me to extract the ſecret, if poſſible. I aſſured her of my beſt endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and doubted not, I told her, but I ſhould be able in a few days to effect what ſhe wiſhed.</p>
               <p>Eliza came down and walked in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032142_0219_0FF15628CC3DED28"/>
before dinner; at which ſhe commanded herſelf much better than I expected. She ſaid that a little ride might, ſhe imagined, be of ſervice to her; and aſked me if I would accompany her a few miles in the afternoon. Her mamma was much pleaſed with the propoſition; and the chaiſe was accordingly ordered.</p>
               <p>I obſerved to Eliza, as we rode, that with her natural and acquired abilities, with her advantages of education, with her opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of knowing the world, and of tracing the virtues and vices of mankind to their origin, I was ſurpriſed at her becoming the prey of an inſidious libertine, with whoſe character ſhe was well acquainted, and whoſe principles ſhe was fully appriſed would prompt him to deceive and betray her. Your ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe is very natural, ſaid ſhe. The ſame will doubtleſs be felt and expreſſed by every one to whom my ſad ſtory is related. But the cauſe may be found in that unreſtrained levity of diſpoſition, that fondneſs for diſſipation and coquetry which alienated the affections of Mr. Boyer from me. This event fatally depreſſed, and enfeebled my mind. I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with avidity the conſoling power of friendſhip, enſnaringly offered by my ſeducer; vainly inferring from his marriage with a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman, that he had ſeen the error of his ways, and forſaken his licentious practices, as he affirmed, and I, fool that I was, believed it!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:032142_0220_0FF15633B9A293E0"/>
It is needleſs for me to rehearſe the perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious arts, by which he inſinuated himſelf into my affections, and gained my confidence. Suffice it to ſay, he effected his purpoſe! But not long did I continue in the deluſive dream of ſenſual gratification. I ſoon awoke to a moſt poignant ſenſe of his baſeneſs, and of my own crime and miſery. I would have f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed from him; I would have renounced him for ever; and by a life of ſincere humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and repentance, endeavored to make my peace with heaven, and to obliterate, by the rectitude of my future conduct, the guilt I had incurred; but I found it too late! My cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances called for attention; and I had no one to participate my cares, to witneſs my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and to alleviate my ſorrows, but him. I could not therefore prevail on myſelf, wholly to renounce his ſociety. At times I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his viſits; always meeting him in the garden, or grove adjoining; till of late, the weather, and my ill health induced me to comply with his ſolicitations, and receive him into the parlor.</p>
               <p>Not long, however, ſhall I be ſubject to theſe embarraſſments. Grief has undermined my conſtitution. My health has fallen a ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice to a diſordered mind. But I regret not its departure! I have not a ſingle wiſh to live. Nothing which the world affords can reſtore my former ſerenity and happineſs!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="unknown:032142_0221_0FF155F1D63D5048"/>
The little innocent I bear, will quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe its mother's ſhame! God Almighty grant it may not live as a monument of my guilt, and a partaker of the infamy and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, which is all I have to bequeath it! Should it be continued in life, it will never know the tenderneſs of a parent; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, want and diſgrace may be its wretched portion! The greateſt conſolation I can have, will be to carry it with me to a ſtate of eternal reſt; which, vile as I am, I hope to obtain, through the infinite mercy of heaven, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſee Major Sanford again. It is nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary to converſe further with him, in order to carry my plan of operation into execution. What is this plan of operation, Eliza? ſaid I. I am on the rack of anxiety for your ſafety. Be patient, continued ſhe, and you ſhall ſoon be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. To morrow I ſhall write my dreadful ſtory to my mother. She will be acquainted with my future intentions; and you ſhall know, at the ſame time, the deſtination of your loſt friend. I hope, ſaid I, that you have formed no reſolution againſt your own life. God forbid, rejoined ſhe. My breath is in his hands, let him do what ſeemeth good in his ſight! Keep my ſecret one day longer, and I will never more impoſe ſo painful a ſilence upon you.</p>

By this time we had reached home. She drank tea with compoſure, and ſoon retired to reſt. Mrs. Wharton eagerly inquired whether I had found out the cauſe of Eliza's melancholy. I have urged her, ſaid I, on the ſubject; but ſhe alledges that ſhe has partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular reaſons for preſent concealment. She has, notwithſtanding, promiſed to let me know, the day after to morrow. Oh, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall not reſt till the period arrives. Dear, good woman, ſaid I to myſelf, I fear you will never reſt afterwards!</p>
               <p>This is our preſent ſituation. Think what a ſcene riſes to the view of your Julia! She muſt ſhare the diſtreſſes of others, though her own feelings, on this unhappy occaſion, are too keen to admit a moment's ſerenity! My greateſt relief is in writing to you; which I ſhall do again by the next poſt. In the mean time, I muſt beg leave to ſubſcribe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſincerely yours,</p>

               <p>ALL is now loſt; loſt, indeed! She is gone! Yes, my dear friend, our beloved Eliza, is gone! Never more ſhall we behold this once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable companion, this once innocent and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py girl. She has forſaken, and, as ſhe ſays, bid an everlaſting adieu to her home, her afflicted parent and her friends! But I will take up my melancholy ſtory where I left it in my laſt.</p>
               <p>She went, as ſhe told me ſhe expected, into the garden, and met her deteſtable paramour. In about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I begged her to compoſe herſelf, and go down to dinner. No; ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not eat; and was not fit to appear before any body. I remonſtrated againſt her immoderate grief; repreſented the injury ſhe muſt ſuſtain by the indulgence of it, and conjured her to ſuppreſs the violence of its emotions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:032142_0224_0FF156148B277FD0"/>
She entreated me to excuſe her to her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma; ſaid ſhe was writing to her, and found it a taſk too painful to be performed with any degree of compoſure; that ſhe was almoſt ready to ſink under the weight of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but hoped and prayed for ſupport, both in this, and another trying ſcene, which awaited her. In compliance with her deſire, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> left her; and told her mamma that ſhe was very buſy in writing; wiſhed not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted at preſent; but would take ſome refreſhment, an hour or two hence. I viſited her again, about four o'clock; when ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more calm and tranquil.</p>
               <p>It is finiſhed, ſaid ſhe, as I entered her apartment, it is finiſhed. What ſaid I, is finiſhed? No matter, replied ſhe; you will know all to morrow, Julia. She complained of exceſſive fatigue, and expreſſed an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She roſe, however, and accompanied her down ſtairs. I met her at the door of the parlor, and taking her by the hand, inquired how ſhe did? Oh, Julia, miſerably indeed, ſaid ſhe. How ſeverely does my mother's kindneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach me! How inſupportably it increaſes my ſelf-condemnation! She wept; ſhe wrung her hands, and walked the room in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt agony! Mrs. Wharton was exceedingly
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:032142_0225_0FF155DE764B8170"/>
diſtreſſed by her appearance. Tell me, Eliza, ſaid ſhe, tell me the cauſe of your trouble! Oh, kill me not by your myſterious conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! My dear child, let me, by ſharing, alleviate your affliction! Aſk me not, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ſaid ſhe; O my mother, I conjure you not to inſiſt on my divulging to night, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſecret which engroſſes and diſtracts my mind! To morrow I will hide nothing from you. I will preſs you no further, rejoined her mamma. Chuſe your own time, my dear; but remember, I muſt participate your grief, though I know not the cauſe.</p>
               <p>Supper was brought in; and we endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to prevail on Eliza to eat, but in vain. She ſat down, in compliance with our united importunities; but neither of us taſted food. It was removed untouched. For a while, Mrs. Wharton and I gazed in ſilent anguiſh upon the ſpectacle of woe, before us! At length, Eliza roſe to retire. Julia, ſaid ſhe, will you call at my chamber, as you paſs to your own? I aſſented. She then approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her mamma, fell upon her knees before her, and claſping her hand, ſaid, in broken accents, Oh madam! can you forgive a wretch, who has forfeited your love, your kindneſs, and your compaſſion? Surely, Eliza, ſaid ſhe, you are not that being! No, it is impoſſible! But however great your tranſgreſſion, be aſſured of my forgiveneſs,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032142_0226_0FF1563565FEF590"/>
my compaſſion, and my continued love! Saying this, ſhe threw her arms about her daughter's neck, and affectionately kiſſed her. Eliza ſtruggled from her embrace, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her with wild deſpair, exclaimed, this is too much! Oh, this unmerited goodneſs is more than I can bear! She then ruſhed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> in ſympathy and aſtoniſhment!</p>
               <p>When Mrs. Wharton had recovered her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a little, ſhe obſerved, that Eliza's brain was evidently diſordered. Nothing elſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, could impel her to act in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary manner. At firſt ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to follow her; but I diſſuaded her from it, alledging, that as ſhe had deſired me to come into her chamber, I thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for me to go alone. She acquieſced; but ſaid ſhe ſhould not think of going to bed; but would, however, retire to her chamber, and ſeek conſolation there. I bade her good night; and went up to Eliza, who took me by the hand and led me to the toilet, upon which ſhe laid the two incloſed letters, the one to her mamma, and the other to me. Theſe, ſaid ſhe, contain what I had not reſolution to expreſs. Promiſe me, Julia, that they ſhall not be opened till to morrow morning. I will, ſaid I. I have thought and wept, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, till I have almoſt exhauſted my ſtrength, and my reaſon. I would now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

a little reſpite, that I may prepare my mind for the account I am one day to give at a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tribunal than that of earthly friends. For this purpoſe, what I have written, and what I ſhall yet ſay to you, muſt cloſe the account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me. I have certainly no bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt you, ſaid I. In my breaſt you are fully acquitted.

               </lg>
               <p>You have forgiven me, Julia; my mother has aſſured me of her forgiveneſs, and what have I more to wiſh? my heart is much light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by theſe kind aſſurances; they will be a great ſupport to me in the dreadful hour which awaits me! What mean you, Eliza? ſaid I. I fear ſome deſperate purpoſe labors in your mind. Oh, no, ſhe replied; you may be aſſured your fear is groundleſs. I know not what I ſay; my brain is on fire; I am all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion! Leave me, Julia; when I have had a little reſt, I ſhall be compoſed. Theſe letters have almoſt diſtracted me; but they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032142_0228_0FF155EF2B0C4F38"/>
and I am comparatively eaſy. I will not leave you, Eliza, ſaid I, unleſs you will go directly to bed, and endeavor to reſt. I will, ſaid ſhe, and the ſooner the better. I tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced her, and retired, though not to bed. About an hour after, I returned to her chamber, and opening the door very ſoftly, found her apparently aſleep. I acquainted Mrs. Wharton with her ſituation, which was a great conſolation to us both; and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged us to go to bed. Having ſuffered much in my mind, and being much fatigued, I ſoon fell aſleep; but the rattling of a carriage, which appeared to ſtop at a little diſtance from the houſe, awoke me. I liſtened a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heard the door turn ſlowly on its hinges. I ſprang from my bed, and reached the window juſt in time to ſee a female handed into a chaiſe by a man who haſtily followed her, and drove furiouſly away! I at once concluded they could be no other than Eliza and Major Sanford. Under this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I made no delay, but ran immediately to her chamber. A candle was burning on the table; but Eliza was not there! I thought it beſt to acquaint her mamma with the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy diſcovery; and ſteping<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment for the purpoſe, found her riſing. She had heard me walk, and was anxious to know the cauſe. What is the matter, Julia, ſaid ſhe; what is the matter? Dear madam,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032142_0229_0FF1560217F719F0"/>
ſaid I, arm yourſelf with fortitude! What new occurrence demands it? rejoined ſhe. Eliza has left us! Left us! what mean you? She is juſt gone! I ſaw her handed into a chaiſe, which inſtantly diſappeared!</p>
               <p>At this intelligence ſhe gave a ſhriek, and fell back on her bed! I alarmed the family, and by their aſſiſtance ſoon recovered her. She deſired me to inform her of every particular relative to her elopement, which I did; and then delivered her the letter which Eliza had left for her. I ſuſpect, ſaid ſhe, as ſhe took it; I have long ſuſpected, what I dared not believe! The anguiſh of my mind has been known only to myſelf, and my God! I could not anſwer her, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. When I had read Eliza's letter to me, and wept over the ſad fall; and, as I fear, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> loſs of this once amiable and accompliſhed girl, I returned to Mrs. Wharton. She was ſitting in her eaſy chair; and ſtill held the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal letter in her hand. When I entered, ſhe fixed her ſtreaming eyes upon me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, O Julia, this is more than the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death! True, madam, ſaid I, your affliction muſt be great; yet that all-gracious Being, who controls every event, is able, and I truſt, diſpoſed to ſupport you! To Him, replied ſhe, I deſire humbly to reſign myſelf; but I think I could have borne almoſt any other calamity with greater reſignation and
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032142_0230_0FF15604C878E260"/>
compoſure than this. With how much comparative eaſe could I have followed her to the grave, at any period ſince her birth! Oh, my child, my child! dear, very dear haſt thou been to my fond heart! Little did I think it poſſible for you to prepare ſo dreadful a cup of ſorrow for your widowed mother! But where, continued ſhe, where can the poor fugitive have fled? Where can ſhe find that protection and tenderneſs, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her great apoſtacy, I ſhould never have withheld? From whom can ſhe receive thoſe kind attentions, which her ſituation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The agitation of her mind had exhauſted her ſtrength; and I prevailed on her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and endeavor to compoſe herſelf to reſt; aſſuring her of my utmoſt exertions to find out Eliza's retreat, and reſtore her to a mother's arms.</p>
               <p>I am obliged to ſuppreſs my own emotions; and to bend all my thoughts towards the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation of Mrs. Wharton's anxiety and grief.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford is from home, as I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I am determined, if he return, to ſee him myſelf, and extort from him the place of Eliza's concealment. Her flight, in her preſent ſtate of health, is inexpreſſibly diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her mother; and, unleſs we find her ſoon, I dread the effects!</p>
               <p>I ſhall not cloſe this, till I have ſeen or
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032142_0231_0FF155B8AEEAF0C8"/>
heard from the vile miſcreant who has involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a worthy family in wretchedneſs!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday Morning</hi>—Two days have elapſed without affording us much relief. Laſt even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I was told that Major Sanford was at home. I immediately wrote him a billet, entreating and conjuring him to let me know where the hapleſs Eliza had fled. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned me the following anſwer.</p>
               <p>"Miſs Granby need be under no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, reſpecting the ſituation of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Eliza. She is well provided for, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently accommodated, and has every thing to make her happy, which love or affluence can give.</p>
               <p>Major Sanford has ſolemnly ſworn not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her retreat. She wiſhes to avoid the accuſations of her friends, till ſhe is better able to bear them.</p>
               <p>Her mother may reſt aſſured of immediate information, ſhould any danger threaten her amiable daughter; and alſo of having ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable notice of her ſafety."</p>
               <p>Although little dependence can be placed upon this man; yet theſe aſſurances have, in a great degree, calmed our minds. We are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, contriving means to explore the refuge of the wanderer; and hope, by tracing his ſteps, to accompliſh our purpoſe. This we have engaged a friend to do.</p>

Would to God I had been totally deprived of that power before ſo fatal a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject required its exertion! Repentance comes too late, when it cannot prevent the evil la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. For your kindneſs, your more than maternal affection towards me, from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to the preſent moment, a long life of filial duty and unerring rectitude could hardly compenſate. How greatly deficient in grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt I appear then, while I confeſs, that precept and example, counſel and advice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and admonition, have been all loſt upon me!</p>

Your kind endeavors to promote my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs have been rapid by the inexcuſable folly of ſacrificing it. The various emotions of ſhame, and remorſe, penitence and regret, which torture and diſtract my guilty breaſt, exceed deſcription. Yes, madam, your Eliza has fallen; fallen, indeed! She has become the victim of her own indiſcretion, and of the intrigue and artifice of a deſigning liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, who is the huſband of another! She is polluted, and no more worthy of her parentage! She flies from you, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her guilt, that ſhe humbly and penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owns; but to avoid what ſhe has never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and feels herſelf unable to ſupport, a mother's frown; to eſcape the heart-rending ſight of a parent's grief, occaſioned by the crimes of her guilty child!</p>
               <p>I have become a reproach and diſgrace to my friends. The conſciouſneſs of having forfeited their favor, and incurred their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and reſentment, induces me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from them the place of my retirement; but, leſt your benevolence ſhould render you anxious for my comfort in my preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I take the liberty to aſſure you that I am amply provided for.</p>
               <p>I have no claim even upon your pity; but from my long experience of your tenderneſs, I preſume to hope it will be extended to me. Oh, my mother, if you knew what the ſtate of
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032142_0234_0FF156174036E6B0"/>
my mind is, and has been, for months paſt, you would ſurely compaſſionate my caſe! Could tears efface the ſtain, which I have brought upon my family, it would, long ſince have been waſhed away! But, alas, tears are vain; and vain is my bitter repentance! It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obliterate my crime, nor reſtore me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and peace! In this life I have no ideas of happineſs. Theſe I have wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned! The only hope which affords me any ſolace, is that of your forgiveneſs. If the deepeſt contrition can make an atonement; if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt pains, both of body and mind, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me to your charity, you will not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable! Oh, let my ſufferings be deemed a ſufficient puniſhment; and add not the inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable weight of a parent's wrath! At preſent, I cannot ſee you. The effect of my crime is too obvious to be longer concealed, to elude the invidious eye of curioſity. This night, therefore, I leave your hoſpitable manſion! This night I become a wretched wanderer from thy paternal roof! Oh, that the grave were this night to be my lodging! Then ſhould I lie down and be at reſt! Truſting in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, through the mediation of his ſon; I think I could meet my heavenly father with more compoſure and confidence, than my earthly parent!</p>
               <p>Let not the faults and miſfortunes of your daughter oppreſs your mind. Rather let the

                  <salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>BY that endearing title you permit me ſtill to addreſs you, and ſuch you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways proved yourſelf, by a participation of my diſtreſſes, as well as by the conſoling voice of pity and forgiveneſs. What deſtiny Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence deſigns for me, I know not; but I have my forebodings that this is the laſt time I ſhall ever accoſt you! Nor does this appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion ariſe merely from a diſturbed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have reaſon to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> myſelf in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed conſumption, which commonly proves fatal to perſons in my ſituation. I have careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concealed every complaint of the kind from my mamma, for fear of diſtreſſing her; yet I have never been inſenſible of their probable iſſue, and have bidden a ſincere welcome to them, as the harbingers of my ſpeedy releaſe from a life of guilt and woe!</p>
               <p>I am going from you, Julia. This night ſeparates us, perhaps, for ever! I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032142_0237_0FF155F37AED8688"/>
to encounter the tears of my friends; and therefore ſeek ſhelter among ſtrangers; where none knows, or is intereſted in my mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſtory. The place of my ſecluſion I ſtudiouſly conceal; yet I ſhall take meaſures that you may be apprized of my fate.</p>
               <p>Should it pleaſe God to ſpare and reſtore me to health, I ſhall return, and endeavor, by a life of penitence and rectitude, to expiate my paſt offences. But ſhould I be called from this ſcene of action; and leave behind me a helpleſs babe, the innocent ſufferer of its mother's ſhame, Oh, Julia, let your friendſhip for me extend to the little ſtranger! Intercede with my mother to take it under her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and transfer to it all her affection for me; to train it up in the ways of piety and virtue, that it may compenſate her for the afflictions which I have occaſioned!</p>
               <p>One thing more I have to requeſt. Plead for me with my two beſt friends, Mrs. Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Mrs. Sumner. I aſk you not to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iate my faults; that cannot be done; but to obtain, if poſſible, their forgiveneſs. I cannot write all my full mind ſuggeſts on this ſubject. You know the purport; and can better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it for me.</p>
               <p>And now, my dear Julia, recommending myſelf again to your benevolence, to your charity and (may I add?) to your affection; and entreating that the fatal conſequences of
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032142_0238_0FF12B56921F6B68"/>
my folly, now fallen upon my devoted head, may ſuffice for my puniſhment; let me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you to bury my crimes in the grave with me, and to preſerve the remembrance of my former virtues, which engaged your love and confidence; more eſpecially of that ardent eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem for you, which will glow till the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring breath of your deſpairing</p>

               <p>I HAVE, at laſt, accompliſhed the removal of my darling girl, from a place where ſhe thought every eye accuſed, and every heart condemned her.</p>
               <p>She has become quite romantic in her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. She would not permit me to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, leſt it ſhould be reported that we
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032142_0239_0FF155C37445DDD0"/>
had eloped together. I provided amply for her future exigencies, and conveyed her by night to the diſtance of ten or twelve miles, where we met the ſtage, in which I had previouſly ſecured her a feat. The agony of her grief at being thus obliged to leave her mother's houſe, baffles all deſcription.</p>
               <p>It very ſenſibly affected me, I know. I was almoſt a penitent. I am ſure I acted like one, whether I were ſincere or not. She choſe to go where ſhe was totally unknown. She would leave the ſtage, ſhe ſaid, before it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Boſton, and take paſſage in a more private carriage to Salem, or its vicinity, where ſhe would fix her abode; chalking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> initials of my name over the door, as a ſignal to me of her reſidence.</p>
               <p>She is exceedingly depreſſed; and ſays ſhe neither expects nor wiſhes to ſurvive her lying in. Inſanity, for aught I know, muſt be my lot, if ſhe ſhould die. But I will not harbor the idea. I hope, one time or other, to have the power to make her amends, even by marriage. My wife may be provoked, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine, to ſue for a divorce. If ſhe ſhould, ſhe would find no difficulty in obtaining it; and then I would take Eliza in her ſtead. Though I confeſs that the idea of being thus connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a woman whom I have been able to diſhonor would be rather hard to ſurmount. It would hurt even my delicacy, little as you
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:032142_0240_0FF155C516A4CC78"/>
may think me to poſſeſs, to have a wife whom I know to be ſeducible. And, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I cannot be poſitive that even Eliza would retain my love.</p>
               <p>My Nancy and I have lived a pretty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable life, of late. She has been very ſuſpicious of my amour with Eliza; and now and then expreſſed her jealous ſentiments a little more warmly than my patience would bear. But the news of Eliza's circumſtances and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> her father's houſe, and extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate herſelf from me intirely. My general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to all this, is, that ſhe knew my character before we married, and could reaſonably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing leſs than what has happened. I ſhall not oppoſe her leaving me, as it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the execution of the plan I have hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above.</p>
               <p>To morrow I ſhall ſet out to viſit my diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate fair one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From my very ſoul I pity her; and wiſh I could have preſerved her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſtently with the indulgence of my paſſion. To her I lay not the principal blame, as in like caſes, I do to the ſex in general. My fineſſe was too well planned for detection, and my ſnares too deeply laid for any one to eſcape who had the leaſt warmth in her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:032142_0241_0FF156209C5036F8"/>
or affection in her heart. I ſhall, therefore, be the leſs whimſical about a future connection, and the more ſolicitous to make her reparation, ſhould it ever be in my power.</p>
               <p>Her friends are all in arms about her. I dare ſay I have the imprecations of the whole fraternity. They may thank themſelves in part; for I alwayſ ſwore revenge for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and coldneſs towards me. Had they been politic, they would have conducted more like the aborigines of the country, who are ſaid to worſhip the devil out of fear.</p>
               <p>I am afraid I ſhall be obliged to remove my quarters; for Eliza was ſo great a favorite in town, that I am looked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> with an evil eye. I plead with her before we parted laſt, to forgive my ſeducing her; alledged my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love, and my inability to poſſeſs her in any other way. How, ſaid ſhe, can that be love which deſtroys its object? But granting what you ſay, you have fruſtrated your own purpoſe. You have deprived yourſelf of my ſociety, which might have been innocently enjoyed. You have cut me off from life in the midſt of my days. You have rendered me the reproach of my friends, the diſgrace of my family, and a diſhonor to virtue and my ſex! but I forgive you, added ſhe. Yeſ, Sanford, I forgive you; and ſincerely pray for your repentance and reformation. I hope to be the laſt wretched female, ſacrificed by you to the arts of falſehood and ſeduction!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="244" facs="unknown:032142_0242_0FF34C3DEE5BE798"/>
May my unhappy ſtory ſerve as a beacon to warn the American fair of the dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and deſtructive conſequences of aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating with men of your character, of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their time, and riſking their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the practice of coquetry and its attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant follies! But for theſe, I might have been honorably connected; and capable, at this moment, of diffuſing and receiving happineſs! But for your arts, I might have remained a bleſſing to ſociety, as well as the delight and comfort of my friends!</p>
               <p>Your being a married man unſpeakably aggravates both your guilt and mine. This circumſtance annexes indelible ſhame to our crime! You have rent aſunder the tendereſt ties of nature! You have broken the bonds of conjugal love, which ought ever to be kept ſacred and inviolate! You have filled with grief and diſcontent the heart of your amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wife, whom gratitude, if no other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhould have induced you to cheriſh with tenderneſs; and I, wretch that I am, have been your accomplice!</p>
               <p>But I ceaſe to reproach you. You have acted but too conſiſtently with the character, which I was ſufficiently appriſed you ſuſtained. The blame then may be retorted on myſelf, for diſregarding the counſels, warnings and admonitions of my beſt friends. You have prided yourſelf in the character of a libertine.
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:032142_0243_0FF1562A9702F9D8"/>
Glory no longer in your ſhame! You have accompliſhed your deſigns; your dreadful deſigns againſt me! Let this ſuffice. Add not to the number of thoſe deluded creatures, who will one day riſe up in judgment againſt you, and condemn you.</p>
               <p>By this time we had nearly reached the inn, and were ſoon to part. I ſeized her hand and exclaimed, you muſt not leave me, Eliza, with that awful anathema on your lips! Oh, ſay that you will forget my paſt faults. That, ſaid ſhe, I ſhall ſoon do; for in the grave there is no remembrance! This to my mind, was a harſher ſentence than the other; and almoſt threw me into deſpair. Never was ſo wrought upon before! I knew not what to ſay or do! She ſaw my diſtreſs, and kindly ſoftened her manner. If I am ſevere, ſaid ſhe, it is becauſe I wiſh to impreſs your mind with ſuch a ſenſe of your offences againſt your Maker, your friends and ſociety in general, as may effect your repentance and amendment. I wiſh not to be your accuſer, but your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former. On ſeveral accounts, I view my own crime in a more aggravated light than yours; but my conſcience is awakened to a conviction of my guilt. Yours, I fear is not. Let me conjure you to return home, and endeavor by you future kindneſs and fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to your wife, to make her all the amends in your power. By a life of virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:032142_0244_0FF34C39B4C32420"/>
you may yet become a valuable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety, and ſecure happineſs both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>I begged leave to viſit her retirement next week, not in continuation of our amour, but as a friend, ſolicitous to know her ſituation and welfare. Unable to ſpeak, ſhe only bowed aſſent. The ſtage being now ready, I whiſpered ſome tender things in her ear, and kiſſing her cheek, which was all ſhe would permit, ſuffered her to depart.</p>
               <p>My body remains behind; but my ſoul, if I have any, went with her!</p>
               <p>This was a horrid lecture, Charles! She brought every charge againſt me, which a fruitful and gloomy imagination could ſuggeſt! But I hope, when ſhe recovers, ſhe will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume her former cheerfulneſs, and become as kind and agreeable as ever. My anxiety for her ſafety is very great. I truſt, however, it will ſoon be removed; and peace and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure be reſtored to your humble ſervant.</p>

               <p>THE drama is now cloſed! A tragical one indeed it has proved!</p>
               <p>How ſincerely, my dear Mrs. Sumner, muſt the friends of our departed Eliza, ſympathize with each other; and with her afflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved parent!</p>
               <p>You have doubtleſs ſeen the account, in the public papers, which gave us the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly intelligence. But I will give you a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of circumſtances.</p>
               <p>A few days after my laſt was written, we heard that Major Sanford's property was attached, and he a priſoner in his own houſe. He was the laſt man, to whom we wiſhed to apply for information reſpecting the forlorn wanderer; yet we had no other reſource. And after waiting a fortnight in the moſt cruel ſuſpenſe, we wrote a billet, entreating him, if poſſible, to give ſome intelligence concerning her. He replied, that he was unhappily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:032142_0246_0FF1564376A808F0"/>
of all means of knowing himſelf; but hoped ſoon to relieve his own, and our anxiety about her.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation we continued, till a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor (purpoſely, we ſince concluded) ſent us a Boſton paper. Mrs. Wharton took it, and inconſcious of its contents, obſerved that the peruſal might divert her, a few moments. She read for ſome time; when it ſuddenly dropped upon the floor. She claſped her hands together, and raiſing her ſtreaming eyes to heaven, exclaimed, It is the Lord; let him do what he will! Be ſtill, O my ſoul, and know that he is God!</p>
               <p>What, madam, ſaid I, can be the matter? She anſwered not; but with inexpreſſible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh depicted in her countenance, pointed to the paper. I took it up, and ſoon found the fatal paragraph. I ſhall not attempt to paint our heart felt grief and lamentation upon this occaſion; for we had no doubt of Eliza's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſon deſcribed, as a ſtranger, who died at Danvers, laſt July. Her delivery of a child; her dejected ſtate of mind; the marks upon her linen; indeed, every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the advertiſement convinced us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond diſpute, that it could be no other. Mrs. Wharton retired immediately to her chamber, where ſhe continued overwhelmed with ſorrow that night and the following day. Such, in fact, has been her habitual frame ever ſince;
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:032142_0247_0FF1562F6DD3FAB8"/>
though the endeavors of her friends, who have ſought to conſole her, have rendered her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more converſable. My teſtimony of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's penitence, before her departure, is a ſource of comfort to this diſconſolate parent. She fondly cheriſhed the idea, that having expiated her offence by ſincere repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, her deluded child finally made a happy exchange of worlds. But the deſperate reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, which ſhe formed, and executed of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a fugitive; of deſerting her mother's houſe and protection, and of wandering and dying among ſtrangers, is a moſt diſtreſſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to her friends; eſpecially to her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in whoſe breaſt ſo many painful ideas ariſe, that ſhe finds it extremely difficult to compoſe herſelf to that reſignation, which ſhe evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrives to exemplify.</p>
               <p>Eliza's brother has been to viſit her laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; and to learn the particulars of her mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy exit. He relates, that ſhe was well accommodated, and had every attention and aſſiſtance, which her ſituation required. The people where ſhe reſided appear to have a lively ſenſe of her merit and miſfortunes. They teſtify her modeſt deportment, her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude under the ſufferings to which ſhe was called, and the ſerenity and compoſure, with which ſhe bid a laſt adieu to the world. Mr. Wharton has brought back ſeveral ſcraps of her writing, containing miſcellaneous reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:032142_0248_0FF155CD6B140F98"/>
on her ſituation, the death of her babe, and the abſence of her friends. Some of theſe were written before, ſome after her confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe valuable teſtimonies of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſenſe, and calm expectation ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of her approaching diſſolution, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to ſooth and comfort the minds of mourning connections. They greatly allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the regret occaſioned by her abſence, at this awful period.</p>
               <p>Her elopement can be equalled only by the infatuation which cauſed her ruin.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>"But let no one reproach her memory.</l>

               </lg>
               <p>I am told that Major Sanford is quite fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. Sure I am that he has reaſon to be. If the miſchiefs he has brought upon others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon his own head, dreadful indeed muſt be his portion! His wife has left him, and returned to her parents. His eſtate, which has been long mortgaged, is taken from him; and poverty and diſgrace await him! Heaven ſeldom leaves injured innocence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avenged! Wretch, that he is, he ought for ever to be baniſhed from human ſociety! I ſhall continue with Mrs. Wharton, till the lenient hand of time has aſſuaged her ſorrows; and then make my promiſed viſit to you. I will bring Eliza's poſthumous papers with me, when I come to Boſton, as I have not time to copy them now.</p>

I foreſee, my dear Mrs. Sumner, that this diſaſtrous affair will ſuſpend your enjoyments, as it has mine. But what are our feelings, compared with the pangs which rend a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent's heart? This parent, I here behold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanly ſtripped of the beſt ſolace of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining years, by the enſnaring machinations of a profligate debauchee! Not only the life, but what was ſtill dearer, the reputation and virtue of the unfortunate Eliza, have fallen victims at the ſhrine of <hi>libertiniſm!</hi> Deteſted be the epithet! Let it henceforth bear its true ſignature, and candor itſelf ſhall call it <hi>luſt</hi> and <hi>brutality!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Execrable is the man, however arrayed in magnificence, crowned with wealth, or decor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with the external graces and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of faſhionable life, who ſhall preſume to diſplay them, at the expenſe of virtue and innocence! Sacred names! attended with real bleſſings; bleſſings too uſeful and important to be trifled away! My reſentment at the baſe arts, which muſt have been employed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the ſeduction of Eliza, I cannot ſuppreſs. I wiſh them to be expoſed, and ſtamped with univerſal ignominy!

Cruel fate has ſnatched her from me, and ſhe is irretrievably loſt! I rave, and then reflect: I reflect, and then rave! I have not patience to bear this calamity, nor power to remedy it! Where ſhall I fly from the upbraidings of my mind, which accuſes me as the murderer of my Eliza: I would fly to death, and ſeek a refuge in the grave; but the forebodings of a retribution to come, I cannot away with! Oh, that I had ſeen her; that I had once more aſked her forgiveneſs! But even that privilege, that conſolation was denied me! The day on which I meant to viſit her, moſt of my property was attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:032142_0251_0FF156113B7C64C0"/>
and to ſecure the reſt, I was obliged to ſhut my doors, and become a priſoner in my own houſe! High living, and old debts, incurred by extravagance, had reduced the fortune of my wife to very little, and I could not ſatisfy the clamorous demands of my creditors.</p>
               <p>I would have given millions, had I poſſeſſed them, to have been at liberty to ſee, and to have had power to preſerve Eliza from death! But in vain was my anxiety; it could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; it could not liberate me! When I firſt heard the dreadful tidings of her exit, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I acted like a madman! Indeed, I am lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe now!</p>
               <p>I have compounded with my creditors, and reſigned the whole of my property.</p>
               <p>Thus, that ſplendor and equipage, to ſecure which, I have ſacrificed a virtuous woman, is taken from me; that poverty, the dread of which prevented my forming an honorable connection with an amiable and accompliſhed girl, the only one I ever loved, has fallen, with redoubled vengeance, upon my guilty head; and I muſt become a vagabond in the earth!</p>
               <p>I ſhall fly my country as ſoon as poſſible; I ſhall go from every object which reminds me of my departed Eliza! But never, never ſhall I eradicate from my boſom the idea of her excellence; or the painful remembrance of the injuries I have done her! Her ſhade
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:032142_0252_0FF155F9F63B2DC0"/>
will perpetually haunt me! The image of her, as ſhe appeared when mounting the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which conveyed her for ever from my ſight, ſhe waved her hand in token of a laſt adieu, will always be preſent to my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! The ſolemn counſel ſhe gave me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we parted, never more to meet, will not ceaſe to reſound in my ears!</p>
               <p>While my being is prolonged, I muſt feel the diſgraceful, and torturing effects of my guilt in ſeducing her! How madly have I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived her of happineſs, of reputation, of life! Her friends, could they know the pangs of contrition, and the horror of conſcience which attend me, would be amply revenged!</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, ſhe quitted the world with compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and peace. Well ſhe might! She had not that inſupportable weight of iniquity, which ſinks me to deſpair! She found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in that religion, which I have ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed as prieſtcraft and hypocriſy! But whether it be true, or falſe, would to heaven I could now enjoy the comforts, which its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries evidently feel!</p>
               <p>My wife has left me. As we lived togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er without love, we parted without regret.</p>
               <p>Now, Charles, I am to bid you a long, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, a laſt farewell. Where I ſhall roam in future, I neither know nor care; I ſhall go where the name of Sanford is unknown; and his perſon and ſorrows unnoticed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="255" facs="unknown:032142_0253_0FF155B0711615F8"/>
In this happy clime I have nothing to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce my ſtay. I have not money to ſupport me with my profligate companions; nor have I any reliſh, at preſent, for their ſociety. By the virtuous part of the community, I am ſhunned as the peſt and bane of ſocial enjoyment. In ſhort I am debarred from every kind of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. If I look back, I recoil with horror from the black catalogue of vices, which have ſtained my paſt life, and reduced me to indigence and contempt. If I look forward, I ſhudder at the proſpects which my foreboding mind preſents to view, both in this and a coming world! This is a deplorable, yet juſt picture of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! How totally the reverſe of what I once appeared!</p>
               <p>Let it warn you, my friend, to ſhun the dangerous paths which I have trodden, that you may never be involved in the hopeleſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and wretchedneſs of</p>

               <p>A MELANCHOLY tale have you unfolded, my dear Julia; and tragic indeed is the concluding ſcene!</p>
               <p>Is ſhe then gone! gone in this moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing manner! Have I loſt my once loved friend; loſt her in a way which I could never have conceived to be poſſible.</p>
               <p>Our days of childhood were ſpent together in the ſame purſuits, in the ſame amuſements. Our riper years encreaſed our mutual affection, and maturer judgment moſt firmly cemented our friendſhip. Can I then calmly reſign her to ſo ſevere a fate! Can I bear the idea of her being loſt to honor, to fame, and to life! No; ſhe ſhall ſtill live in the heart of her faithful Lucy; whoſe experience of her numerous vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and engaging qualities, has imprinted her image too deeply on the memory to be oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. However ſhe may have erred, her ſincere repentance is ſufficient to reſtore her to charity.</p>

Your letter gave me the firſt information of this awful event. I had taken a ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion into the country, where I had not ſeen the papers; or if I had, paid little or no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them. By your directions I found the diſtreſſing narrative of her exit. The poignancy of my grief, and the unavailing la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations which the intelligence excited, need no delineation.

Happy would it have been, had ſhe exerted an equal degree of fortitude in repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the firſt attacks upon her virtue! But ſhe is no more; and heaven forbid that I ſhould accuſe or reproach her!</p>
               <p>Yet, in what language ſhall I expreſs my abhorrence of the monſter, whoſe deteſtable arts have blaſted one of the faireſt flowers in creation? I leave him to God, and his own conſcience! Already is he expoſed in his true colors! Vengeance already begins to overtake him! His ſordid mind muſt now

               <p>Upon your reflecting and ſteady mind, my dear Julia, I need not inculcate the leſſons which may be drawn from this woe-fraught tale; but for the ſake of my ſex in general, I wiſh it engraved upon every heart, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone, independent of the trappings of wealth, the parade of equipage, and the adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of gallantry, can ſecure laſting felicity. From the melancholy ſtory of Eliza Wharton, let the American fair learn to reject with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain every inſinuation derogatory to their true dignity and honor. Let them deſpiſe, and for ever baniſh the man, who can glory in the ſeduction of innocence and the ruin of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. To aſſociate, is to approve; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, is to be betrayed!</p>

               </opener>
               <p>WE have paid the laſt tribute of reſpect to your beloved daughter. The day after my arrival, Mrs. Sumner propoſed that we ſhould viſit the ſad ſpot which contains the remains of our once amiable friend. The grave of Eliza Wharton, ſaid ſhe, ſhall not be unbedewed by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of friendſhip.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday we went accordingly, and were much pleaſed with the apparent ſincerity of the people, in their aſſurances that every thing in their power had been done to render her ſituation comfortable. The minuteſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were faithfully related; and from the ſtate of her mind, in her laſt hours, I think much comfort may be derived to her afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends.</p>
               <p>We ſpent a mournful hour, in the place where ſhe is intered, and then returned to the inn, while Mrs. Sumner gave orders for
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:032142_0258_0FF155BBF816DF18"/>
a decent ſtone to be erected over her grave, with the following inſcription:</p>
               <p>"THIS HUMBLE STONE, <hi>IN MEMORY OF</hi> ELIZA WHARTON, <hi>IS INSCRIBED BY HER WEEPING FRIENDS, TO WHOM SHE ENDEARED HERSELF BY UNCOMMON TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION. ENDOWED WITH SUPERIOR ACQUIREMENT<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

SHE SUSTAINED THE LAST PAINFUL SCENE, FAR FROM EVERY FRIEND; AND EXHIBITED AN EXAMPLE OF CALM RESIGNATION. HER DEPARTURE WAS ON THE</hi> 25<hi>th DAY OF JULY, A. D.—, IN THE</hi> 37<hi>th YEAR OF HER AGE, AND THE TEARS OF STRANGERS WATERED HER</hi> GRAVE."</p>

I hope, madam, that you will derive ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from theſe exertions of friendſhip, and that, united to the many other ſources of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation with which you are furniſhed, they may alleviate your grief; and while they leave the pleaſing remembrance of her virtues, add the ſupporting perſuaſion, that your Eliza is happy.</p>
