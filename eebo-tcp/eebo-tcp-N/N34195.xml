            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>population of this wilderneſs, ſo lately the range of ſavages, and the loneſome haunt of wild beaſts, echoing with the frightful ſcreeches, and ſonorous bootings of deſolate owis, is truely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing! Every town, almoſt, north and ſouth, thro' that tract weſt of Connecticut river, lately called the province of New-Hampſhire; hath more or leſs inhabitants: As it is probable moſt of the towns, in this large extended wilderneſs hath. One (I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) hath more than two hundred families in it; others are various. The town of Rutland, ſituate about ſeventy miles from the north line of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Maſſachuſett's-Bay, hath thirty-five families in it: more are coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what is truly affecting is, That there is not more than one regular Miniſter of the ſtanding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſettled, as ever I have heard of, in all this large extent; yea for a hundred miles or more, in length, and in breadth; perhaps as many from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river, to Hudſon's river; and from the north line of Maſſachuſett's-Bay, to Canada; in which there are even a multitude of people. And indeed, there are but few Miniſters of any denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation! Not only this; but what is ſtill more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting is, The poverty or nearneſs of ſome, and the want of an inclination in many others, ſeem to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their having any at all, in moſt places, at leaſt
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:044789_0003_101F06595928B068"/>
at the preſent; and the affecting conſequences of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple continuing long in ſuch circumſtances; with regard to religion, the worſhip of God, and the</hi> Salvation <hi>of their ſouls, is eaſy to be perceived by the judicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having a call, in providence, to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in this wilderneſs, in the midſt of which I now am, and have been for ſome time; and being deſired to aſſiſt in gathering a Church at Rutland, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 20, 1783; <hi>and to preach on that occaſion, (to which I conſented) I thought proper, as ſuitable to the occaſion, to give a deſcription of the true Church of Chriſt; without the leaſt thoughts of its ever appearing in public: However, it now appears, with a very little alteration, from what it was, when delivered; excepting the improvement, which I have conſiderably enlarged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have but very little to ſay by way of apology for its publication; beſides that very common one,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> "That it is publiſhed at the earneſt deſire of thoſe that heard it." <hi>For I have not the vanity to think, that there is any thing very extraordinary in it, to recommend it to the public: I apprehend, it contains plain truths, in a ſtyle ſuited to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the auditory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I add this was ſome further inducement to me, to conſent to its publication, <abbr>viz.</abbr>. That I expect many of the books will be ſcattered in this wilderneſs, where books are ſcarce: And if they may be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to form in the minds of any, juſt ſentiments of the true Church of Chriſt, and awaken in them, an earneſt ſolicitude to belong to this Church of Chriſt, my end is, in ſome meaſure, anſwered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I ſhall only add, I aſk the candour of my readers;
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:044789_0003_101F06595928B068"/>
to which I am ready to fancy, I am the more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled; ſince I am in the midſt of this vaſt wilderneſs, without the ordinary helps in ſuch caſes; and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any of my brethren in the miniſtry to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe or adviſe with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Requeſting the prayers of God's people, on behalf of the people inhabiting in this wilderneſs; who ſeem to be in imminent danger of periſhing for lack of viſion; I ſubſcribe myſelf your ſervant, for Jeſus ſake.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>I. PETER, ii. 5.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ye alſo as living Stones, are built up a</hi> SPIRITUAL HOUSE, <hi>an</hi> HOLY PRIESTHOOD, <hi>to offer up</hi> SPIRITUAL SACRIFICES, <hi>acceptable to</hi> GOD, <hi>by</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Apoſtle is here giving us a lively deſcription of the true <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Having firſt deſcribed the foundation of the <hi>Church,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> Jeſus Chriſt, whom he calls a '<hi>Living Stone,</hi>' (in the preceding verſe) <q>
                  <hi>Diſallowed indeed of men, but choſen of God and precious.</hi>
               </q> In our text he ſpeaks of the Church, under the ſame metaphor, '<hi>Living Stones,'</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>Living Stones;</hi> is according to the tranſlation in my Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Since the compoſure of the Sermon, I have ſeen it tranſlated '<hi>Lively,</hi>' In ſome other Bibles.</p>
                  <p>But, as I have not the original by me, nor is it in theſe parts; by which I might determine which is the righteſt; therefore I ſhall let it ſtand as it is penn'd.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Where we may obſerve, he (the Apoſtle) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the Church.</p>
            <p>I. By her likeneſs to Chriſt, with reſpect to internal, ſpiritual or divine life; '<hi>living.</hi>'</p>
            <p>II. By her ſtability '<hi>Stones.</hi>'</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:044789_0005_101F065DB98EC1A8"/>
III. By her union with herſelf; '<hi>Built up a Spiritual Houſe.</hi>'</p>
            <p>IV. By her divine conſtitution; '<hi>An Holy Prieſthood.</hi>'</p>
            <p>V. By her exerciſes; '<hi>To offer up Sacrifices.</hi>'</p>
            <p>VI. By the quality of theſe ſacrifices, <abbr>viz.</abbr> '<hi>Spiritual and holy.</hi>'</p>
            <p>VII. By their acceptance with God; '<hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</hi>'</p>
            <p>VIII. By whoſe merits theſe ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are acceptable to God, <abbr>viz.</abbr> The merits of Chriſt, '<hi>Acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>' Each of theſe particulars, in the deſcription of the true Church of Chriſt, I purpoſe briefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider.</p>
            <p>I. THE firſt decription of the true Church, is in her likeneſs to Chriſt, her foundation, with reſpect to her internal, ſpiritual or divine life; '<hi>Living.</hi>'</p>
            <p>'<hi>Chriſt lives;</hi> and becauſe he lives,' '<hi>They ſhall live alſo.</hi>' John 14. 19.</p>
            <p>Every true member <hi>lives by Chriſt's life,</hi> for he lives in them; '<hi>I live,</hi>' (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Gal. XX. 20.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, they have the ſame <hi>kind</hi> of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, that is in Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt <hi>a living Stone;</hi> the foundation of this ſpiritual building! So likewiſe, the true members of his Church are <hi>living Stones;</hi> compacted together in this building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The foundation and the ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are alike in this; they are <hi>living Stones.</hi> This ſpiritual life conſiſts in holineſs, divine love or benevolence. Some indeed ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:044789_0005_101F065DB98EC1A8"/>
holineſs is nothing but divine love; becauſe what the law of God requires of us, is holineſs, and the ſum of what the law requires of us, is love: Love is the fulfilling of the law; (ſaith the Apoſtle.) And upon theſe two command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love to God and our neighbour, our Saviour makes to hang all the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. However, ſome would make a little difference between holineſs and divine love: Holineſs in God (they ſay) is the ſum of all his divine attributes: And holineſs in men they make comprehenſive of all the variety of chriſtian graces, to be exerciſed in the life of a chriſtian; as love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meekneſs, and temperance; which are called the fruits of the holy ſpirit; Gal. v. 22, 23. And can any ſay, and ſay truly, that divine love, or benevolence, is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of all the forementioned graces? Doubtleſs holineſs, is to be univerſally of a right temper of mind: So likewiſe, for ought I know, love is radically this; a man deſtitute of love, hath no right temper; without divine love, he doeth nothing that is truly virtuous; nothing that is truly praiſe worthy; without this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done from a right principle, or to a right end: He that hath no true love to God, hath no ſincere regard to his glory, in any thing that he doth. Without this, faith hath no real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or moral virtue in it. All gifts &amp; knowledge is vain without it: Yea, had a man all faith, ſo that he could remove mountains, and underſtood all myſteries, and could ſpeak with the tongues of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:044789_0006_101F065F81E46FA0"/>
men and angels, and was deſtitute of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine principle, they would make him no better than ſounding braſs, or a tinkling cymbal; a bare ſign or repreſentation of ſomething, when there is really nothing! Nay, ſhould a man give all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burnt in ſacrifice for his religion, and be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of love, it would profit him nothing: See all this confirmed, I Cor. Chap. xiii. Love is the very ſoul and eſſence of every grace, and the diſtinguiſhing character of a good man, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, he is a wicked man, and dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins. Love therefore, is the ſum of all moral virtue, and of every chriſtian grace; yea the very ſoul and life of them all: As without natural or animal life, there would be no natural actions; ſo alſo without <hi>divine love,</hi> there would be no ſpiritual action. <hi>Natural self-love</hi> excites natural men to thoſe <hi>exerciſes,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are proper for moral agents: So ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and divine love excites to thoſe <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exerciſes</hi> and <hi>holy actions,</hi> which are <hi>peculiar</hi> to a <hi>renewea man.</hi> Without love of ſome kind or other, I cannot conceive of a man's acting at all, as a moral agent; and without ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or divine love, I can have no apprehenſion of his acting at all in a ſpiritual manner; or with the leaſt regard to God, any more than I can conceive of a man's acting as a natural man, without natural life. Hence it is, I apprehend, that divine love is called <hi>ſpiritual life:</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, without divine love, men are dead, yea, wholly dead, in a ſpiritual ſenſe. But the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:044789_0006_101F065F81E46FA0"/>
true members of Chriſt's Church, are conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their ſpiritual and public head, in this; Chriſt the <hi>living Stone,</hi> in the foundation of his Church, and the Church built up of <hi>living Stones,</hi> upon this foundation</p>
            <p>II. The true Church of Chriſt is deſcribed by her ſtability, <hi>Stones.</hi> A metaphor borrowed from Stones which are compacted into a building, with an adjective, expreſſing their peculiar, and diſtinguiſhing quality, <hi>living Stones.</hi> A Stone is ſolid and durable, not eaſily moved with the wind; when wrought into a building, they continue for a great length of time. So the Church of Chriſt, compared to <hi>living Stones,</hi> built upon Chriſt, the <hi>living Stone,</hi> is durable, ſtaple and firm: It continues through every age, firm as the everlaſting mountains: It continues through all the convulſions of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. Whatever devaſtations and revolutions take place, in the world, the Church muſt live; though earth and hell conſpire together to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, '<hi>Yet muſt this building riſe!</hi>' Though Satan, with all his malicious arts, and diabolical ſubtilty, lay ten thouſand ſnares to deſtroy it, he cannot prevail; <hi>for it is founded on a rock.</hi> He that fights againſt her, fights againſt God; who will be ſure to avenge '<hi>The quarrel.'</hi> 'Tis with reſpect to the Church that he ſays <q>
                  <hi>Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm?</hi>
               </q> Pſal. cv, 15. Hurt not (q. d.) the people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to me, by the gifts and graces of my ſpirit; and thoſe, eſpecially among them, to whom I farmiliarly reveal my mind and will, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:044789_0007_101F066246E843C8"/>
they may teach others. The Church is called the bride, the lamb's wife, and is moſt dear to the almighty bridegroom: And whoſoever touches his bride, (i.e. hurts or injures her,) ſhall find the arm of her almighty huſband to be ſtrong; who will '<hi>Soon avenge the wrong.</hi>' For thus ſaith the Lord, to his Church; '<hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye..</hi>' Zach. 2, 8. And how <hi>precious!</hi> how <hi>dear!</hi> the Church of Chriſt is to him, he hath manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many ſtriking inſtances of his providence, in puniſhing thoſe that injured or were unkind to her. For this cauſe he plagued and deſtroyed the Egyptians, and when they purſued his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the red ſea, they were all myraculouſly drowned in it; they ſank as lead in the mighty waters; yea they ſank like a ſtone to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: That this was the caſe is further evident from Joel, iii, 19. <hi>Egypt ſhall be a deſolation, for the violence againſt the children of Judah, becauſe they ſhed innocent blood in their land.</hi> How did it fare with the Amalekites for their unkindneſs, becauſe they did not meet God's antient Church with bread and water; but inſtead of this, they ſmote the hindermoſt part of them that were weary and faint; therefore the Lord gave it in charge, utterly to deſtroy Amalak, and to blot out his name from under heaven; which was fully accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>And how did it fare with the Babylonians, for captivating God's people? though done by his permiſſion and direction of his providence. They were threatned with perpetual deſolation for it,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:044789_0007_101F066246E843C8"/>
which threatning has been and ſtill is fulfilling: <q>
                  <hi>Babylon ſhall become a heap, a dwelling place for dragons, an aſtoniſhment, and an hiſſing, without an inhabitant.</hi>
               </q> Jer. ii 37. This city, though the moſt extenſive, <abbr>viz.</abbr> magnificent of any in the known world, is made a perpetual deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>never more to be built or inhabited from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation forever.</hi> See Jer. I. 39, 40, ver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Iſa. xiii, 19, to the end, where the deſolation, perpetual deſolation of Babylon, is very fully and emphatically expreſſed. And how did it fare with the Jews themſelves, when they rejected the King of Zion, and perſecuted his Church? Why he <hi>miſerably deſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their city Jeruſalem.</hi> Tho' Kings, Rulers and people of Iſrael joined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Church, yet they failed. What though with hand joined in hand, they ſet themſelves againſt the Lord, and againſt his anointed, yet, <q>
                  <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens laughed, as the Lord then had them in deriſion.</hi>
               </q> And though all the powers of Rome, when ſhe was miſtreſs of the world, were bent to deſtroy and to root out the chriſtian name, from under Heaven; though ſhe (Rome) murdered millions, and chriſtian blood flowed down like rivers; ſhe could not prevail. Under all theſe trials, the Church rather increaſed, than diminiſhed; the ſuffering of one martyr was ſometimes the means of converting numbers. They who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church, made war with the lamb, and he overcame them; for he is <hi>Lord of Lords and King of King's.</hi> Rev. xvii, 14. Thus ſtaple
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:044789_0008_101F06650FF426F8"/>
and firm is the true Church of Chriſt, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be able to deſtroy it: earth and hell have tried out their ſtrength, in combinations and have not prevailed; for the Lord God and the Lamb is in the midſt of her. He keeps her, he watches over her with as much care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs as the apple of his eye; and the gates of hell cannot prevail againſt her, cannot overcome her. Thus the church is firmer than heaven and earth, and more unſhaken than the ſolid world; her foundation is ſtrong, ſhe is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a living rock, from which ſhe cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or removed, for ſhe is united to it, and the union is indiſſoluble.</p>
            <p>III. The true church of Chriſt is deſcribed by her union with herſelf, <hi>built up a ſpiritual houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This metaphor ſhews how the church is unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with itſelf. As ſtones which are compacted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a building, by the artiſt, are all united together and make one houſe; ſo the Church of Chriſt, as <hi>living ſtones,</hi> is one <hi>ſpiritual houſe built</hi> together by the great maſter builder, in which houſe he dwells forever. As this building is unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the living ſtone which is its foundation, ſo likewiſe theſe <hi>living ſtones</hi> which compoſe this building, are united among themſelves, cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in love, which holds it together, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is indiſſoluble: Not one living ſtone ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail in this building. For this the redeemer prayed and his prayer is always effectual. John xvii. 11, 21, 22, 23. "Holy father, keep through thine own name thoſe whom thou haſt given me, <hi>that they may be one as we are.'</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>That they all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:044789_0008_101F06650FF426F8"/>
may be one,</hi> as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be ONE in us: And the glory, which thou gaveſt me, have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them; that they may be ONE, even as we are ONE: I in them and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in ONE: That the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt <hi>loved them even as thou haſt loved me.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Church is called <q>
                  <hi>The only one</hi> of her mother, and the <hi>choice one</hi> of her that bare her.</q> Cant. vi, 9, which denotes that the Church of Chriſt is <hi>one,</hi> and is moſt dear to him, who is the great founder of it. This union in the Church, the Apoſtle deſcribes by the ſimilitude of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, which is united to the head, by joints and bands, from which it receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and being knit together it increaſeth, with the increaſe of God, Coll. ii, 19. and that which cements together the ſeveral parts of Chriſt's myſtical body, (the Church) is love, Coll. ii, 2. <hi>Being knit together in love.</hi> The liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing members, in Chriſt's Church, are <hi>one,</hi> in all the following reſpects, <abbr>viz.</abbr> They all have one and the ſame public head, even Chriſt, from whom they receive ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in grace. They all truſt their ſalvation in his merits alone. They all with one conſent hold the eſſential doctrines of the Goſpel, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Such as theſe, Salvation from ſin and hell, by free and ſovereign grace alone, beſtowed thro' the merits of the great Redeemer. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is ſolely upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to clothe them in the ſight of a holy God; they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:044789_0009_101F0666F14678B0"/>
all truſt in the merits of his blood, for the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement of their ſins: The merit of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; death for the juſtification of their perſons, and acceptance with God, both of their perſons and ſervices; eternal life and happineſs in the enjoyment of God: They all depend upon his ſpirit and grace to ſanctify them and make them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the ſaints in light. In theſe they all agree, if they are capable of underſtanding doctrines: If there be babes in Chriſt, that do not clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand doctrines at preſent, yet ſurely they have a diſpoſition to underſtand, and as ſoon as they do underſtand, or have juſt notions of the truth, they cordially embrace it: They have a <hi>ſpiritual taſte</hi> and <hi>appetite</hi> for the doctrines of free grace; they are pleaſed with them and like them in their hearts; for like new born babes, in health, they deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, which no unſanctified ſoul doth. Doubtleſs there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have ſo much light and conviction of the truth, that they are forced to acknowledge it; yet have no love for it; no appetite for it at all in their hearts. They may have the form of knowledge and of the truth, who do not love it: This the Apoſtle aſſerts Rom. ii. 20, to 24. concerning thoſe to whom he does not give a very good character, <abbr>viz.</abbr>. That they made their boaſt of the law, and knew God's will, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught themſelves; to whom he ſays, '<hi>The name of God is blaſphemed among the Gentiles through you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:044789_0009_101F0666F14678B0"/>
               <hi>Once more, every living member of Chriſt's Church have all the ſame ſpirit of divine love, that bond of perfectneſs, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks,</hi> Coll. iii: 14. <hi>Wherever they are ſcattered up and down the world, this is the ſpirit that dwells in them;</hi>' this their diſtinguiſhing character: By the <hi>ſpirits of love,</hi> or true benevolence, which they have to each other <q>
                  <hi>All men may know, that they are Chriſt's diſciples,</hi>
               </q> John xiii. 35 <q>
                  <hi>And by this, we may know, that we are of God; and that he dwelleth in us, <abbr>viz.</abbr>. by the ſpirit which he hath given us,</hi>
               </q> As ſaith the Apoſtle, I John iii. 24. And to the ſame purpoſe is the Apoſtle Rom. viii. 9, <q>
                  <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Falſe pretenders to religon, may profeſs themſelves to be his diſciples, when they are intirely deſtitute of the diſtinguiſhing character of his true diſciples, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>divine love.</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there are many ſuch profeſſors, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtitute of any true love, either to God or man: We have a record of ſome, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed well, and no doubt had a very good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelves, to whom Chriſt ſays, <q>
                  <hi>I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</hi>
               </q> Not all that profeſs faith in Chriſt, will put their truſt in him; the ſcribes and phariſees profeſſed to believe in a Meſſiah to come, but when he came, they rejected him; they <q>
                  <hi>Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others;</hi>
               </q> and what reaſon is there to think, but many at the preſent day, are of the ſame ſpirit; they profeſs to believe in Chriſt,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:044789_0010_101F0668ADBF0388"/>
but truſt in themſelves, '<hi>Walking in the light of their own fire, and in the ſparks which they have kindled.</hi>' There were ſome who profeſſed to be Chriſt's diſciples, his cordial friends; to whom he would not commit himſelf, but hid himſelf from them, becauſe he knew them, he knew their hearts; <q>
                  <hi>For he knew all men, and needed not that any ſhould teſtify of man, for he knew what was in man,</hi>
               </q> John ii. 24. 25. Yea many that profeſſed to be Chriſt's diſciples, and were ſo called, took diſguſt at ſome important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which he taught, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

                  <hi>They went out from us,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>But they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would, no doubt, have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi>
               </q> 'Tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange, that that, which hath no root or deepneſs of earth, ſhould wither away: It is nothing ſtrange, that thoſe who are not <hi>living Stones,</hi> and not belonging to Chriſt's building; having no ſpecial grace, no love to Chriſt in their hearts; nothing ſtrange, for theſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their profeſſion, and turn to another, where they can better gratify their pride or their paſſions in ſo doing: But the living members of Chriſt have an <hi>unction</hi> from the <hi>holy one,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:044789_0010_101F0668ADBF0388"/>
an holy anointing, from the holy ſpirit, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Thoſe divine influences, or ſpecial graces ſhed abroad in the heart, which ſecures them from falling; 'tis an unfailing bond, which holds them faſt, and forever ſecures them; it is the bond of perfectneſs; therefore they ſhall never finally fall away: This bond of perfectneſs, or divine love maintains the union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>IV. THE Church is deſcribed by her divine conſtitution, <hi>an holy prieſthood.</hi> One ſpecial part of the prieſts office, under the law, was to offer ſacrifices. Beſides this, they were to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to God, ſeperated from the world, and to be conſtantly employ'd in the ſervice of the ſanctuary, and in teaching the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in alluſion to this, the Church of Chriſt is called <hi>a holy prieſthood,</hi> in the text; becauſe ſhe is to be ſeperated to the ſervice of God: ſhe offers up herſelf as <q>A living ſacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, through Jeſus Chriſt: And hath made us, (ſays the church) Kings and prieſts unto God, and his <hi>father,</hi>
               </q> Rev i. 6. This ſpiritual and holy prieſthood, is peculiarly deſcriptive of the true Church of Chriſt, it is their peculiar and diſtinguiſhing character, as it cannot juſtly be attributed to any other. None truly give up themſelves to God, as liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifices, none are devoted to his ſervice but ſaints; of which are compoſed the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>V. The true Church of Chriſt is deſcribed by her exerciſes, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>to offer up ſacrifices:</hi> which ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:044789_0011_101F066B158A5FB0"/>
does in conſequences of her divine conſtitution, '<hi>A holy prieſthood.</hi>'</p>
            <p>Theſe ſacrifices conſiſt in the offering up of their ſouls, their bodies, with all their powers and faculties to God, to be employed in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Their hearts are given to God; (i. e.) <hi>they ſincerely love him.</hi> It is not uncommon for lovers to ſay to the beloved friend, <q>You have my heart! or I have given you my heart!</q> So the Church of Chriſt has given him her heart; and Chriſt hath ſet his heart upon the Church, his ſpouſe: the divine will is her will; this is the rule by which ſhe walks. She chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es thoſe things which God chooſes; Chriſt and his Church have the ſame object of love and hatred: ſhe is ready both to do and to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake. <q>
                  <hi>In the worſhip of her God, ſhe ſpends her daily breath.</hi>
               </q> She dearly loves the worſhip and ordinances of Chriſt, where he is wont to reveal his power and grace: She loves to hear of Chriſt, of his love and divine excellencies: And her meditation of him is ſweet, even in the night watches; ſhe is ready to part with all for his ſake; to ſacrifice name, eſtate, and life itſelf, for his ſake <q>
                  <hi>whom her ſoul loveth.</hi>
               </q> Yea to eſteem reproaches, for Chriſt, to be great riches, Heb. xi. 26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She can take joyfully the ſpoiling of her goods, and part with father and mother, and other near and dear relatives, houſes and lands, and life itſelf for his ſake and the Goſple's. Unleſs men can part with all for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpel's, they are not, nor can they be his true deciples; (this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:044789_0011_101F066B158A5FB0"/>
we have from his own mouth) this truth is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated from the words of the Apoſtle; <q>
                  <hi>I am not only ready to be bound</hi> (ſays he) <hi>but to die for the name of Jeſus,</hi>
               </q> Acts, xxi, 13. <q>
                  <hi>yea, doubtleſs, and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. Phil. iii. 8. And, not only St. Paul, but every living mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Church of Chriſt, is ready to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice every thing, and count them as dung for Chriſt's ſake. In this manner the Church offers up ſacrifice to God.</p>
            <p>VI. The Church is further deſcribed by the quality of thoſe ſacrifices which ſhe offers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>ſpiritual and holy,</hi> they are not ſuch earnal ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, as were in uſe under the law; nor do they conſiſt in modes and forms or meer bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which profiteth little, I. Tim. iv. 8. which may be done intirely without the heart; but they are ſacrifices ſpiritual and holy; ſpiritual ſacrifices, are ſuch religious exerciſes, as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſpecial and genuine influences of the holy ſpirit; from whence the term ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al is taken in ſcripture. They are ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes therefore, as are peculiar to the ſpiritual man, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Saints; and is given in our text, as one of the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of the true Church of Chriſt: Certainly, none but ſpiritual men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſpiritual and holy ſacrifices; and the ſpiritual man in the ſcripture dialect, is the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing character of a good man, or a true Saint, I Cor. ii. 14, 15, and Gal. vi. I. The natural
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:044789_0012_101F066CD42A4EC8"/>
man receiveth not the things of the ſpirit of God, &amp;c. <hi>But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all things: Ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs:</hi> By which it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plain, that by a ſpiritual man, he means a true Saint, or a living member in Chriſt's Church. And it is peculiar to ſuch as are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices; otherwiſe a corrupt tree may bring forth good fruit; but in a word, ſpiritual and holy ſacrifices, are ſuch exerciſes as God requires, being done with thoſe inward and holy affections; ſuch as faith, love, joy, &amp;c. which are effected and maintained by the holy ſpirit of grace, dwelling in thoſe who are the ſubjects of thoſe graces, by his genuine operations, in which he communicates his own image or nature: Such are ſaid to <hi>be made partakers of the divine nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. THE true Church of Chriſt is deſcribed by the acceptance of her ſacrifices, '<hi>Acceptable to God.</hi>' By this the living members of Chriſt's Church are diſtinguiſhed from all others; none beſides thoſe who belong to the true Church are <hi>acceptable to God:</hi> The ſacrifices, i. e. Spiritual ſacrifices of the true Church alone, are acceptable to God; '<hi>But the ſacrifices of the wicked are an abomination.</hi>' Do you deſire to know what acceptance means? I will endeavour to inform you.

It is further evident, in that he is ſaid '<hi>To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice over her.</hi>' That the Lord Jeſus likewiſe takes peculiar pleaſure and delight in his Church and in the exerciſe of her graces, is evident from many endearing appellations, that he gives her as <q>
                  <hi>My ſiſter, my ſpouſe, my love, my dove, my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled;</hi>
               </q> often repeated, <q>I am come into my garden, my ſiſter, my ſpouſe: <hi>I have gathered my myrrh with my ſpice; I have eaten my honey comb with my honey; I have drank my wine with my milk.</hi>
               </q> Cant. V, I. Theſe expreſſions, no doubt, have reference to the Church's graces, in which he greatly delights; that the prayers of the Saints are pleaſing and delightful to God, is evident, in that they are compared to <hi>incenſe,</hi> Rev v, 8. (which was a rich perfume, uſed in ſacrifices by God's appointment, typify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precious blood of Chriſt,) likewiſe the preaching of the Goſpel, by the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, is mentioned as moſt pleaſing and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; though ſome did not believe, 2 Cor. ii, 15. '<hi>We are unto God,'</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>A ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Chriſt, in them that are ſaved, and in them that periſh;</hi>
               </q> and in a word, every ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſacrifice is pleaſing and acceptable to God; which he will moſt graciouſly reward; this brings me to ſay.</p>
            <p>VIII. BY whoſe merits theſe ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices are acceptable to God, '<hi>Acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>' That is, by his merits: excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as the Church is, and, however high in God's account, yet neither the Church nor her ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, (or religious ſervices) are acceptable to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:044789_0013_101F06735BAB86D0"/>
God on account of her own merits or excellency, but wholly by the merits of Chriſt; ſhe is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous, by his righteouſneſs imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; acquitted from the guilt of ſin, by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his atonement; made holy by the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his ſpirit; otherwiſe ſhe could not be acceptable to God. Hence it is, we are ſaid to '<hi>Be made accepted in the beloved,'</hi> Eph. i. 6. The prayers of <hi>all</hi> Saints are ſaid to aſcend, with the incenſe of Chriſt's merit, ſee Rev. viii, 3, 4. However it may be, that ſome ſinners expect acceptance with God, on account of their own excellencies and virtue of their good deeds (as it is certain they have no dependence upon, or truſt in the merits of Chriſt) yet it may be preſumed, that the Saints, or the living members of Chriſt, (acting in character) have no dependence upon any goodneſs or merit of their own, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the divine favour; nor indeed, do they ſo much as deſire acceptance with God, either of their perſons or ſervices, but by the merits of Chriſt; becauſe in no other way, can God, conſiſtently with the honor of his divine, perfections, accept of them: And as they love the divine honor, they cannot in any other way, deſire acceptance. This, in one view, is the true Church of Chriſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> She is alive; all the members in this Church, are living members of Chriſt; they live, by Chriſt living in them: The life is a ſpiritual and divine life: The ſame kind of life is in every true member of this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical body of Chriſt; as is in the divine head: From this divine head, ſpritual life is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:044789_0013_101F06735BAB86D0"/>
to every true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> member in this building; the foundation and the ſuperſtructure are alike. The eſſence of this life, conſiſts in holineſs or divine love. This houſe (the Church) is built upon a rock, and built with <hi>living Stones;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no ſtorms can overthrow it: The blowing winds, and driving rains, how fiercely ſoever they beat upon it, cannot overturn it: No ſtorms of perſecution; no trial or temptation nor yet the gates of hell can overcome it.</p>
            <p>Not one of theſe living Stones, ſhall ever be joſtled from its foundation; not one can ever be moved out of its place; nor one Stone ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from another, in this building; for they are cemented together by an indiſſoluble union: And the cement that holds them together, is divine love, which never fails. <hi>Charity never faileth:</hi> This is a <hi>Royal Prieſthood,</hi> whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices; which are holy and acceptable to God, by the merits of Chriſt; by which ſhe is diſtinguiſhed from all others: None of all the human race beſides, can be compared to her in theſe reſpects; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can offer ſuch ſacrifices: The ſacrifices of the reſt of mankind, are carnal and dead; as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as thoſe offered by Cain and Able; but the ſacrifices offered by this Royal Prieſthood, are ſpiritual and holy, pleaſing and acceptable to God; in which he ſmells a ſweet ſavour, being perfumed with the moſt coſtly <hi>incenſe;</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>merits, righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>atoning blood of God,</hi> Acts xx. 28. Thus I have endeavoured to give you a plain deſcription of the true Church of Chriſt; agreeable to our text.</p>

            <head>I now proceed to the IMPROVEMENT.</head>
            <head>Improvement.</head>
            <p>FROM this deſcription of the Church of Chriſt, it is eaſy to perceive, even at the very firſt bluſh, that no unrenewed, unbelieving perſon, belongs to the true Church of Chriſt. They have none of thoſe diſtinguiſhing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtics of his true Church, as for inſtance, they have no <hi>ſpiritual or divine life or love:</hi> They are not <hi>built upon the living Stone,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, the foundation of the Church: They have no union with Chriſt the head: They derive no ſpiritual nouriſhment from him: If they creep into his fold among his ſheep, they come not in by Chriſt, the door; but climb over ſome other way; and after all, they are but goats, who leave a ſtinking ſavour behind them; and will be ſet on the left hand of Chriſt, in the laſt great day of trial. Though they eat and drink at his table, they are not nouriſhed; and will at laſt be diſowned by Chriſt: And though they have had the faith of miracles, and have caſt out devils in his name, he will bid them depart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed into everlaſting fire: And though they be counted among the living branches in Chriſt the vine, they have no vital union with him nor do they derive any ſap or nouriſhment from him, but are dry and uſeleſs branches, that will be pruned off and caſt into the fire. They have
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:044789_0014_101F0676895D23F8"/>
no proper and indiſſoluble union among the living branches: If in any reſpect, they may be ſaid to be united to the Saints, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper ſenſe; the union can be no better, nor any other, than <hi>the union of the dead and the living together;</hi> in which caſe there can be no <hi>ſpiritual communion.</hi> Communion ſignifies fellowſhip, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, or receiving together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But living and dead branches have no fellowſhip; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or participation of vital ſap from the true vine Chriſt Jeſus; for <q>
                  <hi>For what communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on hath light with darkneſs, or what part have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with unbelievers.</hi>
               </q> "Can the dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and eat the banquet of the living?" (ſaith Mr. J. Allen.) And can they any more, who are ſpiritually dead, participate of the ſpiritual banquets of thoſe ſpiritually alive? Surely no. And however, graceleſs, unrenewed ſouls, may be numbered in the Church of Chriſt; they are not living, but dead; and truly and really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long not to it; for this building is made up of living Stones; not one dead Stone is to be found in it; but of <hi>living Stones, is built a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> This is another diſtinguiſhing character, which every graceleſs-perſon is deſtitute of; for they never have the character of ſpiritual, but carnal, given to them in ſcripture: Spiritual and carnal are very different and oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; by which Saints and ſinners are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The term ſpiritual is taken from the holy ſiprit, (as before noted) they and they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are called ſpiritual in the ſcripture dialect; in whom the holy ſpirit dwells, by his genuine
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:044789_0015_101EFEB3799C1F88"/>
operations; in which he communicates his own nature; <hi>but not his divine eſſence:</hi> The nature which he communicates is a temper or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind like himſelf, i. e. the moral image of God in the ſoul. Now this indwelling of the holy ſpirit is peculiar to the Saints. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, '<hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi>' That it is abundantly evident, that no unrenewed perſon, can have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny juſt pretenſions to union with, or intereſt in this ſpiritual houſe, the true Church. Nor can they lay any juſt claim to this holy Prieſthood; they are not yet ſet apart, (by the divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the holy ſpirit) to offer ſpiritual ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; this they can have no juſt pretenſions to; for none but ſpiritual men can offer ſpiritual ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. They never gave up themſelves, ſoul and body to God; nor any thing that is their's, to be employed in his ſervice. That unholy ſouls do not offer up ſpiritual ſacrifices, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; becauſe theſe ſacrifices are holy: And a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit; <hi>nor doth a bitter fountain ſend forth ſweet waters. Men do not gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.</hi> Even nature itſelf teaches, that the fruit cannot be ſuperior to the tree that bears it. By theſe ſimilitudes our ſaviour ſhews, that it is the diſtinguiſhed character of a good man, to bring forth good fruit, as he himſelf explains it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, no graceleſs perſon can juſtly pretend to acceptance with God: Acceptance, as heretofore explained, ſignifies to be pleaſed or delighted, &amp;c. But God can be pleaſed, or
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:044789_0015_101EFEB3799C1F88"/>
delighted with no one out of Chriſt, as hath been ſhewn; that even the Saints <q>
                  <hi>Are made accepted in the beloved,</hi>
               </q> Eph. vi. 6. Upon whoſe account then do Chriſtleſs, graceleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners expect acceptance? Not on Chriſt, ſurely; for they reject him, and are not united to him; but this <hi>union to Chriſt, is the ground upon which Saints are accepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can graceleſs ſinners, expect acceptance with a God of infinite holineſs, on their own account, without the moſt daring preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and infidelity; for if Saints, who have ſome degree of holineſs within, '<hi>Are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted only in Chriſt the beloved,</hi>' in whoſe righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear. Not in their own indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that is no better than filthy rags; and when truſted in for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, is odious and deteſtable in the ſight of God; whoſe abhorence of it, is expreſſed, by its being <q>
                  <hi>A ſmoke in his noſe, a fire that burneth all the day.</hi>
               </q> His abhorence is further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by his fearful declaration, concerning thoſe <hi>that walk</hi> in the light of their own fire, and in the ſparks which they had kindled; <q>
                  <hi>This ſhall ye have at mine hand,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ye ſhall lie down in ſorrow.</hi>
               </q> This is further evident from the accumulated woes, denounced againſt the ſcribes and phariſees; <hi>Who truſted in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they were righteous and deſpiſed others.</hi> Hence it appears, that ſinners are not accepted, either by Chriſt's rightouſneſs, or their own, for the reaſons mentioned above.</p>

2d. Is the true Church ſo high in God's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as you have heard; as dear as the apple of his eye: We hence learn, how dear ſhe ſhould be to us! How high in our eſteem! For what God highly eſteems and values, he would have as highly eſteemed and valued to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and fit, that what God has ſet his greateſt and everlaſting love upon (in union with the glory of his own attributes,) that his rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creatures, ſhould alſo, in like manner, ſet their hearts upon: And God hath ſet his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, and everlaſting <hi>love,</hi> upon his Church, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed it with his own blood</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Acts xx. 28.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So ought we to <hi>engrave her as upon the palms of our hands; and ſet her as a ſignet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our right arm, as a ſeal upon our heart.</hi> As Chriſt laid down his life for the Church; ſo ought we '<hi>To lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p>We hence learn, how excellent the Church is is. This appears from her being ſo greatly be loved by the ſacred three: True ſhe is imperfect in herſelf and in her outward dreſs, according to the divine law, conſidered in a ſeperate view, (mean without her relation to Chriſt,) but view her as united to her huſband, Chriſt Jeſus; and ſhe '<hi>Has no ſpot nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle: She is compleatly adorned with the righteouſneſs of the law; for Chriſt is the end of <hi>the law for righteouſneſs, to every o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As to internal excellencies; ſhe has all thoſe divine virtues or graces, which are to be found in Chriſt her head and huſband; who hath '<hi>Formed her beauties like his own.</hi>' She has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his fulneſs, and grace for grace; grace anſwering to the grace that is in Chriſt: She is compared to a bride adorned for her huſband, Rev. xxi. 2. She is compared to the King's daughter, <q>
                  <hi>All glorious within, and her garments of wrought gold;</hi>
               </q> and her beloved calls her '<hi>The faireſt</hi>' among women: Her ſpiritual beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are deſcribed by metaphors borrowed almoſt from every thing excellent in nature.

The ſun ſhines upon the moon, and from thence its rays are reflected to the earth, but after all it hath no light in itſelf; but it is not ſo with the Church of Chriſt: True ſhe hath nothing that ſhe did not receive; but then, the divine excellencies that make her ſhine, <hi>are living principles within, which will continue and abide forever: God dwells in his Church, in every member of it; Chriſt lives in them, as you have heard. The Holy Ghoſt lives and dwells in every true member of Chriſt's Church forever; and is in them, a foundation of light, love, joy and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grace. They are made partakers of the divine nature; they have the divine image in them;</hi> they are become <hi>little ſuns, which ſhine always, yea will eternally ſhine; they have light within.</hi>

4th. Is the Church ſo dear to God, ſo high in his eſteem, as you have heard? Hence ſee how very dangerous it is to injure this ſpouſe of Chriſt, though but in one of her members; touch her, and you touch the apple of his eye; injure her, and his almighty arm ſhall ſoon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the wrong. She is injured, when ſhe is deprived of the miniſtry of the word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Goſpel; thoſe breaſts of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which ſhe is refreſhed, and her ſpiritual appetite regaled. The word and ordinances of God, are thoſe cloudy cyſterns, from which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til inriching and refreſhing ſhowers upon them; therefore, whoever deprives her of theſe, greatly injures her.</p>
            <p>This may be done many ways; but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, ſhe may be deprived of the word and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel, by raiſing perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, or her officers; either with the ſword of ſteel, or of the tongue: This may be done by ſtiring up the people againſt the Paſtor, or againſt the truth, unjuſtly fomenting diviſions: A houſe divided againſt itſelf, cannot ſtand: Schiſms and rents in the body wounds it, divide it in the midſt, and it is deſtroyed. True it is, this Church of Chriſt can never be deſtroyed; yet it may be wounded and injured; <q>For it muſt needs be (ſaith our Lord) that offences come, but woe unto that man, by whom the offence cometh; it were better for him that a mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hanged about his neck, and he drowned in the midſt of the ſea, than to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend one of theſe little ones, who believe in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:044789_0017_101F06821CE92368"/>
me.</q> See them, the amazing danger which they expoſe themſelves unto, who wound and injure this ſpouſe of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. Do none belong to the true Church of Chriſt beſides thoſe, whom the ſcripture calls '<hi>living Stones,</hi>' in our text, compacted into one building, cemented together by divine love: Then it is glaringly evident, <hi>that out of this Church, there is no Salvation:</hi> No building of this kind can ſtand, unleſs built upon the living, the chief corner Stone, Chriſt Jeſus, in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this building<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for a houſe built upon the ſand will fall: None but living branches are united to the vine, ſo as to derive any ſap or nouriſhment from it; but will be pruned off, ſeperated from that <hi>ſuperficial and ſeeming union that they have, and caſt into the fire.</hi> The King of the Church hath declared, the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt his Church, built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a rock, but they will eternally prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every dry branch in it. Here it is eaſy to ſee, that no unbeliever is built upon this rock; Such as are only viſibly, in appearance, or by profeſſion, in the Church of Chriſt, are the children of the kingdom that ſhall be caſt our, Mat. viii. 12. Theſe, (he hath told us) he will diſown, as none of his, at the laſt day; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he never knew them to be ſuch as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed themſelves to be; notwithſtanding any boaſted profeſſion of having <hi>eat and drank in his preſence;</hi> or of many great and miraculous things done in his name, even that of caſting out devils. Every <hi>plant (ſaith our Saviour) which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:044789_0018_101F06850C32C5B0"/>
my heavenly father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up. Chriſt laid down his life for the ſheep:</hi> And it was the Church that was redeemed by his blood; ſo that out of this Church there is no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>This diſcourſe may be further improved by way of enquiry; whether we do truly belong to this living Church of Chriſt or not.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The firſt thing to be enquired after, is, whether you have any ſpiritual or divine life in you or not; for there are no lifeleſs members in the true Church of Chriſt, as you have heard. If you are able to determine this point, it will be ſufficient to determine your character. Let me aſk you? Do you perceive any ſigns of life in you? Do you breathe ſpiritually? Do you perform the functions of the living? If you are alive (in the ſenſe we ſpeak,) Chriſt lives in you, the holy ſpirit dwells in you by his divine influences; for the Apoſtle has given, us this ſign, if you have this divine life, '<hi>You have the witneſs in yourſelves:</hi>' Aſk yourſelves, whether you have the fruits of the ſpirit, as faith, love, joy, meekneſs, patience, long ſuffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, goodneſs, &amp;c. I add, if you have this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, you have been quickened, i. e. made ſpiritually alive; who before, were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. If you be riſen with Chriſt, you ſeek thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt Jeſus is: If ſo, your treaſures are laid up in heaven, and your hearts are there alſo: If you are new born, you will deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby;
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:044789_0018_101F06850C32C5B0"/>
you will hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs; you will long after perfect conformity to God: If you be a living member in Chriſt, God will be the object of your ſupreme love and deſires: Your ſouls will pant after God; they will thirſt for God, even for the living God: your meditations of him will be ſweet in the night watches: You will make his word your ſtudy and delight, the man of your council, your guide: According to this rule, you will endeavour to form your hearts and lives. Again enquire: Have you had a <hi>real, ſenſible diſcovery</hi> of the <hi>raviſhing beauty</hi> of Chriſt, the excellency of his perſon and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that he has been very precious to you, high in your account, your joy, your truſt, your foundation upon which you build your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, your atonement, the chiefeſt among ten thouſands, and altogether lovely, your all and in all. Again enquire: Is ſin your burden? your grief, your abhorence? And do you abhor yourſelf, and repent as in duſt in aſhes.' Can you ſincerely anſwer theſe queries, and honeſtly apply all theſe rules of trial? If ſo, then are ye Chriſt's diſciples indeed, members of his true Church.</p>
            <p>And to you this diſcourſe adminiſters ſweet conſolation; for the eternal God, with all his fulneſs is yours forever, your unfailing portion. God is your everlaſting father and unchangeable friend. The enjoyment of this God, is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate happineſs and endleſs bliſs: This divine conſolation is greater than can be expreſſed! How refreſhing, that the eternal God has made

you his ſon and heir; 'heir of all things.' <hi>If ſons, then heirs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt.</hi> O, the inexpreſſible riches contained in this inheritance; how comfortable the thoughts, that Jeſus Chriſt, with all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable riches is yours! that Chriſt Jeſus, in whom dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead, with all his ſaving benefits, is yours! How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to reflect, that you have a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a beautiful and ſpotleſs robe, even the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, a garment fit to be worn in the palace of the King of heaven, a garment which ſhines with equal brightneſs, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to thoſe worn by angels: How comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this; when you reflect how naked you once were; not having cloathing to hide your ſhame, but now adorned with a gorgeous robe, which will never fade, nor be ſoiled in the leaſt, nor be at all the worſe for wearing! How comfortable to reflect upon that near relation you have to the ſon of God; <q>
                  <hi>That you are his brother, ſiſter or mother, his body his member; his fleſh and his Bones, his bride his wife.</hi>
               </q> And that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will never ceaſe; that the Almighty huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will never diſown you; that nothing can ſeperate you from his love: neither angel nor ſpirit; life nor death; nor any other creature: this your union to Chriſt being indiſſoluble! How comfortable to reflect that all the promiſes are yours in Chriſt, being firſt made with him; that in him they are, yea and in him amen; your bread, upon which you may moſt ſweetly feed: Promiſes of all good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> temporal, ſpiritual and

eternal. Eternal life and glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, <hi>no good thing will be withhold from them that love him!</hi> How comfortable to think, that the holy ſpirit of promiſe is given to you, and dwelleth in you, and ſhall abide with you forever: This truly is the ſum of all goſpel bleſſings: He is the ſpirit of grace and conſolation, and his conſolations are neither ſmall nor few. He is the comforter, the ſpirit of truth that will abide with you forever. The conſolations are ſo numerous, which flow from this union to Chriſt; that there is no end of them: Even a large volume would not contain them all, if particularly mentioned. I ſhall therefore leave you to enlarge in your contemplations upon them, 'While life &amp; being laſts;' and ſhall conclude with a word of exhortation, to thoſe of a different character; I mean the Chriſtleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing, to come and participate of this happineſs.</p>
            <p>Come precious ſouls, and be incorporated into this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual building: Be united to Chriſt the living Stone by faith: Be ye living Stones alſo; living branches in Chriſt the true vine: And for motive conſider, this is the way, the only way to inexpreſſible, inconceiveable happineſs; which hath no end; the road to eternal bliſs: The way to every kind of felicity: For out of this Church there is no ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as you have heard: But if out of this Church, you are in the high road to perdition, your way leads down to death and miſery: Suffer me then, precious ſouls, with all the bowels of tenderneſs and compaſſion to perſuade you to be happy: Shall we ſuppoſe you are in love with death, with your own miſery and ruin? Can human nature be ſunk below the principles of natural reaſon and ſelf preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If otherwiſe, why will you not be perſuaded to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of happineſs ſuitable, both in kind and duration, to your being? I beſeech you by all the joys of heaven, and the torments of the damned, that you come into this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe; you have no ſafety elſewhere; no not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I beſeech you by the unparellelled love of God the father, who gave his only begotten ſon to purchaſe your ranſom: I beſeech you by the immenſe love of a dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; by his agony in the garden; his bloody ſweat, his ſtrong cries and tears, while he bore the heavy load of ſin and guilt which was laid upon him; by his dying groans and precious blood, which ſtreamed from his ſacred ſide,

while he was ſuſpended on that curſed engine of cruelty, the croſs; that you will conſent to be happy by believing in Jeſus, and thereby becoming one of his living members, yea, I beſeech you by every thing deſirable, every thing dear to you, by the eternal happineſs of your precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls, that you join this happy ſociety without delay, in the mid<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Why ſleep ye, precious ſouls, in this your market day? Rouze every power, awake every paſſion; and now make ſure an inheritance among the Saints in light. Now is the time to make yourſelves forever; a precious opportunity is now in your hands; <q>
