            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS TO THE Inhabitants of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HAVING in the courſe of the preſent week, laid before the Public, ſome Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which our preſent ſituation called on us to make to the Preſident and Council, and in which we conceived you were equally (tho' not ſo immediately) concerned with ourſelves, and perceiving that advantage is taken of our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to repreſent us to you, as men dangerous to the community: We think ourſelves bound, by the duty we owe to our country, to our families, to thoſe who have heretofore held us in eſteem, and to the general welfare of ſociety, to addreſs you, and lay before you, a particular ſtate of a moſt dangerous attack, which has been made upon the cauſe of civil and religious freedom, by confining, and attempting to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, from their tendereſt connections, a number
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:015496_0004_0F9985D01599C130"/>
of men, who can, without boaſting, claim to themſelves, the characters of upright and good citizens.</p>
            <p>FOR ſome time paſt, it has been a ſubject of public converſation, that liſts were made out of great numbers of the citizens of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> who were to be confined for offences, ſuppoſed to have been committed againſt the intereſts of <hi>America</hi>—Theſe reports were generally preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ariſe from intemperate zeal, and perſonal animoſities; and, until the attempt, which creates the neceſſity of calling your attention to us, little regard ſeem'd to be paid to them.</p>
            <p>BUT a few days ſince the ſcene opened, and we, the ſubſcribers, were called upon, by perſons, not known as public officers of juſtice, to put our names to a paper,
<q>promiſing not to depart from our dwelling-houſes, and to be ready to appear, on the demand of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Council of the ſtate of <hi>Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> and to engage to refrain from doing any thing injurious to the United Free States of <hi>North America,</hi> by ſpeaking, writing, or otherwiſe, and from giving intelligence to the Commander of the Britiſh forces, or any
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:015496_0005_0F9985D0BB48CDB8"/>
other perſon whatever, concerning public affairs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>CONSCIOUS of our innocence, in reſpect to the charges inſinuated in this paper againſt us, and unwilling to part with the liberty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the free air, and following our lawful buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs beyond the narrow limits of our houſes, diſdaining to be conſidered in ſo odious a light, as men who by crimes had forfeited our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and inherent rights, we refuſed to become voluntary priſoners, and rejected the propoſal. We demanded with that boldneſs, which is inſeparable from innocence, to know by what authority they acted, of what crimes we were accuſed meriting ſuch treatment; and tho' to ſome of us the ſmall ſatisfaction was given, of acquainting us, they acted in purſuance of a recommendation of Congreſs; and to others was read, part of a warrant, from the Preſident and Council; yet, not one of us, was allowed the indiſputable right, of either reading or copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Altho' the great number of meſſengers, employed in the execution of this warrant, and of the perſons who were the objects of it, varied ſome of the circumſtances attending it, yet the general tenor of their conduct was uniform,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:015496_0006_0F9985D16A3CA710"/>
and marks the ſpirit which actuated them. We were all upon our refuſal to ſubſcribe, either immediately, or in ſome ſhort time conducted to this place, where we remained in cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, under a military guard, for twenty-four hours, expecting to be inform'd of the cauſe of our being taken, and to have an opportunity of defending ourſelves; but finding no notice taken of us by our perſecutors, we at length, unitedly demanded of one of the principal meſſengers, a copy of the warrant, by virtue of which we were ſeized, in order that we might know from thence, what heinous crimes were charged on us, to juſtify ſuch rigorous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After conſulting his employers, and cauſing ſome delay, he thought proper to grant our demand—But how were we aſtoniſhed to find a General Warrant, ſpecifying no manner of offence againſt us, appointing no authority to hear and judge, whether we were guilty or innocent, nor limiting any duration to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement!—Nor was this extraordinary Warrant more exceptionable in theſe reſpects, than in the powers given to the meſſengers to break, and ſearch not only our own, but all the houſes their heated imaginations might lead them to ſuſpect. It would be tedious to remark all
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:015496_0007_0F9985D2216E6D08"/>
the groſs enormities contained in this engine of modern deſpotiſm: We therefore preſent you with a copy, from the bare peruſal of which, you will form a better idea of the arbitrary ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit it breathes, than from any deſcription we could poſſibly give it.</p>

            <p>CAN any thing more deciſively evidence the want of proof againſt us, and the injuſtice of the inſinuations, than this ſtubborn incontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible fact.—We have demanded as a matter of right, to be heard before both thoſe bodies, who have hitherto declined it.—A demand reaſonable in itſelf, founded on the immutable principles of equity, and warranted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution under which the Council derive every power they claim.</p>

                        <p>THE order appears to be arbitrary, as you have aſſum'd an authority, not founded on law or reaſon, to deprive us, who are peaceable men, and have never born arms of our Liberty, by a military force, when you might have directed a legal courſe of proceeding—unjuſt, as we have not attempted, nor are charged with any act, inconſiſtent with the character we have ſteadily maintained, of good citizens, ſolicitous to promote the real intereſt, and proſperity of our country, and that it is illegal, is evident, from the peruſal and conſideration of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the government, from which you derive all your authority and power.</p>
                        <p>WE, therefore, claim our undoubted right as Freemen, having a juſt ſenſe of the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value of religious and civil Liberty, to be heard before we are confin'd, in the manner directed by the ſaid order; and we have the

and on our lawful occaſions, and conducted to this place, where we have been kept in cloſe confinement, under a ſtrong military guard, two or more days—that altho' divers of us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the meſſengers who arreſted us, and inſiſted on having copies of the ſaid warrant, yet we were not able to procure the ſame, till this preſent time, but have remained here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſed and unheard. We now take the earlieſt opportunity of laying our grievances before your body, from whom we apprehend they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and of claiming to ourſelves the Liberties and Privileges to which we are entitled by the fundamental rules of juſtice, by our birthright and inheritance, the laws of the land; and by the expreſs proviſion of the preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, under which your board derive their power.</p>
                           <p>WE apprehend, that no man can lawfully be deprived of his Liberty, without a warrant from ſome perſons having competent authority, ſpecifying in offence againſt the laws of the land, ſupported by oath or affirmation of the accuſer, and limiting the time of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until he is heard, or legally diſcharged,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015496_0021_0F9985DE50396D58"/>
unleſs the party be found in the actual perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of a crime. Natural juſtice, equally with law, declares that the party accuſed ſhould know what he is to anſwer to, and have an opportunity of ſhewing his innocence. — Theſe principles are ſtrongly enforced in the ninth and tenth ſections of the Declaration of Rights, which form a fundamental and inviolable part of the Conſtitution, from which you drive your power, wherein it is declared,</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. "THAT in all proſecutions for crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by himſelf and his Council, to demand the cauſe and nature of his accuſation, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted with the witneſſes, to call for evidence in his favour, and a ſpeedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country; without the unanimous conſent of which jury, he cannot be found guilty—Nor can he be compelled to give evidence againſt himſelf; nor can any man be juſtly deprived of his liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers."</p>
                           <p n="10">X. "THAT the people have a right to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015496_0022_0F9985DEEE3EDE00"/>
hold themſelves, their houſes, papers, and poſſeſſions, free from ſearch or ſeizure, and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations firſt made, affording a ſufficient foundation for them, and whereby any officer or meſſenger may be commanded or required to ſearch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected places, or to ſeize any perſon or perſons, his or their property not particularly deſcribed, are contrary to that right and ought not to be granted."</p>
                           <p>How far theſe principles have been adhered to, in the courſe of this buſineſs, we ſhall go on to ſhew.</p>
                           <p>UPON the examination of the ſaid warrant, we find it is, in all reſpects, inadequate to theſe deſcriptions, altogether unprecedented in this or any free country, both in its ſubſtance, and the latitude given to the meſſengers who were to execute it, and wholly ſubverſive of the very Conſtitution you profeſs to ſupport.—The only charge on which it is founded, is a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Congreſs to apprehend and ſecure all perſons who in their general conduct and converſation have evidenced a diſpoſition inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to the cauſe of America, and particularly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015496_0023_0F9985DFB359C080"/>
naming ſome of us,—but not ſuggeſting the leaſt offence to have been committed by us.</p>
                           <p>IT authoriſes the meſſengers to ſearch all papers belonging to us, upon a bare poſſibility, that ſomething political may be found, but without the leaſt ground for a ſuſpicion of the kind.</p>
                           <p>IT requires papers, relative to the ſufferings of the people called Quakers, to be ſeized, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limiting the ſearch to any houſe, or number of houſes; under colour of which, every houſe in this city, might be broke open.</p>
                           <p>TO the perſons whom the Congreſs have thought proper to ſelect, the Warrant adds a number of the inhabitants of the city, of whom ſome of us are part; without the leaſt inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they are within the deſcription given by the Congreſs, in their recommendation.</p>
                           <p>IT directs all theſe matters to be executed (tho' of the higheſt importance to the Liberties of the people) at the diſcretion of a ſet of men, who are under no qualification for the due exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the office, and are unaccuſtomed to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015496_0024_0F9985E07081F418"/>
the forms of executing civil proceſs, from whence probably, have proceeded the exceſſes and irregularities committed by ſome of them, in divers inſtances, by refuſing to give copies of the proceſs to the parties arreſted, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of us, a reaſonable time to conſider of anſwers, and prepare for confinement.—In the abſence of others, by breaking our deſks and other private repoſitories—and by ranſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carrying off domeſtic papers, printed books, and other matters not within the terms of the Warrant.</p>
                           <p>IT limits no time for the duration of our impriſonment, nor points at any hearing, which is an abſolute requiſite to make a legal Warrant; but confounds in one Warrant, the power to apprehend, and the authority to commit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interpoſing a judicial officer between the parties and the meſſenger.</p>
                           <p>UPON the whole, we conceive this Warrant and the proceedings thereupon, to be far more dangerous in its tendency, and a more flagrant violation of every right which is dear to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than any that can be found in the records of the Engliſh conſtitution.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015496_0025_0F9985E1278FAF80"/>BUT when we conſider the uſe to which this GENERAL WARRANT has been applied, and the Perſons upon whom it has been execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>(Who challenge the World to charge them with offence)</hi> it becomes of too great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to be conſidered as the cauſe of a Few.— It is the cauſe of every Inhabitant, and may, if permitted to paſs into a Precedent, eſtabliſh a Syſtem of Arbitrary Power unknown but in the Inquiſition, or the deſpotic Courts of the Eaſt.</p>
                           <p>WHAT adds further to this alarming ſtretch of power is, that we are informed the Vice-Preſident of the Council, has declared to one of the Magiſtrates of the City, who called on him to enquire into the Cauſe of our confinement, that we were to be ſent to Virginia UNHEARD.</p>
                           <p>SCARCELY could we believe ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have been made by a perſon who fills the ſecond place in the government, till we were this day confirmed in the melancholy truth by three of the ſubſcribers, <hi>whom you abſolutely refuſed to hear in perſon, or by Council.</hi>—We would remind you of the complaints urged by
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015496_0026_0F9985E1F7FBF478"/>
numbers of yourſelves againſt the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> for condemning the town of <hi>Boſton</hi> UNHEARD, and we call upon you to reconcile your <hi>preſent</hi> conduct with your <hi>then</hi> profeſſions, or your repeated declarations in favour of general Liberty.—</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>In the name therefore of the whole body of the Freemen of Pennſylvania,</hi> whoſe Liberties are radically ſtruck at in this arbitrary impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of us, their <hi>unoffending</hi> fellow-citizens: We DEMAND an audience; that ſo our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence may appear, and perſecution give place to juſtice.—But if, regardleſs of every ſacred obligation by which men are bound to each other in ſociety, and of that Conſtitution by which you profeſs to govern, which you have ſo loudly magnified for the free ſpirit it breathes, you are ſtill determined to proceed; be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the righteous judge of all the earth for the integrity of our hearts, and the unparalelled tyranny of <hi>your</hi> meaſures.</p>

            <p>THE foregoing Remonſtrance was delivered to <hi>Thomas Wharton,</hi> junr. Preſident, &amp;c. laſt evening, who promiſed to lay it before Council, and ſend an anſwer to one of the Gentlemen, who delivered it to him this morning; but no anſwer has yet been received.</p>
            <p>September 5th, half paſt two o'clock, P. M.</p>
            <p>THUS the matter reſted till about ſeven o'clock yeſterday evening, when inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015496_0028_0F9985E3E6A0BBA0"/>
an anſwer to our repeated demand of an hearing, which we ſtill adhere to as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right, the Secretary of the Council incloſed to <hi>William Bradford,</hi> a copy of a new reſolve, deſiring him to acquaint us with it; wherein, without the leaſt mention of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their inſinuations againſt us, they ſhift the ground on which they ſet out, and propoſe a teſt to be taken by us, in full ſatisfaction of all their ſuſpicions.—</p>
            <p>TO this reſolve we are preparing an anſwer, which we intend ſoon to lay before them: And in the mean time, we beg you will avoid the being influenced by any anonymous publications which our adverſaries, to draw our attention from the immediate object before us, may utter againſt us, filled with falſehoods and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, which they may be encouraged to publiſh from an aſſurance that the printers would conceal their names.</p>
            <p>OUR attention is now engaged in a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſtruggle, for civil and religious Liberty; we therefore hope, you will not expect us to waſte that time in refuting ſuch anonymous performances, which is wholly requiſite for
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015496_0029_0F9985E44BC419A8"/>
bringing this grand point to a proper concluſion. We cannot however wholly paſs by a publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the laſt Evening Poſt, calculated to throw an odium on the juſt cauſe in which we are ſuffering: It is repreſented in that piece, that the Quakers are the principal objects of reſentment, and the cauſe aſſigned is the iſſuing <hi>"ſeditious publications ſtiled Teſtimonies"</hi> one of which they aſſert has been unſeaſonably pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at two critical periods.</p>
            <p>A ſingle ray of chriſtian charity, would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſhew the uncandid conſtruction put by that writer upon the exerciſe of thoſe religious rights ſecured by the conſtitution to every reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſociety of warning, and admoniſhing their members to avoid every thing inconſiſtent with the principles they hold.—It is well known, that at both the times hinted at, contending armies were endeavouring <hi>within the circle of their yearly meeting,</hi> to procure all perſons that ſhould come in their way to join them in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary preparations.</p>
            <p>THE Teſtimony of the Quakers is againſt all wars and fighting, and againſt entering into military engagements of any kind; ſurely then,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015496_0030_0F9985E564FE3AE8"/>
it was the right of the Repreſentatives of that Society, to caution their Members from engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any thing contrary to their Religious Principles. But if it be an offence in thoſe who were active in that Publication, what have thoſe of us done who are not Members of that Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, who are of the Church of England (which two denominations comprehend all the ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers) and who have publiſhed NO Teſtimonies.</p>
            <p>BUT this cannot be conſidered by the Writer as a dangerous Publication, or why does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſh it in the preſent critical ſituation of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs; ſurely this charge is a mere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to vilify a reſpectable body of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
            <p>THUS we have furniſhed you with a calm, and diſpaſſionate account of our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and we wiſh to have it conſidered as a vindication of our own characters, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, tho' firm aſſertion of the unalienable rights of Freemen.</p>
            <p>DIFFICULTIES may perhaps await us, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the aſſiſtance of that Almighty Being, who is the Guardian of the innocent, We pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015496_0031_0F9985E5A188A3F8"/>
to meet them, rather than endanger PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC HAPPINESS AND FREEDOM by a voluntary ſurrender of thoſe Rights which we have never forfeited.</p>

               <hi>P. S.</hi> THE foregoing Addreſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and intended for publication in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſt of the 6th inſtant; but before we thought proper to deliver it to the Printer, we choſe to have ſome converſation with him; he was ſent for, and attended us; we told him we had a paper to publiſh in our vindication, with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015496_0032_0F9985E7B76BFD00"/>
our names ſigned, that as we were confin'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſuſpicions unknown to us, it was hard we ſhould be attacked by anonymous writers in the papers, our characters aſperſed, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices excited againſt us, when we were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a hearing, which ought to be unbiaſs'd and impartial. We therefore required of him, as what we thought a matter of right, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rules of every impartial Free Preſs, that he would refrain from publiſhing hereafter any anonymous papers reflecting upon us, and that he would acquaint us with the name of the writer of two paragraphs, in the then laſt Poſt, highly injurious to our characters. To the former he gave us an abſolute promiſe to adhere; to the latter he ſaid, that he could not give up the name without the writer's conſent; that he would go to him, and return with his anſwer as ſoon as he could, at the ſame time promiſing, that if we deſired it, he would inſert our Addreſs in the Poſt of that evening, tho' it would delay it's appearance till ſome time the next day: He went away and we have not ſince heard from him. Hence we conclude the writer is aſhamed to avow the performance.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:015496_0033_0F9985E8BB8ED380"/>WE now lay before you a Remonſtrance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to Congreſs by eight of us, who were ſelected by them, and recommended to the Council as dangerous men, who ought to be ſecured, the reſt of us being named by the Council themſelves and included together with them in the General Warrant.</p>

                        <p>CONSCIOUS of our innocence, and that we have miniſtred no juſt occaſion, to have our characters thus traduced, and injuriouſly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we have remonſtrated to the ſaid Preſident and Council, againſt their arbitrary, unjuſt, and illegal proceedings againſt us, and demanded our undoubted right of being heard by them: Knowing we can manifeſt the falſehood and injuſtice, of any injurious charge, or ſuſpicions, they or you, may entertain concerning us; but we are denied the opportunity of ſuch a hearing, and were laſt evening informed, by their order, that they have reſolved to ſend us to <hi>Stanton,</hi> in the county of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> to be ſecured there—and we are now told, that place is appointed by you, for our confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

ſuggeſted to, and entertained by you or them, againſt us—being aſſured we ſhall appear to be true friends to, and anxiouſly ſolicitous for the proſperity of America, on the principles of juſtice and liberty—and tho' we are clearly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, from the precepts of Chriſt, the doctrine of his Apoſtles, and the example of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the primitive ages of Chriſtianity, that all outward wars and fightings are unlawful, and therefore cannot join therein, for any cauſe whatever.—We cannot but remind you, that we are by the ſame principles reſtrained from purſuing any meaſures, inconſiſtent with the Apoſtolic advice, "To live peaceably with all men," under whatever powers it is our lot to live, which rule of conduct, we are determined to obſerve, whatever you, or any others may determine concerning us.</p>

we are all to appear before the Tribunal of Divine Juſtice, there to render an account of our actions, and to receive a reward according as our works have been.—And we ſincerely deſire for you, as we do for ourſelves, that we may all ſo direct our courſe, that we may at that Tribunal, receive the anſwer, "of well done," and enjoy the reward of Eternal Peace and Happineſs.</p>

                        <p>THAT it is with pain, we find ourſelves under the diſagreeable neceſſity, of again remonſtrating againſt your extraordinary mode
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015496_0041_0F9985EEA4D394F0"/>
of treating us; when our laſt Remonſtrance was delivered to your Preſident, he gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to our fellow-citizens who waited on him, that he would lay it before you, and return an anſwer—Notwithſtanding which, we have as yet received no anſwer whatſoever to it, but inſtead thereof, a paper ſigned by your Secretary, was delivered to us by <hi>William Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the contents of which we ſhall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remark on.</p>
                        <p>BUT we muſt not omit another letter receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' the ſame channel, by which we are confirm'd in the truth of what we had before heard, that on the very day you were addreſſed by three of us to <hi>be heard,</hi> and before we were furniſhed with a copy of the GENERAL WAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANT, you had reſolved to baniſh us to <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in the county of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> in <hi>Virginia,</hi> a place where you claim no juriſdiction, and to which we are utter ſtrangers; this reſolution formed againſt a body of innocent Freemen, while demanding to be <hi>heard,</hi> is, we believe, the firſt inſtance of the kind to be found in the hiſtory of our country: and, beſides the violent infringement of the laws and conſtitution which you have engaged to govern by, the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:015496_0042_0F9985EF791AF138"/>
hardſhip is heightened by the particular ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that country at this time; as it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly aſſerted, that the Indians have already commenced hoſtilities upon the frontiers of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> not very far diſtant from the place of our intended baniſhment, as tho' you could find no place of ſecurity without endangering our lives.</p>
                        <p>FROM the profeſſions you have repeatedly made of your love of Liberty and Juſtice, and the manner in which we have demanded our undoubted rights, we had reaſon to expect to have heard from you on the ſubject of our laſt Remonſtrance; but we find we were miſtaken, and the complaints of injured Freemen ſtill remain unanſwered.</p>
                        <p>WHETHER you imagine we are of too little conſequence to be regarded, or expect that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement will reduce us to a tame acquieſcence with your arbitrary proceedings, we ſhall not determine; it will not divert our attention from the important object we have in view in behalf of ourſelves, and our country.—Nor will ſubtle propoſals fit only to captivate the unwary, decoy us from the ſure ground on which we ſtand in

to a meaſure as illegal, and unconſtitutional as <hi>your</hi> GENERAL WARRANT, and <hi>our</hi> oppreſſive treatment under it.</p>
                        <p>THE propoſition contain'd in your reſolve of the 5th inſt. to diſcharge us upon taking the Teſt "required by law," or the <hi>new Teſt fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by yourſelves</hi> now demand our notice.</p>
                        <p>AND firſt we would obſerve that if you had a right to make ſuch a propoſition, we think it very improper to be made to men in our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You have firſt deprived us of our Liberty, on one pretence, which finding you are not able to juſtify, you wave, and require as a condition of our enlargement, that we ſhould confeſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men of ſuſpicious characters by doing what ought not to be expected from innocent men. This kind of procedure is not new in hiſtory; for tho' the great patriots of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution found better expedients for the ſecurity of their government, than what ariſes from oaths of abjuration, yet the annals, both of Old and New-England are ſtained with accounts of men, in circumſtances ſimilar to our own, dragged before magiſtrates, on the bare ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of crimes; of whom Teſts, which they
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015496_0044_0F9985F0E8802230"/>
conſcientiouſly ſcrupled to take, have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards demanded, as the condition of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.—But ſuch examples we ſhould hope, would not have found patrons among men profeſſing to be reformers upon all the plans of civil and religious Liberty, adopted by the free nations of Europe.</p>
                        <p>IT is ſtrange to us that men intruſted with <hi>Supreme Executive Powers</hi> ſhould be ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the laws you have moſt ſolemnly engaged to execute, as to require us to do more than thoſe very laws enjoin. By the Teſt Act every inhabitant may take the Teſt, and enjoy all the rights of Freemen, or decline it, and ſubmit to a deprivation of ſome of them, of which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in that Act; but no power is given to any officer of juſtice whatſoever, to tender it to any perſon except in particular circumſtances, and as the charge againſt us is not founded on a breach of that law, it is evident you exceeded your authority in putting it to us. But if after what is paſt, we could be ſurprized at any thing you do, we ſhould have been aſtoniſhed at the rapid progreſs of your uſurpation in aſſuming Legiſlative Powers to yourſelves, while the Aſſembly was ſitting under the ſame roof. You
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015496_0045_0F9985F1ACFE47B0"/>
have overturned the only ſecurity the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has given the people againſt abſolute deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, by attempting to exerciſe the authority of framing a Reſolve operating as a Law at the ſame time, the powers of executing it.</p>
                        <p>YOUR duty as one branch of the Conſtitution is confined to the executing the laws as you find them, and does not extend to the making new ones to ſalve your own irregular conduct. You have undertaken all this by propoſing a new Teſt of your own enacting, unknown, to the Laws and Conſtitution of the Government which you are to execute, unſupported by any authority under which you act; and this an <hi>ex poſt facto</hi> Law made to criminate by a refuſal, thoſe who before were innocent. And if we were in your opinion, ſuch dangerous perſons, as you, under the ſanction of the Congreſs, have endeavoured to repreſent us, and could not be ſecured without ſending us to ſo remote and dangerous part of the country, beyond the limits of your juriſdiction, how will the public be ſecured by our taking either of the Teſts you have propoſed;—That men of bad principles will ſubmit to any Teſts to cover their dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015496_0046_0F9985F2FB4917F0"/>
and wicked purpoſes is evident to all who have been converſant in public affairs.</p>
                        <p>THE great Lord Hallifax, who in the name of the People of England preſented the Crown to King William and Queen Mary at the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, has expreſſed himſelf on this ſubject, in the following nervous terms, "As there is no real ſecurity to any ſtate by oaths, ſo no private perſon, much leſs ſtateſman would ever order his affairs as relying on it; for no man would ever ſleep with open doors, or unlock'd-up-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or plate, ſhould all the Town be ſworn not to rob."</p>
                        <p>ANOTHER moſt extraordinary proceeding we find in your Secretary's letter, where he ſays that <hi>you aſked and received the advice of Congreſs,</hi> upon our Remonſtrance before you determined upon it. What! ſhall unaccuſed Citizens, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding their inherent rights be delayed, or refuſed a Hearing until Congreſs can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted? A Body, who have engaged not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere in the internal police of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Perhaps you thought the authority of a recommendation from Congreſs would render your arbitrary deſigns effectual, and countenance
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015496_0047_0F9985F35FD69AB0"/>
you in the eyes of the people. We truſt you will be miſtaken, and that neither Congreſs nor the people will approve your meaſures.</p>
                        <p>HAVING thus remarked on your propoſal, proteſting our innocence, we again repeat our preſſing demand, to be informed of the cauſe of our commitment, and to have a hearing in the face of our country, before whom we ſhall either ſtand acquitted, or condemned.</p>

                        <p>We have never been ſuffered to come before you to evince our innocence, and remove ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions which you have laboured to inſtil into the minds of others, and at the ſame time knew to be groundleſs, altho' Congreſs recommended it to you to give us a hearing, and your Preſident this morning aſſured two of our friends we ſhould have it.</p>
