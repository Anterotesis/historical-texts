            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">I. IN Anſwer to yours of the Third In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I much condole with you your unhappy Circumſtances, of being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced amongſt ſuch Company, where, as you ſay, you continually hear the Sacred <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the Hiſtories therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, particularly of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all <hi>Revealed</hi> Religion, turned into Ridicule, by Men who ſet up for <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> And they ſay, That there is no greater Ground to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than in <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003675_0003_100244999BD6C138"/>That all theſe Pretences to <hi>Revelation</hi> are <hi>Cheats,</hi> and ever have been among <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Jews, Mahometans,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> That they are all alike Impoſitions of <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>Deſigning Men,</hi> upon the <hi>Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> at firſt, of <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>unthinking</hi> People, till, their Numbers encreaſing, their Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grew <hi>popular,</hi> came at laſt to be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Laws; and then the Force of <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> gives a Byaſs to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of after Ages, till ſuch Deceits come really to be believ'd, being receiv'd upon <hi>Truſt,</hi> from the Ages foregoing, without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Bottom</hi> of them. Which theſe our modern Men of <hi>Senſe,</hi> (as they deſire to be eſteem'd) ſay, That they only do, that they only have their <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> freed from the ſlaviſh Authority of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> in Matters of <hi>Truth,</hi> which, they ſay, ought only to be decided by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> tho' by a rudent Compliance with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> they preſerve themſelves from <hi>Outrage,</hi> and legal <hi>Penalties;</hi> for none of their Complexion are addicted to <hi>Sufferings,</hi> or <hi>Martyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Sir, That which you deſire from me, is, ſome ſhort Topic of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> if ſuch can be found, whereby, without running to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,</hi> and the intricate Mazes of <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> which breed long Diſputes, and which theſe Men of <hi>Reaſon</hi> deny by wholeſale, tho'
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003675_0004_100202B1B0033E98"/>they can give no <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it; only ſuppoſe that <hi>Authors</hi> have been Trump'd upon us, <hi>Interpolated,</hi> and <hi>Corrupted,</hi> ſo that no Streſs can be laid upon them, tho' it cannot be ſhewn wherein they are ſo <hi>Corrupted;</hi> which, in Reaſon, ought to lie upon them to prove, who alledge it; otherwiſe it is not only a <hi>Precarious,</hi> but a <hi>Guilty Plea:</hi> And the more, that they refrain not to quote Books on their Side, for whoſe Authority there are no better, or not ſo good Grounds. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, you ſay, it makes your Diſputes end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and they go away with Noiſe and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and a Boaſt, That there is nothing, at leaſt nothing <hi>Certain,</hi> to be ſaid on the <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Side. Therefore you are deſirous to find ſome <hi>one Topic of Reaſon,</hi> which ſhould demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, and at the ſame Time, diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>Impoſtures</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the old <hi>Pagan</hi> World: That our <hi>Deiſts</hi> may be brought to this <hi>Teſt,</hi> and be either obliged to renounce their <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the common <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> or to ſubmit to the clear Proof, from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, which muſt be ſuch a <hi>Proof,</hi> as no <hi>Impoſture</hi> can pretend to, otherwiſe it cannot prove the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion not to be an <hi>Impoſture.</hi> And, whether ſuch a Proof, one ſingle Proof (to avoid Confuſion) is not to be ſound out, you deſire to know from me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003675_0005_1002449C01477420"/>
And you ſay, That you cannot imagine but there muſt be ſuch a <hi>Proof,</hi> becauſe every <hi>Truth</hi> is in itſelf <hi>Clear,</hi> and <hi>One;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>One</hi> Reaſon for it, if it be the true Reaſon, muſt be ſufficient; and if <hi>ſufficient,</hi> it is better than <hi>many;</hi> for Multiplicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds, eſpecially to weak Judgments.</p>
            <p>Sir, You have impos'd an hard Task up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; I wiſh I could perform it: For tho' <hi>every Truth</hi> is <hi>One,</hi> yet our Sight is ſo feeble, that we cannot (always) come to it <hi>directly,</hi> but by many <hi>Inferences,</hi> and laying of Things together.</p>
            <p>But I think, that in the Caſe before us, there is ſuch a Proof as You require, and I will ſet it down as <hi>ſhort</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> as I can.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Firſt then, I ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Truth of the Doctrine of</hi> CHRIST, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently evinced, if the <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> which are recorded of him in the <hi>Goſpels</hi> be <hi>true;</hi> for his <hi>Miracles,</hi> if <hi>true,</hi> do vouch the <hi>Truth</hi> of what he delivered.</p>
            <p>The ſame is to be ſaid as to <hi>Moſes.</hi> If he brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> in that miraculous Manner, which is related in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and did ſuch other won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Things as are there told of him, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that he was ſent from GOD: Theſe being the ſtrongeſt Proofs we can deſire, and which every <hi>Deiſt</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003675_0006_1002035245AFA488"/>he would acquieſce in, if he ſaw them with his Eyes. Therefore the Streſs of this Cauſe will depend upon the Proof of theſe <hi>Matters of Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And the Method I will take, is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To lay down ſuch <hi>Rules,</hi> as to the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> in General, that where they All meet, ſuch <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> cannot be <hi>falſe.</hi> And then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew that all theſe <hi>Rules</hi> do meet in the <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that they do not meet in the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> of the <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> or can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly meet in any <hi>Impoſture</hi> whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Rules</hi> are theſe. 1ſt. <hi>That the</hi> Matters of Fact <hi>be ſuch, as that Mens out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes, their</hi> Eyes <hi>and</hi> Ears, <hi>may be Judges of it.</hi> 2. <hi>That it be done</hi> Publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>in the Face of the World.</hi> 3. <hi>That not only publick</hi> Monuments <hi>be kept up in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it, but ſome outward</hi> Actions <hi>to be performed.</hi> 4. <hi>That ſuch</hi> Monuments <hi>and ſuch</hi> Actions <hi>or</hi> Obſervances <hi>be</hi> inſtituted, <hi>and do</hi> commence <hi>from the</hi> Time that <hi>the</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact <hi>was done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Two</hi> firſt <hi>Rules</hi> make it impoſſible for any ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> to be impoſed upon Men, at the Time when ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> was ſaid to be done, becauſe every Man's <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Senſes</hi> would contradict it. For Example: Suppoſe any Man ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003675_0007_1002449F64665430"/>that Yeſterday he divided the <hi>Thames,</hi> in Preſence of all the People of <hi>London,</hi> and carried the whole City, <hi>Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> over to <hi>Southwark,</hi> on dry Land, the <hi>Waters</hi> ſtanding like Walls on both Sides: I ſay, it is morally impoſſible that he could perſwade the People of <hi>London,</hi> that this was true, when every <hi>Man, Woman,</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> could contradict him, and ſay, That this was a notorious Falſhood, for that they had not ſeen the <hi>Thames</hi> ſo divided, or had gone over on dry Land. Therefore I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (and I ſuppoſe, with the Allowance of all the <hi>Deiſts</hi> in the World) that no ſuch Impoſition could be put upon Men, at the <hi>Time</hi> when ſuch <hi>publick Matter of Fact</hi> was ſaid to be done.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Therefore it only remains, that ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> might be invented ſome Time after, when the Men of that Generation, wherein the Thing was ſaid to be done, are all paſt and gone; and the Credulity of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Ages might be impoſed upon, to believe that Things were done in former Ages, which were not.</p>
            <p>And for this, the <hi>Two</hi> laſt <hi>Rules</hi> ſecure us, as much as the <hi>Two</hi> firſt <hi>Rules,</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Caſe; for whenever ſuch a <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> came to be invented, if not only <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents</hi> were ſaid to remain of it, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that publick <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Obſervances</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003675_0008_100203543A93F4D8"/>were conſtantly uſed ever ſince the <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> was ſaid to be done, the Deceit muſt be detected, by no ſuch <hi>Monuments</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the Experience of every <hi>Man, Woman,</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> who muſt know that no ſuch <hi>Actions,</hi> or <hi>Obſervances,</hi> were ever us'd by them. For Example, Suppoſe I ſhould now invent a Story of ſuch a Thing done a Thouſand Years ago, I might, perhaps, get ſome to believe it; but if I ſay, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a Thing was done, but that from that Day to this, every Man, at the Age of <hi>Twelve</hi> Years, had a <hi>Joint</hi> of his <hi>Little Finger</hi> cut off; and that every Man in the Nation did want a <hi>Joint</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Finger;</hi> and that this <hi>Inſtitution</hi> was ſaid to be Part of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact</hi> done ſo many Years ago, and vouch'd as a <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of it, and as having deſcended, without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and been conſtantly practic'd, in Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> all along, from the Time that ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> was done: I ſay, it is impoſſible I ſhould be believed in ſuch a Caſe, becauſe every one could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me, as to the <hi>Mark</hi> of cutting off a <hi>Joint</hi> of the <hi>Finger;</hi> and that being Part of my original <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> muſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the whole to be falſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let us now come to the <hi>Second</hi> Point, to ſhew, that the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003675_0009_100244A0ECEB0218"/>and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have all theſe <hi>Rules,</hi> or <hi>Marks</hi> before mentioned; and that neither the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or what is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> have the like; and that no <hi>Impoſtor</hi> can have them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Moſes,</hi> I ſuppoſe it will be allow'd me, that he could not have perſwaded 600000 Men, that he had brought them out of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> thro' the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> fed them 40 Years without <hi>Bread,</hi> by miraculous <hi>Manna,</hi> and the other <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> recorded in his Books, if they had not been true. Becauſe every Man's <hi>Senſes</hi> that were then alive, muſt have cantradicted it. And therefore he muſt have impos'd upon all their <hi>Senſes,</hi> if he could have made them believe it, when it was <hi>falſe,</hi> and no ſuch Things done. So that here are the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> of the above mentioned <hi>Four</hi> Marks.</p>
            <p>For the ſame Reaſon, it was equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to have made them receive his <hi>Five</hi> Books, as Truth, and not to have rejected them, as a manifeſt <hi>Impoſture;</hi> which told of all theſe Things as done before their <hi>Eyes,</hi> if they had not been ſo done. See how poſitively he ſpeaks to them, <hi>Deut.</hi> xi. 2. to Ver. 8. <hi>And know you this Day, for I ſpeak not with your Children, which have not known, and which have not ſeen the Chaſtiſement of the Lord your God, his Greatneſs, his mighty Hand, and his ſtretched out Arm, and his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003675_0010_1002036713CFAF90"/>Miracles, and his Acts, which he did in the midſt of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>unto</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>the King of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and unto all his Land, and what he did unto the Army of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>unto their Horſes, and to their Chariots; how he made the Water of the</hi> Red Sea <hi>to overflow them as they purſued after you; and how the Lord hath deſtroyed them unto this Day: And what he did unto you in the Wilderneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ye came into this Place; and what he did unto</hi> Dathan <hi>and</hi> Abiram, <hi>the Sons of</hi> Eliab, <hi>the Son of</hi> Reuben; <hi>how the Earth opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed them up, and their Houſholds, and their Tents, and all the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that was in their Poſſeſſion, in the midſt of all</hi> Iſrael. <hi>But your Eyes have ſeen all the great Acts of the Lord, which he did,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From hence we muſt ſuppoſe it impoſſible that theſe Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (if an Impoſture) could have been invented, and put upon the People, who were then alive, when all theſe Things were ſaid to be done.</p>
            <p>The utmoſt therefore that even a <hi>Suppoſe</hi> can ſtretch to, is, that theſe Books were wrote in ſome Age after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put out in his Name.</p>
            <p>And to this, I ſay, that if it was ſo, it was impoſſible that thoſe <hi>Books</hi> ſhould have been received as the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in that Age wherein they may have been ſuppos'd to have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003675_0011_100244A4212F1E00"/>been firſt invented. Why? Becauſe they ſpeak of themſelves as delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and kept in the <hi>Ark</hi> from his Time. <hi>And it came to paſs, when</hi> Moſes <hi>had made an End of writing the Words of this Law in a Book, until they were finiſhed, that</hi> Moſes <hi>commanded the</hi> Levites <hi>who bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, ſaying, take this Book of the Law, and put it in the Side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a Witneſs againſt thee,</hi> Deut. xxxi. 24, 25, 26. And there was a <hi>Copy</hi> of this <hi>Book</hi> to be left like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with the <hi>King. And it ſhall be when he ſitteth upon the Throne of his Kingdom, that he ſhall write him a Copy of this Law in a Book, out of that which is before the Prieſts the</hi> Levites: <hi>And it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the Days of his Life; that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, and keep all the Words of this Law, and theſe Statutes, to do them,</hi> Deut. xvii. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Here you ſee, that this Book of the <hi>Law</hi> ſpeaks of it ſelf, not only as an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Relation</hi> of what Things were then done; but as the <hi>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>municipal Law</hi> and <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> binding the <hi>King</hi> as well as the <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in whatever Age after <hi>Moſes</hi> you will ſuppoſe this <hi>Book</hi> to have been <hi>forged,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003675_0012_1002446F457CE070"/>it was impoſſible it could be received as Truth, becauſe it was not then to be found, either in the <hi>Ark,</hi> or with the <hi>King,</hi> or any where elſe: For when firſt invented, every Body muſt know, that they had never heard of it before.</p>
            <p>And therefore they could leſs believe it to be the <hi>Book</hi> of their <hi>Statutes,</hi> and the ſtanding <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> which they had all along received, and by which they had been <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could any Man, now at this Day, invent a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> and make it paſs upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the only <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Statutes</hi> that ever they had known? As impoſſible was it for the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> (if they were invented in any Age after <hi>Moſes</hi>) to have been received for what they declare themſelves to be, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Municipal Law</hi> of the Nation of the <hi>Jews:</hi> And to have perſwaded the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they had <hi>Own'd</hi> and <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd</hi> theſe <hi>Books,</hi> all along from the Days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to that Day in which they were firſt invented; that is, that they had <hi>Own'd</hi> them before they had ever ſo much as <hi>Heard</hi> of them. Nay more, the whole Nation muſt, in an Inſtant, forget their former <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> if they could receive theſe <hi>Books</hi> as being their <hi>Former</hi> Laws. And they could not otherwiſe receive them, becauſe they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003675_0013_100244A685401208"/>vouch'd themſelves ſo to be. Let me ask the <hi>Deiſts</hi> but this One ſhort Queſtion: Was there ever a <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Sham Laws,</hi> which were not the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Nation, Pam'd</hi> upon any <hi>People,</hi> ſince the World began? If not, With what Face can they ſay this of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Why will they ſay that of them, which they confeſs impoſſible in any <hi>Nation,</hi> or among any <hi>People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they muſt be yet more unreaſonable: For the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> have a further De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of their Truth, than even other <hi>Law-Books</hi> have: For they not only contain the <hi>Laws,</hi> but give an <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Account of their <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of them from that Time: As of the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Firſt-Born</hi> in <hi>Aegypt:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numbers viii. 17, 18.</note> And that the ſame Day all the <hi>Firſt-Born</hi> of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> both of <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beaſt,</hi> were by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Law,</hi> dedicated to <hi>God;</hi> and the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> taken <hi>for all the Firſt-Born of the Children of</hi> Iſrael.

The Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> in Memory of the dreadful <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of <hi>God</hi> upon Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe <hi>Remembrances</hi> of <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Actions</hi> and <hi>Occurrences,</hi> there were other ſolemn <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> in Memory of their Deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the <hi>General,</hi> which included all the <hi>Particnlars.</hi> As of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> Deut. v. 15.

            <p>And, not only ſo, but the <hi>Books</hi> of the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi> tell us, that a particular <hi>Tribe</hi> (of <hi>Levi</hi>) was <hi>Appointed</hi> and <hi>Conſecrated</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> as his <hi>Prieſts;</hi> by whoſe Hands, and none other, the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> were to be offered, and theſe ſolemn <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> to be celebrated.

Or, <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> To have received a <hi>Book</hi> for Truth, which ſaid they had <hi>practiſed</hi> them, and appealed to that <hi>Practice?</hi> So that here are the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth</hi> of the <hi>Marks</hi> above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>But now let us deſcend to the utmoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Suppoſition. viz.</hi> That theſe Things were <hi>Practiſed,</hi> before theſe <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> were <hi>Forged;</hi> and that theſe <hi>Books</hi> did only <hi>impoſe</hi> upon the <hi>Nation,</hi> in making them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, That they had kept theſe <hi>Obſervances</hi> in Memory of ſuch and ſuch Things, as were inſerted in thoſe <hi>Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well then, let us proceed upon this <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> (however groundleſs) and now, will not the ſame <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi> occur, as in the <hi>former</hi> Caſe? For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> This muſt ſuppoſe that the <hi>Jews</hi> kept all theſe <hi>Obſervances</hi> in <hi>Memory</hi> of <hi>Nothing,</hi> or without knowing any Thing of their <hi>Original,</hi> or the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why they kept them: Whereas theſe very <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances</hi> did expreſs the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of their being <hi>kept,</hi> as the <hi>Paſſover,</hi> in <hi>Memory</hi> of God's <hi>Paſſing over</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> in that Night wherein he ſlew all the <hi>Firſt-born</hi> of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and ſo of the reſt.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let us <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi> contrary both to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> That the <hi>Jews</hi> did not know any <hi>Reaſon</hi> at all why
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003675_0017_100244A998F78E48"/>they <hi>kept</hi> theſe <hi>Obſervances;</hi> yet was it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to put it upon them, That they had <hi>kept</hi> theſe <hi>Obſervances</hi> in <hi>Memory</hi> of what they had never heard of before that Day, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you will ſuppoſe that theſe <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> were firſt <hi>Forged?</hi> For Example, Suppoſe I ſhould now forge ſome <hi>Romantick</hi> Story, of ſtrange Things done 1000 Years ago, and in Confirmation of this, ſhould endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, That they had all along, from that Day to this, <hi>kept</hi> the <hi>Firſt Day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> in <hi>Memory</hi> of ſuch an <hi>Hero,</hi> an <hi>Appollonius,</hi> a <hi>Barcosbas,</hi> or a <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and had all been <hi>Baptiz'd</hi> in his Name; and <hi>Swore</hi> by his Name, and upon that very <hi>Book,</hi> (which I had then <hi>forged,</hi> and which they never ſaw before,) in their publick <hi>Judicatures;</hi> that this <hi>Book</hi> was their <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>Law,</hi> which they had ever ſince that Time, theſe 1000 Years paſt, <hi>univerſally</hi> receiv'd and own'd, and none other. I would ask any <hi>Deiſt,</hi> whether he thinks it <hi>poſſible,</hi> that ſuch a <hi>Cheat</hi> could paſs, or ſuch a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend</hi> be receiv'd as the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that they could be made believe, that they never had had any other <hi>Goſpel?</hi> The ſame Reaſon is, as to the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and muſt be, as to every <hi>Matter of Fact,</hi> which has all the Four <hi>Marks</hi> before mentioned: And theſe <hi>Marks</hi> ſecure any ſuch <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> as much from being <hi>Invented</hi> and <hi>Impos'd</hi> in
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003675_0018_10024474EDC17488"/>any after <hi>Ages,</hi> as at the Time when ſuch <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> were ſaid to be done.</p>
            <p>Let me give one very ſamiliar Example more, in this Caſe. There is the <hi>Stonhenge</hi> on <hi>Salisbury Plain,</hi> every Body knows it; and yet none knows the Reaſon why thoſe great <hi>Stones</hi> were ſet there, or by whom, or in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of what.</p>
            <p>Now, ſuppoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, That this <hi>Book</hi> was well known in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>enjoyn'd</hi> by <hi>Act of Parliament</hi> to be taught our <hi>Children;</hi> and that we did teach it to our <hi>Children,</hi> and had been taught it our ſelves wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ther he thinks this could paſs upon <hi>England?</hi> And whether, if I, or any other ſhould inſiſt upon it, we ſhould not, inſtead of being believ'd, be ſent to <hi>Bedlam?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us compare this with the <hi>Stonbenge,</hi> as I may call it, or <hi>Twelve</hi> great <hi>Stones,</hi> ſet
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003675_0019_100244AC52F057C8"/>up at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> which is told in the Fourth <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Joſhua.</hi> There it is ſaid, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. That the Reaſon why they were ſet up, was, that when their <hi>Children,</hi> in after Ages, ſhould ask the Meaning of it, it ſhould be told them.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003675_0022_1002447A13824B10"/>muſt take to do it: But all on the ſudden, as ſoon as the <hi>Feet of the Prieſts that bare the Ark were dipped in the Brim of the Water,</hi> Then <hi>the Waters which came down from above, ſtood and roſe up upon an Heap, very far from the City</hi> Adam, <hi>that is beſide</hi> Zaretan: <hi>And thoſe that came down toward the Sea of the Plain, even the Salt Sea, fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were cut off: And the People paſſed over, right againſt</hi> Jericho. The <hi>Prieſts</hi> ſtood in the midſt of <hi>Jordan,</hi> 'til all the <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Iſrael had paſſed</hi> over. <hi>And it came to paſs, when the Prieſts that bare the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, were come up, out of the Midſt of</hi> Jordan, <hi>and the Soles of the Prieſts Feet were lift up upon the dry Land, that the Waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>returned into their Place, and flowed over all his Banks, as they did before. And the People came up out of</hi> Jordan, <hi>on the Tenth Day of the firſt Month, and encamped in</hi> Gilgal, <hi>on the Eaſt Border of</hi> Jericho. <hi>And thoſe Twelve Stones which they took out of</hi> Jordan, <hi>did</hi> Joſhua <hi>pitch in</hi> Gilgal. <hi>And he ſpake unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, When your Children ſhall ask their Fathers in Time to came, ſaying, what mean theſe Stones? Then ſhall ye let your Children know, ſaying,</hi> Iſrael <hi>came over this</hi> Jordan <hi>on dry Land. For the Lord your God dried up the Waters of</hi> Jordan <hi>from before you, until ye were paſſed over; as the Lord
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003675_0023_100244B1116ED460"/>your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up, from before us, until we were gone over. That all the People of the Earth might know the Hand of the Lord, that it is Mighty: That ye might fear the Lord your God for ever.</hi> Chap. iv. from ver. 18.</p>
            <p>If the Paſſage over the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> had been only taking Advantage of a <hi>Spring-Tide,</hi> or the like, How would this teach <hi>all the People of the Earth, that the Hand of the Lord was Mighty!</hi> How would a Thing no more remarkable, have been taken Notice of thro' all the World! How would it have taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>fear the Lord,</hi> when they muſt know, that notwithſtanding, of all theſe <hi>Big Words,</hi> there was ſo <hi>Little</hi> in it! How could they have <hi>believ'd,</hi> or <hi>received</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> as <hi>Truth,</hi> which they knew, told the Matter ſo far otherwiſe from what it was!</p>
            <p>But, as I ſaid, This Paſſage over <hi>Jordan,</hi> which is here compar'd to that of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> is free from all thoſe <hi>Cavils</hi> that are made, as to that of the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Atteſtation to it, being ſaid to be done in the ſame Manner as was that of the <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to form our Argument, Let Us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that there never was any ſuch Thing as that <hi>Paſſage</hi> over <hi>Jordan:</hi> That theſe Stones at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> were ſet up upon ſome other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in ſome after Age: And then, that
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003675_0024_1002447B9E5A8200"/>ſome deſigning Man invented this Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and ſaid, that it was wrote by <hi>Joſhua</hi> at that Time; and gave this <hi>Stonage,</hi> at <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> for a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. Would not every Body ſay to him, We know the <hi>Stonage,</hi> at <hi>Gilgal;</hi> but we never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this Reaſon for it? Nor of this Book of <hi>Joſhua?</hi> Where has it been all this while? And <hi>Where,</hi> and <hi>How</hi> came you, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages, to find it? Beſides, this Book tells Us, that this <hi>Paſſage</hi> over <hi>Jordan</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to be taught our <hi>Children,</hi> from Age to Age: And therefore, that they were always to be <hi>inſtructed</hi> in the Meaning of that <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> at <hi>Gilgal,</hi> as a <hi>Memorial</hi> of it. But we were never taught it when we were <hi>Children;</hi> nor did ever teach our <hi>Children</hi> any ſuch Thing. And it is not likely, That could have been forgotten, while ſo remarkable a <hi>Stonage</hi> did continue; which was ſet up for that, and no other End.</p>
            <p>And if, for the Reaſons before given, no ſuch <hi>Impoſition</hi> could be put upon us, as to the <hi>Stonage</hi> in <hi>Salisbury-Plain;</hi> How much leſs could it be as to the <hi>Stonage</hi> at <hi>Gilgal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if, where we know not the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of a bare naked <hi>Monument,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Sham-Reaſon</hi> cannot be impos'd; how much more is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to impoſe upon us, in <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Obſervances,</hi> which we <hi>celebrate</hi> in Memory of particular <hi>Paſſages?</hi> How impoſſible to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003675_0025_100244B29BA95450"/>make us <hi>forget</hi> thoſe <hi>Paſſages</hi> which we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Commemorate;</hi> and perſwade us, that we had always <hi>kept</hi> ſuch <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> in Memory of what we never heard of before; that is, that we knew it, before we knew it.</p>
            <p>And if we find it thus impoſſible for an <hi>Impoſition</hi> to be put upon us, even in ſome Things, which have not all the <hi>Four Marks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned; how much more impoſſible is it, that any <hi>Deceit</hi> ſhould be in that Thing, where all the <hi>Four Marks</hi> do meet?</p>
            <p>This hath been ſhew'd in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place, as to the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Therefore I come now <hi>(Secondly)</hi> to ſhew, that, as in the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> ſo likewiſe, all theſe Four <hi>Marks</hi> do meet in the <hi>Matters of Fact,</hi> which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of our B. <hi>Saviour.</hi> And my Work herein will be the ſhorter, becauſe all that is ſaid before, of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Books, is every Way as applicable to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Goſpel.</hi> His <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> are there ſaid to be done <hi>publickly,</hi> in the Face of the World, as he argued to his Accuſers, <hi>I ſpake openly to the World, and in Secret have I ſaid nothing,</hi> John xviii. 20. It is told, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. that Three Thouſand at one Time; and <hi>Acts</hi> iv. 4. that Five Thouſand at another Time, were converted, upon Conviction of what themſelves had ſeen, what had been done publickly before their Eyes, wherein it
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003675_0026_1002447D723A94E0"/>was impoſſible to have impoſed upon them: Therefore here were the Two firſt of the <hi>Rules</hi> before mentioned.</p>
            <p>Then for the Two Second: <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>the Lord's Supper</hi> were inſtituted as perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Memorials of theſe Things; and they were not inſtituted in after-Ages, but at the very Time when theſe Things were ſaid to be done; and have been obſerved without Interruption, in all Ages thro' the whole Chriſtian World, down all the Way from that Time to this.

            </p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Heathen Deities</hi> had their <hi>Prieſts: Games,</hi> and other <hi>publick Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in Memory of them.

            <p>And the Truth of the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Exodus</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> being no otherwiſe preſs'd upon Men, than as they have practis'd ſuch <hi>publick Inſtitutions;</hi> it is appealing to the <hi>Senſes</hi> of Mankind for the <hi>Truth</hi> of them; and makes it impoſſible for any to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſuch Stories in after-Ages, without a palpable Detection of the Cheat, when firſt invented; as impoſſible as to have impos'd upon the <hi>Senſes</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> at the Time when ſuch <hi>publick Matters of Fact</hi> were ſaid to be done.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I do not ſay, that every Thing which wants theſe Four <hi>Marks</hi> is <hi>falſe;</hi> but that nothing can be <hi>Falſe</hi> which has them <hi>All.</hi>

            <p>I have no Manner of Doubt, that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that he fought at <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> was killed in the <hi>Senate Houſe;</hi> and many other Matters of Fact of ancient Times, tho' we keep no publick Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances in Memory of them.</p>

But this ſhews that the Matters of Fact of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> have come down to us better guarded than any other Matters of Fact, how true ſoever.</p>
            <p>And yet our <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who would laugh any Man out of the World, as an irrational Brute, who ſhould offer to deny <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil,</hi> their publick Works and Actions, do, at the ſame Time, value themſelves as the only Men of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Senſe,</hi> of <hi>Free, Generous,</hi> and <hi>Unbyaſs'd Judgments,</hi> for ridiculing the Hiſtories of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that are infinitely better atteſted, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with infallible Marks, which the others want.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Beſides that, the Importance of the Subject would oblige all Men to inquire more narrowly into the one than the other: For, what Conſequence is it to me, or to the World, whether there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> whether he beat or was beaten at <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia;</hi> whether <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi> wrote ſuch Books; and whether what is related in the <hi>Iliads</hi> or <hi>Aeneids</hi> be <hi>True,</hi> or <hi>Falſe?</hi> It is not Two Pence up or down to any Man in the World: And therefore it is worth no Man's while to enquire into it, either to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> or <hi>juſtify</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of theſe Relations.</p>
            <p>But our very <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Bodies,</hi> both this <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> are concern'd in the <hi>Truth</hi>

            <p n="7">VII. There are ſeveral other <hi>Topicks,</hi> from whence the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion is evinced to all who will judge by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and give themſelves leave to <hi>Conſider.</hi> As the <hi>Improbablity</hi> that Ten or Twelve <hi>poor illiterate Fiſhermen</hi> ſhould form a Deſign of converting the whole World to believe their <hi>Deluſions;</hi> and the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it, without Force of <hi>Arms, Learning, Oratory,</hi> or any one viſible Thing that could recommend them! And to impoſe a <hi>Doctrine</hi> quite oppoſite to the <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of Men, and all <hi>worldly Advantages,</hi> or <hi>Enjoyments!</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:003675_0033_100244BC156D1B80"/>And this in an Age of ſo great <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Sagacity</hi> as that wherein the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was firſt preached! That theſe <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſhould not only undergo all the <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> but the ſevereſt <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> and moſt cruel <hi>Deaths</hi> that could be inflicted, in Atteſtation to what themſelves knew to be a meer <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Forgery</hi> of their own Contrving!

            <p>Neither can it be ſaid, that they, perhaps, might have propoſed ſome temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to themſelves, but miſs'd of them, and met with <hi>Sufferings</hi> inſtead of them: For if it had been ſo, it is more than probable, that when they ſaw their Diſappointment, they would have diſcover'd their <hi>Conſpiracy;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they might not have only ſav'd their <hi>Lives,</hi> but got great <hi>Rewards</hi> for doing of it.

            <p>But this is not all: For they tell us, that their Maſter bid them expect nothing but <hi>Sufferings</hi> in this World. This is the Tenure of all that <hi>Goſpel</hi> which they taught. And
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003675_0034_1002448698B7D5C8"/>they told the ſame to all whom they <hi>Converted.</hi> So that here was no Diſappointment.</p>
            <p>For all that were <hi>Converted</hi> by them, were <hi>Converted</hi> upon the certain Expectation of <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and bidden <hi>prepare</hi> for it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to take up their <hi>Croſs</hi> daily, and follow him; and told them, that in the World they ſhould have <hi>Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> That whoever did not forſake <hi>Father, Mother, Wife, Children, Lands,</hi> and their very <hi>Lives,</hi> could not be his <hi>Diſciples:</hi> That he who <hi>ſought to ſave his Life</hi> in this World, ſhould <hi>loſe</hi> it in the next.</p>
            <p>Now that this deſpiſed <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> ſhould prevail ſo <hi>Univerſally</hi> againſt the <hi>Allurements</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> and all the <hi>Blandiſhments</hi> of this World; againſt the <hi>Rage,</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi> of all the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Powers</hi> of the Earth, muſt ſhew its <hi>Original</hi> to be <hi>Divine,</hi> and its <hi>Protector Almighty.</hi> What is it elſe could <hi>Conquer</hi> without Arms, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade without <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> overcome <hi>Enemies,</hi> diſarm <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and ſubdue <hi>Empires,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Oppoſition!</hi>

            <p>Men may diſpute an <hi>Impoſition</hi> or <hi>Deluſion</hi> upon our outward <hi>Senſes:</hi> But how that can

            </p>
            <p>This is particularly <hi>inſiſted</hi> on, in the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod with the Jews.</hi> And even the <hi>Deiſts</hi> muſt confeſs, that the Book we call the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> was in being, in the Hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> long before our <hi>Saviour</hi> came into the World.

            <p>Old <hi>Propheſies,</hi> (and all ſo agreeing) could not have been contriv'd to countenance a new <hi>Cheat;</hi> and nothing could be a <hi>Cheat,</hi> that could fulfil all theſe.</p>
            <p>For this therefore, I refer the <hi>Deiſts</hi> to the <hi>Method with the Jews.</hi>

But, I ſay, the foregoing <hi>Propheſies</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> are ſo ſtrong a <hi>Proof,</hi> as even <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> would not be ſufficient to break their Authority.</p>

            <p>It is this that keeps the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Obſtinacy: Though they cannot deny the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> done by our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> to be truly <hi>Miracles,</hi> if ſo done as ſaid: Nor can they deny that they were ſo done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have all the <hi>Four Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> before mentioned. Yet they cannot yield! Why?

We do <hi>Believe</hi> and <hi>Pray</hi> for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For this End they have been ſo miraculouſly preſerv'd, according to the <hi>Propheſies</hi> ſo long before of it. And when that Time ſhall come, as they are the moſt <hi>Honourable</hi> and <hi>Ancient</hi> of all the Nations on the Earth, ſo will their <hi>Church</hi> return to be the Mother <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church, as ſhe was at firſt; and <hi>Rome</hi> muſt ſurrender to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Then all Nations will flow thither: And even <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple may be <hi>Literally</hi> Built <hi>There,</hi> in the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the whole Earth; which <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be, when the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhall meet with the <hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Jews:</hi> For no <hi>Nation</hi> will then contend with the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor <hi>Church</hi> with <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for <hi>Supremacy.</hi> All <hi>Nations</hi> will be ambitious to draw their <hi>Original</hi> from the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe are the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and from whom, as concerning the Fleſh, <hi>Chriſt</hi> came.</p>
            <p>Then will be fulfill'd that outward <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi> and <hi>Reſtauration</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which they expect, purſuant to the <hi>Propheſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They pretend not that this is limited to any particular <hi>Time</hi> of the <hi>Reign</hi> of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah.</hi> They are ſure it will not be at the Beginning; for they expect to go through great <hi>Conflicts</hi> and <hi>Tryals</hi> with their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (as the Chriſtian Church has done) before

So that this is no Obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their <hi>Embracing of Chriſtianity.</hi> They ſee the ſame Things fulfilled in us, which they expect themſelves; and we expect the ſame Things they do.</p>
            <p>I tell this to the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> leſt they may think that the <hi>Jews</hi> have ſome ſtronger Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments than they know of, That they are not perſwaded by the <hi>Miracles</hi> of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> and by the fulfilling of all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies</hi> in him, that were made concerning the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, I would not plead even <hi>Miracles</hi> againſt theſe.</p>
            <p>And if this is ſufficient to perſwade a <hi>Jew,</hi> it is much more ſo to a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> who labours not under theſe <hi>Objections.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="10">X. Here it may be proper to conſider a common <hi>Topick</hi> of the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who, when they are not able to ſtand out againſt the Evidence of <hi>Fact,</hi> that ſuch and ſuch <hi>Miracles</hi> have been done; then turn about, and <hi>deny</hi> ſuch Things to be <hi>Miracles;</hi> at leaſt, That we can never be <hi>Sure,</hi> whether any <hi>wonderful</hi> Thing that is ſhewn to us, be a <hi>True</hi> or a <hi>Falſe Miracle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the great Argument they go upon is this, That a <hi>Miracle</hi> being that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the <hi>Power of Nature,</hi> We cannot know what <hi>exceeds</hi> it, unleſs we knew the utmoſt <hi>Extent</hi> of the <hi>Power of Nature;</hi> and no
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003675_0042_1002448FC7367F20"/>Man pretends to know that; therefore, that no Man can <hi>certainly</hi> know whether any <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> be <hi>miraculous.</hi> And conſequently, he may be <hi>cheated</hi> in his Judgment betwixt <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Falſe Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That Men may be ſo <hi>Cheated.</hi> And there are many Examples of it.</p>
            <p>But that tho' we may not always <hi>Know</hi> when we are <hi>Cheated,</hi> yet we can <hi>certainly</hi> tell, in many Caſes, when we are <hi>not cheated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho' we do not know the utmoſt <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> of the <hi>Power of Nature,</hi> perhaps, in any <hi>One</hi> Thing; yet it does not follow, that we know not the <hi>Nature</hi> of any Thing, in ſome Meaſure; and that <hi>certainly</hi> too. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, tho' I do not know the utmoſt <hi>Extent</hi> of the <hi>Power of Fire,</hi> yet I <hi>certainly</hi> know, That it is the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> to <hi>burn;</hi> and, that when proper <hi>Fewel</hi> is adminiſtred to it, it is contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> not to <hi>conſume</hi> it. Therefore, if I ſee <hi>Three</hi> Men taken off the Street, in their common wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Apparel, and without any <hi>Preparation,</hi> caſt into the Midſt of a <hi>Burning Fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace;</hi> and that the <hi>Flame</hi> was ſo <hi>fierce,</hi> that it <hi>burnt</hi> up thoſe Men that drew them in; and yet that theſe who were thrown in, ſhould walk up and down in the <hi>Bottom</hi> of the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> and I ſhould ſee a <hi>Fourth</hi> Perſon with them of <hi>Glorious</hi> Appearance, like the Son of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003675_0043_100244C7CA86EA70"/>
               <hi>God.</hi> And that theſe Men ſhould come up again out of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> without any Harm, or ſo much as the <hi>Smell</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their <hi>Cloaths,</hi> I could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in thinking that there was a Stop put to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> as to theſe Men; and that it had its Effect upon the Men whom it <hi>Burned,</hi> at the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>Again, tho' I cannot tell how <hi>Wonderful</hi> and <hi>Sudden</hi> an <hi>Increaſe</hi> of <hi>Corn</hi> might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the Concurrence of many <hi>Cauſes,</hi> as a <hi>Warm Climate,</hi> the <hi>Fertility</hi> of the <hi>Soil,</hi> &amp;c. Yet this I can <hi>certainly</hi> know, That there is not that <hi>Natural</hi> Force in the <hi>Breath</hi> of two or three <hi>Words</hi> ſpoken, to <hi>multiply</hi> one ſmall <hi>Loaf</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> ſo <hi>faſt,</hi> in the <hi>Breaking</hi> of it, as <hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>Really,</hi> not only in <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> and <hi>Shew</hi> to the <hi>Eye,</hi> but to fill the <hi>Bellies</hi> of ſeveral Thouſand hungry <hi>Perſons;</hi> and that the <hi>Fragments</hi> ſhould be much more than the <hi>Bread</hi> was at firſt.</p>
            <p>So neither in a <hi>Word</hi> ſpoken, to raiſe the <hi>Dead,</hi> cure <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore, tho' we know not the utmoſt <hi>Extent</hi> of the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> yet we can certainly know what is <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of ſeveral ſuch Things as we do know.</p>
            <p>And therefore, tho' we may be <hi>Cheated</hi> and impos'd upon in many <hi>Seeming Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Wonders;</hi> yet there are ſome Things, wherein we may be <hi>Certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:003675_0044_10024493E31F0720"/>
But further, the <hi>Deiſts</hi> acknowledge a <hi>God,</hi> of an <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> who made all Things.</p>
            <p>Yet they would put it out of his <hi>Power,</hi> to make any Revelation of his Will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: For if we cannot be <hi>certain</hi> of any <hi>Miracle,</hi> how ſhould we know when <hi>God</hi> ſent any Thing <hi>Extraordinary</hi> to us?</p>
            <p>Nay, how ſhould we know the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Power of <hi>Nature,</hi> if we knew not what <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded</hi> it? If we know not what is <hi>Natural,</hi> how do we know there is ſuch a Thing as <hi>Nature?</hi> That all is not <hi>Supernatural,</hi> all <hi>Miracles,</hi> and ſo <hi>diſputable,</hi> till we come to downright <hi>Scepticiſm,</hi> and doubt the <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of our <hi>outward Senſes,</hi> whether we <hi>See, Hear,</hi> or <hi>Feel;</hi> or all be not a <hi>miraculous</hi> Illuſion!</p>
            <p>Which, becauſe I know the <hi>Deiſts</hi> are not inclin'd to do, therefore I will return to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue my Argument upon the <hi>Conviction</hi> of our <hi>outward Senſes;</hi> deſiring only this, That they would allow the <hi>Senſes</hi> of other Men to be as <hi>certain</hi> as their own. Which they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, ſince without this, they can have no <hi>Certainty</hi> of their own.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Therefore, from what has been ſaid, the Cauſe is ſumm'd up ſhortly in this, That tho' we cannot <hi>See</hi> what was done before our Time, yet by the <hi>Marks</hi> which I have laid down concerning the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Matters of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003675_0045_100244CAFB0B3048"/>Fact,</hi> done before our Time, we may be as much aſſur'd of the <hi>Truth</hi> of them, as if we ſaw them with our Eyes; becauſe, whatever <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> has all the Four <hi>Marks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, could never have been <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> and <hi>received,</hi> but upon the Conviction of the <hi>outward Senſes</hi> of all thoſe who did <hi>receive</hi> it, as before is demonſtrated. And therefore this Topick which I have choſen, does ſtand upon the <hi>Conviction</hi> even of Mens <hi>outward Senſes.</hi> And ſince you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd me to <hi>One</hi> Topick, I have not inſiſted upon the other, which I have only named.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. And now it lies upon the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> if they would appear as Men of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to ſhew ſome <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> of former Ages, which they allow to be <hi>True,</hi> that has greater <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of its <hi>Truth,</hi> than the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> otherwiſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, with any Shew of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> reject the one, and yet admit of the other.</p>
            <p>But I have given them greater Latitude than this; for I have ſhewn ſuch <hi>Marks</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as no other <hi>Matters of Fact</hi> of thoſe Times, however <hi>True,</hi> have, but theſe only: And I put it upon them, to ſhew any <hi>Forgery</hi> that has <hi>All</hi> theſe <hi>Marks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a ſhort <hi>Iſſue:</hi> Keep them cloſe to this. This determines the <hi>Cauſe</hi> all at once.</p>

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003675_0048_100244FED2AAF610"/>Powers:</hi> For tho' their <hi>Legerdemain</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to deceive ſome unwary Beholders; and their Power of working ſome <hi>ſeeming</hi> Miracles has been great, yet it never reach'd, nor ever was ſuppoſed to reach ſo far, as to deceive the Senſes of all Mankind, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Notorious</hi> Nature as thoſe of which we now ſpeak, to make them believe, that they had enacted <hi>Laws</hi> for ſuch <hi>Publick Obſervances,</hi> continually prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd them, taught them to their <hi>Children,</hi> and had been inſtructed in them themſelves, from their <hi>Childhood,</hi> if they had never <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, Practis'd, Taught,</hi> or been <hi>Taught</hi> ſuch Things.</p>

               <p>And the Glory of his Wiſdom and Power ſeems greater to us, in the <hi>Acts</hi> of His <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> than even in thoſe of <hi>Creation;</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in His <hi>Governing</hi> the <hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Free-Agents,</hi> without taking from them the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of their <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>do</hi> as they <hi>liſt,</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their very <hi>Evil</hi> into <hi>Good,</hi> by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſs</hi> of His Wiſdom.

               <p>Again, that may be a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in one Nature, which is not ſo in another: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it is a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> that a Man can go two <hi>Yards</hi> or <hi>Miles,</hi> as ſoon as <hi>One,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Two</hi> is but <hi>One</hi> and another <hi>One:</hi> Yet this is no <hi>Contradiction</hi> to <hi>Sight,</hi> which can reach a <hi>Star,</hi> as ſoon as the Top of a <hi>Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> darts his <hi>Rays</hi> in one <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth:</hi> But more than all theſe is the Motion of <hi>Thought,</hi> to which no <hi>Diſtance</hi> of <hi>Place</hi> is any Interruption; which can arrive at <hi>Japan</hi> as ſoon as at a <hi>Yard</hi>'s Diſtance; and can run into the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity</hi> of <hi>Poſſibilities.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now, let us conſider further, that tho' there is no Compariſon between <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Infinite,</hi> yet we have nearer <hi>Reſemblances</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>One</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> than there is of <hi>Sight</hi> to a Man born <hi>blind:</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in any of the other four <hi>Senſes</hi> that has any <hi>Reſemblance</hi> at all to that of <hi>Seeing,</hi> or that can give ſuch a Man any Notion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of it.</p>
               <p>But we find in our own <hi>Nature,</hi> which is ſaid to be made after the <hi>Image of God,</hi> a very near <hi>Reſemblance</hi> of <hi>His Holy Trinity,</hi> and of the different <hi>Operations</hi> of each of the <hi>Divine Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Example; to <hi>know</hi> a Thing <hi>preſent,</hi> and to <hi>remember</hi> what is <hi>paſt,</hi> and to <hi>love</hi> or
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003675_0068_1002451510DDE2E8"/>
                  <hi>hate,</hi> are different <hi>Operations</hi> of our <hi>Mind,</hi> and perform'd by different <hi>Faculties</hi> of it. Of theſe, the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> is the <hi>Father</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and gives <hi>Being</hi> to Things, as to Us; for what we know not, is to Us as if it were not: This anſwers to <hi>Creation.</hi> From this <hi>Faculty</hi> proceeds the <hi>Second,</hi> that of <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which is a <hi>Preſerving</hi> of what the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> has <hi>Created</hi> to Us. Then the <hi>Third Faculty,</hi> that of the <hi>Will,</hi> which <hi>loves</hi> or <hi>hates,</hi> proceeds from <hi>Both</hi> the <hi>Other;</hi> for we cannot <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hate</hi> what is not firſt <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi> by the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>Preſerv'd</hi> to Us by the <hi>Memory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' theſe are different <hi>Faculties,</hi> and their <hi>Operations</hi> different, that the <hi>Second</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or is <hi>Begotten</hi> by it; and the <hi>Third</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> in Conjunction; ſo that one is before the other, in Order of <hi>Nature,</hi> yet not in <hi>Time;</hi> for they are all <hi>Congenial,</hi> and one is as ſoon in the <hi>Soul</hi> as the other; and yet they make not <hi>Three Souls,</hi> but <hi>One Soul.</hi> And tho' their <hi>Operations</hi> are <hi>Different,</hi> and the one proceeds from the other, yet no one can act without the other, and they all <hi>concur</hi> to every <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>each;</hi> for in <hi>Underſlanding</hi> and <hi>Remembring,</hi> there is a concurrent <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Will,</hi> to <hi>conſent</hi> to ſuch <hi>Underſlanding</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring;</hi> ſo that no one can <hi>Act</hi> without the other; in which Senſe, none is <hi>Before</hi> or

                  <hi>After</hi> the other; nor can any of them <hi>Be,</hi> or <hi>Exiſt,</hi> without the other.</p>
               <p>But what we call <hi>Faculties</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi> we call <hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>Godhead;</hi> becauſe there are <hi>Perſonal</hi> Actions attributed to <hi>Each</hi> of them; as that of <hi>Sending,</hi> and being <hi>Sent,</hi> to take <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and be <hi>Born,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And we have no other <hi>Word,</hi> whereby to Expreſs it; we ſpeak it after the Manner of Men; nor could we underſtand, if we heard any of thoſe <hi>Unſpeakable Words,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in its proper <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> therefore we muſt make <hi>Allowances,</hi> and <hi>Great</hi> ones, when we apply <hi>Words</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> to the <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal Being.</hi> We muſt not argue <hi>Strictly</hi> and <hi>Philoſphical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from them, more than from <hi>God</hi>'s being ſaid to <hi>Repent,</hi> to be <hi>Angry,</hi> &amp;c. They are Words <hi>ad Captum,</hi> in Condeſcenſion to our weak <hi>Capacities,</hi> and without which we could not underſtand.</p>
               <p>But this I ſay, That there are nearer <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances</hi> afforded to us of this ineffable <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> than there is betwixt one of our outward <hi>Senſes</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; than the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if we had not the <hi>Experience</hi> of the different <hi>Faculties</hi> of our <hi>Mind,</hi> the <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> would appear <hi>irreconcileable</hi> to all our <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> how <hi>Three</hi> could be <hi>One,</hi> each <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the other, yet but one <hi>Soul;</hi> One proceeding from, or being <hi>Begot</hi> by the other; and yet all <hi>coeval,</hi> and none <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the other: And as to the Difference betwixt <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Perſons, Subſlance</hi> and <hi>Subſiſtence,</hi> it is a puzling Piece of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> And tho' we give not a diſtinct <hi>Subſiſtence</hi> to a <hi>Faculty,</hi> it has an <hi>Exiſtence;</hi> and one <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> can no more be another, than one <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> can be another: So that the Caſe ſeems to be alike in both, as to what concerns our preſent Difficulty of <hi>Three</hi> and <hi>One;</hi> beſides what before is ſaid, That by the Word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> when apply'd to <hi>God,</hi> for Want of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Word whereby to expreſs it, we muſt mean ſomething infinitely different from <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonality</hi> among <hi>Men.</hi> And therefore from a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the one, (ſuppoſe it granted) we cannot charge a <hi>Contradiction</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs we <hi>Underſtand</hi> it as well as the other; for how elſe can we draw the <hi>Parallel?</hi>

               <p>Here is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> That when <hi>Man</hi> had <hi>Sinned,</hi> and was utterly unable to make any <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for his <hi>Sin, God</hi> ſent his own <hi>Son</hi> to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and in the ſame <hi>Nature</hi> that <hi>Offended,</hi> to make full <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of the whole World by his perfect <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Himſelf</hi> upon the Croſs.</p>
               <p>Some ſay, What need any <hi>Satisfaction?</hi> Might not <hi>God</hi> forgive without it? It would ſhew greater <hi>Mercy.</hi> But theſe Men conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, that <hi>God</hi> is not only <hi>Juſt,</hi> but He is <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf; <hi>Juſtice</hi> in the <hi>Abſtract;</hi> He is <hi>Eſſential Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> by its <hi>Nature,</hi> muſt exact to the utmoſt <hi>Farthing,</hi> elſe it were not <hi>Juſtice:</hi> To <hi>Remit</hi> is <hi>Mercy,</hi> it is not <hi>Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice:</hi> And the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God</hi> muſt not <hi>Fight</hi> and <hi>Oppoſe</hi> each other; they muſt all ſtand <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Compleat.</hi> You may ſay then, How can <hi>God</hi> forgive at all? How can Infinite <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſtand together?</p>
               <p>This Queſtion could never have been an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, if <hi>God</hi> Himſelf had not ſhew'd it to Us in the wonderful <hi>OEcconomy</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption:</hi> For here is His Juſtice ſatisfy'd to the leaſt <hi>Jota,</hi> by the perfect <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is <hi>God,</hi> in the ſame
