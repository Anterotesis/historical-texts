            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Penman of this Goſpel was <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> one of the Twelve Apoſtles: he was a Perſon ſo highly favoured by CHRIST, that he is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture call'd, <hi>The Diſciple whom JESUS Loved.</hi> We are told that he lived the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all the Twelve Apoſtles.

Very fitly is the Eagle made his Emblem: So high did he ſoar in his Diſcourſes upon the Divinity of our Saviour, ſo ſteadily did He behold <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs</hi> in His Brightneſs and Glory. He relates ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſages which the other Evangeliſts had omitted, one of which, and that a very ſignal one, we have in this Chapter; wherein we have the Hiſtory of that Illuſtrious Miracle <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>'s Circumſtances, will appear to be very Wonderful and Inſtructive; very Entertaining, and full of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. In the Hiſtory we may Obſerve. (1.) <hi>Lazarus was Sick.</hi> He was one whom JESUS Loved, and yet was Sick. Good Men that are dear to CHRIST, his Friends and Favourites, have been in all Ages Afflicted with the Infirmities and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, which Humane Nature is ſubject to in this Frail Mortal State. So that Love or Hatred can't be known by ſuch Afflictive Diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. (2.) His Siſters <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> ſend to their LORD <hi>to acquaint Him with their Brothers illneſs.</hi> Obſerve here their Care and Concern for their Sick Brother. They ſend to the great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician both of Soul and Body, in his behalf. Let us be very ready to do all the good and kind Offices we can for our Sick Friends and Relations. We ſhould be ready to ſend for the Phyſician: And above all, we ſhould ſend up our fervent Petitions to CHRIST upon the account of our Sick Friends, and Pray to Him, without whom all Phyſicians are of no value, to ſend forth His Word and heal them. What is a Brother, or a Siſter, if not born for ſuch a day of Adverſity? (3.) We have an account of <hi>the Journey CHRIST
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001853_0004_0FB91C9556A5A350"/>made</hi> to viſit the Relations of His diſeaſed Friend <hi>Lazarus;</hi> and of the notice He gave to His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his <hi>Death,</hi> which He at firſt call'd a <hi>Sleep.</hi> The Death of GOD's People is like Sleep after painful Labour. When they lay down their Heads in the Grave, they reſt as in Beds, till the Reſurrection, and will then awake wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed. (4.) We may take Notice of <hi>Martha</hi>'s <hi>going to, and meeting with JESUS;</hi> and of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they had together. <hi>Martha</hi> Expoſtulates with our Saviour concerning His <hi>Delay,</hi> in ſomething a complaiming manner, and yet profeſſeth her Faith in CHRIST's <hi>Power,</hi> and her belief of the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> Our Saviour in anſwer to her Confeſſion of Faith reſpecting the Reſurrection; doth declare that <hi>He is the Reſurrection and the Life.</hi> (5.) We may take Notice of the tender <hi>Sympathy CHRIST had</hi> with his Mourning and Diſtreſſed Friends. It's ſaid, <hi>JESUS Wept.</hi> CHRIST did truly partake of Humane Nature, and was made like unto us, Sin excepted. In the Afflictions of His People He was Afflicted. Their Sorrows and Sufferings made a painful Impreſſion on His Spirit. Here we ſee that He was touch'd with a feeling of the Infirmities and Sorrows of thoſe Mourners. Let us take care that the ſame mind may be in us, which was alſo in CHRIST JESUS. And in particular, when we go to the Houſes of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Let us do it with a becoming Solemnity; let us Mourn with them that Mourn, and labour to have a ſuitable Compaſſion for our Friends. (6.) We may take Notice of the Wonderful <hi>Miracle</hi> our Saviour wrought in raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the Dead. By this Miracle upon a Body that had been Dead Four days, our Saviour gave an undeniable Teſtimony to the Truth which is laid
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001853_0005_0FB91C96D6A6DFB8"/>down in our Text, now to be conſidered. JESUS ſaith unto her, <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the Life.</hi>

CHRIST will in a literal ſence open their Graves, and bring them out of their Graves, and they ſhall live. This the Scripture aſſures us, Joh. 5.28, 29. <hi>Marvel not at this: For the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the Graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good, unto the Reſurrection of Life; and they that have done evil unto the Reſurrection of Damnation.</hi> This Great and Wonderful Work of Raiſing the Dead, belongs to CHRIST's Kingly Office. He is the LORD both of the Dead and Living. He hath the Keys of Death. And at the Laſt Day He will open the Graves, and Command the Dead, both the Bodies of the Saints, and of the Wicked, to ariſe.

1. <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST hath Purchaſed a Glorious and Happy Reſurrection for His People.</hi> The Bodies of Men are by Sin expos'd to Ignominy and Diſgrace. The Apoſtacy did not only deſtroy the Divine Beauty of the <hi>Soul</hi> which conſiſted chiefly in its Conformity to GOD <hi>in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs;</hi> but alſo it defac'd the Beauty of the <hi>Body,</hi> and in a great meaſure mar'd it's Glory. The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men are become vile and ignoble, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively. Phil. 3.21. — <hi>Our vile Body</hi> — We may in this reſpect take up a Lamentation and ſay, <hi>The Crown is fallen from our heads; wo unto us that we have ſinned.</hi> The whole Head is Sick; and the whole Heart faint. <hi>From the ſole of the foot even unto the head there is no ſoundneſs.</hi> No Man enjoys perfect Health. And how often are the Bodies of Men the Seat and Subject of loathſome Diſeaſes; of Wounds and Bruiſes, and putrifying Sores; of great Weakneſs, and pining Sickneſs. And in a little time theſe Earthly Tabernacles muſt Moulder down, and be Diſſolved. In a little time the Beauty and Glory that remains upon our Bodies will be laid in the Duſt, and Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death will ſtain it. But the Son of GOD hath Purchas'd a Glorious Reſurrection for His People. The LORD JESUS CHRIST appear'd upon Earth in the likeneſs of Sinful Fleſh. <hi>And tho' He was in the form of GOD, and thought it not robbery to be equal with GOD;</hi> yet He <hi>took upon Him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</hi> Tho' He was the LORD of Life and Glory, yet He Voluntarily ſubmitted to a ſhameful ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Death. Now all this was, that the Saints might be Redeem'd from the power of the Grave: That the bands of Death might be looſed, and that they might be brought out of the Priſon of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001853_0008_0FB91C9E58768708"/>Grave. Zech. 9.11. <hi>By the Blood of thy Covenant I have ſent forth thy Priſoners out of the Pit.</hi> By Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, CHRIST deſtroy'd the power of Death. CHRIST Redeemed His People by Price; by His Active and Paſſive Obedience He Purchas'd this Glorious Reſurrection for them, with all the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Endowments and Perfective Qualities of their Reſurrection-Bodies. And in this reſpect CHRIST may be called the <hi>Meritorious</hi> cauſe of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST Roſe from the Dead, and ſo became the Exemplar and Pattern of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and the Firſt-Fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> The Son of GOD Roſe again from the Dead by His <hi>own Power,</hi> Joh. 10.18. <hi>I have power to lay it down</hi> [<hi>my Life</hi>]. <hi>and I have power to take it again.</hi> As He offer'd up Himſelf to GOD <hi>through the Eternal Spirit,</hi> i. e. His Eternal God-Head, His Divine Nature; ſo He aroſe again by the Almighty Power of the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. CHRIST raiſed up the Temple of His Body by that Power which He hath in common with the Father and the Holy Spirit. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. And then in the Reſurrection of His Body, the Son of GOD hath given us the <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Exemplar</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which the Reſurrection-Bodies of His People ſhall be Moulded and Faſhioned. For their vile Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhall be Changed and <hi>Faſhioned like to CHRIST's Glorious Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, CHRIST by His Reſurrection is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Firſt-Fruits of them that ſlept. 1 Cor. 15.20. <hi>But now is CHRIST riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept.</hi> As the Firſt-Fruits being offer'd to GOD, under the Law, ſanctified the whole, and were alſo an Earneſt of the full Harveſt:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001853_0009_0FB91CA2D7149D78"/>ſo in CHRIST's Reſurrection, the People of GOD have an <hi>Earneſt, Pledge,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to Glory and Immortality. Accordingly the Apoſtle argues in, 1 Cor. 15.12. <hi>Now if CHRIST be Preached that He roſe from the Dead, how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrection of the Dead?</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it as a very abſurd unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing to deny the Reſurrection of <hi>Believers,</hi> whenas there were ſuch undeniable Proofs and Teſtimonies of CHRIST's being raiſed from the Dead. When our Saviour aroſe again, He brought forth Judgment unto Victory, and gave His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an evident Demonſtration that He had conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Death in their behalf. For He roſe from the Dead as a Publick Perſon, the Head and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of all true Believers. They are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of CHRIST; and CHRIST Myſtical is not perfected till all the Saints are riſen. So that in CHRIST's Reſurrection Believers have an Aſſurance of their own Reſurrection. When the Son of GOD, the Strong the Mighty Redeemer awoke out of Sleep, He took away the Gates of the Grave, and carried away the Bars of the Pit. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture informs us, <hi>that the Graves were then open'd, and many Bodies of Saints which ſlept, aroſe. And came out of the Graves after his Reſurrection,</hi> Mat. 27.52, 53. This Miraculous Work was a Specimen of the General Reſurrection; and a plain proof and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Infinite Vertue of CHRIST's Death and Reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST will at the Laſt Day, raiſe the Dead Bodies of the Saints by His Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, as He is their Head and Redeemer.</hi> This will not be meerly an Act of His <hi>Common</hi> Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, as He is Head over all things: But
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001853_0010_0FB91CA516AE9848"/>alſo an Act of <hi>Grace and eſpecial Favour,</hi> as He is their LORD Redeemer, and their Head. Vital powerful influences will flow from CHRIST as the Head of His body, the Church, unto His Members to quicken and raiſe their Dead Bodies, and to make them Incorruptible, Immortal, Glorious. This the Scripture doth abundantly declare; 1 Cor. 15.22, 45. <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in CHRIST ſhall all be made alive. — The last Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> Phil. 3.20, 21. <hi>For our Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the LORD JESUS CHRIST: who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working, whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> CHRIST will adorn the Bodies of the Saints with the like Excellent and Glorious Qualities, with which His own Body is Beautified and Dignified: Not the ſame in <hi>Degree,</hi> but as to <hi>Kind:</hi> CHRIST's Body will mightily Excel in Glory. Another Signal Teſtimony to the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection we have in the Old Teſtament. Job. 19.23. to 27. incluſively. <hi>Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were Printed in a Book! That they were graven with an iron Pen and Lead, in the Rock for ever! For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter Day upon the Earth. And though after my ſkin, worms deſtroy this Body, yet in my Fleſh ſhall I ſee GOD: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and mine Eyes ſhall behold, and not another; though my Reins <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

He would have this great, important Truth Written in a Book, or Engraven upon ſome Monument that ſhould be durable like the Pillars of Heaven, that ſo it might be conſecrated to Eternity, and handed down to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001853_0011_0FB91CA6979CD878"/>lateſt Poſterity, in Characters which Time ſhould not be able to Efface. When Death, that great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer, whoſe Mouth is an open Sepulchre, hath done it's worſt, deſtroyed not only the outward Parts, the Skin and Fleſh; but alſo prey'd upon the more inward, vital Parts, the Reins; and brought Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſs into the Bones, and conſumed the Marrow: Yet after all, the Son of GOD, that numbers the Hairs of our Heads, and knows all the Atoms that fly in the Air; that ſeeth into the dark Receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Grave, and hath them open and naked to His All-ſeeing Eye: He will preſerve the ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Duſt of His People and out of this very Duſt, He will frame and faſhion their Bodies, with cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wonderful Art; with Infinite and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Skill. But it is not my preſent Purpoſe, to Eſſay a Deſcription of the Reſurrection-Body in it's Beauty and Glory, Strength and Agility, Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Incorruptibility; you may Read the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>Chap.</hi> at your Leiſure. Only we may take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the Reſurrection-Bodies of the Saints will not be meer <hi>Aethereal Vehicles,</hi> or of ſuch a fine Subſtance as ſhall eſcape the Sight, and become Inviſible; No, No; They will be proper <hi>Organical Bodies. Job</hi> ſays, <hi>that though worms deſtroy</hi> this <hi>Body, yet in</hi> My <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſhall I ſee GOD, — <hi>And Mine Eyes ſhall behold,</hi> and not another. Unleſs we acknowlege this, we in effect deſtroy One Eſſential, Conſtituent Part of Man.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is LIFE.</hi> Now this Expreſſion as we hinted before, may be look'd upon as of the ſame Import and Signification with the former, and as Exegetical of it. However, having conſidered the former Expreſſion in a ſtrict and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Senſe, as it reſpects the Reſurrection of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001853_0012_0FB91CA816BC57D0"/>Body; we may ſpeak ſomething, very briefly, unto this, without interfering with what hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>CHRIST as GOD, is Life Eſſentially.</hi> He is the Living GOD. All Degrees of Life are contained in Him by way of Eminency. He poſſeſſeth a Full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life and Being, Unchangibly and Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; without any poſſibility of Decay, or the leaſt approach toward a Diſſolution. He is the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living JEHOVAH, the Eternal I AM. His Life is in and of Himſelf. There are no Seeds or Principles of Corruption in His Nature; and nothing from without, that can in any Meaſure diſturb, much leſs deſtroy His Being. The Angels ſhall never Die; But then GOD gave them their Being at firſt, and they depend intirely upon Him for the Continuance of it: Did not He uphold them by putting His Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Arms underneath them, they would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſink and retire into their firſt State of Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being. But CHRIST is altogether, and abſolutely Independent upon any thing without Himſelf; both for Life and the Continuance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>CHRIST is Life Cauſally and Virtually.</hi> CHRIST as GOD, is the Univerſal Principle and Spring of Life. He is the Fountain, from whence all Kinds of Life flow, and are derived. <hi>In Him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> He made all Things, and upholdeth them all in Being. He is the firſt Cauſe of the Vegetative, Animal, and Rational Life. John 1, 3, 4. <hi>All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> The Son of GOD gave Life to every Living Creature; He form'd the Spirit of Man within him which is the Candle of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001853_0013_0FB91CAA99E0AA10"/>
3. <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST is He is GOD Man Mediator, the Saviour and Redeemer of His People, is their Life.</hi> And this ſeems to be principally intended in our Text. CHRIST is the Prince of Life. Joh. 14.6. <hi>JESUS ſaith unto him, I am the way, and the truth and the life: no Man cometh to the Father but by Me.</hi> Sin hath cut us off from GOD, as He is the Fountain of Spiritual Life. And it's in CHRIST alone that this Fountain is opened to ſuch Sinners as we are. CHRIST Died that His People might Live; and He ever lives to Communicate Life to them. He who is the true and faithful Witneſs teſtifies of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Rev. 1.18. <hi>I am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</hi> CHRIST is a Prieſt, <hi>Who is made not after the Law of a carnal Commandment, but after the power of an endleſs Life,</hi> Heb. 7.16. And He is able to Save them to the uttermoſt that come to GOD by Him, becauſe <hi>He ever lives to make Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) <hi>CHRIST createth the New Nature, and forms the Spiritual Life in His People.</hi> He makes thoſe who were Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, Alive to GOD, by forming the Divine Image in their Souls. He gives this Light of Life to His People, that ſat in the Region and Shadow of Death. Every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever hath a Spiritual Reſurrection thro' CHRIST. Joh. 5.25. <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the Dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of GOD: And they that hear ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>THROUGH CHRIST Believers who were Condemn'd to Die, receive the Justification of Life.</hi> Rom. 5.18. — The free Giſt came upon all Men unto Juſtification of Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001853_0014_0FB91CABD9C17D98"/>
(3) <hi>IT is through CHRIST that the Spiritual Life of GOD's People is maintained and increaſed, till it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in Glory,</hi> Gal. 2.20. I am Crucified with CHRIST: Nevertheleſs I live; yet not I, but CHRIST liveth in me: And the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me, and gave Himſelf for me. Believers receive thoſe vital Influences from CHRIST whereby the New Man is kept alive, fed and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd, till it be grown to the Stature of a perfect Man in CHRIST.</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>THE LORD JESUS CHRIST gives His People Everlasting Life.</hi> At the Great Day, Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life. Then CHRIST, who is the Life of His People, ſhall appear. Then will their Life be perfected for ever; and they ſhall enter upon the Heavenly Life, which ſhall never never have an end. John 10.28. <hi>And I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never Periſh</hi> —</p>

John 5.39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testifie of Me.</hi> It's a wonderful Mercy that ſuch Sinful, Mortal, Dying Creatures as we are, ſhould have the Diſcoveries of an Happy, and Glorious Reſurrection made to us through CHRIST.

It's our Intereſt to lay out our ſelves to the utmoſt in the Work and Service of CHRIST. We ſhould very gladly ſpend and be ſpent for CHRIST; Yea, be ready to Sacrifice our very Lives for His ſake, if His Glory calls for it for He will give all His Faithful Servants a much better Life than this we now enjoy. <hi>Be this faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

USE III. <hi>THIS Conſideration ſhould make the Children of GOD Patient, Submiſſive, and Chearful, under all the Pains, Weakneſs, and Sickneſs, they ſuffer in this Frail, Mortal State.</hi> The Children of GOD are ſubject to the ſame Infirmities and Bodily Pains as others are. They may many times ſay, that they have no Soundneſs in their Fleſh. Many times they may complain with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>That they are weak, and their Bones are vexed,</hi> Pſal. 6.2. O Believer, haſt thou frequent Returns of Pain and Illneſs? Well, ſee that you quietly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently Reſign up your ſelf to the Soveraign Will of GOD. Do not Faint, or Fret, when thou art thus Rebuked of the LORD. Thy Redeemer is by theſe Afflictive Diſpenſations of Providence, preparing thee for an Happy Reſurrection. And when they <hi>Corruptible</hi> ſhall have put on <hi>Incorruption,</hi> thou ſhalt never more complain of Sickneſs; but thy Health and Strength ſhall be perfected for ever. Rev. 21.4. <hi>And GOD ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there ſhall be no more Death, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sorrow nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more Pain, for the former things are paſſed away.</hi>

But the Children of God ſhould labour to overcome this Reluctancy by Faith in CHRIST, and a firm Belief of the Reſurrection. And Certainly, ſeeing their Redeemer is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the Life, they have no need to <hi>fear any Evil</hi> with Amazement; <hi>though they ſhould walk though the valley of the ſhadow of Death.</hi> Do
