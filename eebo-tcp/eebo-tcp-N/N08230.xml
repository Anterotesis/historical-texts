            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS ON THE NATURE OF WAR, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE two general views in which the ſubject of this day's thankſgiving can only be conſidered, are</p>
            <p>Firſt, As an event that, in its cauſe and conſequences, is connected only with the preſent life; and being viſibly produced by the efforts of human wiſdom and human ſtrength, is the ground of human exultation and triumph. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, As the ſole and immediate work of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH"— a part of the adminiſtration of that Merciful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which, through all the revolutions of diſordered nature and diſordered life, purſues but one invariable purpoſe, the Redemption and Salvation of man.</p>
            <p>It would be needleſs to propoſe the ſubject, in the firſt view, to the conſideration of true Chriſtians; who know, with the ſame certainty as they know their own exiſtence, that human nature, left to itſelf, has no power but that of producing mere evil; and that every thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010505_0003_0F801882D4B48598"/>
it and without it that is either great or good, is the free gift of Grace, the unmerited bounty of Redeeming Love. But the true Chriſtian Spirit being almoſt departed from the earth, true Chriſtian knowledge, as its inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is departed with it, and men ſeem to be gone back again to their old animal life: and tho', in ſpeculation and idea, they profeſs an aſſent to the truths of Revelation; yet, in heart and practice, they are to apt to conſider the courſe of all things as connected only with temporal good and evil, and themſelves as the center and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the firſt cauſe and the laſt end of all; aſcribing to human underſtanding deſigns which only Infinite Wiſdom can form, and to human power events which Omnipotence only can produce.</p>
            <p>Leſt, therefore, this leaven of darkneſs, pride, and vanity, ſhould have taken poſſeſſion and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the frame and habit of our ſpirits, it may not be improper to conſider the ſucceſs of War in the firſt general view, as the viſible effect of human power, in which even the profeſſed Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian is ſo apt to glory as his own work.</p>
            <p>If the Chriſtian, however, recollects himſelf, he will find War to be a ſad conſequence of the apoſtaſy and fall of man; when he was abandoned to the fury of his own luſts and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as the natural and penal effect of breaking looſe from the Divine Government, the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law of which is LOVE—<q>Thou ſhalt love the <hi>LORD</hi> thy <hi>GOD</hi> with all thy heart,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010505_0004_0F80188370ACA1E0"/>
with all thy ſoul, with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength; and thy <hi>FELLOW-CREATURE,</hi> as thyſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>St. James hath anſwered the queſtion with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the cauſe of War, in ſo preciſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate a manner, as to preclude all difficulty and doubt about it: <q>
                  <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you,</hi> ſays he? <hi>Come they not hence, even of</hi> your luſts <hi>that war in your members. Ye kill, and deſire to have, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain: ye fight and war; yet ye have not, becauſe ye aſk not,</hi>
               </q>—becauſe ye have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the will of "THE LORD THAT REIGN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETH;" but, forſaking the SUPREME GOOD, in whom alone your happineſs conſiſts, ye follow an earthly and deceitful good, and think only of procuring it by your own power. <q>
                  <hi>Ye aſk, and receive not; becauſe ye aſk amiſs</hi>
               </q> — from a pretended reſpect to "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," but ſolely for animal and ſenſual enjoyment, <hi>"that ye may</hi> conſume it <hi>upon your</hi> luſts."</p>
            <p>In this very explicit and true account, War, like all other evils, is deſcribed as centering in itſelf; and the end of it, is declared to be the gratification of thoſe very appetites and paſſions, from which it derives its birth. And thus it ever was, and ever will be — for in his unhappy circle, which is, indeed, the great circle of the hiſtory of man, the fatal miſchief proceeds: War is the offspring of the inſeparable union between the ſenſual and malignant paſſions; War protracted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010505_0005_0F8018844A322350"/>
to a certain period, neceſſarily compels peace; peace revives and extends trade and commerce; trade and commerce give new life, vigour and ſcope, to the ſenſual and malignant paſſions; and theſe naturally tend to generate another War.</p>
            <p>But War, conſidered in itſelf, is the premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and determined deſtruction of human be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; of creatures originally <hi>"formed after the image of God,"</hi> and whoſe preſervation, for that reaſon, is ſecured by Heaven itſelf within the fences of this righteous law, that <hi>"at the hand of every man's brother, the life of man ſhall be required."</hi> And tho' this created image of the Holy Triune God muſt be owned to have been ſo wretchedly defaced, as to retain but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faint reſemblance of its Divine original; yet, as the higheſt inforc<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ent of that heavenly law, which was publiſhed for the ſecurity of life, it is moſt graciouſly renewed by the Incarnation of the Son of God, and the Indwelling of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Further: the conſequences of War, when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially examined, will be found big, not only with outward and temporal diſtreſs, but with an evil that extends where in the darkneſs and tumult of human paſſions it is neither expected nor conceive to reach. That property is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, ſcattered, and deſtroyed; that laws are trampled under foot, government deſpiſed, and the ties of all civil and domeſtic order broken into pieces; that fruitful countries are made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, and ſtately cities a heap of ruins; that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010505_0006_0F8018851C88BFA0"/>
matrons and virgins are violated; and neither the innocence of unoffending infancy, nor the impotence of decrepit age, a protection from the rage and thirſt for blood—is but the mortal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny of this teeming womb of miſchief. The worſt is ſtill behind—and tho' remote from thoſe ſenſes and paſſions that are exerciſed only by preſent good and evil, and, therefore, not the object of common concern; muſt yet, upon the leaſt recollection, impreſs with horrer every mind that believes there is a Righteous God, and a ſtate of retribution that is to laſt for ever. But what muſt the Chriſtian feel?—he, who knows that the fall of man is a fall from meekneſs, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and love, into ſenſuality, pride, and wrath; that the Son of God became incarnate, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and died, to reſtore that firſt life of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, purity, and love; and that for thoſe, in whom the reſtoration of that life is not begun in the preſent ſtate, the Son of God incarnate has, it is to be dreaded, ſuffered and died in vain— what, I ſay, muſt he feel for thoſe immortal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that, in the earlieſt dawn of their day of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, are by hundreds and thouſands driven into eternity, in the bitterneſs of enmity and wrath — ſome inflamed with drunkenneſs; ſome fired with luſt; and all ſtained with blood? In thoſe direful conflicts, which are maintained with ſo much rage, that when the Vanquiſhed at laſt retreats with the loſs of TWENTY-THOUSAND HUMAN BEINGS, the Victor finds he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſome little advantage at the expence of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010505_0007_0F801885AC3FAAD0"/>
MORE THAN HALF THAT NUMBER <note n="*" place="bottom">SMOLLETT, in his Continuation of the Hiſtory of England, ſpeaking of the battle of Cunersdorf, where the Pruſſians attacked the Muſcovites in the year 1759, ſays, <q>The carnage was truly horrible; above twenty thouſand Pruſſians lay dead on the field. The loſs of the Ruſſians amounted to ten thouſand. It muſt be owned, that if the King was prodigal of his own perſon, he was likewiſe very free with the lives of his ſubjects.</q> He adds: <q>That at no time ſince the days of ignorance and barbarity, have the lives of men been ſquandered away with ſuch profuſion as in the courſe of this German war. They have not only been unneceſſarily ſacrificed in various exploits of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, but they have been laviſhly expoſed to all the rigour and diſtemper of winter-campains,—in deſpite of nature, and in contempt of humanity.</q>
               </note> — Heaven and earth! what a poſſibility is here of a ſacrifice made to <hi>the prince of darkneſs,</hi> the firſt and chief apoſtate! who rejoices in beholding men, thro' the abuſe of thoſe benefits which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved Mercy has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conferred upon them, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into enmity and hatred of God and their brethren; forſaken by God, and deſtroying one another: and thus haſtening once more into his horrid ſociety; that having been accomplices in his rebellion: they may become partakers of his miſery and torment.</p>
            <p>Now, if the man of valour, whom conſenting nations have dignified with the title of HERO, and the man devoted to the world, are aſked, from whence this immortal miſchief, that may thus extend its influence into the regions of eternity, can proceed; what muſt they anſwer?—indeed, what can they anſwer, but that it is engendered by the love of human glory—as vain a phantom
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010505_0008_0F801888562A2220"/>
as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ever play'd before a madman's eye! by the luſt of dominion; the avarice of wealth; and the infamous ambition of being dreaded as the conquerors and tyrants of mankind? Heaven preſerve Britain from theſe, <hi>"earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh"</hi> motives—ſo repugnant to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, compaſſionate, and forgiving temper, with which Redeeming Mercy has bleſt it, in union with the purer beams of heavenly light; that light which is intended to remove all the darkneſs of human corruption, and transform ſelfiſh, ſenſual, proud, and malignant ſpirits, into Angels of patience, humility, meekneſs, purity, and love; the <hi>"children and heirs of God, the brethren and joint heirs of Chriſt!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Britain, in the midſt of thoſe outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in which ſhe is ſo apt to place her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, muſt not forget, that there is no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of being preſerved from ſuch principles, dreadful and deteſtable as they are, but by the moſt humble, affectionate, and conſtant applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to and dependance upon "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," that Gracious Power which firſt plucked them from her breaſt. It is, indeed, a ſtanding obſervation among the prattlers of human philoſophy, "that the mind muſt be very weak, that cannot bear a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:" but where is the mind ſtrong enough to bear it, that is not bleſt from ABOVE with ſomething better than proſperity itſelf? That is not bleſſedneſs, which is ſomething that can be ſeparated from the mind; much leſs that, which
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010505_0009_0F801888DBA8AC58"/>
may leave it miſerable to all eternity; and leaſt of all that, which may tend to make it thus miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by degenerating into a curſe. And this is the caſe of all external things that are called bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; which, in their own nature, are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and changeable, and in their uſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication may be perverted to the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and laſting evils: <q>If ye will not lay it to heart, <hi>to give glory unto my name,</hi> ſaith the Lord of Hoſts; I will even ſent a curſe upon you, and I will <hi>CURSE YOUR BLSSINGS.</hi>
               </q> All external bleſſings, whether national or perſonal, are curſes, when they become the fuel of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and malignant fire in corrupt nature; when they not only alienate the mind from "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH," but madden it to impious rebellion and defiance againſt him.</p>
            <p>From this view of war, begun from human paſſions, and carried on for human purpoſes, for honour, dominion, trade, or ſome other end that centers in the preſent life; it is evident, that the Chriſtian can have no intereſt in it: he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive bleſſing from its ſucceſs, nor triumph and exult when to the ſhort-ſighted view of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind the appearance of ſucceſs preſents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he knows, that the means are infinitely diſproportionate to the end; and his Redeemer himſelf has declared, that <hi>"all they that take the ſword,"</hi> inflamed by malignity, and ſeeking ſome earthly and temporal good, <hi>"ſhall periſh with the ſword."</hi> But, without any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of limitation, the ſame Redeemer, in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010505_0010_0F80188970D68870"/>
Revelation of his future judgments upon a fallen and obſtinately evil world, has further declared, that <q>
                  <hi>he that leadeth into captivity, ſhall go into captivity; and he that killeth with the ſword, muſt be killed with the ſword: Here is the</hi> trial of the <hi>faith and patience of the ſaints,</hi>
               </q> who, being called to a ſtate of ſuffering, and treading in the footſteps of their great Examplar, <q>
                  <hi>when they are reviled, revile not again; when they ſuffer, threaten not; but commit themſelves to</hi> THE LORD THAT REIGNETH, <hi>to him that judgeth righteouſly.</hi>
               </q> And to this ſolemn de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of righteous judgment, the penman of that awful book calls upon all mankind to attend, and ſays, <hi>"If any man have an ear,"</hi> an ear that is not totally deafened by the tumultuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of nature, ſeparated from God, and turned wholly to itſelf, <hi>"let him</hi> now <hi>hear;"</hi> let him now repent, and forſaking his own ſenſual and malignant will, ſeek after the GOD of PEACE and LOVE, and live.</p>
            <p>We will, therefore, turn our attention to the only light in which Succceſs in War can proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be conſidered by us, namely, As the ſole work of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH"— a part of the adminiſtration of that Merciful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which, thro' all the revolutions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered nature and diſordered life, purſues but one invariable purpoſe, the Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man.</p>
            <p>The diſorders of nature and of life are wholly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010505_0011_0F80188A52690B10"/>
the effects of ſin; of a voluntary averſion and alienation from the life, light, and love of God, in perfect union with which, perfect purity, peace, and happineneſs are only to be found. Hence that diſcordancy of the outward elements, which brings forth peſtilence, famine, inundations, earthquakes, ſtorms, and tempeſts: hence, in the corporal part of the human frame, pain, ſickneſs, and death; in the mental, ſenſuality, pride, and malignity, including all the ſelfiſh and wrathful paſſions, that, between individuals, engender en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, hatred, injury, reſentment and revenge, and between nations a peculiar kind of enmity and wrong that iſſues in war. In the elements ſtrife and evil will ſubſiſt, 'till they are purified and united by the laſt renovating fire; in man, 'till all the deſigns of Grace are fully accompliſhed: but ſurrounded with evil as men are, and full of evil themſelves, what would become of the whole wretched race at any given inſtant of time, at this very moment for example, if the effects of that evil were not continually ſuſpended and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Infinite Power, ſo as to become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſubſervient to the purpoſes of Infinite Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs and Love, in Univerſal Redemption.</p>
            <p>The nature of that Redemption it would be needleſs to mention, if in this age of levity we were not ſo apt to forget it. It is, in general, a full reſtoration of the life of God in the ſoul; that Life of Father Son and Holy Spirit, which was once the life and perfection of fallen angels
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010505_0012_0F80188AEC436008"/>
and fallen man; which is and only can be the life and perfection of all holy angels; and which the Son of God has been reſtoring to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the time in which Adam fell.</p>
            <p>When the Son of God became incarnate, what was implied in this Redemption as the effect of its influence upon man, was fully evident from His doctrine and His life; namely, the conqueſt and renunciation of the world, and the death of the will and all the appetites and paſſions of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len animal nature, thro' faith in HIS NAME— not an hiſtorical and ſpeculative faith, a meer ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſent to the truth of a well-atteſted hiſtory of facts and doctrines; but a full, ardent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <hi>deſire</hi> of the LIFE OF CHRIST, as begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and formed in the ſoul by the continual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus, what was at firſt the Perſonal duties of ſingle Chriſtians, when they were ſcattered over the face of the earth, and were only parts of different nations; became afterwards National duties, when whole nations became Chriſtians. <hi>If, therefore,</hi> 
               <q>to love an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to forgive him, do him good, <hi>and</hi> pray for him</q>— <hi>if to</hi> "overcome the world", <hi>whoſe power conſiſts in</hi> 
               <q>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life</q> — <hi>are Chriſtian Perſonal duties; if, to</hi> 
               <q>love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our mind, and with all our ſtrength, and our fellow-creatures as ourſelves,</q>—<hi>is the purity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Chriſtian Perſonal life; the ſame muſt alſo be true of Chriſtian National life and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010505_0013_0F80188BB16B3EC0"/>
duty:</hi> for a Chriſtian nation differs no otherwiſe from a Chriſtian perſon, than as the whole differs from one of the parts of which it eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; and is only the aggregated body of thoſe ſingle perſons, on whom univerſally ſuch duties are enjoined, from whom univerſally ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is required.</p>
            <p>But, to this perfect and heavenly life and duty, War is repugnant, in its cauſe, in itſelf, and in its conſequences: it can be but comparatively irrepugnant, with reſpect to the degrees of its own evil; and the more or leſs it partakes of the malignity of animal paſſions, and the ſenſuality of animal views, the more or leſs obnoxious muſt it render a people to the ſevere judgments of "THE LORD THAT REIGNETH."</p>

            <p>THAT grand enemy of mankind, the devil, is very juſtly called in ſcripture the prince and god of this world, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he has great power in it, many of its rules, and principles being invented by this evil ſpirit, the father of all lies and falſhood, to ſeparate us from God, and prevent our return to happineſs: For, according to the ſpirit and vogue of this world, whoſe corrupt air we have all breathed, there are many things that paſs for great and honourable, and moſt deſirable, which yet are ſo far from being ſo, that the true greatneſs and honour of our nature conſiſts in the not deſiring them. To abound in wealth, to have fine houſes and rich cloaths, to be attended with ſplendor and equipage, to be beautiful in our perſons, to have titles of dignity, to be above our fellow-creatures, to be looked on with admiration, to overcome our enemies with power, to heap up treaſures upon earth, to add houſe to houſe and field to field, and delight ourſelves in the moſt coſtly manner, theſe are the great, the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the deſirable things, to which the ſpirit of the world turns the eyes of moſt people. And many a man is afraid of ſtanding ſtill, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010505_0015_0F80188D2BD67D08"/>
in the purſuit of theſe things, leſt the ſame world ſhould take him for a fool.</p>
            <p>Yet the hiſtory of the goſpel, is chiefly the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Chriſt's conqueſt over this ſpirit of the world, and the number of true Chriſtians, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the number of thoſe, who following the ſpirit of Chriſt, have lived contrary to this ſpirit of the world.</p>
            <p>This is the mark of Chriſtianity, <hi>Whoſoever is born of God overccometh the world.</hi> 1 John v. 4. <hi>Set your affections on things above, and not on things on earth, for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Col. iii. 2. <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; for all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father; but is of the world.</hi> 1 John ii. 15. <hi>Know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God, whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</hi> James iv. 4. <hi>Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind.</hi> Rom. xii. 2.</p>
            <p>This is the language of the whole New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You are to be dead to the world, and to live a new life in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the clearneſs and plainneſs of theſe doctrines by which believers in Chriſt are required thus to renounce the world, yet great part of the Chriſtians live and die ſlaves to the cuſtoms and tempers of the world. <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010505_0016_0F80188F5556FB70"/>
and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls.</hi> Matth. xi. 29. Now this meek, this lowly ſtate, that conſtitutes the true reſt of the ſoul, cnnnot ſubſiſt in any mind, but ſo far as it is thus dead to the world, and has parted with all deſires of enjoying all its riches, pleaſures and honours. So that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be truly humble, you muſt unlearn all theſe notions, which you have been all your life learning, from this corrupt ſpirit of the world. You can make no ſtand againſt the aſſaults of pride, the meek affections of humility can have no place in your ſouls, till you ſtop the power of the world over you, and reſolve againſt a blind obedience to its laws. And when you are once advanced thus far, as to be able to ſtand ſtill in the torrent of worldly faſhions, and opinions, and examine the worth and value of things, which are moſt admired and valued in the world, you have gone a great way in the gaining of your freedom, and have laid a good foundation for the amendment of your heart. Think upon the rich, the great, and the learned perſons, that have made great figures, and been high in the eſteem of the world; many of them died in your time, and yet they are ſunk, and loſt, and gone, and as much diſregarded by the world, as if they had been only ſo many bubles of water. And is it worth your while to loſe the ſmalleſt degree of virtue, for the ſake of pleaſing ſo bad a maſter, and ſo falſe a friend, as the world is. Is it worth your while to bow the knee to ſuch an idol, as
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010505_0017_0F80188FCDE5C8F8"/>
this, that ſo ſoon will have neither eyes, nor ears, nor a heart to regard you; inſtead of ſerving that great, and holy, and mighty God, that will make all his ſervants partakers of his own eternity.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world.</hi> Gal. i. 4. Chriſtianity therefore implieth a deliverance from this world; and he that profeſſeth it, profeſſeth to live contrary to every thing, and every temper, that is peculiar to this evil world. The Apoſtle John declareth this oppoſition to the world in this manner: <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them: We are of God, &amp;c.</hi> 1 John iv. 5. This is the deſcription of the followers of Chriſt; and it is proof enough, that no people are to be reckon'd Chriſtians in reality, who in their hearts and tempers belong to this world. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs.</hi> Chap. v. 19. Chriſtians therefore can no farther know that they are of God, than ſo far as they know they are not of the world, that is, that they don't live according to the ways and ſpirit of the world. And he is only of God, or born of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, who has overcome this world, that is, who has choſen to live by faith, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his actions by the principles of a wiſdom revealed from God, by Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world,</hi> ſays
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010505_0018_0F80189036057BA8"/>
our bleſſed Saviour. This is the ſtate of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity with regard to this world, the profeſſion of Chriſtians requiring them to live as citizens of the new Jeruſalem, and to have their converſation in heaven. If you are not thus out of, and contrary to the world, you want the diſtinguiſhing mark of Chriſtianity; you don't belong to Chriſt, but by being out of the world, as he was out of it. We may deceive ourſelves; if we pleaſe, with vain, and ſoftning comments upon theſe words; but they are, and will be underſtood in their firſt ſimplicity, and plainneſs, by every one that reads them in the ſame ſpirit, that our bleſſed Lord ſpoke them. And to underſtand them in any lower, leſs ſignificant meaning, is to let carnal wiſdom explain away that doctrine, by which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour ſuffered, and was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, to make our ſuffering, and ſacrifice of ourſelves fit to be received by God. And we are to ſuffer, to be crucified, to die, and to riſe with Chriſt; or elſe his crucifixion, death, and reſurrection will profit us nothing. The neceſſity of this conformity to all that Chriſt did, and ſuffered upon our account is very plain from the whole tenor of ſcripture. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, this is the only condition of our being ſaved by them. <hi>If we ſuffer with him, we ſhall alſo reign with him.</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his crucifixion, <hi>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him.</hi> Rom. vi. 6. Here you ſee
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010505_0019_0F801890ED24EE38"/>
Chriſt is not crucified in our ſtead; but unleſs our old man be really crucified with him, the croſs of Chriſt will profit us nothing. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to the death of Chriſt, the condition is this: <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him,</hi> vers 8. If therefore Chriſt be dead alone, if we are not dead with him, we are as ſure from this ſcripture, that we ſhall not live with him. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As to the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt, the ſcripture ſheweth us, how we are to partake of the benefit of it: <hi>If ye be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God.</hi> Col. iii. 1. It was for this reaſon, that the holy Jeſus ſaid of his diſciples, and in them of all true believers, <hi>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world.</hi> Becauſe all true believers conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſufferings, crucifixion, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, live no longer after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and temper of this world, but their life is hid with Chriſt in God. This is the ſtate of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the world, to which all orders of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are called. They muſt ſo far renounce all wordly tempers, be ſo far governed by the things of another life, as to ſhew, that they are truly and really crucified, dead, and riſen with Chriſt. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſſed away, behold all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 17.</p>
            <p>The ancient Philoſophers began all their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in a total renunciation of the ſpirit of this
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010505_0020_0F801891B02FEC18"/>
world; they ſaw with the eyes of heaven, that darkneſs was not more contrary to light, than the ſpirit and wiſdom of this world was contrary to divine wiſdom: Therefore they allowed of no progreſs in virtue, but ſo far as a man had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come himſelf, and the ſpirit of this world. This gave a divine ſolidity to all their inſtructions, and proved them to be maſters of true wiſdom. But the doctrine of the croſs of Chriſt, the laſt, the higheſt, the moſt finiſhing ſtroke given to the ſpirit of this world, that ſpeaks more in one word, than all the philoſophy of voluminous writers, is yet profeſſed by thoſe, who are in more friendſhip with the world, than was allowed to the diſciples of Pithagoras, Socrates, Plato or Epictetus. Nay, if thoſe ancient Sages were to ſtart up amongſt us with their divine wiſdom, they would bid fair to be treated by the ſons of the goſpel, if not by ſome Fathers of the church, as dreaming Enthuſiaſts. But, this is a ſtanding truth, the world can only love its own, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can only be juſtified of her children. The heaven-born Epictetus told one of his ſcholars, <hi>That then he might firſt look upon himſelf as having made ſome true proficiency in virtue, when the world took him for a fool</hi>; an oracle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like that, which ſaid, the wiſdom of this world is fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God.</p>
            <p>If you aſk what is the apoſtaſy of theſe laſt times, or whence is all the degeneracy of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſtian church, it muſt be placed to a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010505_0021_0F801892887D7A28"/>
worldly ſpirit. If here you ſee open wickedneſs, there only form of godlineſs, if here ſuperficial holineſs, political piety, there haughty ſanctity, partial zeal, if almoſt every where, you ſee a Jewiſh blindneſs, and hardneſs of heart, and the church trading with the goſpel, as viſibly, as the old Jews bought and ſold beaſts in their temple, all this is only ſo many forms, and proper fruits of the worldly ſpirit. This is the great net, with which the devil becomes a fiſher of men; and be aſſured of this, that every ſon of man is in this net, till through, and by the Spirit of Chriſt he breaks out of it. I ſay the Spirit of Chriſt, for nothing elſe can deliver him from it. If you truſt to any kind or form of religious obſervances, to any kind of learning, or effort of human pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and then I will tell you what your caſe will be, you will overcome one temper of the world, only and merely by cleaving to another: For nothing can overcome or renounce the world, but ſingly and ſolely the Spirit of Chriſt. Hence it is, that many learned men with all the rich furniture of their brain live and die ſlaves to the ſpirit of this world, the Spirit of Chriſt is not the only thing that is the deſire of their hearts, and therefore their learning only works in and with the ſpirit of this world, and becomes itſelf no ſmall parts of the vanity of vanities.</p>
            <p>Would you know the evil nature and effect of a ſpirit given up to the world, and not ſubjected to the Spirit of Grace: you need only look at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010505_0022_0F8018950A91D750"/>
the bleſſed effect of a continual ſtate of watching, a continual humble application to God in the true ſpirit of prayer, for the one goes downwards with the ſame ſtrength, as the other goes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the one betroths, and weds to an earthly nature, with the ſame certainty, as the other eſpouſes, and unites to Chriſt. The ſpirit of continual watchings and prayer, is a preſſing forth of the ſoul out of this earthly life, it is a ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all its deſire after the life of God, it is a leaving as far as it can, all its own ſpirit, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſpirit from above, to be one life, one love, one ſpirit with Chriſt in God. This prayer, which is an emptying itſelf of all its own luſts and natural tempers, and an opening itſelf for the light and love of God to enter into it, is the prayer in the Name of Chriſt, to which nothing is denied; for the love which God bears to the ſoul, is an eternal never ceaſing deſire to open the birth of his holy word and ſpirit in it, and ſtays no longer till the door of the heart open for Him; and nothing does or can keep God out of the ſoul, or hinder his union with it, but the deſire of the heart turned from it. What the ſoul deſireth, that is the fewel of its fire, and as its fewel is, ſo is the flame of its life. As we ſow we ſhall reap; if to the ſpirit, we ſhall reap life and peace; if to the fleſh, we ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption. Wherever and in whatſoever the will chuſeth to dwell and delight, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the ſoul's food, its cloathing and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010505_0023_0F801896045632F0"/>
Since this is the caſe, let us ſtop a while, let our hearing be turned into feeling. Let us conſider, whether there is any thing in life, that deſerves a thought, but how to keep in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtate of watching and prayer, that we may attain to that purity of heart, which alone can ſee, find and poſſeſs God.</p>

repreſentation of Chriſtianity. They can be zealous for opinions, forms, and an external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any kind, becauſe they leave them in quiet poſſeſſion of their ambition, their covetouſneſs, their love of themſelves, and their love of the world: They can readily take up a profeſſion of faith in a ſuffering Saviour, nay bring themſelves to truſt in an outward covering of his Merits and Righteouſneſs for Salvation, becauſe this coſts them nothing; but to be cloathed with his ſpirit of humility, poverty and ſelf-denial; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own wills in his lowlineſs, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and total reſignation to the will of God, to mortify the fleſhly appetites; to be crucified to the world; to ſtrip themſelves of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and ſatisfaction in thoſe endowments, whether natural or acquired, which appear great and glorious in the eyes both of themſelves and others; and, in a word, to take up their croſs, and nakedly follow a naked Chriſt in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Theſe are hard ſayings, they cannot bear them: But wiſdom is juſtified of her children; unacceptable as theſe doctrines are to others, yet to them, and in them too, they are the power of God, and the wiſdom of God. It was by ſuch fooliſhneſs of preaching that Chriſt's kingdom firſt prevailed over the kingdoms of this world; and it muſt be by the ſame doctrine, under the influence of the ſame ſpirit, that we can only hope for its continuance to the end of it.</p>

the divine life, lies thro' great mortification and ſelf-denial: Some think it enough to get doctrines into the head; but till the heart is in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure purified by faith, nothing is rightly done: and in order to this, the children of Anak, (thoſe corrupt paſſions and inclinations that war againſt the ſoul) muſt be driven out, the perverſeneſs of the will broken, the underſtanding ſimplified, the pride of our hearts pluckt up by the roots, and all the cords that bind us to the world, and the things of it, untwiſted; in a word, our idols muſt be caſt out, and every curſed thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that ſeparates betwixt God and us; for the pure in heart, and they only, ſhall ſee God. It was by this kind of holy violence practiſed on themſelves, that the worthies both of the Old and New Teſtament, in all ages of the church, have laid hold on the kingdom of heaven, been favoured with ſuch rich communications from God, and enabled to work ſuch wonders as ſurpaſs the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of many in this degenerate incredulous age: And that a preparatory diſcipline of ſtrictneſs and ſeverity is neceſſary in order to qualify us for any extraordinary vouchſafements of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and grace, we may learn from the ſchools inſtituted among the Jews for the training up of perſons for the prophetic office, where they were educated in great abſtraction from the world, in the government of their paſſions, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of their natural propenſions, that being ſo diſengaged from the common impediments of

a holy life, they might be more at liberty for devotion and the contemplation of heavenly things, and by ſuch previous exerciſes become fit inſtruments for the Holy Spirit, and more receptive of heavenly wiſdom. Thus came they out holy enthuſiaſts, men of God furniſhed to every good word and work, ſcribes well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed unto the kingdom of heaven, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of giving offence in the way of duty, even before kings, being no leſs qualified for reproof and correction, than for doctrine and inſtruction in righteouſneſs: patterns theſe for all perſons of a religious character, whether they live in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges or in kings houſes; whether they attend on thoſe who go cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fare ſumptuouſly every day, or are called forth to a more promiſcuous employment of their office; for tho' the diſpenſation of prophecy, as it reſpects the foretelling future events, has a long time ceaſed in the church, yet the character of prophets in the capacity of declarers of God's word and will, and as denouncers of his judgments on all impenitents, even the moſt dignified of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, is never to ceaſe in it, neither is the Lord's hand ſhortned that it cannot extend comfort and courage, light and direction for theſe purpoſes now as formerly: But, alas! our hearts are ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they cannot receive it as they ought, and we are ſo entangled, as to many of us, with ſuch an evil covetouſneſs after the things of this life, ſo ſtudious to ſeek the honour that cometh
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010505_0027_0F8018997652CCA0"/>
of man, more than the honour that cometh of God, that we want boldneſs to hold the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt without reſpect of perſons: For let men be never ſo highly titled or charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, let their pretenſions to learning be what they will, and their acquaintance with creeds, canons and commentators never ſo extenſive, yet ſo long as they continue men of this world, and follow the things of it, ſo long as their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are ſet on things beneath, and their hearts unſurrendered to God, they are not better than dry bones as to the divine life, without marrow or moiſture; and as they cannot in ſuch a ſtate receive the things of the Spirit of God, not have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed thereto, ſo will theſe things of courſe appear fooliſhneſs unto them in others, and they will ſpeak evil of that which they know not. It is from a revival of the ſpirit of true Chriſtianity in the hearts of men alone, that we can hope to ſee peace reſtored on earth among the divided churches of Chriſtendom. Whilſt religion reſides only in the reaſoning part of man, it is tinctured with all the prejudices and paſſions of his nature, and his reaſon will be ready to plead for, or againſt the truth, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or education ſways him — But the wiſdom that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, full of mercy, and without partiality; for the fame good ſpirit that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens the underſtanding, cleanſes the heart of
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010505_0028_0F801899F659C1E0"/>
all bitterneſs, malice, and hypocriſy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore operates by pureneſs, by knowbledge, by love unfeigned.</p>
            <p>A party-ſpirit, whether it be in religion or politics, proceeds from littleneſs of mind and narrowneſs of heart, it puts out both the eye of the judgment and the eye of charity, and ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from ſeeing the brighteſt excellence in our neighbour that is not juſt as high or low as ourſelves; as I heard a man of learning once ſay, that he could not allow Milton's Paradiſe Loſt to be a good book, becauſe written by an Oliverian. But the Chriſtian knows no ſuch ſtraitneſs; for his bowels are enlarged towards all that will come within the embraces of his charity, which is as wide as the eaſt is from the weſt. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wrangle and hate about differences of opinion, for he is got above them; his call, his univerſal call is love, and he has adopted for his motto that ſaying of Luther: <hi>In whomſoever I ſee any thing of Chriſt, him I love.</hi> In this man, whereſoever he lives, and by what name ſoever he is called, the kingdom of Chriſt is come: and of ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly men and women it will conſiſt in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged glorious ſtate of it which we are given to look for: And what, if it be already begun on earth!</p>
            <p>
               <q>The one true church of Chriſt is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of ſaints, and charity; true charity, i. e. the love of Chriſt is the life and ſoul of it: Is then the love of God ſhed abroad in our
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010505_0029_0F80189AADEB0528"/>
hearts, and have we fervent charity among ourſelves? For, be it known of a truth, that as much as we poſſeſs of this heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo much have we of Chriſtianity, and no more; and that without it, all zeal for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is but contention, all modes of worſhip but formality, and all orthodoxy but vain opinion."</q>
