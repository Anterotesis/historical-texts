            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>There is a way for men to come out of the misery of sin, and to obtain and enjoy the Mercy and favour of Almighty God, and that is <hi>Faith in Christ:</hi> this is the way, and there is none but this; neither is there any thing in the World, that can help us to the Pardon of our Sins, to the Love of God, and the Salvation of our Souls, but only <hi>Faith in the Lord Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is the way, is apparent enough by the Answer which was given by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas Act.</hi> 16.31. for when the Keeper of the Prison cried out with trembling, <hi>Sirs what must I do to be saved?</hi> they made him this answer, <hi>belie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>And that we may the better know, that the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000547_0002_0FA6B65E35C25828"/>
is in Christ sufficiency enough for the Pardon of our Sins, and the salvation of our Souls, let us consider a little, both who Christ is, and also what he hath done for the working out of our deliverance, and the procuring of our Peace.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus Christ is the <hi>E</hi>ternal Son of God, who pitying that sinful and miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whereinto we are all brought by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of our first Parent, undertook to Mediate the matter betwixt God and us, and to reconcile us again unto God. For the better effecting of which great work. He came down from Heaven, and was Incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and was made Man yea in all things like unto other men, save only in sin, that so be might the better make us free from all sin. Being thus found in the fashion as a Man, he set himself in our stead, ond for us Men, and for our Salvation, he became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. And by his Obedience and Death he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly alone by himself accomplished whatever was requisite for our Salvation.</p>
               <p>The wretchedness of our condition is briefly this: We all like Sheep have gone astray, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have we only omitted those Duties, which the Law requires, but we have also committed those Evils, which the Law forbids; and as the want of Righteousness doth exclude us from the favour of God, and the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000547_0003_0FA6B663E5608EC8"/>
so the guiltiness of sin doth expose us to the wrath of God, and the Damnation of Hell. But the Lord Jesus Christ hath fulfilled all Righteousness. For in his Life he performed as much obedience, as the Law in rigor could exact; and by suffering Death upon the Cross, he underwent as much Punishment as could be required of Sinners, in the severity of Justice: and so by his Death and Obedience hath he provided against our double Misery. For by his sufferings upon the Cross, the Justice of God is satisfied, and his Wrath appeased; and by his Obedience the Law is fulfilled, and we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And as by his Death comes the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin, and deliverance from wrath, so by his Obedience comes the imputation of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and life Everlasting. All which as they were done in our Nature, so they were done for us, and in our behalf, he stood in the place of Sinners, that we might be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Righteous; he took our sins upon him, that he might put his Obedience upon us; the chastisement of our Peace was upon him, that with his stripes we may be healed; he was made a Curse for us, that he might Redeem us from it; he was made sin for us, that knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him: <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 5.22.</p>
               <p>And the better to assure us that by his Death upon the Cross, there was paid a price sufficient
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000547_0003_0FA6B663E5608EC8"/>
enough for the procuring of our Pardon, He arose again from the dead, which he could not have done, if the Justice of God had not been satisfied to the very full in every particular. For as sin is the sting of Death, and the only thing that makes Death terrible, so it is the strength of Death, and it is that only that doth give Death dominion over us: Sin is the Lock, and Bar, and Bolt, that makes fast the Gates of Death; and as the Door cannot be opened to let out a Prisoner, till the Bar be removed; so there is no escaping from Death, until sin be taken out of the way. Christ therefore by Rising from the Dead hath mightily declared unto us, that he hath paid the utmost farthing of our Debts, and that by his Death he hath fully satisfied the Justice of God. So that now by vertue of his Sufferings, the greatest sins are made pardonable, and there is a way set open for the worst of sinners, both to Grace and Glory. I say even for the worst sinners. There is no man now that can deny himself to be capable of Grace; there are too many, who from the greatness of Gods Mercy, do without any cause prusume to sin; but there is no man, who from the heinousness of his sins hath any just cause to despair of Mercy: for though our sins be many, yet the mercies of God be more; though they be great, yet his Mercies are above them; he is rich in Mercy,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000547_0004_0FA6B664475B31A8"/>
yea, his Mercy is Infinite, so that though he hath spent much Mercy already upon our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, yet he hath Mercy enough in store for us also; with him there is plenty of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and his Mercy endureth for ever: And the Merits of Christ are of the same Nature for he is Mighty to save, and he is the same for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and though the Riches of these Merits of Christ, there is a way set open, even for the worst sinners, to become partakers of the Riches of the Mercies of God. Now if any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins, <hi>&amp;c. I Joh.</hi> 2, 1, 2. And though the time of his abode upon earth in the days of his Flesh were but short, though his sufferings were but for a season; yet such was and is the dignity of his Person (being the Eternal Son of God) that his Sufferings and Obedience are infinitely Meritorious, and his Blood is able to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness: so that we may well say with the Apostle, <hi>Who is be that condemneth? It is Christ that Dyed, or rather who is risen again, and now maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us, Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. But let no Man turn this Doctrine of Comfort to a liberty of sinning: against the greatest sins there is hopes an Christ for penitent Believers. But because there is Mercy with God, shall we therefore go on in sin? God forbid: There is Mercy with
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000547_0004_0FA6B664475B31A8"/>
him, and therefore he must be Feared. But if any Man shall presume to sin, because there is Mercy with God, through Jesus Christ; in stead of Mercy, that man is like to meet with nothing but Justice: for as merciful as God is, and as All-sufficient as the Death of Christ is, there is no Mercy for such as go on still in their wickedness.</p>
               <p>And thus you see that Christ is mighty enough to save us from all our Sins, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us unto God: now that we may have benefit by this sufficiency of Christ, we must lay hold upon it by a lively Faith. This is that which Unites us unto Christ, and makes us one with him; this is that which gives us Interest in him, and makes us partakers of his Merits; this makes the Death and Obedience of Christ as verily our own, and as effectual for the Pardon of our Sins, as the Salvation of our Souls, and if they had been performed by our very selves. So that if we do-truly believe in the Lord Jesus, then is God well pleased with us for his sake, and by Vertue of his Merits, being made ours by Faith, our Sins are Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our Souls and Bodies shall be Eternally saved. And so much the Scripture doth plainly testifie in several places. As <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that <hi>Whosoever believe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>han him should not Perish, but have Life Everlasting.</hi> And again
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000547_0005_0FA6B667906DA0A0"/>
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 43. <hi>Through his Name, whosoever belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in him, shall have remission of Sins (be they never so many, never so hainous)</hi> And again, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38, 39. <hi>Be it known unto you, that through this Man is Preached unto you the Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sins, and by him all that believe are Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from all those things, from which they could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moses. By the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> we could never have been acquitted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the guiltiness of Sin, or from the wrath of God: But we are delivered from both, by Faith in Christ; for by it we obtain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of our Sins and the Salvation of our Souls.</p>
               <p>And thus it is manifest, <hi>That Christ is the way by which we are to obtain the Pardon of Sin, and Peace with God; and that Faith is the way whereby we are made Partakers of the Merits of Christ for our Justification and Salvation.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we now in a word, to shew that nothing but Christ can reconcile us unto God, and that nothing but Faith can make us partakers of Christ for our reconciliation.</p>
               <p>There is no way whereby to come unto God but only Christ: It is only in Christ that God is well pleased; neither is there salvation in any other. For there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. Neither is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means on our part, whereby to receive
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000547_0005_0FA6B667906DA0A0"/>
Christ, but only Faith, and yet unless we do receive him, we get no benefit by him; and therefore unless we do believe in him, we shall perish in our sins. And to this purpose speakes our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life; and he that believeth not the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> See the sum of all this, in that place of St. <hi>John, I Epist.</hi> 11. 12, and 13. <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> God hath given to us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life. These things have I written to you, that believe in the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have Eternal Life, and that ye may believe in the Name of the Son of God. By which place it is plain, that there is a way to Life; that Christ is the way to it; that Life is so in him, that it is in no other but him; that it is so in him, that by believing in him, we obtain Life; and that it is so in him, that without believing in him, we get no benefit at all by him. And thus you have the Truth of the former Answer enlarged and that confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to its several Branches; by which it is manifest, that <hi>Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and nothing else but only Faith in him,</hi> can help us to the pardon of sin, the love of God, and the salvation of our souls.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it may be thus applyed.</p>

               <p>I<hi>F I cannot obtain the pardon of my sins, and the favour of God, without Faith in Christ, I doubt my condition is woful, and that I am yet in my sins, and liable into Wrath.

               <p>Doubtless if we do not believe in Christ, our condition is woful: for there is no salvation in any other; and without Faith in him, we can get no benefit by him, but we are in our sins, and the obligation unto wrath is in full power and force against us. For though the Ransom which Christ paied by his Death upon the Cross, be a Ransome abundantly sufficient for the sins of the whole World; yet the benefit of that Death of his is bestowed on none, but upon such conditions as God himself pleaseth: which conditions for such as be of years, are Faith and Repentance; which if we want, we shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

you at his pleasure? And is it your care to know his Will? And is it your endeavour to yield him an Universal Obedience?

Do You thus accept of Christ, and submit unto him? Nay, <hi>It is your hearty desire and unfam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed endeavour so to do?</hi> Then you may be sure that you have some degrees of true Faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and therefore that Christ is yours, that God is yours, that all is yours.

               <p>By these questions we may examine our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000547_0007_0FA6B669882D8D38"/>
we do but deceive our own souls.</p>
               <p>Now if upon examination had, we find that we want Faith, we must be diligent in using the means whereby to get it, which by reading and hearing of the Word of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring about it. <hi>For Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word.</hi> If we find that we have this Faith, we must be careful to keep it, and so increase it, by the Word, by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by Prayer.</p>

Let him diligently consider, how ugly and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some sin doth make us in the sight of God, and what a fearful thing it is to be deprived of the Love of God, and the joyes of Heaven, and what a misery it is to be exposed to the Wrath of God, and the Torments of Hell. Let him seriously ponder what a misery it is to lose the Soul. Let him throughly weight the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Eternity, and the strictness of that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is to come; and the severity of that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000547_0009_0FA6B66B0A81ED18"/>
Sentence, which in that last and dreadful Day shall be pronounced upon all impenitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when they shall be adjudged to that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire, which is prepared for the Devil and his Angels. All these are of singular use to wound our souls, and to effect our hearts with sorrow for our sins. It is the Law that makes way for the Gospel: for thus <hi>John</hi> the Baptist by denouncing the Judgments of God upon wicked courses, prepared the way for our blessed Saviour. But especially let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, how great things God hath done for him. For as there is no greater obligation to obedience, than the loving-kindness of the Lord so there is no thing that doth more aggravate our sins, and so consequently our misery; and therefore nothing that can tend more to the breaking of the heart, than the consideration of the bounty and long-suffering of God to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And this plainly appears by that course which the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> at the Lords ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment took with <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 12. for by setting before his eyes Gods many and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mercies vouchsafed, and his own extream in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and ill requital of so great goodness, he was constrained to cry out with shame and sorrow, <hi>I have sinned against the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And amongst all the mercies of God, there is none that doth more deserve to take up all our thoughts, than that departure of Christ, which
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000547_0009_0FA6B66B0A81ED18"/>
he accomplished at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> neither is there any thing that doth more tend, either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us from sin, or to humble us for our fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than the death of our Saviour.</p>
               <p>For, suppose the Lord Jesus should present himself unto us, when we are about to commit any sin, or after we have done it, as he was hanging upon the Cross, with his Sides Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, his Face Buffeted, his Hands and Feet Nailed, his Head Crowned with Thorns, his very Heart pierced, his whole Body upon the Rack, and Trickling down with Drops of Blood, speaking unto us after this or the like manner. <hi>Behold, if ever sorrows were like unto my sorrows; and yet all this was but the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thy sins. It is thy sins that have brought me to all these Torments, and canst thou delight in that which was the cause of such misery? All this have I done for thy good, and is this the requital of my Love? I have born thy sins, that thou mightest be eased, mine hands were bound, that thine might be freed; my Sides were Scourged, that thine might be spared; my Cheeks were Buffeted, that thine might be Kist; my Head was Crowned with Thorns, that thine might be Crowned with Glory; and is this thy kindness to thy Friend, thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn me hatred for my good-will? Hast thou not put me to pains enough already, but that thou must Rake in my Wounds, and make a sport of my misery? or if thou wilt not pity me, yet pity thy self. For
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000547_0010_0FA6B66C5D190538"/>
can that be light to thee, which cost me so heavy? or shalt thou escape the Cup, that art a sinner, when my Beloved Father would not spare me that was but a Surety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose (I say) that the Lord Jesus should present himself and speak unto us, after this or the like manner; would not such a sight make our Bowels to yern, and such Words cut us to they very heart? Doubtless it were enough to make the dryest eyes to wish for Tears of Blood, and the hardest heart of the most obstinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to become in the midst of his Body like melting Wax, thus to hear and look upon him whom they have pierced: yea it is impossible for any man to think on this, and to go on in sin, but such as could be content to Crucifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the Lord of Glory.</p>
               <p>And thus you see, what are the chiefest helps to Humiliation, and by what means our Hearts may be brought to be deeply affected with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our sins.</p>

               <p>True it is, that Sorrow for Sin makes ready an Heart prepared for the Lord; and as usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the course of Nature, there is no Birth without some pain. So in the work of Grace there is no regeneration, (that of Infants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Some Women have a quick dispatch, others have a more te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Travel: and so it is in the New Birth, all are not pained alike. Some there be that go mourning all the day long, yea, day after day, whereas unto others, heaviness indures, but as it were for a night, and joy cometh in the morning. We must know therefore, and that for our comfort that it is not the quantity but the quality of Sorrow, that God looks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neither matters it so much, how great our Sorrow be, as how true it is.</p>

               <head>Answer.</head>
               <p>True it is, that the crosses and troubles which Men shall meer withal in the way to Heaven, are matters of offence, and unto some they are very powerful, turning them back from the hope laid before them, to the embracing of this present World. But if we would think upon things aright, in the midst of Misery; we should have comforts enough to refresh our Souls. Neither is there any trouble that can befal us, in the midst of which they have not matter of strong consolation, <hi>now being justified by Faith, are at peace with God, through Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to the end that we may be the better comforted against all crosses, let us make use of these few considerations following:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consider that it is no new or strange thing to be exercised with afflictions; neither are crosses and troubles of themselves an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Gods hatred, but rather a token of his love, and a witness of our Adoption, if we bear them patiently, and make good use of them. There is not any affliction Incident to the nature of Man, which some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even of Gods own dear Servants and Children, have not been exercised withal. Look upon <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all that cloud of Witnesses made mention of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. and we shall find
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:000547_0017_0FA6B674CB008358"/>
that through many afflictions, they all entred into the Kingdom of God. Nay, look upon the Captain of our Salvation, and we shall find that even he himself was made perfect through sufferings, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and this must needs be a special means to enable us to bear all with the greater patience, when we shall know and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that though our affliction be for number many, and for nature grievous, yet they are but the measure of our Betters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Consider that God hath promised never to leave us nor forsake us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. and his presence alone is support sufficient even in the worst of miseries. How can <hi>Jacob</hi> be afraid to go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when God himself hath said, he will go with him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 34. God hath made the like promise unto us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he bid us go into troubles; if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to walk through the Valley of the shadow of Death, yet we need fear no evil, as long as he is with us; for <hi>if God be with us, who can be against us?</hi> Rom.8.31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider, that unto such as do believe in Christ, the nature of afflictions is wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; for their sting is pull'd out, and their bitterness is allay'd, they may favour of Anger, of Wrath they do not: Crosses they may be, Curses they are not: they may b<hi>e</hi> Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for our Correction, but they are not Judgments for our Confusion. For Christ
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000547_0018_0FA6B67592E54F90"/>
hath suffered whatever Wrath was due unto us by reason of our sins; and if we be once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God by Faith in Christ, there is more ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er of comfort in the assurance of his love, than there can be of dejection in the greatest trouble.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider that God intends nothing but good unto us, in his sharpest dealings with us: for it is all to humble us, and to prove us, and to do us good at our latter end; all is for our profit, that we may be partakers of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For hereby he reforms what hath been amiss in us in times past; <hi>hereby our iniquity shall be purged, and this is the fruit, to take away our sin,</hi> Isai.27.9.</p>
               <p>Hereby he prevents sin in us for the time to come, as he did <hi>Paul,</hi> unto whom there was sent the Messenger of Satan to buffet him, lest he should have been exalted above measure, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 12.7.</p>
               <p>Hereby he doth wean us from the Love of the World and worldly Vanities. As long as all goes well with us, we are ready to say with <hi>Peter, It is good to be here:</hi> but when once we begin to be afflicted, then presently with the Prodigal, our minds are home-wards,</p>
               <p>Hereby he deals with us as the Husband-man doth by the Vine, he pares and prunes us, to make us the more fruitful, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.2.</p>
               <p>Hereby he doth exercise our Faith and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000547_0018_0FA6B67592E54F90"/>
and makes trial of our sincerity, as he did by <hi>Job.</hi> And so in this he layes the ground of our greater Glory: for greater afflictions require greater patience; and the greater our patience is, the greater shall be our future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
               <p>And the consideration of this must needs be a means to perswade us to Patience: for if we can willingly endure smarting-water for the clearing of our eyes; and bitter Pills, and sharp Lances for the Health of our Bodies: much more ought we to bear with patience the smarting hand of the Almighty God for the health of our Souls. There is no affliction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed joyous for the present, but grievous; but after it worketh the peaceable fruit of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness to such as are exercised thereby, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>Consider that if we do continue faithful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, we shall receive a Crown of life. And if we do but have an eye to that recompence of reward, we shall easily be drawn, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, to esteem the reproach of Christ greater than the Treasures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and to chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to suffer affliction with the People of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25,26. For the happiness of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is to come, is such, that our blessed Saviour accounts it matter of comfort against all fear whatsoever, as it doth plainly appear by
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000547_0019_0FA6B6765043F0C0"/>
those words of his, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. <hi>Fear not little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> Where the only Argument that he makes use of for the encouraging of his little Flock, is the hopes of the Kingdom. And again by that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11,12. <hi>Blessed are ye, when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you for my Names sake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for so persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted they the Prophets which were before you.</hi> Wherein our Saviour doth hearten his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples against Persecution, only upon this ground, because their reward should be great in Heaven. And surely in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> computation, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent affliction is not worthy the speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, in regard of that glory that shall be revealed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. neither is there indeed any comparison at all between them; for the one is but a light and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary affliction, the other is a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of Glory, <hi>2 Cor.</hi> 4. 17. So that this goodness of God in the Land of the living, is enough to keep us from fainting under the heaviest Burden; for though our outward Man decay, yet while we have an eye to this joy set before us, our inward Man will be renewed day by day. Fitly therefore is the hope of this happiness, called the <hi>Anchor of the Soul,</hi> and the <hi>Helmet of Salvation;</hi> for by this
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000547_0019_0FA6B6765043F0C0"/>
                  <hi>Anchor</hi> we are preserved in the deep waters, by this <hi>Helmet</hi> we are protected in the times of danger; and by flying unto this hope, we are sure to find refuge in the day of evil.</p>
               <p>And thus we may be comforted against evils present. Now as for those that are yet to come we may thus resolve, <hi>either they shall not come at all:</hi> for God will stand between us and harm, and keep us quiet from fear of evil: without his providence nothing can befal us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nothing shall befal to do us hurt: for he is a God that delighteth in the prosperity of his Servants.</p>
               <p>Or if they do come, <hi>yet the Lord will deliver us out of all,</hi> there shall be an end. Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will come, and he will deliver his People, even because he hath a favour unto them.</p>
               <p>And in the mean time, <hi>he will support us in them,</hi> till deliverance do come: and his Grace will be sufficient for us. <hi>For God is faithful, and will not suffer us to be tempted above that we are able: but with the temptation also make away to escape, that we may be able to hear it,</hi> I Cor.10.13.</p>
               <p>And <hi>he will also give us benefit by them:</hi> for he maketh all to work together for good to those that love him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. And thus we may be comforted against our fears also. In a word, there's none can know the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, better than he that dwells there. And therefore which way soever God leads us, it is
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000547_0020_0FA6B676F9FD4A88"/>
safe to follow him. The uneasiness of the way, makes us think that it is the farthest way about; but the Lord knows it is the next way home. And whatsoever they seem to us, yet <hi>all the wayes of the Lord are mercy and truth,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such as keep his Covenant, and his Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.10.</p>

               <p>This is answered in a word. It is but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of our own, to think our own troubles the worst, when as indeed they are but common temptations, but say the worst, grant that there be none like them; yet if we shall compare them either with that which we have deserved, or with that which Christ himself for us hath Suffered; or with that weight of Glory that shall be revealed, we shall then esteem them all as nothing.

               <p>This must needs be troublesome to Mindes well affected; howbeit if God himself restrains us, we may then be sure that he requires not our presence. And in such a case, if our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires be with the Congregation, even that desire will be sufficient. Neither is the Lord so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Congregation, but that he is near to all, that call upon him faithfully wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they be, when necessity, and not neglect is the reason of their absence. And besides all this, if at any time, by reason of Age or Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we are not able to do those things which we do desire, and did perform in the time of our health and strength, then shall a willing Mind be well-pleasing unto God, and good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires shall be accepted. Yea, furthermore, this we must know for our consolation; that a Patient submiting to the good will of God, is a worshiping of him, as appears by that <hi>Job</hi> 1. 20, 21. where <hi>Job</hi> is said to worship God, when he did with Patience and contentedness submit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: This is indeed a glorifying of God, and herein we acknowledge him to be our God, and in thus submiting we shall perform unto God as good service as ever we did in all
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000547_0021_0FA6B7BAA52BB388"/>
our Lives. For this is the passive part of true Obedience, and the Tryal of sincerity in other things. To serve the Lord when all goes well with us, is much; and it is altogether as much, if not more, to resolve to trust in him, though he should Kill us. And if we can with <hi>Job</hi> hold fast our Righteousness, and in the hour of Temptation not fall away, this is a true Note of pure Religion, and a manifest Argument of Sincerity and Truth.</p>

               <p>Verily there is no solid Reason why it should; for God hath given us Victory over Death it self; through our Lord Jesus Christ. The Death of Christ was the Death of Death. Death fastning upon him, to whom it was not due, lost its sting, and so became less able to hurt those that had deserved it. Christ hath pul'd out the sting of Death, by dying for sin; so that now, like a Bee, or Snake without a sting, it may buzze about us and fright us, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt us. All the hurt that Death can do to such as believe in the Lord Jesus, is to free them out of Prison, to put an end to their days of sin, to carry them home to their Fathers
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000547_0021_0FA6B7BAA52BB388"/>
house to let them into their Masters joy, to pull down those Mouldring Cottages wherein they dwell, and to build them up to immortality. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, them also that sleep in Jesus, shall God bring with him, and they shall be for ever with the Lord. And of this Happiness the worst kind of death that can befall us, cannot deprive us. A Man may dye in Poverty, he may dye with extremity of Torments, he may dye by common Calamities, and yet he may dye in Faith; and so dying his End shall be Peace: <hi>For blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord, even so saith the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 13. So that if we did but throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the nature of Death, and what it is to the People of God, we should be so far of being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of it, that with St. <hi>Paul, We should rather desire to be desolved, because then we should be with Christ, which is the best of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To shut up this point, and so likewise the whole matter concerning afflictions, this let me add to all the rest, that if we desire to get good by these Meditations, and to be upheld with Comfort in the time of trouble, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue instant in Prayer. This is that Receipt which the Holy Ghost prescribes to all sorts of Persons, against all manner of grievances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, <hi>James</hi> 5. 23. This is the Remedy that is alwayes at hand, and never out of season. Yea, this is that Messenger which being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:000547_0022_0FA6B7BB03A46B38"/>
aright, was never sent empty away. Believe it, If a Man were in a Case more despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then Death, in a place worse then Hell, yet if there he could pray heartily, he should find comfort and strength, even beyond Hope: for our Prayers use to be with the utmost of our Hopes, if not beyond them, and yet God doth use to be better to us than our Prayers.</p>

               <p>Promises I confess that are misapplied, can afford to the Soul no solid Comfort. But from our Failings we may not presently conclude that they do not at all belong to us: for God looks upon the heart; and where Ability is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Will is accepted.</p>
               <p>Are not our Failings your Grief? Are they not besides your Will? Are they not contrary to the current of your Desires, and the main bent of your Resolutions and Endeavours?

               <p>And this is a true Rule, whereby to proceed in the judging of our selves.

               <p>And what can we now object more? Do we doubt the Truth of all these Promises? Surely we need not; for God is not a Man that he should lie, neither the Son of Man that he should repent: Hath he spoken, and shall he not do it? Hath he said, and shall it not come to pass? Was he ever yet worse then his word? And have not we had experience of his Love, as well upon our selves as others? Is he not the true witness, and a God that is most zealous of his own glory? Why then are we disquieted, and why are our hearts dejected within us? Still trust in God, make straight steps to your
