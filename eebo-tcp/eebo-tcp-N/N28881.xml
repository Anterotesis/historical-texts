            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>ISAIAH iii. 4, 5.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>AND I will give children to be their princes, and babes Å¿hall rule over them. And the people Å¿hall be oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, every one by another, and every one by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: the child Å¿hall behave himÅ¿elf proudly againÅ¿t the ancient, and the baÅ¿e againÅ¿t the honorable.</hi>

            <p>WHEN we read and hear Å¿uch threatening predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as this; and Å¿ee our judges as at the firÅ¿t, and our counÅ¿ellors and governors as at the beginningâ€”equally wiÅ¿e and good; we are ready to bleÅ¿s our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and to Å¿ay in our hearts, TheÅ¿e things Å¿hall not come upon <hi>us.</hi> That the whole of what is here foretold, has not <hi>yet</hi> come upon us, we have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly great reaÅ¿on to bleÅ¿s God, and to congratulate one another<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But it Å¿hould be remembered, that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038509_0005_10122C00224888F8"/>
neither paÅ¿t mercies, nor preÅ¿ent happy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances, are any Å¿ecurity againÅ¿t evils to come. SurpriÅ¿ing changes in this fallen world, have ever been frequent, and are Å¿till to be expected. ProÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adverÅ¿ity, like Å¿unÅ¿hine and Å¿torms, are wont to follow each other, almoÅ¿t in conÅ¿tant rotation. Communities, as well as individuals, that have been remarkably raiÅ¿ed up, are often as wonderfully caÅ¿t down, in the providence of God, when moÅ¿t exalted. "He bleÅ¿Å¿eth them alÅ¿o," it is Å¿aid,<note n="*" place="bottom">PÅ¿alm cvii. 38, 39.</note> "Å¿o that they are multiplied greatly, and Å¿uffereth not their cattle to decreaÅ¿e. Again they are miniÅ¿hed, and brought low, through oppreÅ¿Å¿ion, affliction and Å¿orrow."</p>
            <p>OF Å¿uch viciÅ¿Å¿itudes, the choÅ¿en people threatened in our text, was a Å¿triking and an inÅ¿tructive exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. This nation had long been favored, in regard to government, as well as religion, far beyond any other then on the earth. From its earlieÅ¿t infancy, it had been under the peculiar guardianÅ¿hip of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. "When IÅ¿rael was a child," Å¿ays the moÅ¿t High in HoÅ¿ea,<note n="â€ " place="bottom">Chap. xi. 1â€”4.</note> "then I loved him, and called my Å¿on out of Egypt:â€”I taught Ephraim alÅ¿o to go, taking them by their arms: I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke."</p>
            <p>THEY had been liberated from powerful oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ors, and cruel taÅ¿k-maÅ¿ters, by the out-Å¿tretched
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038509_0006_10122C01AFBC94C0"/>
arm of the <hi>Almighty.</hi> They had been led like a flock, through the Red Sea, and forty years in a moÅ¿t per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilous, howling wilderneÅ¿s, by the hand of <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Under <hi>JoÅ¿hua,</hi> their great and beloved general, they had vanquiÅ¿hed mighty armies; and had obtained a peaceful Å¿ettlement as a free and an independent people, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
            <p>HERE, when they forgat God their Saviour, who had done Å¿uch great things for them, and Å¿o many wonderous works before their eyes, he Å¿ometimes left them to have no guide, overÅ¿eer or ruler; and Å¿uffered the Heathen around them, to make terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inroads on their borders. NevertheleÅ¿s, as often as they cried unto the Lord in their diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, he raiÅ¿ed them up judgesâ€”valiant, righteous men, to deliver them out of the hand of their enemies, and to adminiÅ¿ter juÅ¿tice among them. Afterwards, becauÅ¿e of their uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s, and the hardneÅ¿s of their hearts, God gave them kings; and theÅ¿e, Å¿ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of them, were very eminent for wiÅ¿dom and virtue. Nor was their happineÅ¿s, in this reÅ¿pect, yet at an end; for IÅ¿aiah propheÅ¿ied no later than the reign of Hezekiah; one of the moÅ¿t amiable and beÅ¿t of princes.</p>
            <p>BUT, from the days of their fathers, they had gone away from God's ordinances; and now, it Å¿eems, the meaÅ¿ure of their iniquities was almoÅ¿t full. A very awful decree of the holy One of IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael againÅ¿t them is therefore here announced. See
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038509_0007_10122C03C8F15A38"/>
the preceding context. "For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hoÅ¿ts, doth take away from JeruÅ¿alem, and from Judah, the Å¿tay and the Å¿taff; the whole Å¿tay of bread, and the whole Å¿tay of water; the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient; the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counÅ¿ellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. <hi>And I will give children to be their princes,"</hi> &amp; <hi>c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM my text, thus connected, the doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible, which will be our preÅ¿ent Å¿ubject, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT to be under a weak government, is one of the greateÅ¿t calamities, ever Å¿ent upon a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS, you obÅ¿erve, is here threatened together with drouth and famine in the extremeâ€”a total want of bread and of water; as well as being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of the moÅ¿t eminent men, in every neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry employment: and it is mentioned laÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t enlarged upon, as the conÅ¿ummation of miÅ¿ery.</p>
            <p>BUT, after explaining the calamity deÅ¿igned, and Å¿ome of the principal cauÅ¿es of it, I Å¿hall attend, more particularly, to the proof and illuÅ¿tration of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>THERE are two Å¿enÅ¿es, in which government is Å¿aid to be weak: when it is <hi>unwiÅ¿e;</hi> and when it <hi>wants energy.</hi> The latter is the more extenÅ¿ive Å¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038509_0008_10122C05DFA0C958"/>
of the phraÅ¿e; and it comprehends the former: this, therefore, is the Å¿enÅ¿e now to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered. By a weak government will be meant, one that wants energy; whether through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e by whom it is adminiÅ¿tered, or by any other means.</p>
            <p>To mention, with a little enlargement, Å¿ome of the moÅ¿t common cauÅ¿es of Å¿o great an evil, will not be foreign to the deÅ¿ign of this anniverÅ¿ary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the government of a nation or Å¿tate has not proper energy, may be the fault of its conÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. A form of government may be Å¿uch, that, unleÅ¿s the adminiÅ¿tration of it be arbitrary, it will neceÅ¿Å¿arily be weak.</p>
            <p>To give rulers all that power, and reÅ¿erve to the Å¿ubjects all that liberty, which is beÅ¿t for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a nice point; very difficult, I imagine, to be axactly hit, by the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t of men, and men the moÅ¿t diÅ¿intereÅ¿ted. There is danger of erring, undoubtedly, on either hand; of abridging fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as of limiting authority, more than is for the greateÅ¿t general goodâ€”of adopting a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿titution too deÅ¿potic, as well as one too feeble. But when it is left to the people at large, what govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they will be under, the error moÅ¿t to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, I believe, is on the Å¿ide of inefficiency.</p>
            <p>THE love of liberty is natural to all mankind;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038509_0009_10122C07F7822CB0"/>
and even to birds, and four-footed animals, and creeping things. Of this celebrated virtue, we loÅ¿t nothing by the fall of our firÅ¿t parents. Every one, however depraved in other reÅ¿pects, wiÅ¿hes to be freeâ€”unboundedly free; to have none above him; to be his own Å¿ubject, his own governor, his own judge. And when, for obtaining the advantages of Å¿ocial union, individuals give up to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or to any conÅ¿tituted authorities, a power over their words and actions, their property and lives; they do it with great reluctance, and as Å¿paringly as poÅ¿Å¿ible.</p>
            <p>To obÅ¿erve the extreme reluctance of Å¿ome, OR Å¿uch occaÅ¿ionsâ€”to Å¿ee how Å¿trenuouÅ¿ly they will diÅ¿pute every inch of power, veÅ¿ted any where, which might poÅ¿Å¿ibly be abuÅ¿ed, or turned againÅ¿t themÅ¿elves; is apt to remind one of the cautious policy of certain ancient Pagans, deÅ¿cribed by Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emiah, in regard to their gods. Not only would they have gods of their own making, and made of Å¿uch materials that they muÅ¿t needs be born, becauÅ¿e they could not go; but, as wooden gods could fall and might happen to fall upon the makers of them, or on their children, or valuable furniture; for full Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, they <hi>faÅ¿tened them with nails and with ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</hi> "Be not afraid of them," Å¿ays the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; "for they cannot do evil; neither alÅ¿o is it in them to do good."</p>
            <p>CHECKS, unqueÅ¿tionably, there ought to be, on every department of a free government: But if
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038509_0010_10122C0A1C061668"/>
Å¿uch checks be laid upon rulers, that the ruled are under no check at all, harmleÅ¿s, indeed, will Å¿uch rulers be; but altogether inÅ¿ignificant. TheÅ¿e <hi>Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the people,</hi> muÅ¿t have more power than the <hi>child,</hi> and the <hi>baÅ¿e,</hi> who <hi>proudly</hi> Å¿o call them; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s we would have them miÅ¿erable <hi>gods,</hi> or <hi>miniÅ¿ters of God to us for good</hi>â€”their Å¿cripture titles. They muÅ¿t have authority to puniÅ¿h treaÅ¿onable lies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t themÅ¿elves, as well as Å¿landers againÅ¿t the meaneÅ¿t of their Å¿ubjects; otherwiÅ¿e, who will be afraid of them? Or what protection can they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT the government of a people is too weak, may be the fault of thoÅ¿e betruÅ¿ted with its adminiÅ¿tration. It may be owing to their <hi>weakneÅ¿s;</hi> or to their <hi>indolence,</hi> or Å¿lowneÅ¿s in doing buÅ¿ineÅ¿s; or to their exceÅ¿Å¿ive <hi>lenity;</hi> or to their not being of a virtuous character, or not paying a due attention to the Å¿trict regularity of their own lives. TheÅ¿e particulars, Å¿uffer me curÅ¿orily to go over.</p>
            <p>WHEN the rulers of a land are children; wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in underÅ¿tanding, or in firmneÅ¿s and Å¿tability of mind, we are not certainly to expect that the reins of government will be guided with diÅ¿cretion, and held with Å¿ufficient force. To govern well, at leaÅ¿t in the higher and more difficult offices, conÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theoretic knowledge, Å¿ome experience, and more than common natural powers, are altogether neceÅ¿Å¿ary. And Å¿o is that degree of courage and inflexibility, which will enable a man to maintain

his poÅ¿t, and to perÅ¿evere in what appears to him the plain path of duty; unmoved by noiÅ¿y oppoÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionâ€”undaunted by popular clamorâ€”undiÅ¿mayed by imminent danger.</p>
            <p>To Å¿upport an efficient government, rulers muÅ¿t likewiÅ¿e be men of vigilance and activity. "He that ruleth," Å¿ays an ApoÅ¿tle,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xii. 8.</note>

               </gap> Å¿uperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of indolent men, will reÅ¿emble the field of the Å¿lothful which we read of, that was "all grown over with thorns; the face of it covered with net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and the Å¿tone wall thereof broken down". Or, though rulers be not "Å¿lothful in buÅ¿ineÅ¿s;" they may be Å¿o Å¿low in tranÅ¿acting it, and in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to a termination, as very much to lower the tone, and defeat the Å¿alutary deÅ¿igns, of civil government. When courts of juÅ¿tice are Å¿o dilatory in their deciÅ¿ions, and Å¿uch endleÅ¿s eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, and reviews, are admitted; that a man had better loÅ¿e almoÅ¿t any debt or damage, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a legal proceÅ¿s for a recovery, the protection of law muÅ¿t be lamentably weak.</p>
            <p>EXCESSIVE lenity, will have a Å¿imilar effect. Mercy, is indeed an amiable attribute; to paÅ¿s over a tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, is Å¿aid to be the glory of a man;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038509_0012_10122C0DD8E83880"/>
and being ready to forgive, is a duty much inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the word of God: But in one who Å¿uÅ¿tains any place of authority, whether that of a parent, or maÅ¿ter, or civil magiÅ¿trate; lenity and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence may be carried farther than is the glory o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> duty of a man; unleÅ¿s it be his duty and glory to<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> have no government. Should rulers remit crimes, or paÅ¿s them over without condemnation, when the public good, or righting an injured individual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires their puniÅ¿hment; merciful they might be, but not as our Father in Heaven is merciful.</p>
            <p>LIBERALITY to the poor, out of one's own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods, is a capital chriÅ¿tian virtue; but of the property of other people, judges and law-givers, may poÅ¿Å¿ibly be over liberal. The perÅ¿on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> even of the poor, are not to be reÅ¿pected in judgment. Making proviÅ¿ion by law, for Å¿upporting Å¿uch as are unable to Å¿upport themÅ¿elves, is doubtleÅ¿s very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; but why thoÅ¿e who happen to be the creditors of the poor; who have helped them much already, and Å¿uffered much by their Å¿lackneÅ¿s and breach of promiÅ¿e, Å¿hould be Å¿till obliged to loÅ¿e ten times more for their relief, or for the relief of their families, than others equally able, it is not eaÅ¿y to conceive. And Å¿hould courts of law, or courts of equity, cancel the debts of men, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they plead a preÅ¿ent incapacity to pay them, whether Å¿uch clemency might not too much weaken government, as a Å¿ecurity to every one in his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful claims, may be a queÅ¿tion. Indeed, in any caÅ¿e, to give an inÅ¿olvent debtor a <hi>final</hi> diÅ¿charge from all
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038509_0013_10122C1120FFF7B0"/>
he owes, without the conÅ¿ent of his creditors, looks like giving him a licence to be an unrighteous man. For can it ever be right, or can any court under heaven make it right, for a man not to pay his promiÅ¿ed debts, for value received, when <hi>now</hi> he has money enough, becauÅ¿e <hi>once,</hi> the payment of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> was not in the power of his hands.</p>
            <p>THUS to exonerate of a heavy load of old debts, one deeply inÅ¿olvent, is neceÅ¿Å¿ary, it will be Å¿aid; as without this he could have no courage to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence buÅ¿ineÅ¿s anew. And, no doubt, Å¿uch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected exoneration, will be a mighty encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to extravagant adventurers, who have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loÅ¿e, Å¿ince, by running the greateÅ¿t hazards, with the Å¿lendereÅ¿t chance of immenÅ¿e gain, they riÅ¿k only the property of others. If Å¿ucceÅ¿sful, the profit is their own; if unÅ¿ucceÅ¿sful, the loÅ¿s is their neighbour's. But if the tendency of being thus merciful, were much better than it is; or the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency for it far greater; would it not be doing evil that good may come. "He that ruleth over men muÅ¿t be juÅ¿t"<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxiii. 3.</note> The laws of truth and righteouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, are not noÅ¿es of wax; to be bent any way, as will Å¿uit preÅ¿ent convenience. It is dangerous to break down, or break over, the fixed barrier of eternal juÅ¿tice, on any pretence of temporary neceÅ¿Å¿ity.</p>
            <p>ONE way more was hinted, in which thoÅ¿e who govern, may weaken government; and that is, by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038509_0014_10122C12B0092268"/>
being men of a vicious character; or by not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due attention to the Å¿trict regularity of their own lives. Indeed, "a wicked ruler" is often Å¿trong, and fierce, and active, as "a roaring lion and a ranging bear;" but rarely for the benefit of "the poor people." He will not be eager to pluck the Å¿poil out of the mouth of the fraudulent villain, or the violent oppreÅ¿Å¿or; unleÅ¿s that he may get it into his own. Nor will authority, in the hands of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine men, however it may terrify, be much revered. When the makers or judges of laws, are themÅ¿elves notorious breakers of them, or of the laws of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, government will neceÅ¿Å¿arily fall into contempt. It is alÅ¿o to be obÅ¿erved, that advancing to poÅ¿ts of honor, men of looÅ¿e principles and morals, gives reputation to licentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, and Å¿tamps it as the current faÅ¿hion. Their example will encourage evil doers, more than all the puniÅ¿hments they are likely to inflict, will be a terror to them. "The wicked walk on every Å¿ide when the vileÅ¿t men are exalted."<note n="*" place="bottom">PÅ¿alm xii. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT rulers may be far from being the <hi>vileÅ¿t</hi> men, they may be very good men; and yet, by an incau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious conformity to common practices, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be innocent, they may too much countenance Å¿ome things which are of very hurtful tendency. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to inÅ¿tance in one particular. "It is not for kings," we read, "to drink wine, nor for princes Å¿trong drink."<note n="â€ " place="bottom">Prov. xxxi. 4.</note> And certainly, it is not for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038509_0015_10122C144DC36C18"/>
the lower claÅ¿Å¿es to drink Å¿o much of theÅ¿e as many of them do, if they regard their <hi>health,</hi> or <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> or <hi>peace.</hi> I Å¿elect this inÅ¿tance, becauÅ¿e it is directly pertinent to the main Å¿ubject in hand. Nothing is a greater weakener of governmentâ€”nothing makes the multitude more heady and high-mindedâ€”nothing raiÅ¿es oftener or louder, the cry of <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>equality</hi>â€”nothing more emboldens and inflames that little member, which boaÅ¿teth great things, and Å¿etteth on fire the whole courÅ¿e of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureâ€”nothing, in a word, makes men more inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of governing themÅ¿elves, or of being govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than <hi>Å¿trong drink.</hi> Now, if rulers drink, though not to drunkenneÅ¿s; not Å¿o as quite to "forget the law," or greatly to "pervert the judgment of any;" if they only drink as much as is very univerÅ¿ally cuÅ¿tomary, in polite circles, on great occaÅ¿ions; though they do not hurt themÅ¿elves, they may too much Å¿anction that which will hurt their inferiors. That divine injunction, "Thou Å¿halt not follow a multitude to do evil,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxiii. 2.</note> lies with peculiar weight on civil rulers, as well as religious teachers. They, more than others, are under obligation to <hi>lead</hi> the multitude, in whatÅ¿oever things are Å¿ober, wife and good. They, of all men, are bound in duty to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tain from all appearance of any thing, which, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved upon by bungling eager imitators, might grow into a practice pernicious to Å¿ociety. Nor Å¿hould it be forgotten, that every deviation from rectitude of conduct, leÅ¿Å¿ens the dignity, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038509_0016_10122C166B17A1A8"/>
the authority of greatmen. "Dead flies cauÅ¿e the ointment of theapothecary to Å¿end forth a Å¿tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favor: Å¿o doth a little folly, him that is in rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation for wiÅ¿dom and honor."<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">Eccl. x. 1.</note> But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT weakneÅ¿s of government which is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to any people, is often principally the fault of the people themÅ¿elves. It may be owing to their negligence, or to their caprice and folly, in the choice of their rulers; or it may be owing to their ill-treatment of them when choÅ¿en. A government moÅ¿t excellent in its conÅ¿titution, and moÅ¿t wiÅ¿e, juÅ¿t and firm, in its adminiÅ¿tration, may be enervated, or rendered inadequate, by the ungovernable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of the people: By their revilings and Å¿landersâ€”their haughtineÅ¿s and inÅ¿olenceâ€”their factions and tumults. David once Å¿aid, "I am this day weak, though anointed king; and theÅ¿e men, the Å¿ons of <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> are too hard for me."<note n="Â§" place="bottom">2 Sam. iii. 39.</note>
            </p>
            <p>NOR muÅ¿t it be omitted, that, beÅ¿ides the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate natural cauÅ¿es of a weak government, the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, or general wickedneÅ¿s of a people, may be its procuring cauÅ¿e, as a judgment of heaven. "The moÅ¿t High ruleth in the" nations of men; "and giveth" the dominion over them, "to whom Å¿oever he will."<note n="â€–" place="bottom">Dan. iv. 32.</note> "For promotion cometh neither from the eaÅ¿t, nor from the weÅ¿t, nor from the Å¿outh; but God is the judge; he putteth down one,

and Å¿etteth up another."<note n="Â¶" place="bottom">PÅ¿al. lxxv. 6, 7.</note> When the ways of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pleaÅ¿e the Lordâ€”when they fear Him, and work righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s; among other bleÅ¿Å¿ings, he gives them good governors, under whoÅ¿e able and equitable adminiÅ¿tration, they lead quiet and peaceable lives. On the contrary, when they forget Him, neglect his worÅ¿hip, and diÅ¿regard his word; among other modes of puniÅ¿hment, he takes away their wiÅ¿e and faithful magiÅ¿trates, and gives them weak or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones in their Å¿tead; or leaves them to trample all authority under foot. This was the cauÅ¿e of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities threatened in our text and context. See the eighth verÅ¿e, which concludes the paragraph. "For JeruÅ¿alem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; becauÅ¿e their tongue and their doings are againÅ¿t the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glory."</p>
            <p>LET us now attend, as was propoÅ¿ed, to the proof and illuÅ¿tration of the doctrine laid down: That, of all the calamities ever Å¿ent upon a people, being under a weak government, is one of the moÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable.</p>

And if we conÅ¿ider the matter, it may eaÅ¿ily be Å¿een, that the people of all characters, and not merely the righteous among them, muÅ¿t be in a very wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed condition, Å¿hould government be overturned, or have no coercive force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:038509_0018_10122C1C58CE6338"/>
FIRST; an expoÅ¿edneÅ¿s to all manner of mutual injuries, without redreÅ¿s, is one obvious evil thence ariÅ¿ing. <hi>The people Å¿hall be oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"SURELY oppreÅ¿Å¿ion maketh a wiÅ¿e man mad," is an obÅ¿ervation of the royal preacher.<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">Eccl. vii. 7.</note> And many are the accounts in hiÅ¿tory, of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion's having had this effect on a multitude of men, the wiÅ¿e a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fooliÅ¿h. How often have whole nations raved and raged, like the fierceÅ¿t of animals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the operation of the hydrophobia, at only a diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant apprenÅ¿ion of this terrible evil?</p>
            <p>I AM Å¿enÅ¿ible, it is the dread of oppreÅ¿Å¿ion <hi>from government,</hi> and not of being oppreÅ¿Å¿ed one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, through the <hi>want</hi> or <hi>weakneÅ¿s</hi> of it, that uÅ¿ually occaÅ¿ions this rage, and theÅ¿e ravings. The people are ten times more apt to be afraid of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heavy burdens and grievous reÅ¿traints laid upon them, by the beÅ¿t men in power, than of any thing they might be in danger of Å¿uffering from their equals, however wicked, and however unreÅ¿trained. But what can be the reaÅ¿on of this? Is it becauÅ¿e there is not really as much miÅ¿chief to be feared, from individual, as from public oppreÅ¿Å¿ion? From the oppreÅ¿Å¿ions of the <hi>many,</hi> as of the few? From the unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of millions, let looÅ¿e, as from that of one man, or a Å¿mall number of men?</p>
            <p>THIS, certainly, is not the caÅ¿e; this cannot be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038509_0019_10122C1DE89C5108"/>
the reaÅ¿on. When there is no law, and every one does what he thinks fit, without fear of puniÅ¿hment, the people, I believe, have ever been, and are ever likely to be, much more unhappy than even under a very deÅ¿potic and oppreÅ¿Å¿ive government.</p>
            <p>WHAT then <hi>is</hi> the reaÅ¿on? Why are the people, whoÅ¿e voice is Å¿aid to be the voice of God, Å¿o much more ready to Å¿ound and take an alarm, when threatened with the latter, than with the former of theÅ¿e evils? Why are they Å¿o loud and tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, when their liberties are thought to be in any danger; and Å¿o quiet and eaÅ¿y, when government is rudely attacked, and ready to be overthrown? Why is the Å¿hock of terror Å¿o much greater and more univerÅ¿al, at the remoteÅ¿t proÅ¿pect of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, than at the neareÅ¿t, and moÅ¿t evident approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to total anarchy?â€”There may be Å¿everal reaÅ¿ons.</p>
            <p>ONE, probably, is; when the people are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed by each other, their Å¿ufferings are Å¿eparately felt: Whereas, oppreÅ¿Å¿ion from the higher powers falls upon all in a body. In the former caÅ¿e, every one bears his own different burdens; and divided complaints, though bitter, make but a confuÅ¿ed and feeble murmur: in the latter caÅ¿e, all feel or fear the Å¿ame; all voices, therefore, are united in one tremendous cry.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reaÅ¿on may be; under oppreÅ¿Å¿ion from government, often no other way of relief is Å¿een,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038509_0020_10122C2007D52468"/>
than popular combinations and inÅ¿urrections; but when injuries are done us by individuals, becauÅ¿e there is no government to reÅ¿train them, a remedy is always near and obvious. If every one is oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed, every one can be an oppreÅ¿Å¿or. If a man's neighbours all bite and devour him, he can bite and devour all his neighbours. Hence, a diÅ¿Å¿olution of government, inÅ¿tead of being univerÅ¿ally depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, appears to many, "A conÅ¿ummation devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wiÅ¿hed."</p>
            <p>BUT there is another cauÅ¿e of the wonderful phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon I am accounting for, more influential per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with the moÅ¿t, than both the forementioned. It is owing to charity. A kind of charity, not the excluÅ¿ive glory of modern times; but entirely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to fallen creatures. A kind of charity, which covers a multitude of our own Å¿ins, from our own Å¿ight. A kind of charity which always <hi>begins,</hi> and <hi>ends, at home;</hi> though often extenÅ¿ive in its circuits. From this boaÅ¿ted charity, we are ever inclined to hope all things, and believe all things, in favour of any number, or claÅ¿s, or order of beings, in which we ourÅ¿elves are included. Thus men, naturally think of mankind, more highly than they ought to think. Frenchmen, of the French: Britons, of the BritiÅ¿h: Americans, of the people of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: ThoÅ¿e of every Å¿tate and town, of their own Å¿tate's men and town's men; and men of every cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of their brethren of the Å¿ame occupation, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively conÅ¿idered. In like manner, the common people, think the common people exceedingly hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038509_0021_10122C222FFC1690"/>
harmleÅ¿s, and virtuous; while of thoÅ¿e in power, though of their own chooÅ¿ing, and juÅ¿t choÅ¿en out of all the people, they have not near Å¿o favorable an opinion. That the people Å¿hould have too much liberty, therefore, they are not at all afraid: that rulers will not have checks enough upon them, is all their fear.</p>
            <p>THIS beam, of Å¿elfiÅ¿h liberality of Å¿entiment, it may be impoÅ¿Å¿ible for us to caÅ¿t wholly out of our eye: But that, round the edges of it, we may get Å¿ome glimpÅ¿e of real human nature; I know of no better way than to look upon mankind one by one; or in circles not including ourÅ¿elves. Let us then think of other nations; other Å¿tates; other towns, and neighbourhoods; or of particular perÅ¿ons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our neareÅ¿t neighbours. In this Å¿eparate view, let us Å¿earch and look; let us impartially examine characters.â€”Where do we find a great predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the innocent inoffenÅ¿ive people<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Where do we find a nation, or Å¿tate, or town, or Å¿ociety, except our own, Å¿o very virtuous? Where do we find many individuals, beÅ¿ides ourÅ¿elves, Å¿o juÅ¿t and true, temperate and chaÅ¿te, meek and merciful; Å¿o free from coveteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, pride, envy, revenge, and every unfriendly paÅ¿Å¿ion, that we could live Å¿afe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them, were they at full liberty from all the reÅ¿traints of law and government?</p>
            <p>INDEED, how great an alteration this would make, in the apparent characters of moÅ¿t men, it is difficult to conceive, without the trial. A very partial trial
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038509_0022_10122C2494A80660"/>
of it, for a Å¿hort time, Å¿ome of us have once Å¿een; when it was made lawful to diÅ¿charge pecuniary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, at the rate of a tenth, a twentieth, and even a fiftieth, of the real value juÅ¿tly due. We then had a convincing evidence, that the external juÅ¿tice of our common honeÅ¿t people, is owing to the expected compulÅ¿ion of civil law, much more than to uprightneÅ¿s of heart, or feelings of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience, or any dread of a higher tribunal. From this Å¿pecimen, and from the Å¿acred Å¿tory of the behaviour of the men of Benjamin, relative to the Levite from mount Ephraim, when "there was no king in IÅ¿rael; and every one did that which was right in his own eyes;" we may have Å¿ome faint idea of the horrid Å¿cenes of unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s, lewdneÅ¿s and cruelty, that would every where be acted, were it not for the fear of temporal puniÅ¿hment. From all that we have read of the deÅ¿truction of mankind by one another, when ever they are at liberty; and from recent indiÅ¿putable information of the Å¿hock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿tate of things, where government has been overturned; we may well believe that the Å¿cripture accounts of the depravity of men, are no exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Not even the following: "Their throat is an open Å¿epulchre; with their tongues they have uÅ¿ed deceit; the poiÅ¿on of aÅ¿ps is under their lips; whoÅ¿e mouth is full of curÅ¿ing and bitterneÅ¿s; their feet are Å¿wift to Å¿hed blood. DeÅ¿truction and miÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are in their ways, and the way of peace have they not known."<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 13â€”17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:038509_0023_10122C27048224F0"/>
But if this be a true portrait of fallen men, when left to themÅ¿elves, how much are we indebted to the reÅ¿traint laid upon them, for the little peace we enjoy? And may we not well be convinced, that all the terror of the civil Å¿word, in the moÅ¿t faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Å¿kilful hands, will not be more than enough to reÅ¿train from iniquity, Å¿uch a race of beings, Å¿o that they may dwell together, not in unity, as breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, but with any tolerable Å¿afety? EÅ¿pecially if, as is added to finiÅ¿h the above picture, "There is no fear of God before their eyes?" And that this laÅ¿t trait, is Å¿till a part of the character of many, is abundantly evident, both from their avowed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and open practices, Now this being the caÅ¿e, that while the hearts of men are fully Å¿et in them to do evil, they have no fear of the God of heaven to reÅ¿train them; were it not for the dread of gods on earth, our civil rulers, what Å¿ecurity Å¿hould we have, for our names, or property, or lives? If we had no other evil to apprehend, from weakneÅ¿s of government, than only this, of lying open to all manner of mutual oppreÅ¿Å¿ions, Å¿lander, frauds and violences; it would, even then, be evidently one of the greateÅ¿t calamities that could befal a people.</p>
            <p>BUT a Å¿econd evil, Å¿ome what diÅ¿tinct, and worthy of Å¿ome notice, is Å¿uggeÅ¿ted in our text: No one in a Å¿ubordinate Å¿tation would keep his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er place, or treat his Å¿uperiors with Å¿uitable reÅ¿pect. <hi>The child Å¿hall behave himÅ¿elf proudly againÅ¿t the ancient, and the baÅ¿e againÅ¿t the honorable.</hi>

SOLOMON Å¿ays, "There is an evil which I have Å¿een under the Å¿un, as an error that proceedeth from the ruler: Folly is Å¿et in great dignity, and the rich in low place. I have Å¿een Å¿ervants riding upon horÅ¿es, and princes walking as Å¿ervants upon the earth."<note n="â€ " place="bottom">Eccl. x. 5, 6, 7.</note> When authority fails, or is obÅ¿tructed, at the fountain head, its remoteÅ¿t Å¿treams muÅ¿t, in a little time, run low. If parents will not obey magiÅ¿trates, children will be diÅ¿obedient to parents; if maÅ¿ters refuÅ¿e Å¿ubjection to the higher powers, their Å¿ervants and apprentices will Å¿oon pay as little regard to their injunctions. Thus this evil proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the ruler; or from his not being able to rule. And a Å¿erious evil it certainly is. By Å¿uperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, in every degree, it will Å¿oon be very Å¿enÅ¿ibly felt. They will have none to fear them, none to honor them, none over whom they can have any command. Inferiors, of the very loweÅ¿t grade, may exult, for a while, in Å¿uch aeras of freedom; and think them glorious times. But even to theÅ¿eâ€”to the child and the baÅ¿e, this turning of things upÅ¿ide down, generally proves fatal in the end. Being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no control, they Å¿pend their time in idleneÅ¿s; waÅ¿te their Å¿ubÅ¿tance, if they have any, in riotous living; have recourÅ¿e to pilfering, gambling, and every hazardous expedient, to Å¿upport their extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agances, and by various fooliÅ¿h and hurtful practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Å¿oon plunge themÅ¿elves into irrecoverable wretchedneÅ¿s and ruin.</p>

THERE is yet a third capital evil, ariÅ¿ing from too weak a government, which, though not mentioned in our text, Å¿hould be briefly noticed, when treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Å¿ubject at large. A community in Å¿uch a Å¿ituation, will be able to make little defence againÅ¿t a foreign enemy. Like the people of LaiÅ¿h, who had no magiÅ¿trate in the land to put them to Å¿hame in any thing; they will be an eaÅ¿y prey to any hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of enterpriÅ¿ing invaders. No reÅ¿ources can be drawn forthâ€”no navies furniÅ¿hedâ€”no armies raiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Å¿uppliedâ€”no fortifications erected and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿oned, without energy in government. What Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omon Å¿ays of a man that has no rule over his own Å¿pirit, holds equally true of an ungoverned nation: it "is as a city that is broken down, and without walls."</p>
            <p>THE doctrine, I conceive, needs no farther il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luÅ¿tration or proof. It only remains, that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to point out Å¿ome uÅ¿eful inferences from it, applicable to our own times, and to the preÅ¿ent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE holy Å¿criptures may hence be vindicated, in their being Å¿o much on the Å¿ide of government; and no more favorable to the inÅ¿urrection of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors.</p>
            <p>ON theÅ¿e topics, it muÅ¿t be acknowledged, the Å¿pirit of the goÅ¿pel, as well as of the old teÅ¿tament, is Å¿omewhat different from the Å¿pirit that worketh in the children of diÅ¿obedience, among whom we have
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038509_0026_1012274832AE4610"/>
all had our converÅ¿ation. Our Saviour "went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good, and healing all that were oppreÅ¿Å¿ed of the devil;" but under the politcal oppreÅ¿Å¿ions of the Jews, his countrymen, he Å¿eemed not much to Å¿ympathize with them. When it hurt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ciences to pay tribute to a foreign power, and they aÅ¿ked him whether it were lawful; his anÅ¿wer was, "Render to CaeÅ¿ar, the things that are CaeÅ¿ar's, and to God, the things that are God's." He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tantly preached peace, meekneÅ¿s, humility and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion. His apoÅ¿tles in like manner, taught children to obey and honor their parents: and Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to be "Å¿ubject to their own maÅ¿ters, with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but alÅ¿o to the froward." And, inÅ¿tead of animating their numerous proÅ¿elytes, at Crete, at Rome, and all over the world, to riÅ¿e in arms againÅ¿t theÅ¿e rulers of the earth who were their unrighteous and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful perÅ¿ecutors; they would have them "put in mind to be Å¿ubject to principalities and powers, to obey magiÅ¿trates:<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. iii. 1.</note> they exhorted them to "Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themÅ¿elves to every ordinance of man, for the Lord's Å¿ake;"<note n="â€ " place="bottom">a Pet. ii. 13.</note> and told them, "WhoÅ¿oever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿teth the power, reÅ¿iÅ¿teth the ordinance of God; and they that reÅ¿iÅ¿t Å¿hall receive to themÅ¿elves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation."<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 2.</note>

            <p>AT this diÅ¿tance of time, and after Å¿o many rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olutions, Å¿uch paÅ¿Å¿ages as theÅ¿e may Å¿eem hard Å¿ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to Å¿ome <hi>good Å¿oldiers,</hi> even of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. No wonder that the inculcators of Å¿o much pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038509_0027_10122C2D4C0A3EB0"/>
of Å¿pirit, Å¿hould be rejected with Å¿corn, and treated with Å¿currility, in this "age of reaÅ¿on." We are not to wonder, were there no other cauÅ¿e, that infidelity Å¿hould exceedingly increaÅ¿e, in theÅ¿e times of "illumination."</p>
            <p>To the <hi>Å¿piritually</hi> minded ChriÅ¿tian, however, it will readily occur, in favour of the author and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿her of our faith, and his firÅ¿t miniÅ¿ters, that the great object they had in view, was to Å¿ave the <hi>Å¿ouls</hi> of men; and that, teaching them to be meek and lowly in heart, poor in Å¿pirit, and contented in whatÅ¿oever Å¿tate they were, was better adapted to this deÅ¿ign; than filling the heads of inferiors with exalted notions of the equal "rights of man;" in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming their hearts with pride and angry paÅ¿Å¿ions; and throwing families into envying and Å¿trife, and nations into the convulÅ¿ions of civil war; till every one can be as free as the freeÅ¿t, and as high as the higheÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>BUT, leaving <hi>things eternal</hi> out of the queÅ¿tion; according to the Å¿ubject to which we have now been attending, if the preachers and penmen of the New-TeÅ¿tament had aimed only to promote the <hi>temporal</hi> happineÅ¿s, of only the <hi>lower claÅ¿Å¿es</hi> of mankind, they would have done wiÅ¿ely in writing and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on the duties of Å¿ubordination, exactly as they did. Never can there be peace on earth, or any Å¿afety among men, while children are allowed to riÅ¿e up againÅ¿t their parents, Å¿ervants againÅ¿t their maÅ¿ters, and Å¿ubjects againÅ¿t their civil rulers, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038509_0028_10122C2EE90AED70"/>
they think differently from them, or diÅ¿like their government. Thus to make the child, the governor of his governors, and the baÅ¿e, the judge of his judges, is the certain way to endleÅ¿s confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, in all human Å¿ocieties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF the doctrine inÅ¿iÅ¿ted on be true, it follows, that a ready Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to all thoÅ¿e burdens which are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the Å¿upport of good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and for national defence, is the wiÅ¿dom, as well as duty of any people.</p>
            <p>THE apoÅ¿tle to the Romans, having Å¿aid, "The powers that be are ordained of God;" having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved that the benevolent end of their ordination was the good of the people; and, on theÅ¿e grounds, having enjoined Å¿ubjection to them, he adds; "For this cauÅ¿e pay ye <hi>tribute</hi> alÅ¿o: for they are God's miniÅ¿ters, attending continually upon this very thing."</p>
            <p>PUBLIC expenÅ¿es are apt to appear to many, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ively high: but, perhaps, they do not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ider the real occaÅ¿ion there is for great expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in a nation or Å¿tate of any magnitude.</p>
            <p>IN order to the Å¿upport of good government, many rulers, of high and low degree, are abÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceÅ¿Å¿ary. And it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that thoÅ¿e who occupy the higher offices, Å¿hould be men of Å¿upe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior knowledge, and uncommon natural abilities: Å¿uch knowledge as is not eaÅ¿ily acquired, and Å¿uch
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038509_0029_10122C3192D4D0E8"/>
abilities as might procure them a plentiful income in other occupations. If the <hi>bramble,</hi> or the <hi>Å¿hrub oak,</hi> were adequate to rule over the trees, a cheap government might be expected; but if the <hi>vine,</hi> the <hi>fig-tree,</hi> and the <hi>olive-tree,</hi> muÅ¿t be promoted; we are not to think that theÅ¿e will leave their <hi>rich fruits;</hi> their <hi>Å¿weetneÅ¿s,</hi> and <hi>fatneÅ¿s,</hi> without a Å¿uita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compenÅ¿ation.â€”BeÅ¿ides, rulers of high rank, muÅ¿t be at no inconÅ¿iderable expenÅ¿e, to Å¿upport the proper dignity of their Å¿tations. It is alÅ¿o to be taken into the account, that the duties of thoÅ¿e who rule well, and attend continually upon this very thing, are not only exceedingly laborious, but that Å¿ome parts of the eÅ¿Å¿ential Å¿ervices they have to render muÅ¿t be very diÅ¿agreeable; if they have any compaÅ¿Å¿ionate Å¿enÅ¿ibility. The execution of deÅ¿erved vengeance, is Å¿aid to be <hi>God's Å¿trange</hi> work; as being, in itÅ¿elf, moÅ¿t oppoÅ¿ite to One whoÅ¿e nature is <hi>love,</hi> and who <hi>delighteth</hi> in mercy. And, doubtleÅ¿s, that puniÅ¿hment of evil doers, for which earthly rulers are appointed, and which the public good requires, muÅ¿t be really painful to the feelings of humanity; more painful, in many caÅ¿es, than the amputation of limbs, and other high operations in Å¿urgery, for which, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as well as becauÅ¿e of the Å¿uperior Å¿kill and great care requiÅ¿ite, an ample fee to the operator is thought reaÅ¿onable. Moreover; thoÅ¿e who Å¿tand in elevated Å¿tations, are the marks of obloquy, and expoÅ¿ed to many danger, much more than men on the level ground of private life. All theÅ¿e things well weighed, the equitable reward of governors,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038509_0030_10122C3443F4F080"/>
and the neceÅ¿Å¿ary coÅ¿t of Å¿upporting good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muÅ¿t be no inconÅ¿iderable burden on the people.</p>
            <p>IN order to national defence, againÅ¿t hoÅ¿tilities from abroad, Å¿till heavier expenÅ¿es are often indiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penÅ¿ible. In perilous times, there muÅ¿t be armies and fleets, forts and garriÅ¿ons. At the firÅ¿t out Å¿et, more eÅ¿pecially, when all theÅ¿e things are to be new-created, to a people unuÅ¿ed to Å¿uch vaÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures, they will naturally appear enormous; and very eaÅ¿ily may a popular clamor be raiÅ¿ed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t them. It is poÅ¿Å¿ible, indeed, that more may be laid out in theÅ¿e ways, many times, than the public exigences require; but of this, few of the complainers are competent to judge. A nation that has an extended coaÅ¿t, and an extenÅ¿ive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to defend, had better be at immenÅ¿e charges for the Å¿ecurity of theÅ¿e, than lie open to thoÅ¿e Å¿poliations and invaÅ¿ions, to which, without arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when all the world is at war, they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably be expoÅ¿ed.</p>
            <p>To provide both for the internal and external Å¿afety of a numerous people, the burdens laid upon them muÅ¿t often be heavy. TheÅ¿e are evils to be lamented; but in the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of mankind, they are neceÅ¿Å¿ary for the prevention of far greater evils; and Å¿hould therefore be Å¿ubmitted to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out murmuring.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE preceding obÅ¿ervations may Å¿uggeÅ¿t to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038509_0031_10122C35D288F308"/>
us, Å¿ome peculiar advantages of a republican form of government.<note n="*" place="bottom">This inference was paÅ¿Å¿ed over in the delivery.</note>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER every form, there muÅ¿t be orders and degrees; Å¿ome muÅ¿t bear rule, and others be Å¿ubject to tribute. Under every form, there will be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, impoÅ¿ts, exciÅ¿es, and perhaps direct taxation. All for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> of government, however, are not equal. Much advantage hath the republican, many ways.</p>
            <p>ONE advantage is, that the people may always have good rulers, unleÅ¿s it be their own fault. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a monarchy, or an ariÅ¿tocracy, let the body of the people be ever Å¿o virtuous, and ever Å¿o vigilant, they may have children for their princes, and babes to rule over them. When power is hereditary, in kings or nobles, not only is there a riÅ¿k of having the higheÅ¿t Å¿eats of government filled by minors; but, if this Å¿hould not happen, the hazard is great, that thoÅ¿e who inherit the firÅ¿t offices of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will frequently be men of not much knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, or of not much virtue. But in elective gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, where the people at large are the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and eÅ¿pecially where the elections are frequent, they may always have wiÅ¿e and faithful men in all places of authority; if Å¿uch are to be found, and if Å¿uch they chooÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>IT may next be obÅ¿erved; that in republican governments, there is the leaÅ¿t occaÅ¿ion for illegal
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038509_0032_10122C37619630B8"/>
aÅ¿Å¿ociations, or popular tumults, to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreÅ¿s of grievances. If there be any mal-adminiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, or any fault in the conÅ¿titution, a remedy is provided, without diÅ¿turbing the public peace.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER advantage muÅ¿t not be forgotten, which is very great: under this free form of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, the intereÅ¿ts of rulers and Å¿ubjects are Å¿o blendedâ€”Å¿o the Å¿ame, that the former cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿s the latter, without equally oppreÅ¿Å¿ing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves. In an abÅ¿olute monarchy, the king; and in an ariÅ¿tocracy, the nobles, may "bind heavy burdens, and lay them on men's Å¿houlders," with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being obliged to "touch them themÅ¿elves with one of their fingers:" but in democracies, the higheÅ¿t magiÅ¿trates are Å¿ubject to the Å¿ame laws, the Å¿ame duties, the Å¿ame taxes, which they impoÅ¿e upon others. At leaÅ¿t. thoÅ¿e who this year bear rule, the next election may be under law, under tribute. This is a great Å¿ecurity againÅ¿t their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing unrighteous decrees, and writing grievous things.</p>
            <p>LASTLY; repreÅ¿entative rulers feel themÅ¿elves Å¿o dependent on the people, for their continuance in office, that they are not likely to grow haughty and unreaÅ¿onably over-bearing, as thoÅ¿e naturally will, who have no Å¿uch dependence.</p>
            <p>THESE are Å¿ome of the peculiar advantages of a republican government. But then, it is to be well
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038509_0033_10122C3AE6E40630"/>
remembered, that the beÅ¿t things may become the worÅ¿t for us, by being abuÅ¿ed. To render demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic governments Å¿table and happy, it is highly neceÅ¿Å¿ary that the people Å¿hould be wiÅ¿e; virtuous, peaceable, and eaÅ¿ily governed. For want of theÅ¿e requiÅ¿ites, republics have often been, like "man that is born of a woman, of few days, and full of trouble."</p>
            <p n="4">4. IN the more particular application of our Å¿ubject, we are naturally led to a view and convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of our own mercies, and privileges, and proÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, and duties.</p>
            <p>THAT the paÅ¿t mercies of Heaven towards this country, have been Å¿ingularly great, every pious obÅ¿erver will be ready devoutly to acknowledge. I have reference, chiefly, to political mercies; or thoÅ¿e which relate to civil liberty and government. Hardly another inÅ¿tance can be found, I believe, in all hiÅ¿tory, of a people's enjoying both theÅ¿e bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings jointly, in Å¿o high a degree, for Å¿o great a length of time, as they have been enjoyed by Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of theÅ¿e united Å¿tates; and by this Å¿tate, in particular. The people of Connecticut, from the beginning, have invariably choÅ¿en their chief ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿trates, and general aÅ¿Å¿embly; and they have had a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of good governors far beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lot of mankind. Our "officers have been peace, and our exactors righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s," with as few exceptions, perhaps, as ever were known in any part of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:038509_0034_10122C3CF89707B0"/>
OR, if we confine the retroÅ¿pect, within the compaÅ¿s of the laÅ¿t five and twenty years; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it to the whole union, how wonderful have been the Å¿alvations granted us! In this period, we have paÅ¿Å¿ed through the Red Sea of a revolutiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry war; in which our then friends and coadjutors, aÅ¿Å¿aying to follow us, as moÅ¿t who ever attempted it before us, have been drowned. Here, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what uÅ¿ually happens, on Å¿uch occaÅ¿ions, we had guides eminent for prudence, Å¿tability, coolneÅ¿s, and unconquerable perÅ¿everance. And <hi>one,</hi> Å¿uper-eminent for all thoÅ¿e; by the integrity of whoÅ¿e heart, and the Å¿kilfulneÅ¿s of whoÅ¿e hands, we were led like a flock, in Å¿afety, far Å¿urpaÅ¿Å¿ing all rational expectation. We have alÅ¿o paÅ¿Å¿ed, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, thro the howling wilderneÅ¿s of an almoÅ¿t na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional anarchy: where were pits, and Å¿corpions, and fiery flying Å¿erpents. Here again, our great men, with <hi>the greateÅ¿t of all</hi> at their head, in a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, formed and recommended our preÅ¿ent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable conÅ¿titution. And our wiÅ¿eÅ¿t counÅ¿ellors and moÅ¿t eloquent orators, in every Å¿tate, Å¿training every nerve, procured its adoption; whereby we were Å¿aved, when on the brink of diÅ¿Å¿olution. That Å¿uch men were raiÅ¿ed up, and put forward, in theÅ¿e times of need; and their way made proÅ¿perous; was certainly "the Lord's doing, and ought to be marvellous in our eyes," In either of theÅ¿e perils, "it was of the Lord's mercies that we were not conÅ¿umed."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:038509_0035_10122C3E8BC8BD28"/>
AND as paÅ¿t mercies, Å¿o our preÅ¿ent privileges, are Å¿ingular, and Å¿uch as deÅ¿erve a very grateful acknowledgment. While many other nations are Å¿uffering the ravages of a moÅ¿t furious war, Å¿till likely to be carried on with redoubled rage; we enjoy the ineÅ¿timable bleÅ¿Å¿ings of peace. While moÅ¿t other nations are under the dominion of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary kings and nobles, Å¿uch as they happen to be born and educated, whether virtuous or vicious, wiÅ¿e men or fools; we have rulers from the higheÅ¿t to the loweÅ¿t, of our own election. While one oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nation, great and highly civilized, after Å¿wimming in Å¿eas of blood for eight years, and after nearly as many revolutions, in a violent conteÅ¿t for liberty and equality, has at laÅ¿t, nothing more of either than the empty name, we poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿s the reality of both, as far as is conÅ¿iÅ¿tent with any order or Å¿afety.</p>
            <p>OUR national expenÅ¿es are neceÅ¿Å¿arily great: but the burden of them is laid, as much as poÅ¿Å¿ible, on thoÅ¿e moÅ¿t able to bear it; among whom, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ers, being of the richer claÅ¿s, have taken a large proportion on themÅ¿elves. In the nation, and in this Å¿tate, the policy of government, certainly, is not to "grind the face of the poor." The mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and gentleneÅ¿s of our adminiÅ¿tration, it appears to me, is generally very great; and, in regard to its wiÅ¿dom and firmneÅ¿s, conÅ¿idering the times, I think it deÅ¿erving of much applauÅ¿e. ReÅ¿pecting rulers, certainly our condition, hitherto, is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that deÅ¿cribed and threatened in our text.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:038509_0036_10122C40F48CB688"/>
SUCH <hi>have been</hi> our mercies; Å¿uch <hi>are</hi> our priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges. What then are our proÅ¿pects?â€”Not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether fair and promiÅ¿ing, after all. As in the bleÅ¿Å¿ings of heaven, and the abuÅ¿e of theÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ings, there is a Å¿triking reÅ¿emblance between us, and the land of Judah and inhabitants of JeruÅ¿alem, at the time of this prophecy, to which we have been attending; Å¿o, in the Å¿equel, it is poÅ¿Å¿ible there may be a Å¿imilitude. Our mountain is not yet Å¿o Å¿trong, that we have reaÅ¿on, from any quarter, to Å¿ay in our proÅ¿perity, we Å¿hall never be moved.</p>
            <p>SOME may flatter themÅ¿elves, that, although other republics have frequently been tumultuous, and of Å¿hort continuance; ours will be peaceful and permanent, becauÅ¿e of the greater knowledge and virtue of the people.</p>
            <p>IT is true, in this part of the union at leaÅ¿t, "We know that we all have knowledge." But, I doubt, we have more of the "knowledge which puffeth up," than of that knowledge which promiÅ¿es "Å¿tability of times." It is true, we have the light of the goÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and were we diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to be guided by this light, we need not fear the fate of ancient republics, that were bewildered in Pagan darkneÅ¿s. But, in matters relative to government and Å¿ubordination; too many chooÅ¿e to take their inÅ¿tructions from Heathen philoÅ¿ophy, rather than from the oracles of God. And as the knowledge, Å¿o the virtue, of even this happy country, exceedingly wants to be ChriÅ¿tianized. It is true, our "charity abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:"
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:038509_0037_10122C431168CD68"/>
but I am afraid we have not much of that charity which is "the bond of perfectneÅ¿s, or the bond of peace."</p>
            <p>PERHAPS Å¿ome good people are ready to think, we may Å¿afely "truÅ¿t in God; who hath delivered, and doth deliver, that he will yet deliver us." And had we rendered according to the benefits done us, indeed, we might thus Å¿ecurely truÅ¿t. But has this been the caÅ¿e? On the contrary, have we not Å¿inned more and more, Å¿ince the almoÅ¿t miraculous deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erances granted us?

Have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and all manner of looÅ¿e principles, and immoral practices, abounded in all parts of the land, Å¿ince the revolution, and our happy independence, more than at any former period?â€”Shall we then "lean upon the Lord, and Å¿ay, Is not the Lord among us? no evil can come upon us?"<note n="*" place="bottom">Micah iii. 11.

WHEN we read Å¿uch Å¿olemn divine admonitions as theÅ¿e, and conÅ¿ider our own ways and doings, can we confidently expect the continued Å¿miles and protection of the holy governor of the world? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of this, may not our fleÅ¿h well tremble for fear of him? Have we not reaÅ¿on to be afraid of his avenging judgments?</p>
            <p>AND has he not already begun to teÅ¿tify his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure againÅ¿t us, in Å¿ome terrible inÅ¿tances? For Å¿everal years paÅ¿t, our capital towns and cities have been Å¿orely viÅ¿ited with a waÅ¿ting peÅ¿tilence; little, if at all known before, in theÅ¿e parts. And now, very lately, a moÅ¿t awful breach has been made upon us; and of the very Å¿ame kind threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in our context to JeruÅ¿alem and Judah. <hi>For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hoÅ¿ts, hath taken away from America, the STAY and the STAFF:â€”the MIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY MAN, and the MAN OF WAR. The judge, and the PRUDENT, and the ancient: The CAPTAIN of all our armies, and our MOST HONORABLE MAN.</hi> All theÅ¿e, in <hi>one;</hi> by a Å¿udden and Å¿urpriÅ¿ing Å¿troke, hath the <hi>Lord taken away.</hi> The man who "fought for us, and adventured his life for, and delivered us." The man who gave Å¿yÅ¿tem to our diÅ¿tracted affairs; united our broken confederacy; and long guided our difficult courÅ¿e, between the whirlpools of European wars. The man, but for whom, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poÅ¿Å¿ibly, we Å¿hould now have been wretched, conquered, rebel colonies; inÅ¿tead of triumphant, free, independent Å¿tates; and but for whom, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, we might have been as a roap of Å¿and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:038509_0039_10122C47373291C8"/>
of a Å¿trong united nation:â€”The man to whom we are thus indebtedâ€”on whom we were thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, IS NO MORE.</p>
            <p>WHAT farther public calamities the Å¿udden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaÅ¿e of this great Saviour of his country may por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, God only knows. We have reaÅ¿on to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that as he was ever proÅ¿perous in life, Å¿o his death, for him, was favorably timed; that he was taken out of the way of evils to come; great evils coming on a land moÅ¿t dear to him; which he could only have Å¿een, to his inexpreÅ¿Å¿ible Å¿orrow of heart, without being able to prevent. This leÅ¿Å¿on, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we are plainly and moÅ¿t impreÅ¿Å¿ively taught, by a Providence which has clothed a continent in mourning; that <hi>Gods</hi> on earth muÅ¿t <hi>die like men.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">PÅ¿al. lxxxii. 6, 7.

We have many great and good men, yet Å¿pared to us; nor are we without one, at the head of our national government, who, I preÅ¿ume, has the high vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the beÅ¿t judges, and their cordial prayers that he may long live; and long fill the important Å¿tation which he now poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es. But <hi>his</hi> breath is in his noÅ¿trils; and Å¿o is the breath of every other man, moÅ¿t accounted of; in the nation, or in the Å¿tate, Nor is natural death, the only way whereby our remaining firm pillars, may be removed.</p>

AND if we conÅ¿ider the Å¿pirit that now worketh, well may we be apprehenÅ¿ive of unhappy changes; and of all the evils threatened in our text. Some of theÅ¿e, we already experience. Though God hath not given children to be our princes, nor many bad men, we hope, to rule over us; yet the people are oppreÅ¿Å¿ed one by another, in a degree, I believe, beyond what has been uÅ¿ual heretofore. And certainly it is a remarkable day, for the child's behaving himÅ¿elf proudly againÅ¿t the ancient, and the baÅ¿e againÅ¿t the honorable. Nor is this to be wondered at. Of Å¿uch Å¿cenes as we have lately paÅ¿Å¿ed through, it is the natural conÅ¿equence. In revolutionary times, all expreÅ¿Å¿ions of reÅ¿pect are wont to be laid aÅ¿ide, or the application of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ed. The great leÅ¿Å¿ons inculcated on youth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tead of modeÅ¿ty, dutifulneÅ¿s and Å¿ubordination; are boldneÅ¿s, Å¿elf-Å¿ufficiency, and Å¿elf-importance. Children, too young to read the bible, or to be taught their catechiÅ¿m, are mounted on the Å¿tage, to act the orator, the patriot and politician: while the parents, the aged and the wiÅ¿e, Å¿it or Å¿tand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round in low place, wonder and applaud. <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿ius,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ot <hi>JeÅ¿us</hi> nor <hi>Paul, Peter</hi> nor <hi>John,</hi>) are the great models and inÅ¿tructors, of the riÅ¿ing generation of ChriÅ¿tians. Such things as theÅ¿e, <hi>we</hi> have Å¿een; and the effects of them, we Å¿till Å¿adly feel. Habits of Å¿ubordination, always painful to human pride; when once effaced, or much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, are not eaÅ¿ily reÅ¿tored. On the other hand, habits of haughtineÅ¿s and diÅ¿obedience, always
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:038509_0041_10122C4BB05ECC18"/>
congenial to the human heart; when once imbibed, naturally increaÅ¿e to more ungovernableneÅ¿s. One point of freedom gained, another is Å¿truggled for with the greater ardor. LicentiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, like the grave, never Å¿ays, "It is enough."</p>
            <p>IN this Å¿tate, though not near Å¿o free as Å¿ome, great liberties are enjoyed. We have liberty to do every thing that we ought; and a great many things that we ought not. In matters of religion, our liberties are almoÅ¿t unbounded. We may Å¿ell, buy and read, what <hi>books</hi> we pleaÅ¿e: the beÅ¿t, or the moÅ¿t atheiÅ¿tical and blaÅ¿phemous. We may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip what <hi>god</hi> we chooÅ¿e: a juÅ¿t God, or one who has no juÅ¿tice for men to fear. Every <hi>creature,</hi> has equal liberty to preach the goÅ¿pel: and to preach what goÅ¿pel he thinks proper. ThoÅ¿e who perÅ¿uade men by the terrors of the Lord, to Å¿tand in awe, and not Å¿in; and thoÅ¿e who embolden men in all manner of iniquity, by aÅ¿Å¿urances of no wrath to come, have equal encouragement. Any people may make the firmeÅ¿t legal contract for the Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of what miniÅ¿ter they will; and any number, or all of them, may break it when they will.â€”In civil matters, our liberty is a little more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cribed; yet, in theÅ¿e, we have a good deal of el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room, to do wrong, as well as right. We may honor all men, or defame the moÅ¿t dignified and worthy characters. We may Å¿peak the truth, or aÅ¿Å¿ert and propagate falÅ¿ehoods. Men may fulfil their promiÅ¿es, or not fulfil them; pay their debts, or never pay them, without any reÅ¿traint, or much
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038509_0042_10122C4E5392E510"/>
danger of compulÅ¿ion. All theÅ¿e liberties, and a thouÅ¿and others, if not explicitly by law allowed; are taken, very freely by many, in their worÅ¿t lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude; and taken with impunity, in a multitude of inÅ¿tances.</p>
            <p>YET, with all this, numbers among ourÅ¿elves, and much greater numbers in the freer Å¿tates, it is Å¿aid, are not Å¿atisfied; but are Å¿triving, by calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and by intrigues, for new revolutions Å¿till further to weaken government. That Å¿ome men might wiÅ¿h to have their own hands and tongues at greater liberty, provided their neighbours and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could be kept faÅ¿t bound, may eaÅ¿ily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: but how any man, on the leaÅ¿t Å¿ober re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, Å¿hould be willing that all others Å¿hould be under leÅ¿s reÅ¿traint than they now are, appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moÅ¿t inconceivable. One would have thought, that the tragedy Å¿o long exhibited on the great European theatre of confuÅ¿ion, and eÅ¿pecially the laÅ¿t Å¿cene; muÅ¿t have opened the eyes of the moÅ¿t blind; and obliged them to Å¿ee, that overturning and overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a view to break all bonds of Å¿ociety aÅ¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is not the way to public happineÅ¿s, or perÅ¿onal Å¿afety. NevertheleÅ¿s, this Å¿eems not to have been the caÅ¿e. A majority of the people, however, it may be preÅ¿umed, are convinced, that our greateÅ¿t immediate danger, is of having too little govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not too little liberty.</p>
            <p>NOR are our <hi>duties,</hi> if we have this conviction, hard to be underÅ¿tood. Were we in earneÅ¿t diÅ¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038509_0043_10122C4FE012BD38"/>
to Å¿tand in the ways, and Å¿ee, and aÅ¿k for the old paths, where is the good way? And would we walk therein, reÅ¿t might be found; and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened evils now Å¿poken of, be prevented.</p>
            <p>IF we would not have the child behave himÅ¿elf proudly againÅ¿t the ancient, and the baÅ¿e againÅ¿t the honorable, greater attention Å¿hould be paid to the Å¿chooling and government of the riÅ¿ing generation. Some attempt towards a reform in this matter has already been made, under the auÅ¿pices of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aÅ¿Å¿embly: and, as far as I have had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to obÅ¿erve, it has been attended with encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging effects. It is neceÅ¿Å¿ary that thoÅ¿e juÅ¿t weaned from the breaÅ¿t, Å¿hould have line upon line, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon precept; and it is of importance what thoÅ¿e lines and precepts are. Little ones Å¿hould be learnt their letters, at leaÅ¿t; if not a few lines of the New-TeÅ¿tament, before they are learnt to be Grecian and Roman orators and patriots. They Å¿hould be learnt a little modeÅ¿ty, and a little man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, before they are learnt to govern the nation. They Å¿hould be made <hi>good children,</hi> before we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make them <hi>great men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF our legiÅ¿lators would prevent our being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ed every one by another, the old and good way is, to have a code of laws, as Å¿hort and plain as poÅ¿Å¿ible, and Å¿uitably inforced. ObÅ¿olete laws; and laws the only tendency of which is to evade, or needleÅ¿sly delay, the operation of juÅ¿tice; I Å¿hould think, ought to be repealed. And certainly great
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:038509_0044_10122746AE17C630"/>
care Å¿hould be taken, by the appointment of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and faithful judiciary and informing officers, that the laws unrepealed be duly executed.</p>
            <p>IF our judges of courts, would keep us from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ing, or being oppreÅ¿Å¿ed, they Å¿hould cauÅ¿e "judgment to run down as waters, and righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s as a mighty Å¿tream." They Å¿hould Å¿ee that the old complaint in IÅ¿aiah;<note n="â€ " place="bottom">Chap. lix. 14.</note> Judgment is turned away backward, and juÅ¿tice Å¿tandeth afar off; truth is fallen in the Å¿treet, and equity cannot enter," be not applicable to ourÅ¿elves. They Å¿hould Å¿ee, if poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ible, that their judgment Å¿eats be not environed with Å¿o high piles of voluminous fortifications, and Å¿uch numerous garriÅ¿ons, armed at all points, and able to defend any thing, that right can hardly be obtained, in the plaineÅ¿t cauÅ¿e, without a Å¿iege, as long, and as coÅ¿tly, as the Å¿iege of <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the freemenâ€”the fountain of power, would Å¿trengthen government, or guard againÅ¿t its being farther weakened; they Å¿hould be very punctual in attending their legal meetings, and very careful for whom they give in their Å¿uffrages, as members of AÅ¿Å¿embly, or of CongreÅ¿s. They Å¿hould Å¿ee that they do not vote for weak men, however honeÅ¿t; nor for vicious men, however capable; nor for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing men, who are crowding themÅ¿elves forward by every popular artifice: who underÅ¿tand perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all the duties and faults of their Å¿uperiors, but
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:038509_0045_10122C542FC94AA8"/>
Å¿ee no beam in their own eye, and never mind their own buÅ¿ineÅ¿s. Men of real abilities, are generally unaÅ¿Å¿uming and Å¿elf-diffident. Men Å¿enÅ¿ible of the difficulties and reÅ¿ponÅ¿ibility of important poÅ¿ts of truÅ¿t, are generally backward to undertake them. Men reÅ¿tleÅ¿s where they are, and troubleÅ¿ome to thoÅ¿e above them, are generally haughty and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, if advanced to higher Å¿tations. Nor Å¿hould the freemen be too much given to change; unleÅ¿s they mean to weaken government. Bad men, if in office, cannot be too Å¿oon turned out; but thoÅ¿e who have ruled well, ought not to be dropped, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that every man may have his turn; nor merely to Å¿how the great power of the people, and to keep their <hi>Å¿ervants,</hi> who <hi>govern</hi> them, more in fear of them.</p>
            <p>THE miniÅ¿ters of the goÅ¿pel, are thought to have no concern with the temporal happineÅ¿s of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind: doubtleÅ¿s, the good way for them, whether the old way or not, is to confine themÅ¿elves very much to their Å¿piritual vocation. DoubtleÅ¿s their principal buÅ¿ineÅ¿s is, to Å¿ave the Å¿ouls of thoÅ¿e who hear them. But in order to this, they muÅ¿t warn all, of that "wrath of God which is revealed from heaven, againÅ¿t all ungodlineÅ¿s and unrighteouÅ¿neÅ¿s of men," They muÅ¿t "convert Å¿inners from the error of their ways," or they cannot "Å¿ave their Å¿ouls from death." They muÅ¿t teach their converts to "obÅ¿erve all things whatÅ¿oever ChriÅ¿t hath commanded," by himÅ¿elf or his ApoÅ¿tles; or they cannot make them "meet to be partakers of the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038509_0046_10122C56CE5D6DE0"/>
inheritance of the Å¿aints in light." And among theÅ¿e inÅ¿tructions, teaching them to "obey thoÅ¿e who have the rule over them, and to be cautious how they Å¿peak evil of dignities, muÅ¿t not be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. MiniÅ¿ters muÅ¿t not "Å¿hun to declare all the counÅ¿el of God," both to rulers and Å¿ubjects, if they would be "pure from the blood of all men." In a word, they wuÅ¿t do what in them lies to make all their hearers <hi>good ChriÅ¿tians;</hi> for without this they can never get them to heaven; and they need do no more, to make them peaceable and orderly members of Å¿ociety on earth. Thus far, and in this manner, <hi>Aaron</hi> may Å¿till Å¿upport the hand of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> in miniÅ¿tering to the <hi>temporal</hi> good of men, even in a conÅ¿iÅ¿tency with the modern line of Å¿eparation drawn between them.</p>
            <p>LASTLY; all, of every order, if they would do their part to prevent all the evils threatened in our text and context, from coming upon us, as the righteous judgments of Heaven, muÅ¿t Å¿ee that their tongues and their doings are not againÅ¿t the Lord. Never can we rationally hope that God will be at peace with us, unleÅ¿s we treat his laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances with greater attention and reÅ¿pect. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s we ceaÅ¿e to do evil, and learn to do well; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s Å¿ome check be put to thoÅ¿e looÅ¿e principles, and licentious practices, which have over-flowed all our cities, and towns, and villages.</p>
            <p>THE old paths, then, and the good way, to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038509_0047_10122C585C810328"/>
which we muÅ¿t return, and in which we muÅ¿t walk, would we find reÅ¿t, are plain before us.</p>
            <p>BUT, it is to be feared, the voice of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority may now be, as it was in the days of Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah: <hi>We will not walk therein.</hi> Both from the Å¿igns of the times, and from Å¿everal predictions of Å¿crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I think the probability is, that things are not about to alter for the better, but for the worÅ¿e. Mankind Å¿eem yet combining, and "taking coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿el together, againÅ¿t the Lord, and againÅ¿t his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, Å¿aying, Let us break their bands aÅ¿under, and caÅ¿t away their cords from us;" and God Å¿eems remarkably leaving them to Å¿trong deluÅ¿ions, to believe Å¿trange lies. He Å¿eems determined to let them go on, and try the boaÅ¿ted experiment of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and revolutions, to the uttermoÅ¿t: deÅ¿igning, it may be Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, to have a more convictive diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery exhibited, than has ever yet been given, of the madneÅ¿s in the heart of the Å¿ons of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the general regeneration of the world. The unclean Å¿pirits, predicted to come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beaÅ¿t, and out of the mouth of the falÅ¿e prophet, as rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ented in the viÅ¿ion of John; appear evidently to have gone forth over all the earth, and to have been exceedingly buÅ¿y and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful, in raiÅ¿ing and training up their forces for the battle of that great day of God Almighty;<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 13, 14.</note> which, according to the common calculation of expoÅ¿itors, is now only
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038509_0048_1012420CF79CB990"/>
commencing. Whether we turn our eyes to the word of prophecy, or to the aÅ¿pects of providence, we have reaÅ¿on to be very apprehenÅ¿ive, that "this darkneÅ¿s" is yet for a while, to "cover the earth, and groÅ¿s darkneÅ¿s the people,"<note n="â€ " place="bottom">IÅ¿a. ix. 2.</note> in a greater and greater degree, before the expected reign of light and truth, righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s and peace.</p>
            <p>NEVERTHELESS, let not good men deÅ¿pond: nor let them relax their exertions to repel, as long and as extenÅ¿ively as they can, the prevalence of error, irreligion and wretchedneÅ¿s. Mightier is He that is with them, than all that are againÅ¿t them. When it is aÅ¿ked in the eleventh PÅ¿alm: "If the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be deÅ¿troyed, what can the righteous do?" the anÅ¿wer is Å¿hort, but very emphatical and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Å¿ufficient: <hi>"The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven.</hi> ElÅ¿ewhere, the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t, adoring the power and wiÅ¿dom of the MoÅ¿t High, Å¿ays, "Surely the wrath of man Å¿hall praiÅ¿e thee; the remainder of the wrath Å¿halt thou reÅ¿train."<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">PÅ¿al. lxxvi. 10.</note> It is often Å¿aid, "ChriÅ¿t is able to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his own church and miniÅ¿ters, without the aid of human laws." This is doubtleÅ¿s true, it is alÅ¿o true, that ChriÅ¿t is able to take care of his church, and to bring the many Å¿ons given him to glory, without any miniÅ¿ters at all. And equally true is it, that God is able to govern the nations, without the help of earthly rulers. But, from theÅ¿e prem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iÅ¿es,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038509_0049_1012420E9E048E18"/>
the conÅ¿equence will not follow, without hard drawing, that men may innocently and Å¿afely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect exerting the power they have, for the Å¿upport, either of good goverment, or of uncorrupted ChriÅ¿tianity. "ThoÅ¿e that walk in pride, God is able to abaÅ¿e;" but is there therefore nothing haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous, nor wrong, in thus walking? A curÅ¿e was once denounced, on them who "came not to the help of the Lord, againÅ¿t the mighty; though the Lord helped himÅ¿elf, without their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance. But the foregoing truths, however they may have been perverted to the countenancing of human negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the cauÅ¿e of God or ChriÅ¿t, are matter of juÅ¿t conÅ¿olation to the pious and good, when they walk in darkneÅ¿s and have no light: when they Å¿ee little probability that their utmoÅ¿t efforts for the Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of order, or of undefiled religion, will have any effect.</p>
            <p>THERE will always be Å¿ome, and Å¿ome that ought to be leaders and teachers, whoÅ¿e policy it is, to turn with the times; to Å¿wim with the tide, and Å¿wing with the vibrating pendulum of popular opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Who will trim their way to Å¿eek love; and "become all things to all men, if by all means they may Å¿ave" <hi>themÅ¿elves.</hi> But a Å¿teadfaÅ¿t adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to truth and duty, however great the apparent danger, is the only way of real Å¿afety. He who thus "loÅ¿es his life, Å¿hall Å¿ave it;" and he Å¿hall loÅ¿e his life who would Å¿ave it," by deÅ¿erting his poÅ¿t, or hiding himÅ¿elf under refuges of falÅ¿ehood, when evil is foreÅ¿een. "The fearful and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Å¿hall have their part" at laÅ¿t, in the Å¿ame lake with bolder tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ors. "The fear of man bringeth a Å¿nare; but whoÅ¿o putteth his truÅ¿t in the Lord Å¿hall be Å¿afe"<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxix. 25.</note> For the encouragement of good men, in perilous times, and particularly of good rulers, it is written: "He that walketh righteouÅ¿ly, and Å¿peaketh uprightly; he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿eth the gain of oppreÅ¿Å¿ions, that Å¿haketh his hands from holding of bribes, that Å¿toppeth his ears from, hearing of blood, and Å¿hutteth his eyes from Å¿eeing evil; he Å¿hall dwell on high; his place of defence Å¿hall be the munitions of rocks: bread Å¿hall be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him, his waters Å¿hall be Å¿ure,"<note n="â€ " place="bottom">IÅ¿a. xxxiii. 15, 16.</note> On theÅ¿e grounds is the exhortation in IÅ¿aiah, a few chapters after our text,<note n="â€¡" place="bottom">Chap. viii. 12, 13.</note> with which I Å¿hall conclude. "Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people Å¿hall Å¿ay, A confederacy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.
