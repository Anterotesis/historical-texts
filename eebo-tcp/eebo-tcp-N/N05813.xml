            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Second LETTER to a Friend, relating to the Defeat of the French and Indians at Lake-George.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN my letter to you, relating to the <hi>Ohio-Defeat,</hi> I took a brief Notice of our <hi>Crown-point</hi> expedition; diſcovering ſome uneaſineſs at its having been ſo long delayed. I am now well pleaſed with that delay; as it has given occaſion to the <hi>greateſt Action,</hi> in its kind, that ever happened in <hi>North-America.</hi> Never was ſuch a battle fought here before!—Never had we op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity before of gaining ſo glorious a conqueſt over ſo great an army!—I gave it alſo as my opinion, <q>that the <hi>New-England</hi> troops, by reaſon of this delay, would have the <hi>whole power of Canada</hi> to contend with;</q> in which I happened to make a right judgment. For, the day you publiſhed my letter, an expreſs arrived from General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> adviſing, <q>that the ſpies he had ſent out were returned, and bro't him intelligence, that <hi>all Canada</hi> was in motion, the roads filled with waggons, tranſporting all manner of ſtores to <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> and numbers of men continually going there to reinforce <hi>Fort-Frederick</hi>
               </q> Upon which the <hi>General</hi> went on to ſay, <q>that a large reinforcement was, in this ſituation of affairs, abſolutely neceſſary on our ſide;</q> recommending it to the ſeveral <hi>New-England</hi> colonies "to be as ſpeedy in making it as might be;" and aſſuring them, <q>that, in the mean time, inſtead of being idle, he would employ his men in building a <hi>Fort</hi> at the entrance upon the carrying-place towards <hi>Lake George,</hi> or, as the <hi>French</hi> call it, <hi>Lake Sacrament,</hi> and after that, clear a road thro' the carrying-place to the head of the <hi>Lake,</hi> and build another fort at that important paſs, by which time he hoped the reinforcements would be raiſed and ſent, enabling him to proceed on his deſign.</q> It was while our <hi>General</hi> was at <hi>this paſs,</hi> and before he had built the ſecond fort, or received any reinforcements, that he was attacked by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:007382_0003_102B8CCDCBDA1690"/>
You have probably ſeen his Letter to the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Colonies</hi> concerned in the <hi>Crown-point</hi> expedition; giving an account of his engagement with, and ſucceſs againſt, the enemy: For it was printed the very day it came to hand, that every one might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with its contents. And if you have ſeen this letter, you muſt be pleaſed with it, and conceive an high opinion of the <hi>General'</hi>s merit. Perhaps, the beſt bred <hi>regular</hi> could not have diſpoſed matters, under like circumſtances, with greater wiſdom.—And the vein of modeſty that runs thro' his whole narrative cannot but recommend him to all who are capable of diſcernment.—But as his letter was wrote ſo ſoon after the action, it was impoſſible the account of things ſhould be particular enough to ſatisfy the curiouſly inquiſitive.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore give you a <hi>ſummary Abſtract</hi> of what we have more lately received, that may be depended on for fact; from whence you will eaſily be let into a clear and juſt Idea of this whole Matter. And, as you will probably expect it from me, I ſhall hereupon add a few tho'ts tending to ſet the <hi>importance</hi> of this <hi>conqueſt</hi> in a proper light before you; not forgetting, before I finiſh, to acquaint you with the <hi>reinforcements</hi> the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies have raiſed and ſent to guard againſt a diſappointment as to the <hi>preſent expedition:</hi> Upon which you will be at no loſs to determine, that the burden laid upon the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies is, in point of <hi>charge,</hi> far beyond what they are able to bear, if <hi>Great-Britain</hi> does not interpoſe for our help.</p>
            <p>I have been at the pains to conſider and compare a number of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which have been ſent from the army, eſpecially from the officers in it, and thoſe among them, whoſe Character I am acquainted with; I have likewiſe had perſonal converſation with a Gentleman of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, a full week after the action was over, was ſent an expreſs by the <hi>General</hi> to this town; and with another alſo who came away about the ſame time: And the <hi>ſum</hi> of what I have collected, I ſhall relate to you under <hi>three diviſions,</hi> anſwerable to the <hi>three engagements</hi> our men had with the enemy.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of this inſtant, a number of <hi>Mohawks,</hi> who had been out as ſcouts, returned, and informed the General, that they had found three large roads from the ſouth-bay, which they were ſatisfied could not be made but by the marching of ſo many conſiderable bodies of men, who were probably gone to attack our fort at the carrying-place.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007382_0004_102B8CCF57C3D108"/>
The <hi>General,</hi> upon this, diſpatched two expreſſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> the firſt expreſs was killed by the enemy in going to the fort; and General <hi>Johnſon'</hi>s letter ſent by him to Col. <hi>Blanchard</hi> was found in the <hi>Aid de Camp'</hi>s Pocket.</note> that evening to Col. <hi>Blanchard,</hi> the commanding officer <hi>there,</hi> the latter of which returned about 12 o'clock with this account, "that they had both heard and ſeen the enemy, and that they were about four miles from the fort." A council of war having been call'd the next morning, the reſult was, that a 1000 men ſhould be detached from the army under the command of Col. <hi>Williams,</hi> with 200 Indians under the command of <hi>Hendrick</hi> the <hi>Mohawk</hi> ſachem, and ſent to annoy the enemy, whether at the ſort, or in their retreat from it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as victorious, or defeated. This was accordingly done, without any loſs of time; and it made way for, what I call, the <hi>firſt</hi> engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For this detachment had not marched above 2 miles and an ½ before they <hi>unexpectedly</hi> found themſelves within reach of the enemy. They were firſt diſcovered by an advanced Party of <hi>Indians,</hi> with <hi>Hendrick</hi> at their head; who immediately fired upon them. This gave the alarm to Col. <hi>Williams,</hi> who endeavoured with a number of men to ſecure a <hi>rocky eminence</hi> hard by, from whence, as from a kind of caſtle, he might annoy the enemy. But, as they had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his march, by a ſcout they had ſent out, they had ſecured it before, lay there in ambuſcade, and upon his approach within ſure reach of their guns, they roſe up, fir'd, and kill'd him, and many more, dead on the ſpot. By this time the fight became very fierce on both ſides. The advanced party of <hi>Indians</hi> behaved with the utmoſt intrepidity; but perceiving they ſhould be ſurrounded, and deſtroyed, they gave way; and as they paſſed by our men, they told them of their danger, and adviſed to a retreat. They went on not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, fighting with undaunted courage and reſolution; but finding themſelves over-powered with numbers, and almoſt encircled, they quitted the ground, firing as they gave back with conſtancy and fury. Five or ſix Hundred of them retreated with ſuch dexterity, and vigorous exertment, that the return of this <hi>detachment</hi> to the camp was hereby rendered, in a manner, ſafe and eaſy. The <hi>French Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> owned, that we kill'd more of his men in this fight, than we loſt of our own. And my informer aſſures me, this acknowledgment of his was agreeable to the truth of fact. For he ſaw himſelf, the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007382_0005_102B8CD143B704F0"/>
next day, and counted, upwards of 140 dead bodies in the place where the fight firſt began; tho' he could not tell the preciſe number that were <hi>French,</hi> becauſe they had been ſtripped by the <hi>Indians,</hi> and lay naked. And beſides this heap, as it were, of dead bodies, he tells me, they were ſcattered more or leſs the whole way between the place where the engagement began, and the Camp. He further gave me to underſtand, that he took out his watch, when the fire was firſt heard at the camp; that he penciled the time; that it was preciſely 11 o'clock wanting 5 minutes; and that the retreat was not finiſhed till ½ after 12: So that this retreat, and the fight previous to it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued one hour and 35 minutes; from whence it appears, that our men were not over haſty in getting out of the way of danger: For they were diſtant from the camp no more than 2 miles and an ½.<note n="†" place="bottom">General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> judging of the diſtance by the fire, ſays, it was 3 or 4 miles; but my informer aſſures me, he was preſent with the ſurveyer, when the diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fort at the carrying-place, and camp, was accurately meaſured with a chain; that it was 13 miles; and that the diſtance of the place where this fight began, from the camp, was no more than 2 miles and an ½ at fartheſt.</note> To me it ſeems very wonderful, conſidering the ſuperiority of the enemy in number, and their coming upon our men <hi>unawares,</hi> that they were not intirely routed.</p>
            <p>Some have found fault with this detachment; ſuppoſing that they ſhould rather have been cut to pieces, than have turned their backs upon the enemy. But they herein talk wildly. A good retreat is the next glory to a victory. When troops are over-powered with numbers, and unawares too, the trueſt courage is diſcovered in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing and executing the beſt methods to come off with as little loſs as may be. Had our men been upon equal terms with the enemy, I ſhould have tho't they had acted unworthy of the Name of <hi>New-England</hi> men, if they had given way upon any conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But they had now to contend, not only with a large body of <hi>regular veterans,</hi> but with <hi>irregular</hi> troops more numerous than themſelves. And, under theſe circumſtances, what would <hi>bravery,</hi> conducted by wiſdom, direct to, but to make as good a retreat as they could. They might have ſtood, 'tis true, till they had all been killed; but, in that caſe, they would have juſtly merited the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of mad-men. Tis probable, I own, this retreat (at leaſt in regard of a number) might be attended with ſurprize, diſorder and confuſion: And it muſt otherwiſe have been miraculous; as many of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007382_0006_102B8CD2E55649E0"/>
our young Men were here, who never before heard a gun fired in anger. Beſides, there was not ſo much as one <hi>regular</hi> in our whole army, either among the officers, or private men.—And further, they were now engaged, not with <hi>regulars</hi> only, but with <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> the manner of whoſe fighting is <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>confuſed.</hi>—The wonder to me is, not that they retreated, or that numbers of them might be diſordered in their retreat; but that they ſhould be able, upon the whole, to make ſo good a retreat; annoying the enemy all the while they were retreating, and yet managing their retreat ſo as to come off with comparatively ſo ſmall a loſs. Col. <hi>Williams,</hi> Major <hi>Aſhley,</hi> Capt. <hi>Ingerſol,</hi> Capt. <hi>Porter,</hi> Capt. <hi>Ferral,</hi> Capt. <hi>Stod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dert,</hi> Capt. <hi>McGin,</hi> Capt. <hi>Stevens,</hi> Lieuts. <hi>Burt</hi> and <hi>Pumroy,</hi> fell in this engagement, with a conſiderable number of our private men. <hi>Hendrick,</hi> the noted <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachem, fell likewiſe, with a number of <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may properly eno' be obſerved here;—when the <hi>Mohawks</hi> found their <hi>great Sachem</hi> dead and ſcalped, they were exceedingly enraged; ſurrounding the tent were the <hi>French General</hi> lay, and inſiſting that he ſhould be delivered into their hands, that they might ſcalp him alſo. It was with great difficulty he was ſaved from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſacrifice to their fury. Our officers were obliged to remove him from tent to tent to keep him concealed from them, and finally found it neceſſary, notwithſtanding the badneſs of his wounds, to tranſport him privately to <hi>Albany;</hi> where he now is in a dangerous condition, if on this ſide the grave. The <hi>French</hi> han't behaved thus humanly and kindly towards <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners. When they hear of this and other civilities towards their <hi>General,</hi> and the other captives with him, it will, I hope, make them aſhamed of their paſt conduct, and teach them to treat our people in a more human way, ſhould any fall into <hi>their</hi> and the <hi>Indian'</hi>s hands, while united in any action.</p>
            <p>It was not long after the return of this detachment to the Camp, before the enemy appeared in ſight, and found our men in readineſs to give them a warm reception. This was owing to the notice they had of their approaching towards them, and the gradual manner of it, occaſioned by the above fight and retreat. It might have been of dangerous conſequence, had they ſuddenly made an attack upon our camp; but as we had this warning, opportunity was happily

given us to throw up a <hi>breaſt-work</hi> of trees (as General <hi>Johnſon</hi> calls it); to plant a number of cannon in ſuitable places about it; to take poſſeſſion of ſome eminences on our left flank, under the guard of a field-piece advantageouſly ſituated; to line our breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work throughout with men; and, in ſhort, to put things in the beſt diſpoſition, time and circumſtances would permit, to defend ourſelves, and deſtroy the enemy. And now came on the <hi>ſecond Battle,</hi> perhaps, the moſt furious and reſolute, on both ſides, that ever was fought in <hi>North-America.</hi> It opened between 11 and 12 o'clock (keeping to the <hi>General'</hi>s account) with the fire of the <hi>French</hi> regulars; but in a few minutes, the fire became general, and nothing was heard but the noiſe of guns. This part of the attack was moſtly made upon our left wing, bearing towards the center; and it was principally ſuſtained by the <hi>Connecticut</hi> troops, who behaved with great activity and valour. When the <hi>French</hi> found, upon a long and obſtinate tryal, that they muſt be deſtroyed if they continued here, they moved to the <hi>right</hi> of our camp, where the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> regiments were poſted; and upon this attack alſo they maintained a briſk and reſolute fire for a long time, but were ſo weaken'd by the warm and dextrous oppoſition they met with, that their fire gradually grew feeble, and with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable intermiſſions: Upon which our brave men, together with the <hi>Indians,</hi> jumpt over the breaſt-work, reſolutely fell upon them <hi>hatchet</hi> in hand, drove them off the ground, purſued after them, ſlew a great many, and took about 30 priſoners, among whom was Baron <hi>de Dieſkau,</hi> the General of all the troops lately come to <hi>Canada</hi> from <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Engagement, with the purſuit, laſted about 7 hours. Our loſs was leſs now, than in the former fight; but the loſs on the ſide of the <hi>French</hi> was greater: According to the beſt accounts we killed, in this battle, 3 or 4 hundred of their men, officers and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>When General <hi>Johnſon'</hi>s letter firſt came to town, we were ready to think, the <hi>French</hi> muſt have loſt at leaſt a thouſand men; as the battle was of ſuch long continuance, and we had the advantage of <hi>Cannon,</hi> and a <hi>Breaſt-work</hi> of trees to defend ourſelves. Our Idea alſo of the bravery of the <hi>French</hi> was, by reaſon of this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, very much enlarged; and it ſeemed nothing extraordinary that our army, under the above circumſtances, ſhould get the better of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007382_0008_102B8CD705A07DA0"/>
them. But, from Major <hi>Hore,</hi> who came to this Government laſt week upon an Errand from the army, is one of its officers, and was excellently active in the late fight; as alſo from another Gentleman who came ſince, we were led to conceive more juſtly of the matter. Our wonder now was, not that a 1000 were not killed, but that ſo many as 3 or 400 ſhould be ſlain in this battle. For their account is, "that the battle was fought upon a plain, covered with pitch-pine trees, of various ſizes, ſome ſmaller, ſome greater, as is common in ſuch plains, in their natural ſtate of wildneſs, and a thick under-growth of ſhrubs, intermixed with brakes, as high as a man's waſte; that no part of this plain was cleared, except only the road we had made from the fort at the Carrying-place to the Camp; that the <hi>French regulars</hi> marched in this road, and began the fight drawn up in order; that they kept their order but a ſmall ſpace of time, not long enough to receive a ſecond diſcharge from our Cannon; and that the battle was now carried on in the <hi>Indian</hi> way by the whole <hi>French</hi> army, <hi>regulars</hi> as well <hi>irregulars,</hi> ſome fighting behind trees, and ſtumps, and others ſquatting ſo as to be defended by the under-growth of ſhrubs and brakes." Tis eaſy, upon this Repreſentation of the Matter, to ſee, that the enemy were upon equal terms with us, tho' we had a kind of breaſt-work; nay, as it was nothing more [ſo I am inform'd by one that was preſent when it was made] than bodies of trees laid ſingly upon the ground, round the Camp, and in many places ſo as not to touch one another, I am ready to think, they had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us; eſpecially as the under-growth near the Camp had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been cut down for the conveniency of the army. And from hence alſo it will not appear ſtrange, if our Cannon [three or four of which were the only ones that could be uſed, and theſe not more than 3 or 4 rounds, it being to little purpoſe to fire them] did not do them the damage, we, upon the firſt hearing of the ſtory, might be apt to imagine. The plain truth is, after the <hi>regulars</hi> became <hi>irregulars</hi> in the manner of their fighting, there was no great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made, either by our <hi>Cannon,</hi> or <hi>random Muſquetry.</hi> The chief execution was now done, partly by our men's watching for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to fire, when they could catch any of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> within full view; for they are moſt of them ſo dextrous in the uſe of the Gun, as to be pritty ſure of taking a man down within an hundred yards diſtance: And partly, by their ruſhing upon them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007382_0009_102B8CD90A9FF0B0"/>
the cloſe of the battle, and purſuing them, not only with their Guns, but hatchets alſo.<note n="*" place="bottom">Perhaps the <hi>Hatchet</hi> (a weapon our men were all armed with) is, in our way of fighting, a more fatal inſtrument, than even the <hi>broad Sword,</hi> or <hi>Bayonet,</hi> if managed with ſkill. The <hi>Indians</hi> will readily faſten it in a man's ſkull, at more than a rod's diſtance. Many of our people are equally dextrous in the <hi>throw</hi> of it; and all our men know its uſe ſo well, that tis certain death to a man to be within fair reach of their aim, when ſtretched forth to ſtrike with it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Our men, after they had entered on action, were leaſt fearful of any ill conſequence from the <hi>regulars;</hi> and they ſuffered leaſt from them: Tho' none among the enemy ſuffered ſo much from us as <hi>theſe regulars,</hi> thro' their unacquaintedneſs with the <hi>American</hi> method of fighting. Few of them, comparatively, whether officers, or private men, are tho't to have eſcaped with their lives. How elſe can it be accounted for, that the <hi>General</hi> ſhould be taken alone? So I was particularly informed he was by Major <hi>Hore,</hi> whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this fact is confirmed by ſeveral letters from the army, particularly by one from General <hi>Lyman.</hi> Tis ſcarce credible, that the chief commanding officer, and one of ſuch importance to the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, ſhould be left by all his <hi>regulars,</hi> both officers and common ſoldiers, and in a wounded condition too, if they were generally alive. One would think, they muſt, for ſhame, have kept with him at all hazards. Thus much, I think muſt be allowed to be certain; either that they were generally ſlain, or ſtruck with ſuch a panic, upon being purſued by our men, as to be out of the poſſeſſion of themſelves.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Johnſon</hi> and Major <hi>Nichols</hi> were wounded in this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and they only among the field-officers. The <hi>General</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Ball in his thigh; but he can now walk about, and we hope will be able to proceed in perſon in further proſecution of our deſign, when the reinforcements are arrived. Col. <hi>Titcomb</hi> was the only officer, at leaſt above a Captain, that fell in this ſecond battle. He was ſhot dead on the ſpot. And his fall is the more to be regretted, as he was well experienced in the method of battering forts. He had a principal hand in the erection of all the batteries at <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> and commanded one at that ſiege, which was known by his name, and was eminently galling to the enemy. He went then, and now alſo, chiefly for the publick benefit; and his name ought to be tranſmitted to poſterity with honour.</p>
            <p>One thing more may be worthy of notice with reference to this battle; and that is, that among the 2 or 300 arms that have already
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007382_0010_102B8CDA9FFAD420"/>
been bro't into the Camp, a number appear to have been thoſe that were taken from us at the <hi>Ohio-defeat:</hi> From whence it is obvious to collect, that ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> or <hi>Canadians,</hi> or both, that came off conquerors at the <hi>Monongahela,</hi> were ſlain at <hi>Lake-George.</hi>—This was the fate particularly of Monſieur St. <hi>Piere,</hi> whoſe death is perhaps the greateſt loſs the <hi>French</hi> could have met with, at this day; as he was the chief commander of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and had moſt influence to engage them in any deſign againſt the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Engagement, as I may properly call it, was occaſion'd thus.—Col. <hi>Blanchard,</hi> the chief officer at the Carrying-place, not knowing but they might need help at the <hi>Camp,</hi> detached to their aſſiſtance between 2 and 300 men, moſtly <hi>New-Hampſhire,</hi> ſome <hi>Yorkers,</hi> under the command of Capt. <hi>McGinnis.</hi> Between 4 and 5 o'clock they reached the place were Col. <hi>Williams</hi> had been attacked in the morning, and there they found about 500 of the enemy (chiefly <hi>Indians</hi>), who had fled from the former battle, and were come hither to refreſh themſelves, ſcalp our dead, take their packs, and get off. Our men fell upon them with the greateſt fury, made priſoners of ſome, killed a great many, and intirely routed them; driving them off the ground, and recovering more of their packs than they could carry with them to the Camp.<note n="†" place="bottom">This engagement was begun near the place, where the <hi>French</hi> had encamped the night before, and where they had left their baggage. Accordingly being thus driven off, our people the next day, bro't in 4 or 5 waggon loads of Ammunition, Proviſions, Blankets, &amp;c. And they ſince find, that their flight was ſo haſty, and ſo much in a fright, that, as they fled, they dropt their blankets, bread, and even ſome of the ſcalps of our men.</note> It can ſcarce be accounted for, that they ſhould be able to accompliſh all this, upon any other ſuppoſition than <hi>that</hi> of the enemy's being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited with the dreſſing they had received a little before, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying, in their fright, the numbers with which they were now beſet. We loſt but a few men in this fight. General <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſays, two were killed, eleven wounded, and five miſſing. Among the wounded is Captain <hi>McGinnis,</hi> who behaved with prudence and valor. He is ſince dead of his wounds. The ſlaughter of the enemy was very conſiderable. The account we have received is, that we ſlew near an hundred of them: Thus ended the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable 8th day of this inſtant <hi>September.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our loſs, upon the whole, amounts to 187 <hi>Engliſh;</hi> 126 killed, and 61 miſſing: Tho', of the miſſing, 20 are returned, and probably
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007382_0011_102B8CDCCBB75808"/>
more by this time. I can't learn, that the <hi>Indians</hi> loſt more than from 15 to 20. The wounded are 94 <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and about 10 or 12 <hi>Indians.</hi> The <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-regiments are the greateſt ſufferers, as they were moſt in action. Two of their 3 colonels were killed, and one of their majors [another was wounded], beſides ſeveral of their Captains and Lieutenants; and among them, are the greater part of the private men that were ſlain. The loſs on the enemy's ſide was much greater than on our's. We know not the number of their wounded; but between five and ſix hundred were probably ſlain in all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and it may be yet more; for our people are daily finding dead bodies. The account from <hi>New-York,</hi> and <hi>Albany</hi> is 700: But the preciſe number of the ſlain will never be known. The <hi>Indians,</hi> we are all ſenſible, are ſtrangely ſollicitous to hide their dead, and will run all hazards to this end. And they have doubtleſs concealed numbers of their killed men. We are ſatisfied of this, not only from their known temper and practice, but from our having found at leaſt 40 <hi>biers,</hi> [poles with croſs-ſticks of wood, haſtily put together] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with blood, upon which, it is ſuppoſed, they carried off numbers of their ſlain. Our people have alſo found ſome of their concealed dead, particularly 4 or 5 <hi>Indians</hi> in a ſunk piece of land.</p>
            <p>I may properly take notice here of, what I eſteem, an exceſs of civility in our people towards the <hi>French.</hi>—They ſent out parties, as ſoon as they could with conveniency, not only to bury their dead, but to bury as many of them as might be without the knowledge of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to prevent their being <hi>ſcalped.</hi> This I call an <hi>exceſs</hi> of civility, not indeed conſidered in itſelf ſimply, but comparing it with the conduct of the <hi>French</hi> towards us. They took no care to ſave any of our men, who fell at the <hi>ſouthward,</hi> this ſummer, from being <hi>ſcalped;</hi> but ſuffered them all, officers as well as common ſoldiers, to have this indignity offered to them by the <hi>Indians:</hi> And moreover, they left their dead bodies upon the field of battle, as we have been well aſſured, to putrify and rot there, unleſs they were devoured by the wolves and crows, and other beaſts and birds of prey. Conſidering this inhuman conduct of the <hi>French,</hi> I can't but think, we exceeded in our civilities to the dead at <hi>Lake-George.</hi> For we have learnt by long experience, that unleſs we treat them as they treat us, we may expect ill uſage at their hands.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> engaged in this bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it remains ſtill uncertain. In the <hi>New-York</hi> News-paper, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007382_0012_102B8CDEF672EF30"/>
came to Town laſt poſt, they are ſaid to have been 3376. The account ſtands thus. <hi>Regulars,</hi> 1126. <hi>Militia,</hi> 1200 form'd in 12 companies, with 20 regulars in each company. <hi>Indian Traders,</hi> 300. <hi>Militia officers volunteers,</hi> 30. <hi>Cadets,</hi> about 20. <hi>Indians</hi> 700. <hi>Total,</hi> 3376. 'Tis evident, I believe, from General <hi>Dieſkau'</hi>s papers, that he bro't this number with him from <hi>Canada,</hi> thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly aſcertain'd: But whether he left any at <hi>Crown-point,</hi> or <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderogo,</hi> and if any, how many, cannot perhaps be reduced to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Thus much we may venture to ſay, as he knew our force, tis highly probable, he came with one that was ſuperior. I cannot therefore ſuppoſe, he had leſs than 2000 <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> beſides 5 or 600 <hi>regulars</hi> at leaſt. We had about 2100 <hi>New-England</hi> men, and between 2 and 300 <hi>Indians.</hi> The reſt of our men were partly confin'd by ſickneſs, but moſtly left at the <hi>Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place</hi> to take care of the <hi>fort</hi> there.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you as particular an account, as you can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect, at preſent, of this <hi>victory</hi> over the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> I can't, in conſiſtency with the regard I have for my Country, reſtrain my ſelf from going on to repreſent, in a few words, the IMPORTANCE of it to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt.</p>
            <p>You will, at once, be ſenſible of its great <hi>Importance,</hi> if you only turn the tables in your mind, and ſuppoſe the <hi>French</hi> had been <hi>victors,</hi> inſtead of our army.</p>
            <p>Some, by giving a looſe to their imaginations, have ſtrangely heightened our melancholy condition, in this view of the matter. They have, in their fancies, block'd up all communication with our Troops at <hi>Lake-Ontario,</hi> and delivered our <hi>Governor,</hi> who is now there, a prey into <hi>French</hi> hands;—they have look'd upon <hi>Albany</hi> as beſieged, and taken;—yea, they have tranſported the enemy to <hi>New-York,</hi> and entertain'd fearful apprehenſions reſpecting the fate even of that <hi>city.</hi>—But theſe are vain imaginations, the imagery of mere fancy; and muſt appear ſo to all, who will only call to mind, what was done at <hi>Albany, Connecticut,</hi> and the <hi>weſtern</hi> parts of <hi>this Government,</hi> when it was known, that our army was attacked, but unknown what would be the iſſue. We have been well aſſured, they were beating to arms, and would have been upon the enemy, with trible their number, in a fortnight's time, had not tidings of our being conquerors rendered their immediate progreſs needleſs.</p>
            <p>But though theſe fancied conſequences would not have taken
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007382_0013_102B8CE0F7DADBD0"/>
place, had the <hi>French</hi> come off victorious: yet others, and very miſchievous ones too, muſt have followed. Our <hi>fort</hi> at the Carrying-place would certainly have fallen into their hands, and together therewith all the artillery, ammunition, and ſtores, which had not been taken by them at the <hi>Camp;</hi>—awful numbers of our men muſt have been ſlain, and captivated; and, in a word, our whole army routed, and an entire end put to our deſign againſt <hi>Crown-point,</hi> at leaſt for this year:—All which has been happily prevented, by its being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in providence, that the victory ſhould fall on our ſide.</p>
            <p>The <hi>poſitive</hi> advantages of this conqueſt are alſo very ſignal, and may be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> worthy of particular notice.</p>
            <p>Hereby the diſgrace that was reflected on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> arms, on the banks of the <hi>Monongahela,</hi> is wholly wiped away. Were 300 of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſlain <hi>there?</hi> A much greater number of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> (5 or 600) were ſlain <hi>here.</hi>—Were the <hi>Engliſh regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> ſtruck with a panic, when attacked <hi>there</hi> by <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indian irregulars?</hi> The <hi>French Regulars,</hi> and <hi>veterans</hi> alſo, were ſeized with an equal fright <hi>here,</hi> when purſued by <hi>New-England Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars:</hi> Otherwiſe they would not have fled ſo univerſally, and in ſuch hurry, as to leave their <hi>firſt officer</hi> alone, not having a ſingle man to help him.—Was the <hi>Britiſh General</hi> mortally wounded in <hi>that</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement? So was the <hi>French General</hi> in <hi>this:</hi> (he is ſuppoſed to be dead of his wounds, before this time) Only the advantage lies on our ſide; for <hi>our General</hi> was carried off by his own men, whereas the <hi>French General</hi> was left to fall a priſoner into his enemies hands.</p>
            <p>Hereby an happy turn has been given to the ſpirits of our men on the one hand; and an unhappy one to the enemy's on the other. Our people, to an obſerving eye, were plainly under a depreſſure, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the <hi>horrid ſlaughter</hi> at the <hi>ſouthward,</hi> the like whereto had never before been ſeen, or heard of, in the Country; while, on the other hand, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> were fluſht with the victory they had obtained, and diſpoſed therefrom to undertake any thing, imagining there would be no ſtanding before them: But, by what was done at <hi>Lake George,</hi> this ſtate of mind has luckily been inverted. We are now raiſed in our ſpirits, they ſunk in their's:—We go on, in our deſign, animated with new life and vigor; they oppoſe us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and intimidated:—We act againſt them as conquerors; they againſt us as having been fairly beat from the field of battle, and quite routed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:007382_0014_102B8CE2A9769FC0"/>
In fine, hereby the ſtrength of the enemy has been greatly weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. They have loſt their <hi>General,</hi> an experienced warrior, who was purpoſely ſent from <hi>France</hi> to be at the <hi>head</hi> of their military affairs; and they have loſt alſo, together with him, moſt of their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of diſtinction and worth, and a great number of their common ſoldiers. 'Tis true, 2 or 3 of our chief officers, and 10 or 12 inferior ones, all men of bravery, were ſlain in the ſame field of battle, as well as a conſiderable number of our private men: But the loſs on their ſide, with reſpect to officers as well as common ſoldiers, is far greater than on our's. Their priſoners ſay, their army is ruined. And, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, after a deduction of their dead, their wounded, their captivated, their deſerters, their loſt and periſhed in the woods, their number (fitted for action) will not be more than <hi>half</hi> what it was, when they came forth againſt us. This is certainly a great advantage to us, and an equal diſadvantage to them. They will doubtleſs, be rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from <hi>Canada;</hi> but ſo will our army from <hi>New-England:</hi> And <hi>Canada,</hi> we know, can't ſupply ſuch numbers of men, as it is in the power of <hi>New-England</hi> to do. And, by reaſon of this effort of the <hi>French,</hi> in which they were intirely diſappointed, we are better able to judge, what reinforcements may be neceſſary, and are more warmly ſpirited to raiſe and ſend them, with the quickeſt diſpatch.</p>
            <p>And this minds me of my promiſe, not to forget to give you <hi>ſuch an account</hi> of theſe reinforcements, as may be ſufficient to open to you the <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> of a large remittance from <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And to this end, I need not be <hi>particular.</hi> It might be imprudent, under preſent circumſtances, to be ſo: Tho' I may tell you, the <hi>General-Aſſembly</hi> of this province, who are now ſitting, have, this week, acted the part of wiſe and kind fathers to this people, in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home a repreſentation of what has been done, with reference to this affair; and I cannot but hope, and believe, it will procure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of that heavy weight of <hi>charge</hi> that is now lying on us, and muſt ſink us into ruin, if we don't receive ſupport from out <hi>mother-country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only ſay in general, that the reinforcements already gone, and now going, to our army, will make it a very formidable one, I mean, for this part of the world; and the charge, ariſing from the pay, and ſubſiſtence, [almoſt doubled in its coſt, by the difficulty of tranſportation] of ſuch a body of men, muſt appear, to all who will allow themſelves to think, to be far beyond the utmoſt ability of a few poor, infant, colonies; as the <hi>New-England</hi> ones certainly are. They
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007382_0015_102B8CE492B91F10"/>
are all engaged in the preſent expedition; they will all therefore need aſſiſtance. Tho' this is emphatically true of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-Province: Nor can it be denied, that <hi>they</hi> have the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> claim [I would not ſay an excluſive one] to the pity and help of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> They are the <hi>Principals</hi> in the enterprize on foot, and bear the <hi>greateſt</hi> part in it. But this is not all: The better half of each of the Regiments raiſed, this ſpring, upon the eſtabliſhment, under Major General <hi>Shirley,</hi> and Major General <hi>Pepperrell,</hi> were inhabitants of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-Bay; and the other two regiments, which are gone to <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> were almoſt <hi>wholly</hi> made up of men of the ſame <hi>Province.</hi> 'Tis true, theſe regiments are in the pay of the <hi>crown:</hi> But ſtill, the benefit of the labour of ſo many men, in their proper buſineſs, is loſt to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and further, the proportion of the tax that would have fallen to their ſhare, muſt now be taken from them, and faſtened upon the other members of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, you are ſenſible, will greatly increaſe their burden. Beſides, no longer ago than laſt year we were at the expence of erecting a fort on the banks of <hi>Kenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi>-River, under the cover of 8 or 900 men raiſed for the purpoſe, principally with a view to ſecure our Sovereign's rights in thoſe parts; the expence of which fort, in its erection, and maintenance to this day, has amounted to <hi>Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds,</hi> our money, at the loweſt computation. Nor is this all yet: As we are at war, not only with the <hi>Indians</hi> near <hi>Canada,</hi> but with all the tribes of <hi>eaſtern Indians,</hi> (the <hi>Penobſcots</hi> excepted, againſt whom alſo we are upon the point of proclaiming war,) we are obliged to keep a conſiderable number of our men conſtantly ſcouring the woods, from <hi>eaſt</hi> to <hi>weſt,</hi> in a line of 2 or 300 miles, to defend our out-ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt their depredations.—In ſhort, one <hi>ſixth</hi> part of the effective men in the Province are, at this day, in military ſervice; and more than <hi>double</hi> the number in our own pay, than when we went againſt <hi>Cape-Breton:</hi> And if the burden of that expedition was juſtly tho't too heavy for us, much more is this the truth of the caſe at preſent.—We ſtand indeed a ſad chance of being an undone people, if we are not pitied, and relieved from the other ſide of the water.—'Twill otherwiſe be certainly impoſſible for us to engage in any enterprize the next year.—We ſhall have neither a heart-diſpoſing us, nor money enabling us, thereto: Whereas, if we are reimburſed this charge, and properly aſſured, that any other attempts ſhall be carried on at the expence of the <hi>Crown,</hi> it will give a ſpring to our vigor, and we ſhall join heart and hand in exerting our whole power to promote the ſervice of our King in ſcourging his and our enemies.</p>
            <p>And if we are thus ſupplied with money, let the <hi>ſouthern colonies ſleep on;</hi> let <hi>New-York</hi> government in particular, ingloriouſly ſit ſtill, and do nothing<note n="†" place="bottom">Tho' <hi>New-York</hi> ſupply'd only 800 men upon the preſent expedition (300 of which they did not raiſe in their own government, being unwilling to loſe ſo much of the labour of their people): yet when a <hi>large</hi> reinforcement was found neceſſary, even a <hi>greater</hi> number of men than was at firſt ſent, they choſe to lay upon their oars, not troubling themſelves to raiſe a ſingle man: So that the <hi>whole reinforcement</hi> of our army has been from the <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, who, to their honour be it ſpoken, have exerted themſelves beyond what could have been expected. 'Tis plain, from the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>conduct,</hi> our <hi>ſouthern</hi> brethren have diſcovered, that if any thing is done to purpoſe againſt the <hi>French,</hi> it muſt be done by <hi>New-England.</hi> And ſhall they not be aſſiſted, in point of money, from <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>—Can it, in the name of reaſon, be tho't equal, that <hi>theſe</hi> colonies ſhould be diminiſhed and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, while the growth of the <hi>ſouthern</hi> ones, in number and riches, is hereby promoted?—From the character we have of Governor <hi>Hardy,</hi> and the ſpirit he has already diſcovered, we hope <hi>New-York,</hi> under his adminiſtration, will act more like friends to the common <hi>Britiſh</hi> intereſt.</note>, while the

               <hi>New-England</hi> Governments are raiſing and ſending large reinforcements in defence, even of thoſe territories that are frontiers to them, and in the defence of which <hi>they eſpecially</hi> ſhould lay themſelves out to the utmoſt: I ſay, if we of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>-Province, together with the other <hi>New-England</hi> colonies, are properly encouraged and ſtrengthened with money from home, we ſhall nothing regard the <hi>ſtrange conduct</hi> of the <hi>ſouthern Governments,</hi> but chearfully and reſolutely undertake any enterpriſe for the <hi>common good;</hi> and doubt not, but we ſhall ſoon be able, without any aſſiſtance from them, under the ſmiles of providence, to bring down the pride of the <hi>American</hi> French, and make them glad to be at peace with us upon any terms.</p>
            <p>Wiſhing ſoon to hear good tidings from our brethren, who, by this time, we would hope, are gone from <hi>Lake-George,</hi> properly reinforced, in further proſecution of their deſign, I am, with great Reſpect,</p>

Their return is expected in about a fortnight, with a much greater number from their ſeveral tribes, when Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Hardy</hi> will, WITHOUT FRAUD, in <hi>perſon,</hi> in the name of his <hi>royal Maſter,</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>preſent</hi> to them: Upon which they will rejoin our army. It is ſaid, and I believe with truth, that they deſign to ſend to all the tribes of <hi>Indians</hi> in ſubjection to, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with them, to <hi>ſharpen their arrows,</hi> and come forth to revenge the death of their <hi>Sachem.</hi>—The fall of this <hi>Indian Chief</hi> is a great loſs to us, as well as them. For he was a faſt friend to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as an inveterate hater of the <hi>French;</hi> having too much underſtanding not to ſee thro' their deſigns, which he was convinced would finally end, if accompliſhed, in the reduction of the <hi>Indians,</hi> to a ſtate of ſlavery. It was very much owing to his influence, that the <hi>Six-Nations,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>abuſes</hi> they have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from <hi>ſome Yorkers,</hi> have been ſo firmly attached to our intereſt—Perhaps, there is not left, among all the <hi>Indians</hi> on the continent, a man equal to him in <hi>policy;</hi> and he had the <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> of a <hi>Lyon.</hi>
