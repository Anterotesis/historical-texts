            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>AS the occaſion of this Poem was real, not fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious, ſo the method purſued in it, was rather impoſed, by what ſpontaneouſly aroſe in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's mind, on that occaſion, than meditated, or deſigned. Which will appear very probable from the nature of it. For it differs from the common mode of Poetry; which is, from long narrations to draw ſhort morals. Here, on the contrary, the narrative is ſhort, and the morality ariſing from it makes the bulk of the Poem. The reaſon of it is, That the facts mentioned did naturally pour theſe moral reflections on the thought of the writer.</p>

            <p>THESE, and ſome other quotations, I am proud to borrow from the Night-Thoughts eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from Night the Fourth. In which, energy of language, ſublimity of ſentiment, and the moſt exquiſite beauties of poetry, are the leaſt perfections to be admired. Almoſt every line glows with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; riſes into the moſt exalted apprehenſions of the adorable Redeemer; and is animated with the moſt lively faith in his all-ſufficient mediation. The author of this excellent performance has the peculiar felicity, of ennobling all the ſtrength of ſtyle, and every delicacy of imagination, with the grand and diſtinguiſhing truths of Chriſtianity. Theſe thoughts give the higheſt entertainment to the fancy, and impart the nobleſt improvement to the mind. They not only refine our taſte, but prepare us for death, and ripen us for glory. I never take up this admirable piece, but I am ready to cry out.—<hi>Tecun. vivere amem, tecum obeam libens;</hi> i. e. <q>Inſpire me with ſuch a ſpirit, and life ſhall be delightful, nor death itſelf unwelcome.</q>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>FEW ages have been deeper in diſpute about religion, than this. The diſpute about religion, and the practice of it, ſeldom go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſhorter, therefore, the diſpute, the better. I think it may be reduced to this ſingle queſtion, <hi>Is Man Immortal,</hi> or is he not? If he is not, all our diſputes are mere amuſements, or trials of ſkill. In this caſe, Truth, Reaſon, Religion, which give our Diſcourſes ſuch pomp and ſolemnity, are (as will be ſhewn) mere empty ſounds, without any meaning in them. But if man is immortal, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> him to be very ſerious about eternal conſequences; or, in other Words, to be truly religious. And this great fundamental truth, uneſtabliſhed, or unawaken'd in the minds of men, is, I conceive, the real ſource and ſupport of all our infidelity; how remote ſoever the particular objections advanced may ſeem to be from it.</p>
            <p>Senſible appearances affect moſt men much more than abſtract reaſonings; and we daily ſee bodies drop around us, but the ſoul is inviſible. The power which inclination has over the judgment, is greater than can be well conceived by thoſe that have not had an experience of it; and of what numbers is it the ſad intereſt, that ſoul ſhould not ſurvive! The heathen world confeſſed, that they rather hoped, than firmly believed immortality! and how many heathens have we ſtill amongſt us! The ſacred page aſſures us, that life and immortality is brought to light by the goſpel: But by how many is the goſpel rejected, or overlooked! From theſe conſiderations, and from my being, accidentally, privy to the ſentiments of ſome particular perſons, I have been long perſuaded, that moſt, if not all, our infidels (whatever name they take, and whatever ſcheme, for argument's ſake, and to keep themſelves in countenance, they patronize) are ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their deplorable error, by ſome doubt of their immortality, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the bottom. And I am ſatisfied, that men once thoroughly convinced of their immortality, are not far from being Chriſtians. For it is hard to conceive, that a man fully conſcious eternal pain or happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will certainly be his lot, ſhould not earneſtly, and impartially, inquire after the ſureſt means of eſcaping one, and ſecuring the other. And of ſuch an earneſt and impartial inquiry, I well know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:015714_0117_0F99E38F7B4D6198"/>
Here, therefore, in proof of this moſt fundamental truth, ſome plain arguments are offered; arguments derived from principles which infidels admit in common with believers; arguments, which appear to me altogether irreſiſtible; and ſuch as, I am ſatisfied, will have great weight with all, who give themſelves the ſmall trouble of looking ſeriouſly into their own boſoms, and of obſerving, with any tolerable degree of attention, what daily paſſes round about them in the world. If ſome arguments ſhall, Here, occur, which others have declined, they are ſubmitted, with all deference, to better judgments in this, of all points, the moſt important. For, as to the being of a God, that is no longer diſputed; but it is undiſputed for this reaſon only, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Becauſe where the leaſt pretence to reaſon is admitted, it muſt for ever be indiſputable. And of conſequence no man can be betrayed into a diſpute of that nature by vanity; which has a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſhare in animating our modern combatants againſt other articles of our belief.</p>

               <l>In Smiles ſhe ſunk her grief, to leſſen mine.</l>
               <l>She ſpoke me comfort, and encreas'd my pain.</l>
               <l>Like pow'rful armies trenching at a town,</l>
               <l>By ſlow, and ſilent, but reſiſtleſs ſap,</l>
               <l>In his pale progreſs gently gaining ground,</l>
               <l>Death urg'd his deadly ſiege; in ſpite of art,</l>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS we are at war with the power, it were well if we were at war with the manners, of France. A land of levity, is a land of guilt. A ſerious mind is the native ſoil of every virtue; and the ſingle charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that does true honor to mankind. The ſoul's immortality has been the favourite theme with the ſerious of all ages. Nor is it ſtrange; it is a ſubject by far the moſt intereſting, and important, that can enter the mind of man. Of higheſt moment this ſubject always was, and always will be. Yet this its higheſt moment ſeems to admit of increaſe, at this day; a ſort of occaſional importance is ſuperadded to the natural weight of it; if that opinion which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Preface to the preceding Night, be juſt. It is there ſuppoſed, that all our infidels, whatever ſcheme, for argument's ſake, and to keep themſelves in countenance, they patronize, are betray'd into their deplorable error, by ſome doubt of their immortality, at the bottom. And the more I conſider this point, the more I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of the truth of that opinion. Tho' the diſtruſt of a futurity is a ſtrange error; yet it is an error into which bad men may naturally be diſtreſſed. For it is impoſſible to bid defiance to final ruin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome refuge in imagination, ſome preſumption of eſcape. And what preſumption is there? There are but two in nature; but two, within the compaſs of human thought. And theſe are,—That either God will not, or can not puniſh. Conſidering the divine attributes, the firſt is too groſs to be digeſted by our ſtrongeſt wiſhes. And ſince omnipotence is as much a divine attribute as holineſs, that God cannot puniſh, is as abſurd a ſuppoſition, as the former. God cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly can puniſh, as long as the wicked man exiſts. In non-exiſtence, therefore, is their only refuge; and, conſequently, non-exiſtence is their ſtrongeſt wiſh. And ſtrong wiſhes have a ſtrange influence on our opinions; they bias the judgment in a manner, almoſt, incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And ſince on this member of their alternative, there are ſome very ſmall appearances in their favour, and none at all on the other, they catch at this reed, they lay hold on this chimaera, to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſhock, and horror, of an immediate, and abſolute, deſpair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:015714_0145_0F99E3ADDB626428"/>
On reviewing my ſubject, by the light which this argument, and others of like tendency, threw upon it, I was more inclin'd than ever, to purſue it; as it appeared to me to ſtrike directly at the main root of all our infidelity. In the following pages, it is, accordingly, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued at large; and ſome arguments for immortality, new (at leaſt, to me,) are ventured on in them. There alſo the writer has made an attempt to ſet the groſs abſurdities and horrors of annihilation in a fuller and more affecting view, than is (I think) to be met with elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen, for whoſe ſake this attempt was chiefly made, profeſs great admiration for the wiſdom of heathen antiquity: What pity 'tis, they are not ſincere! If they were ſincere, how would it mortify them to conſider, with what contempt, and abhorrence, their notions would have been received, by thoſe whom they ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire? What degree of contempt, and abhorrence, would fall to their ſhare, may be conjectured by the following matter of fact (in my opinion) extremely memorable. Of all their heathen worthies, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates ('tis well known) was the moſt guarded, diſpaſſionate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: Yet this great maſter of temper was angry; and angry at his laſt hour; and angry with his friend; and angry for what deſerv'd acknowledgment; angry, for a right and tender inſtance of true friendſhip towards him. Is not this ſurpriſing? What could be the cauſe? The cauſe was for his honour; it was a truly noble, tho', perhaps, a too punctilious, regard for immortality: For his friend aſking him, with ſuch an affectionate concern as became a friend, <hi>Where he ſhould depoſit his remains?</hi> it was reſented by Socrates, as implying a diſhonourable ſuppoſition, that He could be ſo mean, as to have a regard for any thing, even in himſelf, that was not immortal.</p>
            <p>This fact well conſider'd, would make our infidels withdraw their admiration from Socrates; or make them endeavour, by their imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this illuſtrious example, to ſhare his glory: And, conſequently, It would incline them to peruſe the following pages with candor and impartiality: Which is all I deſire; and that, for their ſakes: For I am perſuaded, that an unprejudiced infidel muſt, neceſſarily, receive ſome advantageous impreſſions from them.</p>

            <head>CONTENTS of the Seventh Night.</head>
            <p>IN the Sixth Night arguments were drawn, from nature, in proof of immortality: Here, others are drawn from man: From his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, p. 141; from his paſſions and powers, 142; from the gradual growth of reaſon, ibid. from his fear of death, ibid. from the nature of hope, 143; and of virtue, 144, &amp;c. from knowledge, and love, as being the moſt eſſential properties of the ſoul, 147; from the order of creation, 148; from the nature of ambition, 149, &amp;c. Avarice, 152, 153; Pleaſure, 153. A digreſſion on the grandeur of the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 154, 155. Immortality alone renders our preſent ſtate intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, 156. An objection from the Stoics diſbelief of immortality anſwered, 156, 157. Endleſs queſtions unreſolvable, but on ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our immortality, 157, 158.

               <l>AS when a traveller, a long day paſt</l>
               <l>In painful ſearch of what he cannot find,</l>
               <l>At night's approach, content with the next cot,</l>
               <l>There ruminates, awhile, his labour loſt;</l>
               <l>Then chears his heart with what his fate affords,</l>
               <l>And chants his ſonnet to deceive the time,</l>
               <l>Till the due ſeaſon calls him to repoſe:</l>
               <l>Thus I, long travell'd in the ways of men,</l>
               <l>And dancing, with the reſt, the giddy maze,</l>
               <l>Where diſappointment ſmiles at hope's career;</l>
               <l>Warn'd by the languor of life's evening ray,</l>
               <l>At length have hous'd me in an humble ſhed;</l>
               <l>Where, future wand'ring baniſh'd from my thought,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:015714_0233_0F99E29E8C264678"/>
And waiting, patient, the ſweet hour of reſt;</l>
               <l>I chaſe the moments with a ſerious ſong.</l>
               <l>Song ſooths our pains; and age has pains to ſooth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When age, care, crime, and friends embrac'd at heart,</l>
               <l>Torn from my bleeding breaſt, and death's dark ſhade,</l>
               <l>Which hovers o'er me, quench'd th' ethereal fire;</l>
               <l>Canſt thou, O night! indulge one labour more?</l>
               <l>One labour more indulge! then ſleep, my ſtrain!</l>
               <l>Till, haply, wak'd by RAPHAEL's golden lyre,</l>
               <l>Where night, death, age, care, crime, and ſorrow, ceaſe;</l>
               <l>To bear a part in everlaſting lays; </l>
               <l>Tho' far, far higher ſet, in aim, I truſt,</l>
               <l>Symphonious to this humble prelude here.</l>

               <l>Has not the muſe aſſerted pleaſures pure.</l>
               <l>Like thoſe above; exploding other joys?</l>
               <l>Weigh what was urg'd, LORENZO! fairly weigh;</l>
               <l>And tell me, haſt thou cauſe to triumph ſtill?</l>
               <l>I think, thou wilt forbear a boaſt ſo bold.</l>
               <l>But if, beneath the favour of miſtake,</l>
               <l>Thy ſmile's ſincere; not more ſincere can be</l>
               <l>LORENZO's ſmile, than my compaſſion for him.</l>
               <l>The ſick in body call for aid; the ſick</l>
               <l>In mind are covetous of more diſeaſe;</l>
               <l>And when at worſt, they dream themſelves quite well,</l>
               <l>To know ourſelves diſeas'd, is half our cure.</l>
               <l>When nature's bluſh by cuſtom is wip'd off,</l>
               <l>And conſcience, deaden'd by repeated ſtrokes,</l>
               <l>Has into manners naturaliz'd our crimes;</l>
               <l>The curſe of curſes is, our curſe to love;</l>
               <l>To triumph in the blackneſs of our guilt,</l>
               <l>(As Indians glory in the deepeſt jet);</l>
               <l>And throw aſide our ſenſes with our peace.</l>

               <l>But, grant no guilt, no ſhame, no leaſt alloy;</l>

               <l>No joy, no glory, glitters in thy ſight,</l>
               <l>But thro' the thin partition of an hour,</l>
               <l>I ſee its ſables wove by deſtiny;</l>
               <l>And that in ſorrow bury'd; this in ſhame;</l>
               <l>While howling furies ring the doleful knell;</l>

            <head>NOTES. ON the BOOK of JOB.</head>
            <p>IT is diſputed among the Critics who was the Author of the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> Some give it to <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſome to others. As I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in this little Performance, ſome Arguments occur'd to me, which favour the former of theſe Opinions; which Arguments I have flung into the following Notes, where little elſe is to be expected.</p>
            <p>Page 297. <hi>Thrice Happy</hi> Job, &amp;c.] The Almighty's Speech, Chapter xxxviii. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is what I paraphraſe in this little Work, is by much the fineſt Part of the nobleſt, and moſt antient Poem in the World. Biſhop <hi>Patrick</hi> ſays, its Grandeur is as much above all other Poetry, as Thunder is louder than a Whiſper. In order to ſet this diſtinguiſh'd Part of the Poem in a fuller Light, and give the Reader a clearer Conception of it, I have abridg'd the preceding and ſubſequent Parts of the Poem, and join'd them it; ſo that this Piece is a ſort of an Epitome of the whole Book of <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I uſe the Word <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> becauſe I want another which might better anſwer to the uncommon Liberties I have taken. I have omitted, added, and tranſpos'd. The <hi>Mountain,</hi> the <hi>Comet,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> and other Parts, are entirely added: The <hi>Peacock,</hi> the <hi>Lion,</hi> &amp;c are much inlarg'd: And I have thrown the Whole into a Method more ſuitable to our Notions of Regularity. The judicious, if they compare this Piece with the Original, will, I flatter myſelf, find the Reaſons for the great Liberties I have indulg'd myſelf in through the Whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Longinus</hi> has a Chapter on Interrogations, which ſhews that they contribute much to the Sublime. This Speech of the Almighty is made up of them. Interrogation ſeems indeed the proper Style of Majeſty incens'd. It differs from other manner of Reproof, as bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Perſon execute himſelf, does from a common Execution; for he that aſks the Guilty a proper Queſtion, makes him, in effect, paſs Sentence on himſelf.</p>

of old <hi>Greece,</hi> is Fiction built on Truth. Probably this moſt noble Part of it, the Almighty ſpeaking out of the Whirlwind (ſo ſuitable to the After-practice of the <hi>Greek</hi> Stage. when there happened <hi>Dignus Vindice Nodus),</hi> is fictitious; but it is a Fiction more agreeable to the Time in which <hi>Job</hi> lived, than to any ſince. Frequent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, were the Appearances of the Almighty after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Exodus ch. xix.

            <p>Page 299. <hi>Thus far thy floating Tide,</hi> &amp;c.] There is a very great Air in all that precedes; but this is ſignally Sublime. We are ſtruck with Admiration to ſee the vaſt and ungovernable Ocean receiving Commands, and punctually obeying them; to find it like a manag'd Horſe, raging, toſſing, and foaming, but by the Rule and Direction of its Maſter This Paſſage yields in Sublimity to that of <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> &amp;c. ſo much only, as the abſolute Government of Nature yields to the Creation of it.</p>
            <p>The like Spirit in theſe two Paſſages is no bad concurrent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that <hi>Moſes</hi> is Author of the Book of <hi>Job.</hi>

The Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, ſay the Naturaliſts, lying long under Water, and being there forced to hold its Breath, when it emerges, the Breath long repreſt is hot, and burſts out ſo violently, that it reſembles Fire and Smoke. The Horſe ſuppreſſes not his Breath by any means ſo long, neither is he ſo fierce and animated; yet the moſt correct of Poets ventures to uſe the ſame Metaphor concerning him.</p>

It is not improbable, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſtole their Hieroglyphic for the Morning, which is the Crocodile's Eye, from this Paſſage, though no Commentator I have ſeen mentions it.
