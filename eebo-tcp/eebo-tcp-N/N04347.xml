            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE enclos'd which comes open, you will ſee is a CONFESSION, and RETRACTATION, of the Rev. Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT; which he left with me <hi>Yeſterday,</hi> and deſir'd me to incloſe in a Letter to you: praying that you would ſee that it is <hi>according to his Deſire forthwith publiſh'd,</hi> and <hi>made known in the moſt open Manner.</hi> He deſired me to aſſure you that the <hi>whole of the Paper, and every Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, was made and written with his own Hand.</hi> And <hi>he is full, and free in it,</hi> and ſeems to be <hi>deeply ſenſible of his Miſcarriages, and Miſconduct</hi> in thoſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and <hi>very deſirous to do all he poſſibly can to retreive the Diſhonour which he has done to Religion,</hi> and <hi>the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to many Miniſters</hi> of the Goſpel; and in this as well as any other Way to promote the Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and prevent any further Prejudices againſt the Work of God which he may have been the Occaſion of raiſing or increaſing. I muſt needs ſay for my own Part I deſire to bleſs God for <hi>that humble, and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian-like Temper</hi> he appears to be in; and can't but hope that God deſigns to uſe him as an Inſtrument of greater Service to the Honour of Chriſt, and the good of his Church. I am Sir with great Reſpect your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Brother and humble Servant,</p>

            <head>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi>'s Retractations.</head>
            <p>ALTHO' I don't queſtion at all, but there is great Reaſon to bleſs God for a <hi>glorious and wonderful Work of his Power and Grace</hi> in the <hi>Edification</hi> of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Converſion</hi> of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the <hi>neighbouring Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>ſeveral other Parts,</hi> within a few Years paſt; and believe that the Lord hath favoured me, tho' moſt unworthy, with ſeveral others of his Servants, in granting ſpecial Aſſiſtance and Succeſs; the Glory of all which be given to JEHOVAH, to whom alone it belongs:</p>
            <p>Yet after frequent Meditation and Deſires that I might be enabled to apprehend Things juſtly, and, I hope I may ſay, mature Conſideration; I am now fully convinced and perſuaded, that <hi>ſeveral Appendages</hi> to <hi>this glorious Work</hi> are no eſſential Parts thereof, but of a <hi>different</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Nature and Tendency; <hi>which Appendages</hi> I have been in the Time of the Work very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious in and inſtrumental of promoting, by a miſguided Zeal: being further much influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Affair by the <hi>falſe Spirit;</hi> which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005374_0004_101828301AB979F8"/>
by me, did (as I have been brought to ſee ſince) prompt me to <hi>unjuſt Apprehenſions</hi> and <hi>Miſconduct</hi> in <hi>ſeveral Articles;</hi> which have been great Blemiſhes to the Work of God, very grievous to ſome of God's Children, no leſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring and corrupting to others of them, a ſad Means of many Perſons queſtioning the Work of God, concluding and appearing againſt it, and of the hardening of Multitudes in their Sins, and an awful Occaſion of the Enemies blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the right Ways of the Lord; and withal very offenſive to that God, before whom I would lie in the Duſt, proſtrate in deep Humility and Repentance on this Account, imploring Pardon for the Mediator's Sake, and thankfully accepting the Tokens thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Articles,</hi> which I eſpecially refer to, and would in the moſt public Manner <hi>retract,</hi> and <hi>warn others againſt,</hi> are theſe which follow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The Method I us'd for a conſiderable Time, with Reſpect to ſome, yea many <hi>Miniſters</hi> in ſeveral Parts, in openly <hi>expoſing ſuch as I fear'd or thought unconverted, in public Prayer or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe:</hi> herein making my private Judgment, (in which alſo I much ſuſpect I was miſtaken in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtances, and I believe alſo that my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning ſeveral, was formed raſhly and upon very ſlender Grounds.) I ſay making my
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005374_0005_10180F22C6CCD458"/>
private Judgment, the Ground of public Actions or Conduct; offending, as I apprehend (altho' in the Time of it ignorantly) againſt the <hi>ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> and ſuch other Paſſages of Scripture, as are ſimilar; yea, I may ſay, offending againſt the Laws both of Juſtice and Charity: Which Laws were further broken,</p>
            <p n="2">II. By my <hi>adviſing and urging to ſuch Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from <hi>thoſe Miniſters,</hi> whom I treated as above, as I believe may juſtly be called raſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, and of ſad and awful Tendency and Conſequence. And here I would aſk the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of thoſe Miniſters, whom I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured in both theſe Articles.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I confeſs I have been much led aſtray by <hi>following Impulſes</hi> or Impreſſions as a Rule of Conduct, whether they came with or without a Text of Scripture; and my neglecting alſo duly to obſerve the Analogy of Scripture: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded this was a great Means of corrupting my Experiences and carrying me off from the Word of God, and a great Handle, which the <hi>falſe Spirit</hi> has made uſe of with Reſpect to a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and me eſpecially.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I believe further that I have done much Hurt to Religion by <hi>encouraging private Perſons to a miniſterial and authoritative Kind or Method of exhorting;</hi> which is particularly obſervable in many ſuch being much puft up and <hi>falling into
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005374_0006_101828356D61B8B8"/>
the Snare of the Devil,</hi> while many others are thus directly prejudic'd againſt the Work.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I have Reaſon to be deeply humbled that I have not been duly careful to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or prevent Prejudice, (where I now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I might then have done it conſiſtently with Duty) which appear'd remarkable in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. I practis'd, of <hi>ſinging with others in the Streets</hi> in Societies frequently.</p>
            <p>I would alſo penitently confeſs and bewail my <hi>great Stiffneſs</hi> in retaining theſe <hi>aforeſaid Errors</hi> a great while, and Unwillingneſs to examine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them with any Jealouſy of their being Errors, notwithſtanding the friendly Counſels and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of real Friends, eſpecially in the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>Here may properly be added a Paragraph or two, taken out of a <hi>Letter from me</hi> to Mr. <hi>Barber</hi> at <hi>Georgia;</hi> a <hi>true Copy</hi> of which I gave Conſent ſhould be publiſh'd lately at <hi>Philadelphia:</hi> 
               <q>— I would add to what Brother <hi>T</hi>— hath written on the awful Affair of Books and Cloaths at <hi>New-London,</hi> which affords Grounds of deep and laſting Humiliation; I was to my Shame be it ſpoken, the Ringleader in <hi>that horrid Action;</hi> I was, my dear Brother, under the powerful Influence of the <hi>falſe Spirit</hi> almoſt one whole Day together, and Part
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005374_0007_1018283AA30D7AF0"/>
of ſeveral Days. The Lord ſhewed me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that the Spirit I was then acted by was in it's Operations void of true inward Peace, laying the greateſt Streſs on Externals, neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Heart, full of Impatience, Pride and Arrogance; altho' I thought in the Time of it, that 'twas the Spirit of God in an high Degree; awful indeed! my Body eſpecially my Leg much diſorder'd at the ſame Time,<note n="*" place="bottom">I had the <hi>long Fever</hi> on me and the cankry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour raging at once.</note> which Satan and my evil Heart might make ſome Handle of.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now may the holy wiſe and good God, be pleas'd to guard and ſecure me againſt <hi>ſuch Errors</hi> for the future, and ſtop the Progreſs of thoſe, whether Miniſters or People, who have been corrupted by my Words or Example in any of the above mention'd Particulars; and if it be his holy Will, bleſs <hi>this public Recantation</hi> to this Purpoſe. And Oh! may he grant withal, that ſuch as by Reaſon of the aforeſaid <hi>Errors and Miſconduct</hi> have entertained unhappy Prejudices againſt Chriſtianity in general, or the late glorious Work of God in particular, may by this Account learn to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Appendage</hi> from the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> or <hi>Eſſence,</hi> that which is <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>odious</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:005374_0008_1018283E46B27A40"/>
from that which is <hi>precious, glorious</hi> and <hi>divine,</hi> and thus be entirely and happily freed from all thoſe Prejudices refer'd to, and this in infinite Mercy through Jeſus Chriſt: and to theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts may all God's Children, whether Miniſters or others ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
