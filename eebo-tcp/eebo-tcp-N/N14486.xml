            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE writer of the following ſheets has thrown together a few facts, to obviate ſome miſtakes which have been embraced, reſpecting the Natives of this land; he neither wiſhes to flatter thoſe of his own colour by acknowledging that they are ſuperior to the tawney Indian; otherwiſe than as they excel him in acts of beneſicence and of an imitation of the the great Author of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whoſe name they have aſſumed; nor to exalt the character of the poor untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored Indian, at the expenſe of truth, by over-rating their chaſtity, their love of juſtice, and hoſpitality; particularly in their affectionate reception of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors on their firſt ſettlement of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; nor to ſay more in their favour than is ſupported by the concurrent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of hiſtorians of various religious profeſſions and different nations.</p>
            <p>Neither is it intended to juſtify theſe people in any of their acts of cruelty:
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018356_0003_0FA6A315B5C7D668"/>The motives which have induced the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to engage in this publication are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to party views; an apprehenſion of duty, and univerſal good-will to mankind. And if the Indian is repreſented to have been oppreſſed and injured, it is not to provoke a ſpirit of retaliation, nor to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a diſcontent, but to ſtate to the view of the public, wherein they have been aggrieved; and wherein they have been culpable, that the people of theſe ſtates may ſee they have not been free from blame, in hopes that a more candid and indulgent conſideration of their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may excite in us humanity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</p>
            <p>Be not offended therefore if the Indian is repreſented as a rational being as well as ourſelves, if having an immortal ſoul, capable of receiving the refining influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our holy religion, it is that he may be allowed to dwell in ſafety, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in the opportunity, which a return of peace, may afford to inſtruct him in the knowledge of the true God.</p>
            <p>If doubts ſhould remain, whether the Indians are, indeed ſuſceptible of thoſe religious impreſſions as here mentioned; the reader is referred to the ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the ſucceſsful labours of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <head>SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE <hi>INDIAN NATIVES</hi> OF THIS CONTINENT.</head>
            <p>SITUATE as we are on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent with very extenſive frontiers, bordering upon a vaſt wilderneſs, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the native Indians, it becomes a ſubject worthy the moſt ſerious attention of every friend of mankind, every lover of his country, to be truly informed what is the ſituation and diſpoſition of that people, ſo far as it may have an influence upon our duty as Chriſtians, and our peace and ſafety as members of Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: And that we may not make a raſh
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018356_0006_0FA6A31C9F840DE0"/>eſtimate of our own importance, or of the incapacity of thoſe people for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous improvement, the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and quotations are recommended to the ſerious peruſal of every reader, as they give a view of the opinions of ſome of the early ſettlers, of different deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, in this continent.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſettlers of Pennſylvania, who had full opportunities of being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the nature and diſpoſition of the Natives, and who made it a principal point to obſerve ſtrict juſtice in all their tranſactions with them, have left us very favourable memorials of the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued kindneſs they experienced from theſe people: the great diſadvantages to which their ignorance and roving temper ſubjected them, our forefathers thought it their duty to endeavour to draw them from, by exemplary acts of benevolence and inſtruction; which pious practice has ſince been ſucceſsfully purſued, by ſeveral well diſpoſed perſons in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, New-Jerſey, and elſewhere: ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of whom have tranſmitted ſatisfactory accounts of their labours.</p>
            <p>From theſe publications as well as from the remembrance of ſome yet living, it is evident, that the natural diſpoſition of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018356_0007_0FA6A31D3B469F20"/>the Indians has generally been to ſhew kindneſs to the Europeans, in their early ſettlements; and that their mental pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are equally with our own capable of improvement; that the apparent differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in them, as well as in the Black Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and us, ariſes principally from the advantages of our education, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of life.</p>
            <p>Some writers have repreſented Indians as naturally ferocious, treacherous, and ungrateful, and endeavoured to eſtabliſh this character of them, from ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular tranſaction which hath happened on ſpecial occaſions: but no concluſion of their original character ſhould be drawn from inſtances in which they have been provoked, to a degree of fury and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, by unjuſt and cruel treatment from European Aggreſſors; of which moſt hiſtories of the firſt ſettlements on this continent furniſh inſtances, and which writers have endeavoured to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and vindicate, by reprobating the character of thoſe poor people.</p>
            <p>It is a matter of fact, proved by moſt Hiſtorical Accounts of the trade carried on with the Indians at our firſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, as well as in the firſt ſettlements made on this continent, that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018356_0008_0FA6A31E12A2B8B0"/>they generally manifeſted themſelves to be kind, hoſpitable and generous to the Europeans, ſo long as they were treated with juſtice and humanity; but when the adventurers from a thirſt of gain, over reached the Natives, and they faw ſome of their friends and relations treacherouſly entrapped and carried away to be ſold for ſlaves, <note n="*" place="bottom">Amongſt the many inſtances of this kind which might be given, that are recorded by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent authors, the following is moſt ſtriking, viz. One Hunt, an early trader with the Indians of New-England, after a proſperous trade with the Natives, enticed between 20 or 30 on board his veſſel, and contrary to the public faith, clapped them under hatches, and ſold them to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards at Malaga; but the Indians reſented it, and revenged themſelves on the next Engliſh that came on the coaſt. Neal's Hiſtory of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, page 21.</note> themſelves injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly treated and driven from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive poſſeſſions, what could be expected but that ſuch a ſordid conduct in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, would produce a change of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the Indians. The early ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers of New-Jerſey have always confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the teſtimony of the Pennſylvanians, with reſpect to the good uſage they met
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018356_0009_0FA6A31EB6BED4E0"/>with from the Indians. The writer of the Hiſtory of that Province informs us, page 440, <q>That, for almoſt a centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Natives had all along maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intercourſe of great cordiality and friendſhip with the inhabitants.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known that the Indians' de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment to each other is peaceable and inoffenſive; eſteeming ſudden anger un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming and ignominious; they ſeldom differ with their neighbour, or do them any harm or injury, except when intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by ſtrong liquor, of which they are fond, to an enormous degree: this is the general character given of Indians, by all impartial writers.</p>
            <p>The noted French author Charlevoix, who appears to have been deep in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries into their manners and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in his long travels from Quebec, thro' the lakes and down the Miſſiſſipi to Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, informs, <q>That with a mein and appearance altogether ſavage; and with manners and cuſtoms which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the greateſt barbarity, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans enjoy all the advantages of ſociety. At firſt view, ſays he, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them without form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, law or ſubordination, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the wildeſt caprice; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018356_0010_0FA6A32259C30438"/>they rarely deviate from certain maxims and uſages founded on good ſenſe alone, which holds the place of law, and ſupplies in ſome ſort, the want of legal authority. <note n="*" place="bottom">Human Nature, even in its rudeſt ſtate, is poſſeſſed of a ſtrong ſenſe of right and wrong; a pure principle which is not confined to any name or form, but diffuſes itſelf as univerſally as the ſun; it is <q>
                        <hi>That light which enlightens every man coming into the world.</hi>
                     </q> John i. 9. All thoſe who vield to its impreſſions are brethren in the full extent of the expreſſion, however differing in other reſpects.</note> Reaſon alone is capable of retaining them in a kind of ſubordination; not the leſs effectual, towards the end propoſed, for being entirely voluntary. They manifeſt much ſtability in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have ſolemnly entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; patient in affliction, as well as in their ſubmiſſion to what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend to be the appointment of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; in all which they manifeſt a nobleneſs of ſoul, and conſtancy of mind, at which we rarely arrive with all our Philoſophy and Religion. As they are neither ſlaves to ambition, nor
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018356_0011_0FA6A324A8FB2E30"/>intereſt; the two paſſions which have ſo much weakened in us thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of humanity, which the kind Author of Nature has engraven in the human heart, and kindled thoſe of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, which are as yet generally unknown amongſt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not notorious that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally kinder to us than we are to them? There is ſcarce an inſtance occurs, but that they treat every white man, who comes amongſt them, with reſpect; which is not the caſe from us to them.</p>
            <p>Their modeſt conduct to women who have been captured by them, is certainly worthy of commendation, much exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what would be expected, in like caſes, from the lower claſs amongſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is alſo acknowledged by all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſons, who have been converſant with Indians, that they have generally manifeſted a faithfulneſs to the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have entered into for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of any perſon they have undertaken to protect, far exceeding that to be found amongſt the generality of white people; as alſo in the performance of thoſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants which they have confirmed by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belts of wampum.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018356_0012_0FA6A3262CFB80C0"/>
Charlevoix farther obſerves, <q>That whoever inſinuates himſelf in their eſteem, will ſind them ſufficiently do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile to do any thing he deſires; but that this is not eaſily gained, as they generally give it to merit only, of which they are as good judges as moſt amongſt us. He adds, that theſe good diſpoſitions are very much eclipſed by the cruelty they ſometimes exerciſe upon ſuch of their enemies, whom they have devoted to death; as well as the right they almoſt univerſally claim to private revenge. They conſider it as a point of honour to avenge inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to their friends, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the death of a relation; blood for blood, death for death, can only ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the ſurviving friends of the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red party.</q> Something of the ſame law of retaliation was uſual amongſt the ancient Jews and Romans.</p>
            <p>From this principle, as well as from the high notions they have of military glory, the young Indians ſometimes ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly purſue violent meaſures, contrary to the mind of their elders.</p>

            <p>The good diſpoſition of the more ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Indians is ſenſibly ſet forth by De las Caſas, Biſhop of Chapia, who ſpent much time and labour in endeavouring to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Indians of New-Spain, from the grievous oppreſſion they laboured under, in his repreſentation to the King and Council of Spain, which, with little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, may well be applied to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of moſt parts of the continent. He ſays, <q>I was one of the firſt who went to America, neither curioſity nor intereſt prompted me to undertake ſo long and dangerous a voyage; the ſaving the ſouls of the Heathens was my ſole object. Why was I not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, even at the expenſe of my blood, to ranſom ſo many thouſands of ſouls who fell unhappy victims to avarice or luſt.—It is ſaid, that barbarous executions were neceſſary to puniſh or check the rebellion of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018356_0014_0FA6A32705788B10"/>Americans; but to whom was this owing? did not thoſe people receive the Spaniards who firſt came amongſt them, with gentleneſs and humanity? did they not ſhew more joy, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, in laviſhing treaſure upon them, than the Spaniards did greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in receiving it?—but our ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice was not yet ſatisfied—tho' they gave up to us their land and their riches, we would take from them their wives, their children, and their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—To blacken theſe unhappy people, their enemies aſſert, that they are ſcarce human creatures—but it is we ought to bluſh for having been leſs men, and more barbarous than they.—They are repreſented as a ſtupid people, addicted to vice;— but have they not contracted moſt of their vices from the examples of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? And as to thoſe vices peculiar to themſelves, have not the Chriſtians quickly exceeded them therein? Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it muſt be granted, that the Indians ſtill remain untainted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vices, uſual amongſt the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; ſuch as ambition, blaſphemy, treachery, and many like monſters, which have not yet took place with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018356_0015_0FA6A327B8F4F2A8"/>them; they have ſcarce an idea of them, ſo that, in effect, all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we can claim, is to have more elevated notions of things, and our faculties more unfolded, and more cultivated than theirs.—Don't let us ſlatter our corruptions, nor volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily blind ourſelves; all nations are equally free: one nation has no right to infringe upon the freedom of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: let us do towards thoſe people, as we would have them to have done to us, if they had landed upon our ſhore, with the ſame ſuperiority of ſtrength. And, indeed, why ſhould not things be equal on both ſides. How long has the right of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt been allowed to be the balance of juſtice. What part of the Goſpel gives a ſanction to ſuch a doctrine. In what part of the whole earth did the Apoſtles and firſt promulgators of the Goſpel, ever claim a right over the lives, the freedom, or the ſubſtance of the Gentiles. What a ſtrange me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod this of propagating the Goſpel, that holy law of grace, which from being ſlaves to ſatan, initiates us into the freedom of the children of God.</q>

               </gap>, in his Hiſtory of Louiſiana, who during a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſixteen years, appears to have been careful in his enquiries, relating to the nature and diſpoſition of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations ſeated in a ſpace of 1500 miles on both ſides the Miſſiſſipi, with ſome of whom he was intimately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, whom he repreſents as generally endowed with good ſenſe, kindneſs and moderation. He tells us, <q>That upon an acquaintance with the Indians, he was convinced that it is wrong to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them Savages, as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making a good uſe of their reaſon, and their ſentiments are juſt; that they have a degree of prudence, faithfulneſs and generoſity, exceeding that of nations who would be offended at being compared with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No people, he ſays, are more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitable and free than the Indians; hence they might be eſteemed an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py people, if that happineſs was not impeded by their paſſionate fondneſs for ſpirituous liquors, and the fooliſh notion they hold in common, with many profeſſing Chriſtians, of gaining reputation and eſteem, by their prow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018356_0017_0FA6A32B3691F498"/>in war:</q> both which potent evils, have from views of policy or intereſt, been much encouraged by their Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean neighbours."</p>
            <p>From him, as alſo from ſome other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, we learn that ſome of theſe nations appear but little inclined to war, and there are others who abſolutely refuſe to take any part therein, but patiently bear the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips which the violence of other Indians ſubjects them to; of which good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we have had inſtances amongſt ourſelves in the caſe of the Moravian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</p>
            <p>Dupratz obſerves upon the whole, <q>That there needs but prudence and good ſenſe, to perſuade the Indians to what is reaſonable, and to preſerve their friendſhip without interruption. He adds, We may ſafely affirm that the differences we have had with them, have been more owing to us than to them. When they are treated inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently or oppreſſively, they have no leſs ſenſibility of injuries than others.

Many more authors might be quoted, declarative of the commendable qualities which have appeared in the Indians, whilſt uncorrupted by an intercourſe with the Europeans, and which is ſtill the caſe in the diſpoſition of thoſe nations ſituated at a diſtance from us. <note n="*" place="bottom">Note, In a late Hiſtory of the Britiſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in North-America, printed in 1773, p. 219, the Author ſpeaking of the Natives, ſays, <q>The nearer the Indians of Canada are viewed, the more good qualities are diſcovered in them; for moſt of the principles which ſerve to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their conduct; the general maxims by which they govern themſelves; and the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of their character, diſcover nothing of the barbarian.</q>
                  <p>Of the Five Nation Indians, M. Delapoterie. a French Author, (wherein he very much agrees with Cadwalader Colden, late preſident of New-York) in his account of thoſe Indians, ſays, <q>They are thought by a common miſtake, to be mere barbarians, always thirſting for human blood; but their true character is very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: they are indeed the fierceſt and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable people in North-America; and at the ſame time, as politic and judicious, as well can be conceived, which appears from the management of all the affairs they tranſact, not only with the French and Engliſh, but likewiſe with almoſt all the Indian Nations of this vaſt continent.</q>

                     <q>Speaking of the Cherokees, and other South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Indians, page 157, he ſays, Theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans look upon the end of life, to be living happily; and for this purpoſe, their whole cuſtoms are calculated to prevent avarice, which they think imbitters life; and nothing is a more ſevere reflection amongſt them, than to ſay, <hi>That a man loves his own.</hi> To prevent the riſe and propagation of ſuch a vice, upon the death of any Indian, they burn all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the deceaſed, that there may be no temptation for the parent to hoard up a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of arms, and domeſtic conveniences for his children. They ſtrengthen this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, by a ſuperſtition, that it is agreeable to the ſoul of the deceaſed, to burn all they leave, and that affliction follow thoſe who uſe any of their goods. They cultivate no more land than is neceſſary for their plentiful ſubſiſtance, and hoſpitality to ſtrangers.</q>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018356_0019_0FA6A330018841F8"/>appears from accounts left us by Jonathan Carver, who from the year 1766, to the year 1768, incluſive, viſited ſeveral Nations weſt of the river Miſſiſſipi, and the upper lakes. Speaking of the general temper of the Indians ſituate in thoſe parts, he tells us, <q>They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely liberal to each other, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the deficiencies of their friends, with any ſuperfluity of their own
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018356_0020_0FA6A3312C035580"/>—That governed by the plain and equitable laws of Nature, every one is remarked ſolely according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; and their equality, condition, manners and privileges, with that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſociable familiarity which prevails thro' every Indian Nation, animates them with a pure and truly patriotic ſpirit, that tends to the general good of the Society to which they belong. The Indians, he ſays, are not without ſome ſenſe of Religion, ſuch as proves that they worſhip the great Creator, with a degree of purity unknown to nations who have greater opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of improvement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>That the pleas of Indians for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing war, are in general more rational and juſt, than ſuch as are brought by Europeans, in vindication of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. To ſecure the rights of hunting—to maintain the liberty of paſſing thro' their accuſtomed tracts, and to guard thoſe lands which they conſider, from a long tenure, as their own, againſt any infringment, are the general cauſes of thoſe diſſenſions which ſo often break out between the Indian Nations. He agrees with Charlevoix, that the Indians feel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018356_0021_0FA6A3317B6093A8"/>with exquiſite ſenſibility; whence they purſue vegeance with unremitting ardour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt in the Indian Country, he was inſtrumental in preventing the Chipeways and Nadoweſſis Indians from proſecuting the war, which had during a courſe of 40 years, ſubſiſted between them. This, the old Indians told him, they had long wiſhed to put an end to; but that their endeavours were fruſtrated by the young warriors, of either nation, who could not reſtrain their ardour when they met. They ſaid they ſhould be happy, if ſome chief of the ſame pacific diſpoſition as himſelf, and who poſſeſſed an equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reſolution and coolneſs, would ſettle in the country between the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for by the interference of ſuch a perſon, an accommodation, which, on their part, they ſincerely deſired might be brought about. From this circumſtance, as well as what Duprat and others obſerve of the peaceable diſpoſition of ſome of the Indians, we may well conclude, that ſuſceptible as thoſe untutored people are, to the dictates of reaſon, if the profeſſors of Chriſtianity had, by a proper uſe of that ſuperior knowledge they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with, honeſtly laboured, thro'
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018356_0022_0FA6A332375056E0"/>Divine help, to acquaint them with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and precepts of the Goſpel; to make them ſenſible of that univerſal brotherhood that loving, meek, forgiving ſpirit, which the precepts and example of our Saviour call for, it would have been a matter of the greateſt joy both to them and us; but the reverſe has happened, except in a few particular inſtances; the different denominations of Chriſtians have rather added freſh fuel to this falſe fire, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the poor Natives, when it has ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their political purpoſe, to violence amongſt themſelves, and to become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the wars they have waged one againſt another.</p>
            <p>A diſpoſition to miſrepreſent and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Indians, in order to juſtify, or palliate the practice of unjuſt and cruel meaſures towards them, has particularly appeared in the affecting caſe of thoſe Indians, denominated Moravian Indians, ſettled on the Muſkingum, a branch of the Ohio; who have, of late, deeply ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on account of what they thought the peaceable ſpirit of the Goſpel requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them. A true repreſentation of the ſtate and diſpoſition of thoſe Indians, as well as an account of this deplorable tranſaction, drawn from the account giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018356_0023_0FA6A33369725DE8"/>by the ſurvivors, appears neceſſary, as well to reſcue thoſe innocent ſufferers from the odium which has been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly caſt upon them, as to prevent ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who may come amongſt us, from forming ſuch erronious ideas of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as may have an influence upon the welfare of both them, and the White People.</p>
            <p>The firſt gathering of thoſe Indians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a good degree of civil and religious order, was about 30 years ago, by means of one of them, named Papunhank. The place of their reſidence at that time, was at Whihalooſing, on the Suſquehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, about 200 miles from Philadelphia. In the converſation they had with ſome ſerious people, in a viſit to that city, about the year 1756, at a time when the province was diſtreſſed by the Indian war, they appeared to have a feeling ſenſe of that inward change of heart which the Goſpel requires, and declared their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſapprobation of war, and fixed reſolution to take no part therein; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending it to be diſpleaſing to the Great Being, who, as one of them expreſſed it, <q>Did not make men to deſtroy men; but to love and aſſiſt each other.</q> They held a conference with the Governor,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018356_0024_0FA6A33567B38B30"/>in which they informed him, <q>That they remembered the old friendſhip which ſubſiſted between their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ours; that they were great lovers of peace, and had not taken any part in the war.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They delivered three white priſoners which they had recovered from the other Indians. They deſired that no ſtrong drink ſhould be given them, nor be ſent to their town. The ſpeaker, Papun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hank, appeared ſerious, as under a ſenſe of the Divine Preſence, and concluded with a ſolemn prayer, with which the whole audience ſeemed much affected.</p>
            <p>About 13 years paſt, theſe Indians meeting with difficulty, from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of White Settlers near them, by which ſpirituous liquors were brought to their towns; they removed to the Muſkingum, a branch of the Ohio. In their perigrination thither, they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſome of the Moravians, who have long reſided with them, and by their careful attention, both to their civil and religious concerns, never leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, even in the times of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt danger and difficulty, a near and ſteady connection between them took place.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="unknown:018356_0025_0FA6A335F6354DD8"/>
            <p>During the late troubles, theſe Indians adhering to the principles they had long profeſſed, abſolutely refuſed to take any part in the war, notwithſtanding the threats and repeated abuſes they received on that account from other tribes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe parties which paſſed thro' their towns, in their way to our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers; whom they ſometimes diſſuaded from their hoſtile intentions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to go back again; or warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the inhabitants of their danger. This humane conduct being conſidered as obſtructive to the hoſtile proceedings of the Tribes at war, was at length made the pretence of carrying them off. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, on the 4th of Auguſt, 1781, a ſtring of Wampum was ſent by the Chief of the Wyondats, who reſided at Sanduſky, with a meſſage, letting them know, He was coming with a number of warriors; but biding them be not afraid, for he was their friend. In a few days after, 220 warriors arrived, when call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a council of the head men of the three Moravian towns, they acquainted them they were come to take them away; ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it for a reaſon, <q>That they, and their Indians, were a great obſtruction to them in their war-path.</q> They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018356_0026_0FA6A339040B6298"/>them this anſwer: <q>That it was impoſſible for them to remove at that time, and leave their corn behind them, leſt they and their children ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with hunger in the wilderneſs.</q> To this, the Chief of the Wyondats, at firſt, ſeemed to attend; but being inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by ſome white men in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, they perſiſted in their reſolution; and after killing many of the cattle and hogs, ripping up their bedding, and committing many other outrages, on the 28th of Auguſt, and September, forced them from their three towns, in all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 3 and 400 perſons; who, after a tedious journey in the wilderneſs, arrived at a branch of Sanduſky creek, where the body of them were ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main. Some of their principal men were ſent to Major Arent Schuyler De Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the Engliſh Commander at fort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troit, who commended them, as a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able people, and exhorted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſuch; but added, That many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints had been made of them; that they had given intelligence to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c. he had ſent for them; but that his inſtructions had been exceeded, in the ill-treatment they had received; that however he would provide for them.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018356_0027_0FA6A339B7785910"/>Thus the matter reſted till the ſpring, 1782, when theſe Moravian Indians fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding corn ſcarce and dear at Sanduſky, deſired liberty to return to their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to fetch ſome of their corn, of which they had leſt above 200 acres ſtanding; which when granted, many of them went, among whom were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral widows with their children, ſome of whom had been ſubjected to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme want, as to eat the carcaſes of the dead cattle and horſes.</p>
            <p>When the people at and about the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nongahela, underſtood a number of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were at the Moravian towns, they gave out, that the intention of thoſe people was, to fall upon the back inhabitants, which ought to be prevented. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon about 160 men got together, and ſwimming their horſes over the Ohio, came ſuddenly upon the chief Moravian town. The firſt perſon who appeared, they ſhot at and wounded, when coming up to him, they found he was an half Indian, ſon to John Bull, one of the Moravians, by an Indian woman, to whom he is regularly married; they killed and ſcalped him, and proceeded to the town. The Moravian Indians, who were moſtly in the fields pulling
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018356_0028_0FA6A33A86EF67E8"/>corn, did not run off, as many of them might, if they had been conſcious of any offence; but came of their own accord, into the town, at the call of the white people, who at firſt, expreſſed friendſhip to them; but ſoon after, violently ſeized and bound them, when the Helpers, <note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are Indians who aſſiſt the miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in keeping good order amongſt their people, and upon occaſion, give public exhortations.</note> of whom there were five of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable, in the company, and others exhorted the younger, to ſubmiſſion and patience; telling them, they thought their troubles in this world, would ſoon be at an end, and they would be with their Saviour. They then ſung and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, till they were led out, one after the other, and inhumanly ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; firſt the men, and then the women. Two boys, who made their eſcape, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe particulars. One of them lay in the heap of the dead, in a houſe, and was ſcalped; but recovering his ſenſes, eſcaped: the other, who had hid himſelf under the floor, was an eye-witneſs of this tragic ſcene, and ſaw the blood of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018356_0029_0FA6A33C72652B38"/>the ſlain running in a ſtream. Theſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans before being bound, were ſo little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of being charged with guilt, that they informed the White People, that more of their brethren were at another town to which they accompanied them; who in like manner fell a ſacrifice with them, to the barbarity of the whites. The dead bodies were afterwards burned with the houſes. Before their death, they were alſo obliged to ſhew in what part of the woods they had concealed their effects, when the other Indians (as before mentioned) took them away.</p>
            <p>Thoſe at the third town having ſome intelligence of what paſſed, made their eſcape. One of the Helpers, who eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed relates, That in a conference they had with the other Helpers, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered what they ſhould do in caſe of an attack, either from the Americans, or the Indians, who had taken part with the Engliſh, ſome of whom charged them of having, thro' the intelligence they gave to the Virginians, been the occaſion of the ſlaughter of their brethren, at Goſchaching; the reſult of their confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was, <q>Not to go away, nevertheleſs to leave each one to act according to the feeling of his own heart. He added,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018356_0030_0FA6A340940A7288"/>That there was ſo much love amongſt them, that he had never felt the like before.</q> This is a ſummary of this dreadful tranſaction, as it is given by the principle leader of thoſe that remain.</p>
            <p>The Account, as it ſtands in the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania Gazette, of April 17th, 1782, after giving an account of the incurſions of the Indians, adds, <q>That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being greatly alarmed, and having received intelligence that the Indian towns, on the Muſkingum, had not moved as they had been told—a number of men properly provided, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and rendevouſed on the Ohio, oppoſite the Mingo Bottom, with a deſign to ſurpriſe the above towns —160 men ſwam the river, and proceeded to the towns on the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingum, where the Indians had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected a large quantity of proviſions to ſupply their war-parties. They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the town in the night, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, attacked the Indians in their cabbins, and ſo completely ſurpriſed them, that they killed and ſcalped upwards of 90, but a few making their eſcape, about 40 of which were warriors, the reſt old women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. About 80 horſes fell into their
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018356_0031_0FA6A3420A8EB688"/>hands, which they loaded with the plunder, the greateſt part furrs and ſkins; and returned to the Ohio, without the loſs of one man.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is alledged, in vindication of this deliberate maſſacre, that 40 of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were warriors, preparing to attack our frontiers; but this aſſertion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts it ſelf: for had it been the caſe, it is not likely they would have brought their wives, with the widows, and 34 children, who were ſlain with them, or have ſuffered them with themſelves, to be thus murdered, without making the leaſt reſiſtance, or hurt to their murderers.</p>
            <p>Soon after the death of theſe Indians, about 500 men, probably encouraged by this eaſy conqueſt aſſembled at the old Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos on the weſt ſide of the Ohio, and being equipped, on horſeback, ſet on for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſky, where the remaining part of the Moravian Indians reſided, in order to deſtroy that ſettlement, and other Indian towns in thoſe parts; but the Wyandots, and other Indians, having ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their approach, met them near Sanduſky, when an engagement enſued, in which ſome of the aſſailants were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſeveral taken priſoners, amongſt whom was the Commander Col. Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018356_0032_0FA6A342C3C51298"/>and his ſon-in-law. The Col. the Indians put to a cruel death, and killed the other, with other priſoners.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the cruelty exerciſed on the Col. and the death of the priſoners taken at Sanduſky, was, in a great meaſure, owing to the murder of the peaceable Moravian Indians, at which they expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>This grievous tranſaction appears in a yet more afflictive point of view, when it is conſidered, that tho' many threats had been thrown out againſt thoſe Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, both by the Engliſh and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, <note n="*" place="bottom">As the Wyondat King in his Speech told them, <q>My couſins, you Chriſtian Indians, in Gnadenhutten, Shoenbrun and Salem. I am concerned on your account, as I ſee you live in a dangerous ſituation. Two mighty and angry Gods ſtand oppoſite to each other, with their mouths wide open, and you ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and are in danger of being cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the one or the other of them, or both, and crombled with their teeth.</q> To which the Chriſtian Indians anſwered, Uncle, &amp;c. &amp;c. you Shawanees our Nephews—We have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto not ſeen our ſituation ſo dangerous as not to ſtay here. We live in peace with all mankind, and have nothing to do with the war. We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and requeſt no more, than that we may be permitted to live in peace and quiet—We will preſerve your words and conſider them— and ſand you, Uncle, an anſwer.</note> yet they took no ſtep for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018356_0033_0FA6A343764A48F0"/>truſting in the care of Heaven, and the protection of the government, under which they had lived many years with due ſubmiſſion. But ſuch is the corrupting nature of war, that it gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hardens the heart, to a fearful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of inſenſibility. Yet ſurely a time of rouſing muſt come, when, if not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to obduracy, equal to their deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the blood of theſe innocent people will be heavy upon all concerned in the ſhedding of it.</p>
            <p>We cry out againſt Indian cruelty; but is any thing which Indians have done, (all circumſtances conſidered) more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with juſtice, reaſon, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, than the murder of thoſe Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Indians; a peaceable, innocent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe conduct, even when under the ſcalping-knife, evidenced a depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on Divine Help for ſupport, as much becoming Chriſtians, as their ſufferings in ſupport of their religious principles,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018356_0034_0FA6A345F6B8A2F0"/>and their fidelity to the government had before manifeſted them to be our ſpecial friends.</p>
            <p>In vindication of this barbarous tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, endeavours have been uſed, to make us believe, that the whole race of Indians are a people prone to every vice, and deſtitute of every virtue; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a capacity for improvement. What is this but blaſphemouſly to arraign the wiſdom of our Creator, and inſinuate, that the exiſtence He has given them, is incompatible with his moral government of the world. But this muſt be admitted to make way for the propoſal of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the univerſal extirpation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians from the face of the earth. Such, alas! is the manner in which too many of the pretended followers, of the meek and ſuffering Saviour of the world, would fulfil the prophecy concerning him, <q>
                  <hi>That he ſhall have the Heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermoſt Parts of the earth for his poſſeſſion.</hi>
               </q> And who himſelf declared, <q>
                  <hi>That he came not to deſtroy mens' lives, but to ſave them;</hi>
               </q> and when fainting in his laſt agony, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mockery and deriſion, conceived at once a prayer, and an apology for his murderers: <q>
                  <hi>Father, forgive them, they
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018356_0035_0FA6A34A803CCA80"/>know not what they do.</hi>
               </q> Now ſo far as we know the prevailance of this ſpirit of love and forgiveneſs, over the pride and warth of our hearts, ſo far are we the diſciples and followers of Chriſt; and ſo far only, can we truly pray for, and witneſs the coming of His kingdom: and on the other hand, ſo far as we are ſubject to a vindictive and unforgiving ſpirit, ſo far we are in a ſtate of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God, and reprobate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a true faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which works only by love, to the purifying of the heart from every diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a contrary nature. Was this diſtinction always obſerved in our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcriminations of mankind, we ſhould get thro' abundance of frivolous and ſuperficial prejudices which divide the Chriſtian World, and be convinced, that it is not the colour of our ſkins, out ward circumſtances or profeſſion, but the ſtate and temper of the mind and will, which makes us Jews or Gentiles; Chriſtians or Heathens; Elect or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in the ſight of God. That this change of heart is the ſure effect of the coming of Chriſt's kingdom, was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced in many of thoſe Indians, whoſe caſe is here repreſented; who, by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018356_0036_0FA6A34BA83A81F8"/>to the operations of Divine Grace, were brought to an entire reformation of mind and manners. That ſavage feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with all thoſe dazzling notions of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be gained from the deſtruction of mankind, ſo natural to the fallen ſons of Adam, have gradually melted away in theſe Indians, into a frame of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility and love, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them in that lamb-like ſubmiſſion, under that remarkable ſucceſſion of trials and afflictions which was permitted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them; whereby many of them are at length put beyond the reach of enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>We are told by a late Author, who appears zealous for the extirpation of all Indians, <q>
                  <hi>That for a keg of whiſkey, you might induce any Indian to murder his wife, children and beſt friend.</hi>
               </q> That this is not a juſt character of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, all, who are acquainted with that people, can teſtify: yet there are, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ill-diſpoſed people amongſt them, as well as amongſt us, who under the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power of ſtrong drink, (which has an uncommon bad effect on them) may be led into the greateſt enormities. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, as has been mentioned, impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial men, who from good views, have
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018356_0037_0FA6A34BB9303A70"/>viſited or reſided with them, repreſent them in a very different light: as Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levoix, and other French and Spaniſh Authors: John Elliott, Thomas Mayew; John Sergeant, in New-England; David Brainard and others in the Jerſeys; and more lately the Moravians in different parts. Theſe have ſpent much time and labour for the civil and religious improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Natives, in which they all expreſſed ſatisfaction and comfort.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy of peculiar notice, that in the wars the Indians have waged upon our frontiers, there has ſcarce been an inſtance of any of thoſe Indians, who had made a ſerious profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, having been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the barbarous eruptions againſt us. <note n="*" place="bottom">Neal, p. 30, 2d. vol. ſays, <q>There is one thing which deſerves to be taken notice of; that is, the unſhaken fidelity of the Indian Converts, during the whole courſe of the war, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſuaſion nor threatnings of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, could draw from their allegiance to the Engliſh. The government had a watchful eye upon them at firſt, and the mob being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt Indians, could hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from ſacrificing the Converts to their fury.</q>
                  <p>The ſame Author obſerves, That the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſo well ſatisfied with the fidelity of the Indians, that inſtead of diſarming them, as was deſired, the Indians on Martha's Vineyard, who were twenty to one in number to the White People, continued ſo faithful to their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they were ſupplied with all ſorts of ammunition, and the defence of the Iſland com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their care; and ſo faithful were they to their truſt, that all people that landed upon the Iſland, during the courſe of the war, were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, brought before the Governor.</p>
               </note>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:018356_0038_0FA6A34C793E2108"/>Theſe have generally put themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of their ſeveral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as former inſtances in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the inſtance of the Moravian Indians, both in the former, and late war, will undoubtedly evince.</p>
            <p>The people of Pennſylvania, and New-Jerſeys, as has been already noted, have had full opportunity to experience the good diſpoſition and kindneſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, ſo long as they were treated with juſtice and humanity, as particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the many ſtriking inſtances of probity, gratitude and beneficence, on record, at a time when the diſparity of their numbers was ſo great, that they might have eaſily deſtroyed the ſettlers,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018356_0039_0FA6A34E9FB6AED0"/>had they been ſo minded. But ſo far were they from moleſting them, that they were rather as nurſing fathers to them; granting them ample room for ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; freely aſſiſting them with the means of living, at eaſy rates; manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thro' a long courſe of years, a ſtrict care and fidelity in obſerving their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and fulfilling their other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which there is the greateſt reaſon to conclude would ſtill be the caſe, in every part of the continent, if the ſame equitable and kind meaſures were purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it is a matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted perſuaſion, with impartial peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have been converſant with Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that if their dipoſitions and natural powers are duly conſidered, they will be found to be equally with our own, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of improvement in knowledge and virtue, and that the apparent difference between us and them, is chiefly owing to our different ways of life, and different ideas of what is neceſſary and deſirable, and the advantage of education, which puts it in our power to gloſs over our own conduct, however evil; and to ſet theirs, however defenſible, in the moſt odious point of light.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:018356_0040_0FA6A34EC4623910"/>
Much of their blamable conduct, now complained of, is certainly imputable to a long continued train of fraudulent and corrupt practices, in our intercourſe with them, eſpecially, the fatal introduction of ſtrong drink, of which they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten complained, <note n="*" place="bottom">At the treaty at Carliſle, in 1753, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſay, <q>The Rum ruins us. We beg you would prevent its coming in ſuch quantities. We deſire it may be forbidden, and none ſold in the Indian country; but that if the Indians will have any, they may go amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and deal with them. When theſe Whiſkey traders come, they bring 30 or 40 Kegs, and put them before us, and make us drink, and get all the ſkins that ſhould go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by this means, we not only ruin ourſelves, but them too.</q>
                  <p>
                     <q>The wicked whiſkey ſellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them ſell their very clothes from their backs. In ſhort, if this practice be continued, we muſt be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ruined. We moſt earneſtly, therefore, beſeech you to remedy it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find an early record, in the Hiſtory of New-Jerſey to the credit of the people of that day, That at a conference they held with the Indians, where 8 Kings or Chiefs were preſent, the ſpeaker expreſſed himſelf to the following effect: <q>Strong liquors were ſold to us by the Sweeds and by the Dutch; theſe people had no eyes, they did not ſee it was hurtful to us; that it made us mad. We know it is hurtful to us. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, if people will ſell it to us, we are ſo in love with it, that we cannot forbear; but now there is a people come to live amongſt us, that have eyes; they ſee it to be for our hurt; they are willing to deny themſelves the profit, for our good. Theſe people have eyes, we are glad ſuch a people are come, we muſt put it down by mutual conſent. We give theſe 4 belts of wampum—to be a witneſs of this agreement we make with you; and would have you tell it to your children.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> and deſired it might
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018356_0041_0FA6A34F91772548"/>not be brought amongſt them, by which inſtead of allaying the ferment of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, by a good example, and the good inſtruction, which our ſuperior knowledge would enable us to give them, too many have been inſtrumental in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to a ſtate of diſtraction, which when it has burſt forth in vengeance upon ourſelves, is made a pretence for deſtroying them, as tho' they were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the aggreſſors.</p>
            <p>That Indians may be tempted or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to the perpetration of great evils, by the intemperate love and uſe of ſtrong
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018356_0042_0FA6A3503666C9D0"/>liquors, is eaſily conceived; but whether they, who, to gratify the cravings of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did avarice, furniſh them with the intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating potion, and then take advantage of their ſituation, to impoſe upon them, and tempt them to evil, are not princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally accountable, for the crimes they commit, and their conſequences, is not a query worthy of their moſt awful conſideration.</p>
            <p>Had the views of the inhabitants of the colonies, been more juſt and wiſe, and their conduct towards the Natives regulated by a benevolence worthy of the Chriſtian Name, every reaſonable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſettling in their country, might have been fully accompliſhed, and they at the ſame time become, generally, as well civilized, as thoſe few who were under the care of the Moravians, at the Muſkingum.</p>
            <p>The accounts of the wicked policy and cruelties exerciſed by the Spaniards upon their Indians, we read with horror, without conſidering how far ourſelves are in a degree guilty of ſomething of the ſame.</p>
            <p>How many peaceable Indians, reſiding amongſt us, have formerly as well as lately, been murdered, with impunity,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018356_0043_0FA6A353AEE01388"/>to ſatisfy the rage of angry men, tho' under the protection of the law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attonement being made. <note n="*" place="bottom">At the Coneſtogo Manor, Lancaſter town, and ſeveral other|inſtances.</note>
            </p>
            <p>What deſtruction both of Indians and others, thro' a violent inſringement on what they apprehended to be their rights. What dreadful havock has the deſire of gain made amongſt them, by the ſale of ſpirituous liquors, &amp;c. &amp;c. Surely this muſt be accounted for, when an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for blood takes place. Indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as well as duty, ſhould induce the people, in general, to endeavour the bringing the Indians off from thoſe falſe habits and prejudices, which are as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their own happineſs, as they are dangerous to ours.</p>
            <p>To what degree of diſtreſs, a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians can reduce a country, let the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of New-England teſtify, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the long and diſtreſſing wars with the Eaſtern Tribes, <note n="†" place="bottom">D.

The Indians were not inſenſible of this uſage; but were afraid to do themſelves juſtice, till they heared that all New-England was involved in a bloody war, when they plainly told the Engliſh, they would bear their inſults no longer."</note> who upon the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>Surely we had ſmitten the whole army of the Indians, that fought againſt us, twenty-three years ago, from one end of the land to the other; only there were left a few wounded amongſt them in the eaſt, and now they have riſen up, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and have ſet the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on fire. Certainly a more humbling matter cannot be related. Moreover, is it not a very humbling thing, that when about an hundred Indians durſt begin a war upon all theſe populous colonies, an army of a thouſand Engliſh raiſed, muſt not kill one of them all, but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, more of our ſoldiers periſhed by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardſhips, than we had ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the world.

It was, very probably, the want of ſuch a care in the people of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, particularly in the lamentable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Pequot Indians, tho' perpetrated many years before, which produced the grievous crop of calamity and diſtreſs here complained of; for however time and changes may veil paſt tranſactions, and remove them from ſight, and the remembrance of men, yet they will remain, as preſent, in the view of <hi>Divine Purity;</hi> and whilſt unrepented of, will, tho' covered, as with dirt and droſs, remain as engraven on a rock, which when the overflowing ſtream pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and that time of general inquiry, comes, when ſecret things ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, will appear as a teſtimony againſt tranſgreſſors.</p>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Neal, page 23, obſerves, relating to thoſe Pequot Indians, "That they made a noble ſtand againſt the united force of New-England, and would certainly have defended their country againſt the encroachment of the Engliſh, if the Narraganſets, their inveterate enemies, had not aſſiſted the Engliſh to deſtroy them".</note>
            </p>
            <p>This account of the deſtruction of the Pequot Indians, is by no means intended as a reflection on the people of New-England; ſenſible, that it is now long ſince many amongſt them, have been foremoſt in furniſhing inſtances of the bleſſing attendant on the extenſion of friendly meaſures, and a commendable care for the civil and religious welfare of the Indians; as well as they have of late years, ſhewn an examplary and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy concern for doing juſtice to the oppreſſed Africans: but only for this neceſſary purpoſe, that the dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of former times, may be, as inſtructive cautions in our future tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions

Indeed we cannot be too weighty in conſidering how we lay our foundation for future happineſs or miſery; as our Saviour's declaration will be verified often, in time, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in eternity: <hi>That as we ſow we ſhall reap; and with that meaſure we meet, it ſhall be meaſured to us again.</hi> And altho' the children are not accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the iniquity of their fathers; yet where the children are baſking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in the eaſe and plenty they enjoy thro' the ſins of their fathers, as is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly the caſe of thoſe, who are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of eſtates procured by hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures towards Indians, or thro' the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Negroes; theſe as they rejoice in thoſe poſſeſſions, which the SIN has produced, cannot expect otherwiſe than, <hi>to be partakers in the</hi> PLAGUE.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, if the peace and ſafety of the inhabitants of our wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended frontiers; the lives and welfare of ſo many innocent and helpleſs people, depends on the maintenance of a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercourſe with our Indian neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,

On the other hand, what greater injury can be done to our country, than to diffuſe, amongſt the thoughtleſs part of the people, a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and promote a conduct, tending not only to deprive us of the advantage, which a friendly intercourſe with them may produce; <note n="*" place="bottom">As it is expected that meaſures are now tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to procure a free communication with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Country, whereby an extenſive trade with the Natives will probably take place, and which, under proper regulation, may prove very beneficial, or the contrary, if left to the management of the Traders, who have generally no other view but gain. Is it not an object worthy the peculiar no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the different Legiſlatures, that a ſpecial guard be had againſt the evil conſequences which will certainly attend, if an effectual reſtraint is not laid on the introduction of ſpirituous liquors, and other abuſe, amongſt the Indians.</note> but by raiſing their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N an hiſtorical account of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Boquet's expedition againſt the Ohio Indians, publiſhed under his inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in 1765, we meet with a liſt of the fighting men of the different Indian na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the northern and ſouthern di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricts of North-America, amounting to fifty-ſix thouſand, five hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſiſting, chiefly, of ſuch Indians as the French were connected with in Canada and Louiſiana.</p>
            <p>This account we are there told may be depended upon, ſo far as matters of this kind can be brought near the truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given by a French trader of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable note, who had reſided many years amongſt the Indians.</p>
            <p>The publiſher of that account, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of reputation, now in this city, who has for many years made matters relating
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:018356_0054_0FA6A36176C1E9F0"/>to Indians his particular ſtudy, tells us, "That ſo large a number of fighting men may ſtartle us a firſt ſight; but the account ſeems no where exaggerated, excepting only that the Calawba nation (mentioned in the liſt to be 150 gun-men) is now almoſt extinct.</p>
            <p>In ſome nations which we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, the account falls, even ſhort of their numbers; and ſome others do not appear to be mentioned at all, or at leaſt not by any name known to us: Such for inſtance, are the lower Creeks, of whom we have a liſt, according to their towns. In this liſt their warriors or gun-men are 1180, and their inhabitants about 6000. Thus a comparative judgment may be formed of the nations above-mentioned; the number of whoſe inhabitants will (in this proportion to the warriors, viz. five to one) be about 283000."</p>
            <p>From the above account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Indians known to us, beſides thoſe we are unacquainted with, how important muſt it appear, to every ſenſible feeling mind, that a friendly intercourſe be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with them as well from our duty as Chriſtians, as the great advantage which would ariſe from a well regulated trade; and the dreadful diſtreſs and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018356_0055_0FA6A36273CAE170"/>which a diſagreement with them might bring upon ſo vaſt a number of helpleſs people, on our long extended frontiers. <note n="*" place="bottom">To thoſe who profeſs that peaceable principle, which implies a full reliance upon the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, the number, or apparent power of any adverſaries is of little weight.
<p>But it is to be obſerved, theſe are quotations from authors, not of the ſame peaceable profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and are therefore conſidered as proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe readers, who, not grounded in this peaceable uniting principle, are <hi>of contrary ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> of the neceſſity they are under, even as prudent men, <hi>upou their own principles,</hi> to conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate the friendſhip of the natives.</p>
                  <p>The common aſſertion, that if friendly and pacific meaſures were alone purſued, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe ſo diſpoſed, would become a prey to every invader. But this aſſertion cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as valid, except we believe that "the Lord has forſaken the earth;" Ezek. ix 19. but, "if the Lord reigneth," Pſ. lxliii. 1. and "we fear his name, he will be a wall of fire round about us." Zach. ii. 5.</p>
                  <p>And whatever ſuffering is permitted to come upon any, on account of their fidelity to what they may think their duty requires, in the ſupport of that peaceable government of Chriſt, <hi>the encreaſe of which,</hi> we are told by the prophet I ſaiah, <hi>there is to be no end;</hi> as in the caſe of the Moravian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, it will be but as a deliverance from their troubles in this world, and of a more exceeding weight of glory, in that which is to come.</p>

In the hiſtory of the Britiſh dominions in North-America, already mentioned, 2d. vol. page 68, we meet with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtructive obſervation: "The perpetual mereaſing generations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, in America, may ſupply num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that muſt in the end wear out theſe poor Indian inhabitants from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but we ſhall pay dear, both in blood and treaſure, in the mean while, for our injuſtice.</p>
            <p>Our frontiers, from the nature of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing ſettlements diſperſed along the branchings of the upper parts of our ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and ſcattered in the diſunited val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, amidſt the mountains, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unguarded and defenceleſs againſt the incurſions of Indians.—The farmer driven from his little cultured lot, in the woods, is loſt: The Indian in the woods, is every where at home; every buſh, every thicket, is a camp to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; from whence, at the very moment when he is ſure of his blow, he can ruſh upon his prey. In ſhort, our frontier ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements muſt ever lie at the mercy of the ſavages; and a ſettler is the natural prey to an Indian, whoſe ſole occupation is war and hunting.</p>

               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:018356_0057_0FA6A3672F696F98"/>
To countries circumſtanced as our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are, an Indian is the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of enemies. For in a war with Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, no force whatever, can defend our frontiers from being a conſtant wretched ſcene of conflagrations, and of the moſt ſhocking murders. Whereas on the contrary, our temporary expeditions againſt the Indians, even if ſucceſsful, can do them little harm. Every article of their property is portable, which they always carry with them; and it is no great matter of diſtreſs to an Indian, to be driven from his dwelling ground, who finds a home in the firſt place he ſits down upon."</p>
