            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>The 22d of <hi>May</hi> laſt, Dyed the Reverend &amp; Excellent Mr. SAMUEL MAN, Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Wrentham,</hi> in the 72d. Year of his Age; He ſerved in the Miniſtry there for <hi>Forty Eight</hi> Years, with great Diligence, Prudence, Fidelity, Pains and Chearfulneſs; tho' under long and great Bodily weakneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, to that degree, that he had not been out of his own Town for 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Years before his Death: He was Born at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and bred at the <hi>College</hi> there; and tho' his Education was attended with ſome diſadvantages, yet by the Bleſſing of GOD on his hard Studies he attained to very conſiderable Learning, Divine &amp; Humane, &amp; was very well qualify'd for a more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Station in the Church of GOD, than where he was placed, and yet from thence his Fame went thro' out
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002076_0005_0FBB7C70EE794B08"/>
the whole Country. That which made his Face to ſhine, was his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Holineſs before GOD, his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Prudence, Humility, Meekneſs and Charity before Men; Modeſt even to Exceſs. His Divinity was Solid, Well-grounded &amp; Orthodox, of the Old Puritan Stamp; His Preaching as it was the effect of hard Study, Prayer &amp; Reading: ſo it proved very Grave, Learned, Methodical and Accurate. His ordinary Sermons were fit for the Preſs; and yet ſuch his humility, that he thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his worth Publiſhing. He Lived and Dyed with the Intereſt of GOD, the Church in General, His Country, and his own Charge in ſpecial, much upon his Heart. The Laſt Sermon he Preached, which was on the Firſt Day of <hi>March</hi> laſt (being Lord's-Day,) was from thoſe words, Eccl. 1.14. <hi>I have ſeen all the works that are done under the Sun, &amp; behold all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>CHRIST takes notice of the Means of Grace and the Succeſs of thoſe Means becauſe both come from Himſelf.</hi> The Means of Grace ſpring from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Covenant between His Father and Himſelf. <hi>Iſai</hi> 42.6. &amp; 49.6. I <hi>will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayſt be my Salvation unto the ends of the Earth,</hi> (to enlighten them with the Word.) It is CHRIST that has made a <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of the Means of Grace, and of a bleſſing upon thoſe Means. Zech. 9.11. <hi>By the blood of thy covenant I have ſent forth the priſoners out of the pit wherein there is no water.</hi> Gal. 3.13, 14. <hi>Abrahams</hi> bleſſing was the Covenant of Grace, &amp; the diſpenſation thereof in the Means of Grace, &amp; the ſaving bleſſing on the diſpenſation; and the inheritance of the Heavenly Canaan thro' that bleſſing. Yea the Means of Grace are procured, &amp; are continued to a Perſon or People by CHRIST's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002076_0061_0FBB7CDFE922B360"/>
Pſal. 2.8. <hi>Ask of me &amp; I will give thee the heathen for thine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the ends of the earth for thy poſſeſſion.</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. For he ſaith, <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Iſai. 49.7, 8. which is God's Speech to Chriſt about giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Day &amp; Means of Grace in anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to His interceſſion. Moreover the Means of Grace &amp; the Succeſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are diſpenſed and ordered by the Hand of Chriſt. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.16, 20. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Gifts of the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of His Father, &amp; He gives them unto Men. And He diſpoſes of Men Miniſterially gifted here and there according to His good pleaſure, and He gives or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the ſucceſs as pleaſeth Him; as He commands the Rain to fall on one City, and not on another, and bleſſeth the Seed ſown as He pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>CHRIST obſerves how long He is with a Perſon or People by the Miniſtry of the Word, becauſe He is His Fathers Servant in this matter, and muſt give account of all that God has given Him.</hi> Iſai. 49.3, 4, 5, 6. Joh. 17.12. Heb. 2.13.

               <hi>Behold I and the Children which God hath given me. Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition.</hi> CHRIST gives account, and therefore muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. CHRIST takes notice not only of the Congregation in general, but of every particular Perſon in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; as He did of the fruitleſs Fig-tree. Luk. 13.7. <hi>Behold theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this fig-tree, and find none: cut it down why cumbreth it the ground?</hi> And there is ſatisfaction joy and delight that comes to Chriſt by the good ſucceſs of the Miniſtry. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10, 11. And contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is a grief and vexation to His Soul, and matter of bitter complaint when it proſpers not: He complains, Iſai. 49.4. <hi>I have laboured in vain, &amp;c.</hi> And in, Mar. 3.5. <hi>He looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardneſs of their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Yea Chriſt wept over Jeruſalem for their impenitency and unbelief, under the Means of Grace. <hi>Luk,</hi> 19.41, 42.

the offer of Grace and Glory to thee, and not to others, but Grace?

All this <hi>thou rejecteſt</hi> by thy unbelief and unprofitableneſs under the Miniſtry of the Word.

Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thou unprofitable Sinner, that GOD the Holy Ghoſt keeps an exact account of all His pains &amp; patience with, and toward thee; He hath a Book of Memorial, in which He enters upon record, all His layings out upon thee; He obſerves &amp; keeps the account how many Sermons you have heard, what Counſels were given to you by your dear Deceaſed Paſtor, how many Sabbaths you have had the advantage of; how many applications His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath made to your Soul; and how long His patience has waited upon

            <p>I now proceed to the Second DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>DOCT. II. <hi>WHEN CHRIST Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to gather Perſons, eſpecially Young Perſons, under the ſpecial Wing of His ſaving Covenant by the Miniſtry of His Word, and they will not be be gathered, He will ſeverely puniſh them for their neglect and refuſal.</hi> This is plain in the Text.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine contains in it theſe Three following Propoſitions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Now this Propoſition contains Two Concluſions in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concluſion. <hi>THAT the Miniſtry of the Word is the Great, Inſtituted and All-ſufficient Means of gatherings Souls under the Wing of Chriſt's Covenant.</hi> When I ſay it is the Means of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Souls under the Wing of Chriſt's Covenant; I look on it as an Inſtrument in the Hand of the Spirit of Chriſt, whereby He works Faith in the Hearts of Men, &amp; ſo brings them near to Chriſt, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der the Wing of Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.15, 16. The Word Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the power of God unto Salvation
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002076_0070_0FBB7CEFA7D5CCB8"/>
to every one that believeth. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17. <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a preacher? So then, faith cometh by hearing, &amp; hearing by the word of God,</hi> that is, by the Word Preached, as you may ſee in the former verſe. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2, 5. When I ſay it is a ſufficient Means, I mean ſufficient without thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary helps of Miracles that for a time were granted to the World, 'till the Doctrine was ſufficiently declared &amp; publiſhed: ſufficient without thoſe extraordinary helps that deluded Souls are looking for, as Viſions, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Inſpirations, &amp; Enthyſiaſtick ſuggeſtions, &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.30. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. What the Word diſcovers, I oppoſe it, to any other diſcovery of any other thing. No other diſcovery is a Means of Faith in Chriſt, &amp; bringing the Soul under the Wing of Chriſt. As for the Preaching of the Law; the Law indeed may convince of Sin, &amp; ſo of Soul ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and of death, &amp; condemnation.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002076_0071_0FBB7CF3582FC9A8"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9. &amp; ſo by the Law we become dead to the Law. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. and ſo may have its work upon the Heart, to make known Sin, but yet not ſufficient to finiſh conviction; much leſs to reach converſion. Joh. 16.9. <hi>Of Sin becauſe they believe not.</hi> Gal. 3.22. <hi>But the Scripture hath concluded all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Sin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Christ might be given to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> But the Preaching of the Law cannot bring you unto Chriſt. Here the Goſpel &amp; the Miniſtry of it, is the only ſufficient Means to bring the Soul under the Wing of Chriſt. Gal. 3.1, 2. <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the truth, before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, crucify'd among you? This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> Iſai. 11.10.11, 12. Mar. 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the world and preach the Goſpel to every creature. He that believeth &amp; is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> The Goſpel was committed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002076_0072_0FBB7CF5E6DE9F60"/>
to Paul to be Preached for the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith among all Nations for His Name. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. To prove that the Goſpel, ſpecially as Preached has the ſufficiency of a Means,</p>
            <p>Argu. 1. THAT the Miniſtry of the Word is the All-ſufficient Means of gathering Souls under the Wing of CHRIST's Covenant appears <hi>from the Univerſallity and Antiquity of theſe Means.</hi> Thus Adam and Eve were brought under the Wing of Chriſt. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Joh. 8.56. <hi>Your father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham rejoyced to ſee my day: and be ſaw it and was glad.</hi> Luk. 24.25, 26, 44, 45. Therefore the Goſpel is the Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goſpel. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.6. only Preached with this diſtinction, From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Chriſt's coming, it was to them in promiſe; but to us, in performance. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Argu. 2. <hi>NO other Means were ever effectual without this diſcovery of CHRIST, and this diſcovery of CHRIST has been effectual without other Means.</hi> What did the Creation of the World, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.) but declare GOD's Eternal
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002076_0073_0FBB7CF70D5DFB58"/>
Power and <hi>God-Head</hi>? not the way of Salvation by CHRIST. What did the terrible giving of the Law? What did all the Miracles of Moſes, &amp; the Prophets? But the diſcovery of CHRIST by the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel without Miracles, have brought many, yea multitudes under the Wings of CHRIST. Now the diſcovery of Chriſt, of His Name, and Truths, and Ways, comprehends all that a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter needs to know or preach amongſt a People. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. It contains the whole myſtery of Godlineſs; both the object of Faith, and whatſoever elſe is neceſſary morally as a means, to a gracious change. 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſy great is the myſtery of godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtifyed in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi> This is excellently ſet forth by the Apoſtle, in 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002076_0074_0FBB7CF8956128E8"/>
the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.1.8. <hi>Therefore ſeeing we have this miniſtry, as we have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy we faint not; for we preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Jeſus the Lord; and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>v. For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. But we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us.</hi> CHRIST in the Goſpel is the end of the law for righteouſneſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3.</p>
            <p>Argu. 3. <hi>THE diſcovery of CHRIST in the Goſpel, &amp; the Miniſtry of the Word, is the wiſdom &amp; power of GOD to Salvation.</hi> 1 Cor. 18.22, 24. <hi>For the preaching of the croſs is to them that periſh, fooliſhneſs: but unto us which are ſaved, it is the power of God. It pleaſed God by the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe. Unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Never look to meet with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Wiſdom and Power to ſave you but in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002076_0075_0FBB7CFA019F38E0"/>
The Miniſtry of the Word is the Inſtrument to convey the Spirit. Gal. 3.2. <hi>This only would I learn of you, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> Act. 10.44. While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> fell on all them which heard the word. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.52.</p>

The Soul that is gathered under CHRIST's Wing, his ſight of Chriſt is from God's teaching by His Spirit dwelling in him, and enabling him to behold the things themſelves; called therefore the evidences and demonſtration of the Spirit &amp; power. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.10. It is written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>And they ſhall be all taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard &amp; learned of the Father cometh unto Me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.

Iſai. 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me: I am found of them that ſought me not: I ſaid, behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</hi> So that He beholds the Realities themſelves. See Pauls Prayer, Eph. 1.17, 18, 19. <hi>That the God of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowlege of him: the eyes of your underſtanding being enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened: that ye may know what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, And what is the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us-ward who believe; according to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places.</hi> Moreover the Fruit
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002076_0089_0FBB7D1502D68448"/>
of this Illumination upon the Soul, that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST, is, that it works effectually, and transforms the Soul. 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>We all with open face beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</hi> It renews the whole Man, &amp; brings forth fruit in the whole Man in new obedience.</p>
            <p>THE Soul that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared Affection to Chriſt; He is moſt precious to him; That Soul is taken up with Chriſt as his Saviour from Sin; from the guilt of Sin, &amp; from the filth of Sin; as a Saviour from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin, as well as from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of Sin; He deſires to have Chriſt made of God unto him, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, ſanctification and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p>HE that is gathered under the Wing of CHRIST, has in him a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſpiritual life; he has the Son, therefore alſo he has life. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.11,

12.
