            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth, may</hi> Iſrael <hi>now ſay:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed againſt me.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>A <hi>Century</hi> from the <hi>Incorporation</hi> of the <hi>Town, this Day</hi> expires—And altho' it was long a Frontier, and has often ſuffer'd the Fury of the Enemy; is yet fair, and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of GOD has been his peculiar Care in all Ages of the World—And therefore altho' the Seed of the Serpent have often perſecuted the Seed of the Woman; yet they have never been able fully to accompliſh their Deſires—The Adverſary hath often lifted up the Horn,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007020_0005_102AE9A38DFAF6D8"/>
and they that hate <hi>Mount-Sion</hi> have often bro't her low; yet they have been no more than a Scourge in the Hand of GOD, to chaſtiſe his People, to correct what was amiſs, and to make them more humble and ſervent in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Yet the Enemy meant not ſo.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>this World</hi> is in a <hi>militant</hi> State, and may well expect ſhocking Aſſaults from thoſe that hate her.—She hath been troubled on every Side, and perplexed, but not in Deſpair; perſecuted, but not forſaken; caſt down, but not deſtroyed; a Buſh burning, but not conſumed.</p>
            <p>It was frequently thus with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they continu'd the peculiar People of God—Many a Time have they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me from my Youth up, may <hi>Iſrael</hi> now ſay, many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth; yet they have not prevailed againſt me.</p>
            <p>Interpreters agree that this Pſalm was written, when ſome new and heavy Calamity either preſſed hard upon, or impended that People.—But whether when <hi>Senacherib,</hi> with the Hoſt of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> invaded <hi>Judea;</hi> or when <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> and Confederates, after the Return of the Captivity, made Intereſt againſt them in the Court of <hi>Perſia;</hi> or at ſome other calamitous Seaſon; is neither eaſy, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to determine.</p>
            <p>For whatever was the particular Occaſion of the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Deſign is manifeſtly to excite that People to a ſerious Recollection of the numerous Calamities bro't upon them by their Enemies, ever ſince their being taken into Covenant with, and made the peculiar People of God—As alſo to acknowledge the merciful Interpoſitions of God for them; who notwithſtanding their frequent Rebellions againſt him, had not ſuffered their Enemies ſo far to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, as to cut them off from being a People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:007020_0006_102AE9A59E2E2E58"/>
               <hi>Yet they have not prevailed againſt me,</hi> is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the ſtricteſt Senſe, as if they had never been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or bro't into Subjection by their Enemies—for in this Senſe it is not true, as appears from the Scripture-Hiſtory of that Church and People.—</p>
            <p>The Meaning therefore is, they have never been able wholly to extirpate us, or to cut us off from being a Church and Nation.—</p>
            <p>Our Text is well paraphras'd by a learned Prelate.<note n="†" place="bottom">Bp. <hi>Patrick</hi> in loc.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Our Adverſaries may <hi>Iſrael</hi> now on this Occaſion ſay, have very often, and very ſorely diſtreſſed us, ever ſince we began to be a People; it is hard to tell how often, or into how great Straits they have reduc'd us, ſince we began to be a Nation; and yet by the ſpecial Favour of God, they have never been able to accompliſh their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our utter Extirpation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From the Words let us conſider,</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet preſerv'd from utter Ruin:</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>II. As aſcribing the Glory of their Preſervation unto GOD.</p>
            <p>I. Then let us conſider the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of GOD, as frequently afflicted by their Enemies, and yet preſerved from utter Ruin.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of their Affliction and Preſervation, from their ſojourning in <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the Reign of <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> you have on ſacred Record, and is therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to be recited here.—</p>

            <p>In 1697.

            <p>And accordingly on the <hi>Eleventh</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> when the Inhabitants, ſuſpicious of no Enemy, were gone out to their Labour; they came in ſeveral Companies into the Town, and were very near ſurprizing ſaid <hi>Sawyer'</hi>s Garriſon, both the Gates being left open; but that Mr. <hi>Jabez Fairbank,</hi> who was at his own Houſe half a Mile's Diſtance, and deſigning to bring his little Son from ſaid Garriſon, mounted his Horſe which came running to him in a Fright; and rode full Speed into the Gate, but yet nothing ſuſpicious of an Enemy—However, this was a Means of ſaving the Garriſon: for the Enemy who were

            <p>On this ſorrowful Occaſion, the Town ſet a-part a Day for Prayer and Faſting.</p>

            <p>In 1704, there came an Army of <hi>ſeven Hundred French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> from <hi>Canada</hi>—with <hi>two Tribes,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Monſt.

Moreover, in their March there aroſe a Mutiny among them about the Diviſion of the Plunder; and the Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion roſe ſo high, that <hi>above two Hundred</hi> of them return'd—But the Reſt came on, and ſent out their <hi>Scouts,</hi> who reported, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ready in great Numbers to receive them.—On this they call'd a Council of War, in which they concluded to lay aſide the Deſign on <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>—and to beat up for Voluntiers, for the Aſſault of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter;</hi> and a large Number enliſted.—<note n="*" place="bottom">Some of the Accounts which Mr. <hi>Penhallow</hi> hath given of the Miſchiefs done in this Town by the Enemy, are in diverſe Caſes not only imperfect, but very <hi>Erroneous,</hi> which are doubtleſs owing to the wrong Information he had.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And on the 30th of <hi>July</hi> they came within about <hi>two Miles</hi> of the Town—and encamp'd, and by Night ſent in their Spies to obſerve the Poſture of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—And on the 31ſt, they fell furiouſly upon the Town early in the Morning; and in their firſt Onſet kill'd Lieut. <hi>Nathanael Wilder,</hi> near the Gate of his own Garriſon.—And the ſame Day <hi>three</hi> others near the ſame Garriſon.<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>The Enemy were uncommonly brave: and therefore altho' Capt. <hi>Tyng,</hi> who had the Command of the Garriſon Soldiers; and Capt. <hi>How,</hi> who on the Alarm, march'd immediately from <hi>Marlborough</hi> with what Men he cou'd ſuddenly raiſe; and the Inhabitants maintain'd a warm Diſpute with them for ſome Time; yet being much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in Number were oblig'd to retreat into Garriſon.—On which they burnt the Meeting-Houſe, and ſix other Buildings, &amp; deſtroy'd much of the live Stock of the Town. <hi>Note,</hi> What Numbers of the <hi>Enemy</hi> were kill'd, either in the Field, or at the other Garriſon is uncertain, but is tho't to be conſiderable—among the Reſt a <hi>French Officer</hi> of ſome Diſtinction, was mortally wounded, which greatly exaſperated their Spirits:</p>

Before Night there came ſuch Numbers to the Relief of the Town, that the Enemy retreated; and altho' pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, yet <hi>were</hi> not over-taken.

            <p>On the 26th of <hi>October</hi> following, there having been a Party of the Enemy diſcover'd at <hi>Still-River,</hi> the Soldiers and Inhabitants belonging to the Rev.

            <p>But the fatal Miſtake immediately appear'd; and he being carried into the Houſe, forgave the Perſon that ſhot him; and in <hi>an Hour</hi> or <hi>two</hi> expir'd, to the great Grief not only of his Conſort, but of his People, who had an exceeding Value for him.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Gardner</hi> was not Ordained.</note>

And on the 18th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, <hi>Twenty-four</hi> ſtout <hi>Indians,</hi> who according to their own Account had all been Captains, came to <hi>Marlborough,</hi> and captivated Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan Wilder,</hi> a Native of this Town, and but lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from it.—The <hi>next Day</hi> being perſu'd by about <hi>Thirty</hi> of <hi>Marlborough</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and overtaken—the Front of our Men came upon them before they had the leaſt Apprehenſion of a Purſuit.</p>
            <p>Their Packs were all ſlung, and it being a miſty Day, their Caſes were on their Guns.—And therefore had ours <hi>all</hi> run down upon them, they might eaſily have deſtroy'd or taken all, and ſav'd the Life of the Captive.—The Enemy themſelves at the firſt Appearance of our Men, had determin'd to reſign themſelves to their Mercy.—But obſerving that but <hi>Ten</hi> of the <hi>Thirty</hi> came down upon them, they took Courage, unſlung their Packs, and fought like Men—having firſt diſpatch'd their Captive.</p>

to aſcribe the Glory of it unto GOD—Unto GOD, who in Conſequence of their peculiar Relation to Him, and of his gracious Promiſes to Them, had gloriouſly appear'd for them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the <hi>Red-Sea;</hi> and often afterwards, when endanger'd or oppreſs'd by Enemies, more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and powerful than themſelves.</p>
            <p>Theſe Aſcriptions are common in the ſacred Pages.—<q>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us what Work thou didſt in their Days, in the Times of old<note n="‖" place="bottom">

            <p>Theſe Acknowledgements &amp; Aſcriptions are not only founded on the Reaſon and Nature of Things; but alſo enjoin'd by divine Authority, to keep divine Benefits in Memory, to inſpire ſucceeding Generations with Gratitude, and to engage them effectually in the Fear and Service of the moſt high GOD—Accordingly we have the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> aſſigning this as a Reaſon of her Practice.—</p>
            <p>
               <q>We will ſhew to the Generation to come the Praiſes of the LORD, and his Strength, and his wonderful Works that he hath done—For he eſtabliſhed a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in <hi>Jacob,</hi> and appointed a Law in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which he commanded our Fathers that they ſhou'd make <hi>them</hi> known to their Children—That the Generation to come might know <hi>them,</hi> even the Children which ſhou'd be

            <p>The Deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from Oppreſſion &amp; Bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was to be celebrated with ſolemn Feſtivity, and with the Reaſon of it carefully to be tranſmitted by divine Appointment to Poſterity—<hi>And thou ſhalt ſhew thy Son in that Day, ſaying, This is done becauſe of that which the Lord did unto me, when I came out of Egypt,—And it ſhall be for a Sign unto thee, that the Lord's Law may be in thy Mouth; thou therefore ſhalt keep this Ordinance.</hi>

            <p>And as the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of <hi>theſe Aſcriptions</hi> hath always been the ſame, and the ſame Spirit of Gratitude hath reſted upon the Saints of all ſucceeding Ages; So the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> hath always given to the ſame GOD the Glory of her Preſervation, under the numerous Evils which have been bro't upon her by her Enemies—whether Men or Devils.</p>
            <p>And well may the Inhabitants of <hi>this Country</hi> join with the Church in all preceeding Times, in giving Glory to the GOD of Salvation.—</p>

For when they were few in Number, when they were far from human Help, in a howling Wilderneſs, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with numerous <hi>Barbarians,</hi> who thirſted for their Blood, and often plotted their Deſtruction; <hi>GOD</hi> the <hi>GOD</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was their Saviour—They truſted in Him, and were not aſhamed—And notwithſtanding all the Attempts of their Enemies, whether <hi>American,</hi> or <hi>European,</hi> are yet a growing People.</p>
            <p>The Habitations of Cruelty are become a Valley of Viſion—Where <hi>Satan</hi> was worſhipped with horrid Rites, the GOD of Heaven is now adored—The ſolitary Places rejoice, the Wilderneſs bloſſometh as the Roſe, and the Glory of <hi>Sharon</hi> is given unto it.—</p>
            <p>Surely, it was GOD that bro't a Vine from far, caſt out the Heathen before it, planted it, and cauſed it to take Root, and fill the Land; ſo that the Hills are covered with the Shadow, and the Bows thereof are like the goodly Cedars.—</p>
            <p>GOD grant, that the Hedges may not be broken down, that it may never be plucked by thoſe that paſs by, that the <hi>Boar</hi> out of the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> may never waſte it, nor the wild Beaſts devour it; but may the Glory of the LORD be upon it from Generation to Generation.—</p>
            <p>But the <hi>preſent Aſſembly</hi> calls for a particular Addreſs.—</p>
            <p>Brethren, as through the good Hand of our God upon us, we this Day ſee the <hi>Completion</hi> of a <hi>Century</hi> from the <hi>Incorporation</hi> of <hi>the Town,</hi> and have recollected ſome of the ſignal Mercies of GOD to our Fathers under their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Afflictions by the Enemy; we may with Propriety join with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, and ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <q>If it had not been the LORD who was on our Side; if it had not been the LORD who was on our Side, when
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007020_0030_102AE9DAD61605B0"/>
Men roſe up againſt us; then they had ſwallow'd us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled againſt us.—Bleſſed be the LORD who hath not given us a Prey to their Teeth—Our Help is in the Name of the LORD</q>—Who reigns in <hi>Zion</hi> Head over all Things unto his Church—And will Reign, till all oppoſing Rule, Authority and Power ſhall be put down, and the Time come for deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom unto GOD, even the FATHER, and for preſenting his Church without Spot, and with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Joy before the Preſence of his Glory.</p>
            <p>As the Church was purchas'd by his own Blood, the FATHER hath in all Ages committed the Preſervation of it to HIM; and as <hi>Mediator</hi> veſted him with all Power in Heaven and Earth. In all the Afflictions of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was afflicted, in his Love and in his Pity he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed them, he bare them, and carried them all the Days of old.—He was the Refuge of <hi>our</hi> Fathers in their Diſtreſſes.—Let us therefore mention the loving Kindneſſes of the LORD, and the Praiſes of the LORD, according to all that he hath beſtowed upon us—And the great Goodneſs towards the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which he hath beſtowed according to his Mercy, and according to the Multitude of his loving Kindneſſes.</p>
            <p>Let the Conſideration of theſe Things animate us.</p>
            <p n="1">1.) <hi>To a firm and unſhaken Confidence in Him under all Adverſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is one important End for which the merciful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of GOD for our Fathers in their Diſtreſſes are to be recollected.—He commanded our Fathers that they ſhou'd make them known to their Children, that they might ſet their Hope in GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">2.) <hi>Let theſe Things excite us to a ſincere Compliance with all his Precepts, whether relating to Faith or Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:007020_0031_102AE9DC94731B80"/>
This alſo is another important Uſe to be made of them.—That they might ſet their Hope in GOD, and not forget his Works, <hi>but keep his Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without a ſincere Regard to divine Precepts, our Confidence will be Preſumption.—For there is no Promiſe of Protection or Bleſſing to ſuch as perſevere in Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Unbelief.—</p>
            <p>If ye forget the Works of the LORD, and walk not in his Ways, ye may well expect to be abandon'd to all Evil.—This is evident from the Hiſtory of <hi>Iſrael</hi>—For when <hi>Joſhua</hi> and all that Generation were gathered to their Fathers; and there aroſe another Generation, who knew not the Works of the LORD, which he had done in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> They forſook the LORD GOD of their Fathers, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd after the Gods of the People that were round about them, and provoked the LORD to Anger—And he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd them into the Hands of Spoilers, that ſpoiled them, and ſold them into the Hands of their Enemies round about, ſo that they cou'd not ſtand any longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Enemies.—</p>
            <p>Whetherſoever they went out, the Hand of the LORD was againſt them for Evil; as the LORD had ſaid, and as the LORD had ſworn unto them, and they were greatly, diſtreſſed.—</p>
            <p>Muſe therefore on his Wonders of old, and on his Works in the Days of your Fathers, 'till the Fire ſhall burn within you—'till ſacred Ardors ſhall riſe in your Souls, and animate you to the moſt chearful Truſt and Obedience.—</p>
            <p>Ye are the Seed of the bleſſed of the LORD, and the Children of the Covenant which he made with them—
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007020_0032_102AE9E01786D3C0"/>
Fulfil therefore the Obligations, as ye expect the Bleſſings of that Covenant.—Let your Hearts be ſtedfaſt in it.</p>
            <p>Be ambitious of imitating whatever was excellent in your Anceſtors—Conſider from whence ye are fallen—Your Works are not perfect before GOD: Remember therefore how ye have received and heard, and repent—and ſtrengthen the Things that remain &amp; are ready to die.</p>
            <p>Is not this the Voice of your Fathers, <q>And ye our Children, know ye the GOD of your Fathers, and ſerve him with perfect Hearts and willing Minds; if ye ſeek him he will be found of you, but if you forſake him he will caſt you off forever.</q>—</p>
            <p>Your Fathers bare the Heat and Burden of the Day, they ſubmitted to many Hardſhips &amp; Dangers; not only that they might leave unto you a fair temporal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as it is this Day; but alſo, what they eſteem'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely preferable, that they might leave you in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Goſpel in its Purity—For the Sake of This, they ventured their Lives into this Wilderneſs—For This, they expos'd themſelves to Perils by Sea, to Perils in the Wilderneſs, to Perils by the Heathen, and to various Evils.</p>
            <p>And ye are riſen up in your Fathers Stead; and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſhines in full Orb upon you—Stand faſt therefore in the <hi>Liberty</hi> wherewith CHRIST hath made you free.—</p>
            <p>Give Commandment to your Houſholds, and to your Seed after you, to walk in all the Commandments &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the LORD blameleſs, and to do Mercy and Judgment—That they alſo may give the ſame in Charge to theirs—from Generation to Generation—</p>
            <p>That the divine Bleſſing may be upon them, and the Kingdom of GOD be advanced by them.</p>
