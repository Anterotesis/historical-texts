         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>JOB, in the firſt part of his days, was <hi>the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt.</hi> His poſſeſſions were large, his family was numerous and flouriſhing; his own character was fair and blameleſs. Yet this man it pleaſed God to viſit with extraordinary rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of fortune. He was robbed of his whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. His ſons and his daughters all peri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and reduced to poverty, was ſmitten with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore diſeaſe. His friends came about him, ſeemingly with the purpoſe of adminiſtering comfort. But from a harſh and ill-founded conſtruction of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Providence in his diſaſters, they only added to his ſorrows by unjuſt upbraiding. Hence thoſe many pathetic lamentations with which this book abounds, poured forth in the moſt beautiful and touching ſtrain of Oriental poetry. In one of thoſe hours of lamentation, the ſentiment in the text was uttered; <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life;</hi> a
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:028306_0007_0FD894D73ADB1BB0"/>ſentiment, which ſurely, if any ſituation can juſtify it, was allowable in the caſe of Job.</p>
            <p>In ſituations very different from that of Job, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der calamities far leſs ſevere, it is not uncommon to find ſuch a ſentiment working in the heart, and ſometimes breaking forth from the lips of men. Many, very many there are, who on one occaſion or other, have experienced this wearineſs of life, and been tempted to wiſh that it would come to a cloſe. Let us now examine in what circumſtances this feeling may be deemed excuſable; in what it is to be held ſinful; and under what reſtrictions we may, on any occaſion, be permitted to ſay, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider the words of the text in three lights; as expreſſing, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſentiment of a diſcontented man; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſentiment of an afflicted man; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The ſentiment of a devout man.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Let us conſider the text as expreſſing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of a diſcontented man; with whom it is the effuſion of ſpleen, vexation, and diſſatisfaction with life, ariſing from cauſes neither laudable nor juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. There are chiefly three claſſes of men who are liable to this diſeaſe of the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the idle; the luxurious; the criminal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> This wearineſs of life is often found among the idle; perſons commonly in eaſy circumſtances of fortune, who are not engaged in any of the labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occupations of the world, and who are, at the ſame time, without energy of mind to call them forth into any other line of active exertion. In this languid, or rather torpid ſtate, they have ſo many vacant hours, and are ſo much at a loſs how to fill up their time, that their ſpirits utterly ſink; they become burdenſome to themſelves, and to every one

What a convincing proof is hereby afforded, that man was deſigned by his Creator to be an active being, whoſe happineſs is to be found not merely in reſt, but in occupation and purſuit? The idle are doomed to ſuffer the natural puniſhment of their inactivity and folly; and for their complaints of the tireſomeneſs of life there is no remedy but to awake from the dream of ſloth, and to fill up with proper employment the miſerable vacancies of their days. Let them ſtudy to become uſeful to the world, and they ſhall ſoon become leſs burdenſome to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They ſhall begin to enjoy exiſtence; they ſhall reap the rewards which Providence has annexed to virtuous activity; and have no more cauſe to ſay <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.</hi>

               <hi>Next,</hi> The luxurious and the diſſipated form ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther claſs of men, among whom ſuch complaints are ſtill more frequent. With them they are not the fruit of idleneſs. Theſe are men who have been buſied enough; they have run the whole race of pleaſure; but they have run it with ſuch inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſpeed, that it terminates in wearineſs and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit. By the perpetual courſe of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which they are engaged; by the exceſſes which they indulge; by the riotous revel, and the midnight or rather morning hours to which they prolong their ſectivity; they have debilitated their bodies, and worn out their ſpirits. Satiated with the repetition of their accuſtomed pleaſures, and yet unable to find any new ones in their place; wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round and round their former haunts of joy, and ever returning diſappointed; weary of themſelves, and of all things about them, their ſpirits are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a deadly gloom, and the complaint burſts forth of odious life and a miſerable world. Never
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028306_0009_0FD894DB5A7E1EA8"/>are theſe complaints more irequent than at the cloſe of rounds of amuſement, and after a long repetition of feſtal pleaſures; when the ſpirits which had been forced up, as by ſome intoxicating drug, to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural height, ſubſide into profound dejection. What increaſes the evil is, that it is not among the infirm and the aged, but among the young, the gay, and the proſperous, who ought to be reputed the happieſt men, that this diſtaſte of life moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevails.</p>
            <p>When perſons of this deſcription, in their peeviſh and ſplenetic hours, exclaim, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life,</hi> let them know, let them be aſſured, that this is no other than the judgment of God overtaking them for their vices and follies. Their complaints of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery are entitled to no compaſſion; nay, they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe they ariſe from a ſinful cauſe; from a mind broken and debaſed by luxury and corruption. They are the authors of their own miſery, by having thrown away on the follies of the world thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which God had beſtowed on them for nobler ends.—Let them return to the duties of men and Chriſtians. Let them retreat from frivolity, and abſtain from exceſs. Let them ſtudy temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, moderation, and ſelf-command. By enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a virtuous and manly courſe of action, and applying to the honourable diſcharge of the ſunctions of their ſtation, they will acquire different views. They will obtain more real enjoyment of life, and become more willing to prolong it.—But, after the warnings which God has given them of their miſbehaviour by the inward miſery they ſuffer, if they ſtill continue to run the ſame intemperate round, and to drain pleaſure to the laſt dregs, it ſhall come to paſs, that they who now contemn life, and are impatient of its continuance, ſhall be the perſons
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028306_0010_0FD894DC81031050"/>moſt eager to prolong it. When they behold it in reality drawing towards a cloſe, and are obliged to look forward to what is to come after it, they ſhall be rendered awfully ſenſible of its value. They will then graſp eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to ſtop them if they could, and to employ every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that remains in repairing their paſt errors, and in making their peace, if poſſible, with God and heaven. According as <hi>they have ſown,</hi> they now <hi>reap.</hi> They are reduced <hi>to eat the fruit of their own ways, and to be filled with their own devices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There remains ſtill a third claſs of thoſe who from diſcontent are become weary of life; ſuch as have embittered it to themſelves by the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of criminal deeds. They have been, perhaps, unnatural to their parents, or treacherous to their friends; they have violated their fidelity; have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared and ruined the innocent; or have occaſioned the death of others. There is no wonder that ſuch perſons ſhould loſe their reliſh for life. To what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever arts they may have recourſe for procuring a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful peace, conſcience will at times exert its native power, and ſhake over them its terrific, ſcourge. The internal miſery they endure has ſometimes ariſen to ſuch a height, as has made them terminate, with their own hands, an exiſtence which they felt to be inſupportable.—To the complaints of ſuch perſons no remedy can be furniſhed, except what ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from the bitterneſs of ſincere and deep repentance. We can do no more than exhort them to atone as much as is in their power for the evils they have committed; and to fly to the divine mercy through Jeſus Chriſt for pardon and forgiveneſs. Let us now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Turn to perſons of another deſcription, and conſider the ſentiment in the text as extorted by ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations

               </gap>ſs. Theſe are ſo variouſly multiplied in the world, and often ſo oppreſſive and heavy, that aſſuredly it is not uncommon to hear the afflicted complain that they are weary of life. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, if not always allowable, yet certainly are more excuſable than thoſe which flow from the ſources of diſſatisfaction already mentioned. They are ſufferers, not ſo much through their own miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as through the appointment of Providence; and therefore to perſons in this ſituation it may ſeem more needful to offer conſolation, than to give admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. However, as the evils which produce this impatience of life are of different ſorts, a diſtinction muſt be made as to the ſituations which can moſt excuſe it.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, the exclamation in the text may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by deep overwhelming grief. When they whom we had moſt affectionately loved, and in whom we had placed the felicity of our days, are taken away, our connection with life appears to be diſſolved. <q>Why ſhould we ſurvive thoſe to whom our ſouls were tied? Would to God we had died before them? Now when they are gone all pleaſure and hope is gone as to us. To us the ſun no longer ſhines with his uſual brightneſs. No longer cheerfulneſs inveſts the face of nature. On every object a ſad gloom appears to reſt; and every employment of life is become an oppreſſive burden.</q> With the feelings of thoſe who are thus diſtreſſed we naturally ſympathiſe. They are frequently the feelings of the moſt virtuous and amiable minds: And yet ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt be told, that grief may be endulged ſo far as to become immoderate and improper. There are bounds which are preſcribed to it both by reaſon and by religion. A Chriſtian ought not to <hi>mourn like thoſe who have no hope.</hi> While he feels his ſorrows as a man,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028306_0012_0FD894DF95914D20"/>he ſhould alſo ſtudy to bear them like a man, with fortitude; and not abandon himſelf to feeble and fruitleſs melancholy. Let him have recourſe to a ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous diſcharge of the duties of his ſtation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as incumbent on him to make the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he can of thoſe comforts which Providence has ſtill left in his poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>Again; it ſometimes happens that, apart from grief, great reverſes of worldly fortune give riſe to the lamentation in the text. This was the caſe with Job himſelf. A ſudden fall from opulence into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence and want; ſome undeſerved diſgrace incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or ſome unexpected cloud thrown over former reputation and fame; the unkindneſs and deſertion of friends, or the inſolent triumph of enemies, are apt to overwhelm the minds of men with gloom, and to reduce them to be weary of life. To perſons under ſuch calamities, ſympathy is due. That ſympathy, however, will be proportioned to the degree in which we conſider them as free from blame in the misfortunes which they ſuffer. As far as, through their own miſconduct and vice, they have been the authors to themſelves of thoſe misfortunes, we withdraw our pity. The burthen which they have brought on themſelves we leave them to bear as they can; and with little concern we hear them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim that their <hi>ſouls are weary of life.</hi>—Not only ſo, but even in caſes where calamities have fallen on the innocent, to the pity which we feel for them will be joined a ſecret contempt, if we perceive that together with their proſperity, their courage and fortitude have alſo forſaken them. To abandon themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection carries no mark of a great or a worthy mind. Inſtead of declaring that his <hi>ſoul is weary of his life,</hi> it becomes a brave and a good man, in the evil day, with firmneſs to maintain his poſt; to bear up againſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028306_0013_0FD894E0FB70FAE0"/>the ſtorm; to have recourſe to thoſe advantages which in the worſt of times, are always left to integrity and virtue; and never to give up the hope that better days may yet ariſe.</p>
            <p>It is good for perſons in ſuch ſituations to remark that, though Job was for a long while ſeverely tried by a variety of diſtreſſes, yet his condition was not left finally unhappy. On the contrary, the goodneſs of that God whom he had ſerved returned at laſt, to ſhine upon him with greater brightneſs than ever. His riches were reſtored to him twofold. The loſſes in his family were repaired by a new offspring. His name became again renowned in the Eaſt; and <hi>the latter end of Job,</hi> we are told, <hi>was more bleſſed than the beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtill, it may be aſked, will not the continuance of long and ſevere diſeaſe juſtify the exclamation in the text, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life!</hi> To perſons who are forſaken by all the bleſſings of health, and who have no proſpect left, but that of lingering under ſickneſs or pain, Job's complaint may aſſuredly be forgiven more than to any others. Though it might be ſuggeſted to them, that even in old age and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, except in very extreme caſes, ſome reſources are always left, of which they may avail themſelves for relief; yet it muſt be admitted, that lawfully they may wiſh their ſufferings to be brought to an end. Still however they muſt remember, that reſignation to the pleaſure of heaven continues to be their duty to the laſt. As long as any part remains to be acted, as long as their continuance in the world can ſerve any valuable purpoſe; it is more honourable to bear the load with magnanimity, than to give way to a querulous and dejected ſpirit. It remains,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To addreſs myſelf to another order of men, among whom, though more rarely than among thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028306_0014_0FD894E33A89E6A0"/>whom I have deſcribed, the ſentiment of the text is to be found. They are perſons who have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular complaint to make of the injuſtice of the world, or the afflictions of their ſtate. But they are tired of the vanity of the world, of its inſipid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and its perpetually revolving circle of tifles and follies. They feel themſelves made for ſomething greater and nobler. They are diſguſted and hurt with the ſcenes of wickedneſs that are often paſſing before their eyes. Their hearts are warmed with the thoughts of a purer and more perfect exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence deſigned for man; and in the moments of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration after it, the exclamation breaks forth, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life.—O that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly away and be at reſt. Lo then I would wander far off, and remain in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I would haſten my eſcape from the windy ſtorm and tempeſt. For I have ſeen violence and ſtrife in the city. Wickedneſs is in the midſt thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her ſtreets.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lv. 6, 11.</note>—In this view the ſentiment in the text may ſometimes be that of a devout man. But ſuch perſons I muſt admoniſh, that their devotion, how ſincere however, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together of a rational and chaſtened kind. It was from this temper that, in former ages of the church, the numerous race ſprung of anchorets, hermits, and all the various orders who voluntarily abandoned the the world, to people the lonely deſarts and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtic retreat. The ordinary courſe of things ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed below them as candidates for heaven. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the world appeared unworthy of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and dangerous to their virtue. Breathing after a higher eſtate, they imagined that they could not abſtract themſelves too much from every earthly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028306_0015_0FD894E4C0801510"/>amuſement, as long as they were forced to remain in this place of exile.</p>
            <p>Let us beware of all ſuch imaginary refinements as produce a total diſreliſh of our preſent condition. They are, for the moſt part, grafted either on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed purſuits, or on a melancholy and ſplenetic caſt of mind. They are far from contributing to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and are inconſiſtent with all the active virtues of man. This life deſerves not indeed to be put in competition with that bleſſed immortality to which God has raiſed our hopes. But ſuch as it is, it is the gift of God. It is the ſphere in which his wiſdom has placed us, and appointed us to act our parts. As long as it laſts, we muſt neither ſlight the duties which it requires, nor undervalue the innocent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments which it offers. It belongs to a man to live among men as his brethren; which he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf weary of life is not qualified to do with propriety.</p>
            <p>Thus I have placed before you, in various views, the ſentiment in the text; and have ſhewn in what circumſtances, and from what cauſes, that diſreliſh of life ariſes which is often found among mankind. On a review of the whole, we cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it is oftener to be aſcribed to our own vices and follies, than to any other cauſe. Among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in the world, to whom at this day, life is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, the far greater number is of thoſe who have rendered it ſo to themſelves. Their idleneſs, their luxury and pleaſures, their criminal deeds, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate paſſions, their timidity and baſeneſs of mind have dejected them in ſuch a degree, as to make them weary of their exiſtence. Preyed upon by diſcontent of their own creating, they complain of life when they ought to reprehend themſelves.</p>
            <p>Various afflictions there doubtleſs are in the world;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028306_0016_0FD894E64690A618"/>many perſons with whom we have cauſe to ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſe, and whom we might reaſonably forgive for wiſhing death to cloſe their ſorrows. But of the evils which embitter life, it muſt be admitted, that the greater part is ſuch as we have brought on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or at leaſt ſuch as, if we were not wanting to ourſelves, might be tolerably ſupported. When we compute the numbers of thoſe who are diſpoſed to ſay, <hi>My ſoul is weary of my life,</hi> ſome there are to whom this ſentiment is excuſable; but many more among whom it is in no way juſtifiable. I admit that, among the worthieſt and the beſt, there may be dark moments in which ſome feeling of this nature may be apt to intrude upon their minds. But with them they are only moments of occaſional and paſſing gloom. They ſoon recall the vigour of their minds; and return with ſatisfaction to the diſcharge of the duties, and to a participation of the enjoyments of life.</p>
            <p>One great cauſe of men's becoming weary of life is grounded on the miſtaken views of it which they have formed, and falſe hopes which they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from it. They have expected a ſcene of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; and when they meet with diſappointments and diſtreſſes, they complain of life, as if it had cheated and betrayed them. God ordained no ſuch poſſeſſion for man on earth as continued pleaſure. For the wiſeſt purpoſes he deſgined our ſtate to be chequered with pleaſure and pain. As ſuch let us receive it, and make the beſt of what is doomed to be our lot. Let us remain perſuaded, that ſimple and moderate pleaſures are always the beſt; that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and a good conſcience are the ſureſ foundations of enjoyment; that he who ſerves his God and his Saviour with the pureſt intentions, and governs his paſſions with the greateſt care, is likely to lead the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028306_0017_0FD894E7BADE9E20"/>happieſt life. Following theſe principles, we ſhall meet with fewer occaſions of being weary of life; we ſhall always find ſome ſatisfactions mixed with its croſſes; and ſhall be enabled to wait with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contented mind till the Almighty, in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, finiſh our ſtate of trial, and remove us to a more bleſſed abode.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT appears from this chapter, that one deſign of the Apoſtle, in writing to Timothy, was to guard him againſt certain corrupters of Chriſtian doctrine, who had already ariſen in the church. To their falſe repreſentations of religion he oppoſes that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral view of it which is given in the text. Such ſummaries of religion frequently occur in the ſacred writings; and are extremely uſeful. By the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive energy with which they expreſs the great lines of our duty, they both imprint them on our memory, and bring them home to our conſcience with force. In the progreſs of this diſcourſe, I hope
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028306_0018_0FD894E958338A98"/>to make it appear, that the words of the text afford a moſt enlarged and inſtructive view of religion in all its chief parts.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle pronounces charity to be <hi>the end</hi> or ſcope <hi>of the commandment,</hi> that is, of the law of God. At the ſame time, in order to prevent miſtakes on this moſt important ſubject, he ſubjoins to charity certain adjuncts, as neceſſary to qualify it, and to render the Chriſtian character complete. Theſe are the <hi>pure heart,</hi> the <hi>good conſcience,</hi> and <hi>faith unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> In treating of theſe, I ſhall ſhew the nature of their connection with charity, and the importance of their being always united with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The end of the commandment is charity.</hi> Charity is the ſame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Teſtament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It conſiſts not in ſpeculative ideas of general benevolence floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as ſpeculations too often do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched and cold. Neither is it confined to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent good nature, which makes us reſt ſatisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a ſingle virtue; but a diſpoſition reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, generoſity, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and liberality, flow, as ſo many native ſtreams. From general good-will to all, it extends its influence particularly to thoſe with whom we ſtand in neareſt connection, and who are directly within the ſphere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it deſcends to the ſmaller aſſociations of neighbourhood, relations, and friends; and ſpreads itſelf over the whole circle of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028306_0019_0FD894EAC25F0E40"/>ſocial and domeſtic life. I mean not that it imports a promiſcuous undiſtinguiſhing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we ſhould endeavour to carry it ſo far, would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an impracticable virtue, and would reſolve it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to ſhut our eyes to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to thoſe who befriend and thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure us. It reſerves our eſteem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it inſpires forgiveneſs and humanity. It breathes uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal candour, and liberality of ſentiment. It forms gentleneſs of temper, and dictates affability of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It prompts correſponding ſympathies with them who rejoice and them who weep. It teaches us to ſlight and deſpiſe no man. Charity is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppreſſed, the reconciler of differences, the interceſſor for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders. It is faithfulneſs in the friend, public ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it in the magiſtrate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the ſovereign, and loyalty in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. In parents it is care and attention; in children it is reverence and ſubmiſſion. In a word, it is the ſoul of ſocial life, it is the ſun that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is <hi>like the dew of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and the dew that deſcendeth on the mountains of Zion where the Lord commanded the bleſſing, even life for evermore.</hi>

            <p>Such charity, ſays the text, is <hi>the end of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi> This aſſertion of the Apoſtle is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conſonant to all that reaſon can ſuggeſt on the ſubject of religion. For, on conſidering the nature of the Supreme Being, reaſon gives us much ground
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028306_0020_0FD894EC3A7DFFC0"/>to believe, that the chief deſign of all the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he has given to men, is to promote their happineſs.

            <p>At the ſame time, while I aſcribe to charity that high place in the ſyſtem of religion, which juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to it, I am not to be underſtood as confi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing all religion to this diſpoſition alone. With much wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and propriety, the text hath annexed to it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain adjuncts, without which neither the character of a good man can be completed, nor charity itſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed to advantage. To the conſideration of theſe I now proceed; and I enter the more readily on this branch of the ſubject, as there is ground to believe, that many pretend to poſſeſs charity, without proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtanding its nature and efficacy. There has been always an unhappy tendency among men to run to extremes, on one ſide or other, in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as one ſet of men, who employ all their zeal on right belief, are prone to undervalue good practice; ſo another ſet who wiſh to be eſteemed, rational chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, are inclined to reſt the whole of their duty on charitable deeds, while they overlook certain diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and habits which ought always to accompany them. It is therefore of importance, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of both theſe claſſes of men ſhould be rectified, in order that religion may be held forth to the world in its complete form, and in its full and undiminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſtre.</p>
            <p>The firſt qualification of charity pointed out in the text is purity; <hi>charity out of a pure heart.</hi> Purity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the virtues which belong to the individual,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028306_0022_0FD894EF41382A10"/>conſidered in himſelf, and with reſpect to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his deſires and pleaſures. It hath its ſeat in the heart; but extends its influence over ſo much of the outward conduct, as to form a great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial part of the character. They are only the <hi>pure in heart,</hi> we are told by our Saviour, <hi>who can ſee God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. v. 8</note> It is alſo true, that they are only the <hi>pure in heart</hi> who can properly diſcharge their duties towards mankind. Inordinate love of pleaſure, intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſenſuality, and a courſe of irregular life, are inconſiſtent, not only with the general character of a good man, but alſo with the peculiar exerciſes of charity and benevolence. For nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than that habits of licentious indulgence contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to ſtiffle all the good affections; to harden the heart; to nouriſh that ſelfiſh attachment to our own vitious pleaſures which renders us inſenſible to the circumſtances and wants of others. A profligate man is ſeldom found to be a good huſband, a good father, or a beneficent neighbour. How many young perſons have at firſt ſet out in the world with excellent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of heart; generous, charitable, and humane; kind to their friends, and amiable among all with whom they had intercourſe? and yet how often have we ſeen all thoſe fair appearances unhappily blaſted in the progreſs of life, merely through the influence of looſe and currupting pleaſures; and thoſe very perſons who promiſed once to be bleſſings to the world, ſunk down, in the end, to be the burthen and nuiſance of ſociety? The profuſion of expence which their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures occaſion, accounts in a great meaſure for the fatal reverſe that takes place in their character. It not only drains the ſources whence the ſtreams of beneficence ſhould flow, but often obliges them to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028306_0023_0FD894F0C667D4E0"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>me oppreſſive and cruel to thoſe whom it was their duty to have patroniſed and ſupported.</p>
            <p>Purity of heart and conduct muſt therefore be held fundamental to charity and love, as well as to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral piety and virtue. The licentious I know are ready to imagine, that their occaſional deeds of boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liberality will atone for many of their private diſorders. But, beſides that ſuch plans of compenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for vices, by ſome ſuppoſed virtues, are always fallacious, the licentious may be aſſured, that it is an appearance only of charity, not the reality of it, to which they can lay claim. For that great virtue conſiſts not in occaſional actions of humanity, in fits of kindneſs or compaſſion, to which bad men may be prompted by natural inſtinct; but in the ſteady and regular exerciſe of thoſe good affections, and the diſcharge of thoſe important duties towards others, for which the licentious are in a great meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified. Their criminal propenſities direct their inclinations to very different objects and purſuits; and often determine them to ſacrifice the juſt rights of others, ſometimes to ſacrifice the peace and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the innocent, to the gratification of their paſſions. Such is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> pernicious influence which the love of pleaſure has on the good qualities of its devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed votaries. The impure heart is like the ſtagnant and putrifying lake, which ſends forth its poiſonous exhalations to corrupt and wither every plant that grows on its banks.</p>
            <p>The ſecond qualification annexed to Charity, in the text, is, that it be <hi>of a good conſcience</hi> By this I underſtand the Apoſtle to mean, that charity be in full conſiſtency with juſtice and integrity; that the <hi>conſcience</hi> of the man who purpoſes to perform ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of benevolence, be free from the reproach of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neglected the primary duties of equity. For,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028306_0024_0FD894F23A745718"/>undoubtedly, juſtice is a virtue primary to charity; that is, it muſt go before it in all its exertions, One muſt firſt <hi>do juſtly</hi> before he can pretend that he <hi>loves mercy.</hi>—Religion, my friends, in order to render it uſeful to mankind, muſt be brought down by its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from the ſublimity of ſpeculation to the functions and occupations of ordinary life. It is my duty to admoniſh you, that you muſt, in the firſt place, be fair in all your dealings with others; you muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the debts you owe; you muſt pay the wages due to your ſervants and dependents; you muſt provide for your own family, and be juſt to the claims of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; then, and then only, you can, <hi>from a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> as the text enjoins, perform acts of generoſity and mercy.</p>
            <p>This leads to a reflection which here deſerves our attention; that, in order to fulfil that <hi>charity which is the end of the commandment,</hi> oeconomy, and good order in private life, ought to be carefully ſtudied by all Chriſtians. This is more cloſely connected with <hi>a good conſcience,</hi> than many ſeem inclined to admit. Oeconomy, when prudently and temperately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, is the ſafeguard of many virtues; and is in a particular manner favourable to the exertions of benevolence. He who by inconſiderate conduct is injuring his circumſtances, will probably in time loſe the inclination, and certainly is depriving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the means, of being ſerviceable to his brethren. Some important exertions, indeed, there are of charity, which have no connection with giving or beſtowing. Candour, forgiveneſs, gentleneſs, and ſympathy, are due to our brethren at all times, and in every ſituation of our own fortune. The poor have opportunities for diſplaying theſe virtues, as well as the rich. They who have nothing to give can often afford relief to others, by imparting what they feel. But, as far as beneficence is included in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028306_0025_0FD894F3C0DBE4F8"/>charity, we ought always to remember, that juſtice muſt, in the firſt place, inviolably be held ſacred.</p>
            <p>The wiſdom of ſcripture remarkably appears, in the connection pointed out by the text between <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>good conſcience</hi> or integrity; a connection which I apprehend is often not attended to ſo much as it deſerves. Among the frugal and induſtrious, great regard is commonly paid to juſtice. They will not defraud. They will not take any unlawful advantage in their dealings: And ſatisfied with this degree of <hi>good conſcience,</hi> they are ſtrangers to that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which is the <hi>end of the commandment.</hi> They are hard and unfeeling. They are rigid and ſevere in their demands. They know nothing of humanity, forgiveneſs, or compaſſion.—Among another claſs of men, who have been more liberally educated, and who are generally of a higher rank in life, juſtice is apt to be conſidered as a virtue leſs noble than chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and which may, on ſome occaſions be diſpenſed with. They are humane perhaps, and tender in their feelings. They are eaſy to their dependents. They can be liberal, even to profuſion. While, at the ſame time, they are accumulating debts, which they know themſelves unable to diſcharge. Their affairs are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to run into confuſion. Oeconomy and good order are neglected. The innocent, in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſuffer materially through their miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And all the while they aſſume to themſelves the praiſe of being generous and good-hearted men. This ſurely is not that <hi>charity</hi> which the Goſpel en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins; and which, in its very eſſence, involves <hi>good conſcience</hi> and integrity. He who pretends to do good to his brethren, without firſt doing them juſtice, cannot be accounted their real friend. True charity is not a meteor, which, occaſionally glares; but a luminary, which, in its orderly and regular courſe, diſpenſes a benignant influence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028306_0026_0FD894F5402C3468"/>
The third and laſt adjunct connected in the text with charity is, that it be <hi>of faith unfeigned</hi> Faith in the ſcripture ſenſe of it, includes the whole of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious principles reſpecting God, and reſpecting Chriſt. Good principles, without good practice, I confeſs, are nothing; they are of no avail in the ſight of God, nor in the eſtimation of wiſe men, But practice not founded on principle is likely to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways unſtable and wavering; and, therefore, the faith of religious principles enters, for a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſhare, into the proper diſcharge of the duties of charity.</p>
            <p>It will be admitted that, without faith, our duties towards God cannot be properely performed. You may be aſſured that your duties towards men will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways greatly ſuffer from the want of it. Faith, when pure and genuine, ſupplies to every part of virtue and in particular to the virtue of charity, many motives and aſſiſtances, of which the unbeliever is deſtitute. He who acts from faith acts upon the high principle of regard to the God who hath made him, and to the Saviour who redeems him; which will often ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him to his duty when other principles of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence become faint and languid, or are croſſed by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite intereſts. When he conſiders himſelf as pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the approbation of that divine Being, from whom love deſcends, a ſacred enthuſiaſm both prompts, and conſecrates, his charitable diſpoſitions. Regardleſs of men, or of human recompence, he is carried along by a higher impulſe. He acts with the ſpirit of a follower of the Son of God, who not only has enjoined love, but has enforced it by the example of laying down his life for mankind. Whatever he does in behalf of his fellow-creatures, he conſiders himſelf as doing, in ſome degree, to that divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who hath ſaid, <hi>Inaſmuch as ye have done it unto
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028306_0027_0FD894F6BAE1B718"/>one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth xxv. 40.</note> Hence charity is with him not only a moral virtue, but a Chriſtian grace. It acquires addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al dignity and energy from being connected with the heavenly ſtate and the heavenly inhabitants He mingles with beings of a higher order, while he is diſcharging his duty to his fellow creatures on earth; and by joining faith and piety to good works he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes the character of a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to explain the full ſenſe of that comprehenſive view of religion which is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the text. I have ſhown in what reſpects <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> joined with <hi>the pure heart, the good conſcience, and faith unfeigned</hi> forms <hi>the end of the commandment.</hi> Let us ever keep in view thoſe eſſential parts of a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character, and preſerve them in their proper uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus ſhall our religion riſe into a regular and well-proportioned edifice, where each part gives firmneſs and ſupport to another. If any one of thoſe material parts be wanting in the ſtructure; if, our ſyſtem of charity, either purity, or juſtice, or faith, be left, there will be cracks and ſlaws in the building which prepare its ruin.</p>
            <p>This is indeed one of the greateſt and moſt frequent errors of men, in their moral conduct. They take hold of virtue by pieces and corners only. Few are ſo depraved as to be without all ſenſe of duty, and all regard to it. To ſome moral qualities, which appear to them amiable or eſtimable, almoſt all men lay claim; and on theſe they reſt their worth, in their own eſtimation. But theſe ſcattered pieces of virtue, not uniting into one whole, nor forming a conſiſtent character, have no powerful influence on their general habits of life. From various unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028306_0028_0FD894F9C0FDEBE8"/>quarters they lie open to temptation. Their lives are full of contradiction, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> perpetually fluctuate between good and evil. Virtue can neither riſe to its native dignity nor attain its proper rewards, until all its chief parts be joined together in our character, and exert an equal authority in regulating our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>

            <p>THE ſun that rolls over our heads, the food that we receive, the reſt that we enjoy, daily admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh us of a ſuperior power, on whom the inhabitants of the earth depend for light, life, and ſubſiſtence. But as long as all things proceed in their ordinary courſe; when day returns after day with perfect ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilarity; when our life ſeems ſtationary, and nothing occurs to warn us of any approaching change, the religious ſentiments of dependence are apt to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. The great revolutions of time, when they come round in their ſtated order, have a tendency to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028306_0029_0FD894FB49F7AE78"/>force ſome impreſſions of piety even on the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking minds. They both mark our exiſtence on earth to be advancing towards its cloſe, and exhibit our condition as continually changing; while each returning year brings along with it new events and at the ſame time carries us forwards to the concluſion of all. We cannot, on ſuch occaſions avoid perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there is a Supreme Being who holds in his hands the line of our exiſtence, and meaſures out to each of us our allotted portion of that line. Beyond a certain limit, we know that it cannot be extended; and long before it reach that limit it may be cut aſunder by an inviſible hand, which is ſtretched forth over all the inhabitants of the world. Then natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ariſes the ejaculation of the text, <hi>My times. O God, are in thy hand.</hi>
               <q>My fate depends on thee. The duration of my life, and all the events which in future days are to fill it, are entirely at thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.</q>—Let us now, when we have juſt ſeen one year cloſe, and another begin, mediate ſeriouſly on this ſentiment. Let us conſider what is implied in <hi>our times being in the hand of God;</hi> and to what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement this meditation leads.</p>
            <p>The text evidently implies, firſt, that <hi>our times</hi> are not in our own hands; that, as our continuance in life depends not on ourſelves, ſo the events which are to happen, while life remains, are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. Of this we may behold many a proof, when we look back on the tranſactions of the year which is juſt finiſhed. Recollection will readily preſent to us a buſy period, filled up with a mixture of buſineſs and amuſement, of anxteties and cares, of joys and ſorrows. We have talked, perhaps and acted much. We have formed many a plan; in public or in private life, we have been engaged in a variety of purſuits. Let me
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028306_0030_0FD894FCC79FF338"/>now aſk, how ſmall a proportion of all that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened could have been foreſeen, or foretold by us? How many things have occured, of which we had no expectation; ſome, perhaps, that have ſucceeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our hopes; many, alſo, that have befallen us contrary to our wiſh? How often were each of us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed that there are ſecret wheels, which, unſeen by us, bring about the revolutions of human affairs; and that, while man was deviſing his way, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was directing the event?</p>
            <p>That ſcene is now cloſed. The tale of that year has been told. We look forward to the year which is beginning; and what do we behold there?—All, my brethren is a blank to our view: A dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known preſents itſelf. We are entering on an untri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, undiſcovered country, where, as each ſucceeding month comes forward, new ſcenes may open; new objects may engage our attention; changes at home or abroad, in public or private affairs, may alter the whole ſtate of our fortune. New connections may be at hand to be formed, or old ones juſt about to be diſſolved; perhaps, we may have little more to do with this world, or with any of its connections; we may be ſtanding on the verge of time and life, and on the point of paſſing into a new region of exiſtence. In ſhort the proſpect before us is full of awful uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Life and death, proſperity and adverſity, health and ſickneſs, joy and trouble, lie in one un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhable maſs, where our eye can deſcry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing through the obſcurity that wraps them up.</p>
            <p>While it is thus certain that <hi>our times</hi> are not at our own diſpoſal, we are taught, by the text, that they are <hi>in the hand of God.</hi> This may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two views. Our times are in the hand of God, as a ſupreme Diſpoſer of events. They are in the hand of God as a Guardian and a Father.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:028306_0031_0FD894FE4AC4D600"/>
               <hi>Our times,</hi> I ſay <hi>are in the hands of God</hi> as a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme irreſiſtible Ruler. All that is to happen to us in this and the ſucceeding years of our life,—if any ſucceeding years we ſhall be allowed to ſee,—has been foreknown and arranged by God. The firſt view, under which human affairs preſent themſelves to us, is that of confuſed and irregular ſucceſſion. The events of the world ſeem thrown together by chance, like the billows of the ſea, tumbling and toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over each other, without rule or order. All that is apparent to us is the fluctuation of human caprice, and the operation of human paſſions. We ſee the ſtrife of ambition, and the efforts of ſtratagem, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to accompliſh their ſeveral purpoſes among the ſocieties of men. But it is no more than the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, the outſide of things, that we behold. Higher counſels, than it is in our power to trace, are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the tranſactions of the world. If we believe in God at all, as the Governor of the univerſe, we muſt believe that, without his providence, nothing happens on earth. He over-rules, at his pleaſure, the paſſions of men. He bends all their deſigns into ſubſerviency to his decree. <hi>He makes the wrath of man to praiſe him</hi> and <hi>reſtrains,</hi> in what meaſure he thinks <hi>the remainder of wrath.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxvi. 10.</note> He brings forth in their courſe all the generations of men. When the time is come for their entering into light, they appear on the ſtage; and when the time fixed for their diſmiſſion arrives, he <hi>changes their countenance,</hi> and ſends them away. The time of our appearing is now come, after our anceſtors had left their place, and gone down to the duſt. We are at preſent permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to act our part freely, and without conſtraint. No violence is done to our inclination or choice.

               <hi>Our times are</hi> altogether <hi>in his hand.</hi> Let us take notice, that they are not in the hands either of our enemies, or of our friends. It is not in the power of man to ſhorten or to prolong our life, more or leſs than God has decreed. Enemies may employ craft or violence in their attacks; friends may employ ſkill and vigilance for the preſervation of our health and ſafety; but both the one and the other can have effect only as far as God permits. They work in ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to his purpoſe. By him they are held in inviſible bonds. To the exertions of all human agents he ſays, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, and no further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are to obſerve next, that <hi>our times are in the hand of God,</hi> not only as an almighty Diſpoſer, but as a merciful Guardian and Father. We are by no means to imagine, that from race to race, and from year to year, God ſports with the lives of ſucceeding generations of men, or, in the mere wantonneſs of arbitrary power, brings them forth, and ſends them away. No; if we have any confidence in what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the light of nature ſuggeſts to all men, or what the revelation of the goſpel has confirmed to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, we have full ground to believe, that the admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration of human affairs is conducted with infinite wiſdom and goodneſs. The counſels of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are indeed too deep for our limited underſtandings to trace. <hi>His path</hi> may often, as to as, be <hi>in the ſea, and his footſteps in the mighty waters;</hi> while, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <hi>all his paths are mercy and truth.</hi> He who, from
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028306_0033_0FD895013AA95968"/>the benignity of his nature, erected this world for the abode of men; He who furniſhed it ſo richly for our accommodation, and ſtored it with ſo much beauty for our entertainment; He who ſince firſt we entered into life, hath followed us with ſuch a variety of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſurely can have no pleaſure in our diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſtreſs. <hi>He knows our frame; he remembers we are duſt;</hi> and looks to frail man, we are aſſured, with <hi>ſuch pity as a father beareth to his children.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm ciii. 13, 14.</note> To him we may ſafely commit ourſelves, and all our concerns; as to one who is beſt qualified, both to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the incidents proper to happen to us in this world, and to judge of the time when it is fit for us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from it.</p>
            <p>Even that ignorance of our future deſtiny in life, of which we ſometimes complain, is a ſingle proof of his goodneſs. He hides from us the view of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, becauſe the view would be dangerous and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering. It would either diſpirit us with viſions of terror, or intoxicate us by the diſcloſure of ſucceſs. The veil which covers from our ſight the events of this and of ſucceeding years, is a veil woven by the hand of mercy. Our <hi>times are in his hand;</hi> and we have reaſon to be glad that in his hand they are kept, ſhut out from our view. Submit to his pleaſure as an almighty Ruler we muſt, becauſe we cannot reſiſt him. Equal reaſon there is for truſting in him as a Guardian, under whoſe diſpoſal we are ſate.</p>
            <p>Such is the import of the text, that <hi>our times are in the hand of God.</hi> Our times are unknown to us, and not under our own direction. They are in the hands of God as a Governor and Ruler; in the hands of God as a Guardian and Father. Theſe ſeparate views of the text require, on our part, ſeparate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028306_0034_0FD895039547EFE0"/>
Seeing our times are not in our own hand, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing futurity is unknown to us, let us, firſt, check the vain curioſity of penetrating into what is to come. Conjecture about futurity we often muſt; but upon all conjectures of what this year is to produce, let us lay a proper reſtraint. Let us wait till God ſhall bring forward events in their proper courſe, without wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcover what he has concealed; leſt, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery were granted, we ſhould ſee many things, which we would wiſh not to have ſeen.</p>
            <p>The moſt common propenſity of mankind is to ſtore futurity with whatever is agreeable to them; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in thoſe periods of life when imagination is live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hope is ardent. Looking forward to the year now beginning, they are ready to promiſe themſelves much from the foundations of proſperity which they have laid; from the friendſhips and connections which they have ſecured; from the plans of conduct which they have formed. Alas! how deceitful do all theſe dreams of happineſs often prove! While many are ſaying in ſecret to their hearts, <hi>To-morrow ſhall be as this day and more abundantly,</hi> we are obliged in return to ſay to them, <hi>Boaſt not thyſelf of to-morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> I do not mean, that in the unknown proſpect which lies before us, we ſhould forebode to ourſelves nothing but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. —May it be the pleaſure of Heaven that this year run on in a placid and tranquil tenor to us all!—But this I ſay, that in ſuch foreſight of futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as we are allowed to take, we may reckon upon it as certain, that this year ſhall prove to us, as many paſt have proved, a chequered ſcene of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and ſome troubles. In what proportion one or other of theſe ſhall prevail in it; whether, when it ends, it ſhall leave with us the memory of joys or of ſorrows, is to be determined by him in whoſe hands
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028306_0035_0FD895054CA30FC8"/>
               <hi>our times are.</hi> Our wiſdom is, to be prepared for whatever the year is to bring; prepared to receive comforts with thankfulneſs, troubles with fortitude; and to improve both for the great purpoſes of virtue and eternal life.</p>
            <p>Another important inſtruction which naturally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from our times not being in our own hands is, that we ought no longer to trifle with what it is not in our power to prolong; but that we ſhould make haſte to live as wiſe men; nor delaying till to-morrow what may be done to day; <hi>doing now with all our might whatever our hand findeth to do;</hi> before that <hi>night cometh wherein no man can work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Admiſts the uncertainty of the events which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, there is one thing we have too much reaſon to believe namely, that of us who are now aſſembled in this congregation, and who have ſeen the year begin, there are ſome who ſhall not ſurvive to ſee it cloſe. Whether it ſhall be you, or you, or I, who ſhall be gathered to our fathers before the revolving year has finiſhed its round, God alone knows. <hi>Our times are in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and?</hi> But to our place, it is more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſome of us ſhall have gone. Could we foretel the month, or the day, on which our change was to happen, how diligent would we be in ſetting our houſe in order, and preparing ourſelves to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Maker? Surely, that ought to be prepared for with moſt care, concerning which we are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how ſoon it is to take place. Let us therefore <hi>walk circumſpectly,</hi> and <hi>redeem the time.</hi> Let us diſmiſs thoſe trivial and ſuperſluous cares which burden or corrupt our life, in order to attend to what is of higheſt importance to us as men and Chriſtians. The beginning of each year ſhould carry to us all a ſolemn admonition of our folly, in neglecting to improve ſuitably the years that are paſt. It ſhould call up
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028306_0036_0FD895067B56C008"/>miſpent time into our view; and be like the hand coming forth upon the wall, in the days of Belſhazzar, and writing in legibl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> characters over againſt us, <q>O man! thy days are numbered; thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting; take care leſt thy kingdom be on the point of departing from thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When we conſider, in the next place, that our times as I before illuſtrated, are in the hand of God as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Diſpoſer, it is an obvious inference from this truth, that we ſhould prepare ourſelves to ſubmit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to his pleaſure both as to the events which are to fill up our days, and as to the time of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this world. To contend with him we know to be fruitleſs. The word that is gone ont of his moath muſt ſtand. In the path which he has marked out for us, whether it be ſhort or long, rugged or ſmooth, we muſt walk. Is it not then the dictate of wiſdom, that we ſhould previouſly reconcile ourſelves to this ſoverign ordination, and bring our minds to harmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize with what is appointed to be our deſtiny? Let us fortify this temper, by recalling that reflection of the wiſe man; <hi>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life; all the days of his vain life which he ſpendeth as a ſhadow?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſ. v 12.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To enjoy long life, and ſee many days, is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal with; and, as the wiſh is proinpted by nature it cannot be in itſelf unlawful. At the ſame time, ſeveral circumſtances concur to temper the eagerneſs of this wiſh; and to ſhow us that it ſhould always be formed under due ſubmiſſion to the wiſer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven. Who among us can tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in wiſhing for the continuance of many years on earth, we may not be only wiſhing for a prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028306_0037_0FD87F3BC5817068"/>of diſtreſs and miſery?—You might live, my friends, till you had undergone lingering rounds of ſevere pain, from which death would have proved a ſeaſonable deliverance. You might live till your breaſts were pierced with many a wound from public calamities or private ſorrows. You might live till you beheld the death of all whom you had loved; till you ſurvived all thoſe who love you; till you were left as deſolate ſtrangers on earth, in the midſt of a new race, who neither knew you, nor cared for you, but who wiſhed you off the ſtage.—Of a nature ſo ambiguous are all the proſpects which life ſets before us, that in every wiſh we form, relating to them, much reaſon we have to be ſatisfied that our times are in the hands of God, rather than our own.</p>
            <p>This conſideration is greatly ſtrengthened when, in the laſt place, we think of God acting, not as a Sovereign only, but as a Guardian, in the diſpoſal of our times. This is our great conſolation in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to futurity. To God as a wiſe Ruler, calm ſubmiſſion is due; but it is more than ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that belongs to him as a merciful Father; it is the ſpirit of cordial and affectionate conſent to his will. Unknown to us as the times to come are, it ſhould be ſufficient to our full repoſe that they are known to God. The day and the hour which are fixed in his counſels for our diſmiſſion from life, we ought to be perſuaded are fixed for the beſt; and that any longer we ſhould not wiſh to remain.</p>
            <p>When we ſee that laſt hour drawing nigh, though our ſpirits may be compoſed on our own account, yet, on account of our friends and families, no little anxiety and ſorrow may be ſometimes apt to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the mind. Long we have enjoyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their ſociety, and been accuſtomed to conſider them as parts of ourſelves. To be parted from them
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028306_0038_0FD89508009B9FD8"/>forever is, at any rate, a bitter thought; but to the bitterneſs of this, is over and above added the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of their ſuffering much by our death. We leave many a relation, perhaps may leave young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and a helpleſs family, behind us, to be expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to various dangers, and thrown forth on an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly world. Such virtuous anxieties often oppreſs the tender and feeling heart at the cloſing periods of life.—My brethren, look up to that God, in whoſe hands <hi>the times</hi> of your fathers were; in whoſe hand <hi>the times</hi> of your poſterity ſhall be. Recollect, for your comfort, the experience of ages. When were the righteous utterity forſaken by God in times paſt? Why ſhould they be forſaken by him in times to come; Well did he govern the world before you had a being in it: Well ſhall he continue to govern it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you are no more. No cauſe have you, therefore, to oppreſs your minds with the load of unknown fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. Commit your cares to a Father in heaven. Surrender your friends, and your family, to that God, who hath ſaid, <hi>The children of his ſervants ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and their ſeed ſhall be eſtabliſhed before him.</hi>

            <p>I have thus ſhewn what the import is, and what the improvement ſhould be, of the doctrine of the text, that <hi>our times are in the hand of God.</hi> It aſſerts a fact, the the truth of which can be called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by none; a fact which, whether perſons have any ſentiments of religion or not, is calculated to make a ſerious impreſſion on every mind; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſeaſons when the revolution of years gives us warning that our duration on earth is meaſured, and advances towards its period. To perſons who are
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028306_0039_0FD8950AC0608308"/>religiouſly diſpoſed, who ſtudy to improve life to its proper purpoſes, to do their duty towards God and man, and through the merits of their Redeemer to obtain grace and favour from Heaven, the doctrine of the text is ſtill more important. Among them it tends to awaken impreſſions which are not only ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but, as I have ſhown, ſalutary and comforting to the heart.—Thankful that our times are in the hand of a Sovereign, who is both wiſe and gracious, let us prepare ourſelves to meet the approaching events of life with becoming reſignation, and at the ſame time with manly conſtancy and firm truſt in God. As long as it ſhall pleaſe him to continue our abode in the world, let us remain faithful to our duty; and when it ſhall pleaſe him to give the command for, our remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val hence, let us utter only this voice: <q>In thy hand O my God, <hi>my times are.</hi> Thou art calling me away. Here I am, ready to obey thy call, and at thy ſignal to go forth. I thank thee that I have been admitted to pertake ſo long of the comforts of life, and to be a ſpectator of the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſplayed in thy works. I thank thee that thou haſt borne ſo long with my infirmities and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; haſt allowed me to look up to thy promiſes in the goſpel, and to hear the words of eternal life uttered by my great Redeemer. With gratitude faith, and hope I commit my ſoul to thee. <hi>Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace; for mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation.</hi>
               </q>—Such are the ſentiments with which every pious and good man ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his life. Such indeed are the ſentiments which he ought to carry through every part of life. With theſe may we begin, and with theſe conclude, every ſucceeding year which God ſhall think fit to add to our earthly exiſtence!</p>

            <p>THE parable, of which theſe words are a part, contains a prophetical deſcription of the ſtate of the church. Our Lord predicts that the ſocieties of Chriſtians were to be infected with perſons of looſe principles and bad diſpoſition, whom he likens to <hi>tares</hi> ſpringing up among <hi>wheat.</hi> He intimates that there ſhould ariſe ſome whoſe officious zeal would prompt the deſire of exterminating immediately all ſuch evil men; but that this were contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of providence, and to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity; that a complete ſeparation was indeed to be made at laſt between the good and the bad; but that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration was to be delayed till the end of the world, when, in the ſtile of the parable, the <hi>tares</hi> ſhould be entirely <hi>gathered out from among the wheat. Let both grow together until the harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we look around us, nothing is more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in the ſtate of the world, than that broad mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the religious and the impious, the virtuous and the wicked, which we find taking place in every ſociety. Strong objections ſeem hence to ariſe againſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028306_0041_0FD8950D3A5E6DB8"/>either the wiſdom or goodneſs of divine Providence; eſpecially when we behold bad men not only tolerated in the world, but occaſionally exalted in their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to the depreſſion of the juſt. Why, it will be ſaid, if a Supreme Being exiſt, and if his juſtice rule the univerſe, does he allow ſuch infamous perſons as the records of hiſtory often preſent, to have a place, and even to make a figure in his world? Why ſleeps the thunder idle in his hand, when it could ſo eaſily blaſt them? What ſhall we think of one who, having the power of exterminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them always at his command, permits them to proceed without diſturbance; nay, ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to look on them with complacency?—It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes highly worthy of our attention to conſider what anſwer can be made to theſe objections; to inquire whether any reaſons can be given that ſerve to juſtify this diſpenſation of Providence, in allowing a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bad men to continue on the face of the earth until the end of time. This inquiry ſhall make the ſubject of the preſent diſcourſe, together with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections as naturally ariſe from ſurveying the ſtate of human affairs.</p>
            <p>But, before entering directly on ſuch inquiry, it may be proper to take notice, that, in our eſtimation of who are the good, who are the bad, we are often in hazard of committing miſtakes. The real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of men are known only to God. They fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently depend on the ſecret and unſeen parts of life. As in judging of themſelves men are always partial, ſo in judging of others they often err, through the imperfect information which they have gathered, or the raſh prejudices which they have formed. They are too apt to limit the character of virtue to thoſe who agree wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h them in ſentiment and belief; and exaggerate the failings of thoſe againſt whom they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028306_0042_0FD8950EC66AB340"/>have conceived diſlike, into great and unpardonable crimes. Were it left to the indiſcreet zeal of ſome to extirpate from the earth all thoſe whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider as bad men, there is ground to apprehend that, inſtead of tares the wheat would often be rooted out.—At the ſame time, we readily admit the fact, as too manifeſt to be denied, that a multitude of groſs and notorious ſinners are now mixed with the followers of God and virtue. Let us proceed then to conſider how far this is conſiſtent with the juſtice and wiſdom of the Govenor of the world.</p>
            <p>It is a principle in which all ſerious and reflecting perſons have agreed, and which by many arguments is confirmed, that our preſent ſtate on earth is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſtate of diſcipline and improvement, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fit human nature for a higher and better ſtate which it is to attain hereafter. Now, this principle being once admitted, we ſay, that the mixture of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice which here prevails, is calculated to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this purpoſe better than a more unmixed and perfect ſtate of ſociety would have done.</p>
            <p>For, in the firſt place, the crimes of the wicked give occaſion to the exerciſe of many excellent diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of heart among the righteous. They bring forth all the ſuffering virtues, which otherwiſe would have had no field; and by the exerciſe of which the human character is tried, and acquires ſome of its chief honours. Were there no bad men in the world to vex and diſtreſs the good, the good might appear in the light of harmleſs innocence; but could have no opportunity of diſplaying fidelity, magnanimity, patience, and fortitude. One half of virtue, and not the leaſt important half, would be loſt to the world. In our preſent imperfect ſtate, any virtue which is never exerciſed is in hazard of becoming extinct in the human breaſt. If goodneſs conſtantly proceeded
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028306_0043_0FD895103B4101A0"/>in a ſmooth and flowery path; if, meeting with no adverſary to oppoſe it, it were ſurrounded on every hand with acclamation and praiſe, is there no ground to dread that it might be corrupted by vanity, or might ſink into indolence? This dangerous calm muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be interrupted. The waters muſt be troubled, leſt they ſhould ſtagnate and putrify. When you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wicked men multiplying in number, and increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in power, imagine not that Providence particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favours them. No; they are ſuffered for a time to proſper, that they may fulfil the high deſigns of heaven. They are employed as inſtruments in the hand of God for the improvement of his ſervants. They are the rods with which he chaſtens the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in order to rouſe them from a dangerous ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; to form them for the day of adverſity, and to teach them how to ſuffer honourably.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the mixture of the bad among the good ſerves not only to give exerciſe to the paſſive graces, but alſo to improve the active powers and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of man. It inures the righteous to vigilance and exertion. It obliges them to ſtand forth, and act their part with firmneſs and conſtancy in evil times. It gives occaſion for their virtues to ſhine with conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous luſtre; and makes them appear as <hi>the lights of the world</hi> amidſt ſurrounding darkneſs. Were it not for the dangers that ariſe from abounding iniquity, there would be no opportunity for courage to act, for wiſdom to admoniſh, for caution to watch, nor for faith to exert itſelf in <hi>overcoming the world.</hi> It is that mixture of diſpoſition which now takes place, that renders the theatre on which we act ſo buſy and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and ſo much fitted for giving employment to every part of man's intelligent and moral nature. It affords a complete field for the genuine diſplay of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; and gives every man the opportunity to come
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028306_0044_0FD87F3D5A194258"/>forth and ſhow what he is. Were the terror of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conduct altogether regular and uniform, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by no follies and vices, no croſs diſpoſitions and irregular paſſions, many of our active powers would find no exerciſe. Perhaps even our life would languiſh, and become too ſtill and inſipid. Man is not yet ripe for a paradiſe of innocence, and for the enjoyment of a perfect and faultleſs ſociety. As in the natural world, he is not made for perpetual ſpring and cloudleſs ſkies, but by the wintry ſtorm muſt be calied to exert his abilities for procuring ſhelter and defence; ſo in the moral world, intermixture of bad men renders many an exertion neceſſary, which in a perfect ſtate of the world would find no place, but which in the preſent ſtate of trial is proper and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.—The exiſtence of vice in the world aſſuredly teſtifies our preſent corruption; and according to the degree of its prevalence, is always, more or leſs, the ſource of miſery. It is a ſtanding proof of the fall and degeneracy of man. But as long as that fallen ſtate continues, the wiſdom of Providence eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in making the errors and frailties of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubſervient to the improvement of the juſt. <hi>Tares</hi> are for that reaſon ſuffered at preſent to grow up <hi>among the wheat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations on the wiſdom of Providence in this diſpenſation will be farther illuſtrated, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the uſeful inſtructions which we receive, or which at leaſt every wiſe man may receive, from the follies and vices of thoſe among whom we are obliged to live.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028306_0045_0FD89512D3DBD108"/>crimes have ariſen; obſerving how bad company has ſeduced this man from his original principles and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits; how a careleſs indulgence of pleaſure has blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intoxicated that man; how the neglect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitutions has, in another, gradually paved the way for open profligacy; much ſalutary inſtruction is conveyed to the virtuous. Tracing the dangerous and ſlippery paths by which ſo many have been inſenſibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etrayed into ruin, their views of human nature are enlarged; the ſenſe of their own imbecility is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed upon them; accompanied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the neceſſity of a conſtant dependence on the grace and aſſiſtance of heaven. All the crimes which they behold diſturbing ſociety around them, ſerve as ſignals hung out to them, beacons planted in their view, to prevent their making ſhipwreck among thoſe rocks on which others have ſplit. It has been juſtly ſaid, that not only from the advices of his friends, but from the reproaches of his enemies, a wiſe man may draw inſtruction. In the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is not only by the examples of good men, but likewiſe by thoſe of the wicked, that an attentive mind may be confirmed in virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next.</hi> Theſe examples of bad men, while they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the virtuous of the dangers againſt which they are to guard, are farther profitable by the views which they exhibit of the evil and the deformity of ſin. Its odious nature never appears in ſo ſtrong a light as when diſplayed in the crimes of the wicked. It is true that, when vice is carried to a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and diſguiſed by plauſible colours, it may paſs unreproved, and even for a while ſeem popular in the world. But it is no leſs true that, when it becomes open and flagrant, and is deprived of the ſhadow of virtue, it never fails to in our general reproach, and to become the object either of contempt or of hatred.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:028306_0046_0FD895140008F110"/>How often, for inſtance, have the abilities, which once drew eſteem and admiration, ſunk, in a ſhort time, into the moſt humiliating degradation mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the aſcendant which corrupted inclinations and low habits had acquired over their poſſeſſor? How often have the riſing honours of the young been blaſted, by their forſaking the path of honour on which they had once entered, for the blind and crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tracts of depravity and folly? Such ſpectacles of the infamy of vice, ſuch memerials of the diſgrace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, are permitted by Providence for general inſtruction and are aſſuredly edifying to the world. It was neceſſary, for moral improvement, that the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellence of virtue, and the deformity of vice, ſhould be ſtrongly impreſſed on every intelligent mind. This could never be done with ſo great advantage as by the ſtriking contraſts of both which are produced by the living examples of evil men intermixed with the good. It is in this mirror that we clearly contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate how much the <hi>righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame purpoſe of important inſtruction is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promoted by the inſtances of miſery which the ſtate of wicked men on earth affords. I admit that the worldly ſucceſs, which ſometimes attends them, may blind and ſeduce the unwary; but a little more reffection enables men to diſtinguiſh between appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſucceſs and real happineſs. The condition of worthleſs men, whatever ſplendor riches may throw around them, is eaſily diſcerned to be a reſtleſs and miſerable one; and the miſery which they ſuffer, to be derived from their vices.

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028306_0047_0FD89515809093B8"/>deceiving and deceived; ſupplanting and ſupplanted; ever purſuing, but never ſatisfied? Theſe are not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of rare obſervation, or which require nice ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny to diſcover them. We need only open our eyes to behold the wicked tormented by their paſſions, and far removed from that ſanctuary of calmneſs and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity which is the abode of real happineſs. Nay, when we appeal to bad men themſelves, after they have run the whole round of vicious pleaſures, we will often find them obliged to confeſs, that the wretched reſult of their purſuits has been <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit;</hi> and that the happieſt days they have enjoyed were in the times of innocence; before criminal deſires and guilty paſſions had taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their breaſts. Such practical demonſtrations as theſe of the infelicity of ſin are yielded by the examples of evil doers whom we ſee around us. By attending to their ſituation, the miſery, as well as infamy of guilt is realiſed, and rendered ſenſible to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p>Thus, upon a fair inquiry, you behold how the ways of God may, in this remarkable caſe, be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to man. You behold what important ends are advanced, by permitting <hi>the tares</hi> at preſent to <hi>grow together with the wheat.</hi> The intermixture of evil men in human ſociety ſerves to exerciſe the ſuffering graces and virtues of the good; by the diverſity of characters among thoſe with whom they have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it ſerves to bring forth and improve their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers and virtues, and to enlarge the circle of uſeful occupations; it ferves to inſtruct them in the temptations againſt which they are to guard, to reveal to them all the deformity of vice, and to make its miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſs conſpicuouſly before their eyes. When we con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>der them as actors on the theatre of the world, they are thereby improved in the part they have to perform.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:028306_0048_0FD89516FA505840"/>When we conſider them as ſpectators of what is paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that theatre, their minds are thereby inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their views rectified and enlarged by the objects that are ſet before them.</p>
            <p>From theſe important truths, ſeveral reflections no leſs important ariſe.</p>
            <p>We are naturally taught, in the firſt place, never to be haſty in finding fault with any of the arrangements of Providence. The preſent permiſſion of moral evil on the earth ſeemed, on the firſt view, to furniſh a ſtrong objection againſt either the wiſdom or the goodneſs of the Author of nature. After beholding the uſeful purpoſes which are anſwered by that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, how cautious ſhould we be in advancing any of our raſh ſpeculations againſt his government and conduct! To our confined and humble ſtation it belongs not to cenſure, but to ſubmit, truſt, and adore; ſatisfied that the farther we enquire, the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his ways will appear the more; thankful for the diſcoveries of them which have been imparted to us; and perſuaded that, where our diſcoveries fail, it is not becauſe there is no more wiſdom or goodneſs to be ſeen, but becauſe our preſent condition allows us not to ſee more.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, let us be taught with what eye we are to look upon thoſe bad men whom we find around us in the world. Not ſurely with an eye of envy. Whatever proſperity they may ſeem to enjoy, they are ſtill no more than <hi>tares,</hi> the weeds of the field; contemptible in the ſight of God; tolerated by his providence for a while on account of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, to whoſe improvement they are rendered ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient. The parable informs us that, in the end, they are to be <hi>gathered and burnt.</hi> In this life only they have <hi>their good things.</hi> But their proſperity is tranſitory. <hi>They are brought into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſolation in a moment,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028306_0049_0FD8951889BC08F0"/>and utterly conſumed with terrors. As a dream when one awaketh, ſo, O God, when thou awakeſt, thou ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt deſpiſe their image</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm Ixxiii. 19.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>.— When we conſider their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate, it becomes us to behold them with the eye of pity. Let us remember that, in the midſt of their errors, they are by nature ſtill our brethren. Let us not behave to them in the ſpirit of bitterneſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not their follies. Pride not yourſelves on ſuperior virtue. Remember that, as bad men are mixed with the good, ſo, in the beſt men, vices are at preſent mixed with virtues. Your own character, good as you may eſteem it, is not free from every evil taint; and in the characters of thoſe whom you reprobate as vitious, there are always ſome good qualities mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the bad ones. Study, as far as you can, to reclaim and amend them; and if, in any degree, you have been profited by their failings, endeavour, in return, to profit them, by good counſel and advice, by advice, not adminiſtered with officious zeal, or ſelf-conceited ſuperiority, but with the tenderneſs of compaſſion and real friendſhip.</p>
            <p>In the third place, in whatever proportion the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of vice may ſeem to take place in the world, let us never deſpair of the prevalence of virtue on the whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond meaſure, the quantity of vice that is found in the mixture. It is proper to obſerve, that in the parable now before us, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the owner of the field had <hi>ſown his good ſeed,</hi> no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is given us to think, that the good ſeed was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely chocked up by <hi>tares.</hi> On the contrary, we are told that <hi>the blade ſprung up, and brought forth fruit;</hi> and, though the <hi>tares</hi> alſo aroſe, yet, in the end there was a <hi>harveſt,</hi> when the <hi>wheat was reaped and gathered into the barn.</hi> In the moſt corrupted times, God never leaves
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:028306_0050_0FD8951A09293AE8"/>himſelf without many witneſſes on earth. He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at entive to the cauſe of goodneſs; and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupports and advances, it by means which we are una<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> to trace. He nouriſhes much piety and virtue in hearts that are unknown to us; and beholds repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ready to ſpring up among many whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a reprobates.—I know that it has always been comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> for perſons to repreſent the age in which they live as the worſt that ever appeared; and religion and virtue as juſt on the point of vaniſhing from among m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. This is the language ſometimes of the ſerious; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ten of the hypocritical, or of the narrow-minded. But true religion gives no ſanction to ſuch ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or ſuch gloomy views. Though the <hi>tares</hi> muſt be at all times ſpringing up, there is no reaſon for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they ſhall ever overſpread the whole field. The nature of the weeds that ſpring up may vary, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the ſoil. Different modes of iniquity may diſtinguiſh different ages of the world; while the ſum of corruption is nearly the ſame. Let not our judgments of men, and of the times in which we live, be haſty and preſumptuous. Let us truſt in the grace of God; and hope the beſt of mankind.</p>
            <p>In the fourth and laſt place, let us keep our eyes ever fixed on that important period, which is alluded to in the text, as the concluſion of all. <hi>Let both grow together until the harveſt.</hi> The great ſpiritual year is to be cloſed by <hi>a harveſt,</hi> when <hi>the houſeholder is to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wheat into his barn;</hi> when, at the end of the world, the final diſtinction of men and characters is to take place. The confuſed mixture of good and evil, which now prevails, is only a temporary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of Providence, accommodated to man's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and imperfect ſtate. Let it not tempt us for a moment to diſtruſt the reality of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or to entertain the remoteſt ſuſpicion that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028306_0051_0FD8951B80D64778"/>good and evil are to be on the ſame terms forever. The frailties of our nature fitted us for no more at preſent than the enjoyment of a very mixed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſociety. But when our nature, pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Looking forward to this glorious iſſue with ſtedfaſt faith, let no croſs appearances every diſcomfit our hopes, or lead us to ſuſpect that we have been ſerving God in vain.

               </gap> all his diſcourſes; and, in the words of the text, is expreſſed with much energy. In the preceding verſe, he had given a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gh account of his own perſon and dignity. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father; and no man knoweth the Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, ſave the Son, and he to whomſoever the Son will reveal him.</hi> But leaſt any of his hearers ſhould be diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by this myſterious repreſentation of his greatneſs, he inſtantly tempers it with the moſt gracious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity; declaring, in the text, the merciful inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his miſſion to the world, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing which claims our attention in theſe words is, what we are to underſtand by <hi>coming unto Chriſt.</hi> This is a phraſe which has often given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to controverſey. By theological writers it has been involved in much needleſs myſtery, while the meaning in itſelf is plain and eaſy. The very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor that is here uſed ſerves to explain it. In the ancient world, diſciples flocked round their different teachers, and attended them wherever they went; in order both to teſtify their attachment, and to imbibe more fully the doctrine of their maſters. <hi>Coming unto Chriſt,</hi> therefore, is the ſame with reſorting to him as our declared Maſter? acknowledging ourſelves his diſciples, believers in his doctrine, and followers of his precepts. As Chriſt is made known to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the character both of a Teacher and a Saviour, our <hi>coming to him</hi> imports not only ſubmiſſion to his inſtructions, but confidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his power to ſave. It imports that, forſaking the corruptions of ſin and the world, we follow that courſe of virtue and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028306_0054_0FD895217A3108A0"/>which he points out to us; relying on his med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation for pardon of our offences, and acceptance w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>h heaven. This is what is implied in the ſcripture term <hi>Faith;</hi> which includes both the aſſent of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the truth of the Chriſtian religion, and the concurrence of the will in receiving it.</p>
            <p>What next occurs in the text to attract our notice is the deſcription of thoſe to whom the invitation is addreſſed. All thoſe who <hi>labour and are heavy laden,</hi> that is, who, in one way or other, feel themſelves grieved and dutreſſed, are here invited to come to Chriſt.—Now, from two ſources chiefly our diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ariſe; from moral, or from natural cauſes.</p>

He conſiders that he is undoubtedly placed under the government of a juſt God, who did not ſend him into this world for

            <p>Such diſtreſſes as theſe, ariſing from moral internal cauſes, may be made light of by the giddy and the vain; and repreſented as confined to a few perſons only of diſtempered imagination. But to thoſe whoſe profeſſions give them occaſion to ſee men under vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumſtances of affliction, they are known to be far from being unfrequent in the world; and on many more occaſions than is commonly imagined, to throw over the human mind the blackeſt gloom of which it is ſuſceptible. Religious feelings, be aſſured, have a deep root in the nature of man. They form a part of the human conſtitution. They are interwoven with many of thoſe fears and hopes which actuates us in the changing ſituations of fortune. During the gay and active periods of life, they may be ſmothered; but with moſt men, they are ſmothered rather than totally obliterated: And if any criſis of our condition ſhall awaken, and bring them forth, in their full force upon a conſcious guilty heart, woe to the man, who, in ſome diſconſolate ſeaſon, is doomed to ſuffer their extreme vengeance!</p>
            <p>But, while under ſuch diſtreſſes of the mind not
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028306_0056_0FD895247B452050"/>a few may be ſaid to <hi>labour and to be heavy laden,</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtill is the multitude of thoſe who, from natural external cauſes, from the calamities and evils of life, undergo much ſuffering and miſery. The life of man is not indeed wholly compoſed of miſery. It admits of many, pleaſing ſcenes. On the whole, there is reaſon to believe that it affords more joy than grief. At the ſame time, the unfortunate, as I before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, form always a numerous claſs of mankind; and it may be ſaid with truth, that <hi>ſore travel is ordained for the ſons of men.</hi> Though the burden is not equally laid on all; ſome there always are, on whom it falls with oppreſſive weight.—Unexpected diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have cruſhed their hopes, and blaſted the plans which they had formed for comfort in the world. The world had, perhaps, ſmiled upon them once, only to give them a feeling of its miſeries at the laſt. Struggling with poverty, unable to ſupport their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies whom they ſee languiſhing around them, they, at the ſame time, are obliged by their ſituation in ſo ciety to conceal their neceſſities; and under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>When we turn to thoſe who are accounted proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, we ſhall always find many ſorrows mingled with their pleaſures; many hours of care and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein they acknowledge themſelves claſſed with thoſe who <hi>labour and are heavy laden.</hi> In en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

Yet, even there, could we look into the boſoms of theſe appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently happy perſons, how often would we find them inwardly preyed upon by ſome tormenting ſuſpicions ſome anxious fears, ſome ſecret griefs which either they dare not diſcloſe to the world, or from which, if diſcloſed, they can look for no relief?—In ſhort, amidſt that great company of pilgrims, who are jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying through life, many there are whoſe journey lies through a valley of tears; and many to whom that valley is only cheered by tranſient glimpſes of joy.</p>
            <p>To theſe claſſes of mankind is addreſſed the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the text. To them, it is in a particular manner addreſſed; overlooking the giddy and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated multitude. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden.</hi> Not as if our Saviour were always ready to accept that ſort of piety which is merely the conſequence of diſtreſs; or made all thoſe welcome, who are driven by nothing but fear or danger to have recourſe to him. His words are to be underſtood as intimating, that the heart which is humbled and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by affliction, is the object of his compaſſionate regard; that he will not reject us merely becauſe we have been caſt off by the world; but that, if with proper diſpoſitions and ſentiments we apply to him in the evil day, we ſhall be ſure of meeting with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reception. It now remains to ſhow, what that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is which we may look for; what that reſt is which Chriſt hath promiſed to confer on thoſe who <hi>come to him;</hi> whether their diſtreſſes ariſe from moral or natural cauſes. <hi>Come unto me, and I will give you reſt.</hi>

1. Chriſt affords reſt to the diſturbed mind that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under apprehenſions and fears of guilt. Let thoſe who ſuffer diſtreſs of this nature <hi>come to Chriſt,</hi> that is, with contrition and repentance, have recourſe to him as their Saviour, and they ſhall regain quietneſs and peace. Fooliſh and guilty they have been; and juſtly lie under dread of puniſhment; but the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſorrow which they now feel, implies their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be changed. It implies, as far as it is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, that, ſenſible of their folly, they now deſire to become good and wiſe; and are determined for the future to hold a virtuous courſe, could they only hope to obtain pardon for the paſt. In this ſituation of mind, let them not be caſt down and deſpair. Chriſt has brought with him from heaven the olive branch. He carries in his hand the ſignal of forgiveneſs. The declaration which he publiſhes is, <hi>Let the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lv. 7.</note> Inſufficient though our own repentance be, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure pardon from heaven, we are informed, that an all-ſufficient atonement has been made by Chriſt. Neither the number nor the atrocity of offences ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, from forgiveneſs, the penitent who returns to his duty. To all who come under this deſcription, the offer of mercy extends, without exception. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi>

Conſider what <hi>reſt</hi> the religion of Chriſt gives to them whoſe diſtreſs ariſes not from inward and moral, but from natural and external cauſes; from adverſe fortune, or any of thoſe numerous calamities to which we are at preſent expoſed To ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, it may ſeem more difficult to promiſe any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual relief. In the former caſe, the diſtreſs lay entirely in the mind. As ſoon as its views are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and its apprehenſions quieted, the evil is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the cure effected. Here, the diſtreſs ariſes from without; and the religion of Chriſt affects not the courſe of external events. But though it removes not all the evils of life, though it promiſes no contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance of undiſturbed proſperity, (which indeed it were not ſulutary for man always to enjoy) yet, if it mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igates the evils which neceſſarily belong to our ſtate, and ſupports us under them, it may juſtly be ſaid to give <hi>reſt to them who labour and are heavy laden.</hi> When
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028306_0060_0FD8952A7A2095B0"/>much that is material and important is effected, we have no cauſe to complain, though all that we deſire be not accompliſhed.—In this part of the diſcourſe, I am to be conſidered as addreſſing myſelf not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuch as are at preſent ſuffering any ſevere ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It inſpires fortitude. It diſcovers a ſupreme adminiſtration, ſo friendly to the intereſts of goodneſs, as never to allow the followers of Chriſt to dread, that, in any ſituation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they ſhall be neglected by Heaven. From the abſtract conſideration of the divine perfections, men had always ſome ground to believe, that the general order of the univerſe was conſulted by its great Ruler. But how far the intereſt of individuals might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to yield, or, in many caſes might be ſacrificed, to this general order, they were left altogether in the dark. Here the goſpel of Chriſt comes to our aid, by the explicit aſſurance which it gives, that, in the great ſyſtem of Providence, the welfare of every ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle good man is particularly included. <hi>All things,</hi> we are expreſsly told, are made to <hi>work together,</hi> not merely for the order and perfection of the whole, but alſo <hi>for good to them who love God.</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028306_0061_0FD8952C0D34D818"/>perſon, who comes under this deſcription, forms a ſyſtem complete within itſelf; where every event that happens to him poſſeſſes its deſtined place, and forms a link in that great chain of cauſes, which was appointed, from the beginning of things, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his improvement and felicity. Such an arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the affairs of the world, may appear aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our narrow capacities; yet ſurely implies no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort beyond the reach of infinite power, joined with infinite wiſdom and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>Hence ariſes a degree of fortitude and conſtancy to good men, which can upon no other grounds be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Faith, in theſe principles of the goſpel, erects for them a fortieſs, impregnable to the aſſaults of the world, into which they can at all times retreat. Sitting under the ſhelter of divine protection, they calmly hear the ſtorm, when it blows with its utmoſt violence around them. <hi>The floods have lifted up their voice; they have lifted up all their waves But the Lord on high is mightier than the noiſe of many waters; yea, than the mighty waves of the ſea.</hi>

            <p>The doctrine of Chriſt not only arms us, in this manner, with fortitude againſt the approach of evil; but, ſuppoſing evils to fall upon us with their heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt preſſure, it lightens the load by many conſolations to which others are ſtrangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are viſited, the hand of an offended ſovereign, Chriſtians are taught to view
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028306_0062_0FD8952D8DAB09E8"/>them as the well-intended chaſtiſements of a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father. They hear amidſt them, that ſtill voice which a good conſcience brings to their ear: <hi>Fear not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah xli. 10.</note> They apply to themſelves the comfortable promiſes with which the goſpel abounds. They diſcover in theſe the happy iſſue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence ſhall have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed its great and good deſigns. In the mean time, devotion opens to them its bleſſed and holy time, devotion opens to them its bleſſed and holy ſanctuary: That ſanctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at reſt; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults are huſhed, and its miſeries diſappear; where greater objects open to our view than what the world preſents; where a more ſerene ſky ſhines, and a ſweeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In thoſe moments of devotion, a pious man, pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his wants and ſorrows to an almighty Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter, feels that he is not left ſolitary and forſaken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt are with him; and, though he ſhould be bereaved of every earthly friend, he can look up in heaven to a Friend who will never die.</p>
            <p>To theſe preſent conſolations, the religion of Chriſt adds the joyful proſpect of that future ſtate, where eternal <hi>reſt remaineth for the people of God.</hi> This life they are taught to conſider as only the <hi>houſe of their pilgrimage;</hi> the temporary manſion of painful though neceſſary diſcipline. But let them endure for a little and the pilgrimage ſhall end, the diſcipline ſhall be finiſhed; and all the virtuous be aſſembled in thoſe bliſsful regions which are prepared for their reward. Such a proſpect cheers the darkeſt hours of life;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028306_0063_0FD8952EFB072CF0"/>and affords a remedy to every trouble. <hi>The ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 18.</note> They appear in this comparative view, as no more than a diſtreſſing dream of the night, from which one awakes into health, and light, and joy.—Peculiar is this high conſolation to the religion of Chriſt. It is what all nations had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly wiſhed for; what all philoſophy had anxiouſly ſought to diſcover; but what no reſearch, no philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy were able to aſcertain to mankind, till Chriſt brought the aſſurance of life and immortality from heaven; and conferred on his diſciples this noble and ineſtimable gift.</p>
            <p>Thus, on the whole, the Chriſtain doctrine is found to be the great Medicine of life. It is the balm of human ſorrows and cares. In our preſent ſtate, where ſo many are ſuffering actual diſtreſs, of one kind or other, and where all have reaſon to dread the approach of diſtreſs, it is religion only that can alleviate the burdens of life, and ſmooth our paſſage through this evil world.—Let this view of religion perſuade us to improve the ſacred ordinance of our Lord's ſupper for <hi>coming unto Chriſt,</hi> in the way before explained: that is, joining ourſelves to him as his diſciples; his diſciples, not in words and profeſſions only, but in heart, and in truth; <hi>taking upon us his yoke,</hi> as is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the words immediately following the text; <hi>and learning of him who is meek and lowly in heart.</hi> Let thoſe who labour under the ſenſe of remembred follies and crimes, <hi>come unto Chriſt</hi> with penitent diſpoſitions, and they ſhall obtain pardon. Let thoſe who labour under the ſuffering of preſent, or the apprehenſion of future ſorrows, <hi>come unto Chriſt,</hi> and they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive conſolation. All who are in any ſenſe <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028306_0064_0FD8953151D25508"/>laden,</hi> coming unto him, ſhall find <hi>reſt</hi> to their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Before concluding this diſcourſe, there is another ſet of men, not yet mentioned, to whom I muſt alſo addreſs the exhortation in the text; thoſe I mean, who labouring under none of the diſtreſsful burdens of life are ſurfeited of its pleaſures; who labour under the burden only of languid eaſe, and the load of inſipid proſperity. You drag, my friends, but a miſearble exiſtence. Oppreſſed by no ſorrow, you feel vacuity and diſſatisfaction within; you are often weary of life; and in your ſolitary hours, are diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that all you have experienced is vanity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould you any longer <hi>ſpend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not? Come to the waters which are now offered to you, and drink. Hear, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the corrupting vanities of the world, to Chriſt, to religion, and to virtue. New ſources of enjoyment ſhall then be opened to you. A world yet untried ſhall diſplay itſelf to your view. You ſhall be formed to a reliſh for the quiet and innocent pleaſures of piety and devotion; of friendſhip, and good affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; of uſeful knowledge, and virtuous activity; of calm ſociety, and ſeaſonable retirement; pleaſures of which at preſent you have no conception; but which, upon trial. you ſhall find ſuperior to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, or turbulent amuſements, in which you have hitherto paſſed your days.—The true ſatisfaction of the human mind is only to be found in religion and goodneſs; in a purified heart, and a virtuous life. All other plans of happineſs are fallacious, and preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with diſappointment. It is only by <hi>acquainting ourſelves with God</hi> that we can <hi>find peace:</hi> And thoſe who are <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> now, ſhall be <hi>weary and heavy laden</hi> to the end, unleſs they come to him who only can <hi>give them reſt.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT appears from many paſſages in the writings of this prophet, that in his days great corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners had begun to take place among the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Originally a ſober and a religious nation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to a ſimple and paſtoral life, after they had enlarged their territories by conqueſt, and acquired wealth by commerce, they gradually contracted habits of luxury; and luxury ſoon introduced its uſual train of attending evils. In the hiſtory of all nations, the ſame circulation of manners has been found; and the age in which we live reſembles, in this reſpect, the ages which have gone before it. Forms of iniquity may vary; but the corrupt propenſities of men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main at all times much the ſame; and revolutions from primitive ſimplicity to the refinements of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal luxury have been often exhibited on the ſtage of the world. The reproof directed in the text to the Jews of that antient age, will be found equally appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the manners of many, in modern times. In diſcourſing from it, I ſhall firſt conſider the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028306_0066_0FD895343AC86E70"/>of thoſe who are deſcribed in the text, and ſhow the guilt that is involved in it. I ſhall next conſider the duties which perſons of that character are ſuppoſed to have neglected; to <hi>regard the work of the Lord, and to conſider the operation of his hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. When we take into view the character pointed at in the text, it is evident that what the prophet means to reprove is, the ſpirit of inconſiderate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation of intemperate indulgence, and irreligious luxury. It is not <hi>the feaſt and the wine, the harp and the viol,</hi> which he means to condemn. Muſic and wine are, in themſelves, things of innocent nature: Nay, when temperately enjoyed, they may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for uſeful purpoſes; for affording relaxation from the oppreſſive cares of life, and for promoting friendly intercourſe among men. The opulent are not prohibited from enjoying the good things of this world, which Providence has beſtowed upon them. Religion neither aboliſhes the diſtinction of ranks, (as the vain philoſophy of ſome would teach us to do,) nor interferes with a modeſt and decent indulgence of pleaſure.—It is the criminal abuſe of pleaſure which is here cenſured; that thoughtleſs and intemperate enjoyment of it which wholly abſorbs the time and attention of men; which obliterates every ſerious thought of the proper buſineſs of life; and effaces the ſenſe of religion and of God.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to remark, that it is not open and direct impiety, which is laid to the charge of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons here characteriſed. It is not ſaid, that in their feaſts they ſcoffed at religion, or blaſphemed the name of God. To this ſummit of wickedneſs theſe perſons had not yet arrived; perhaps, the age in which they lived gave not its countenance to this wantonneſs of impiety. It is merely a negative crime of which they are accuſed; that they <hi>regarded not the work of the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028306_0067_0FD8953680937218"/>Lord, neither conſidered the operation of his hands.</hi> But this abſence of all religious impreſſions is here pointed out, as ſufficient to ſtigmatize their characters with guilt. As ſoon as the ſenſe of a Supreme Being is loſt, the great check is taken off, which keeps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraint the paſſions of men. Mean deſires, and low pleaſures, take place of the greater and nobler ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents which reaſon and religion inſpire. Amidſt the tumult of <hi>the wine and the feaſt,</hi> all proper views of human life are forgotten. The duties which, as men, they have to perform, the part they have to act in the world, and the diſtreſſes to which they are expoſing themſelves, are baniſhed from their thoughts. <hi>To-morrow ſhall be as this day, and more abundantly,</hi> is the only voice Inflamed by ſociety, and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from one looſe companion to another, the ſpirit of riot grows and ſwells, till it end in brutal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
            <p>Were ſuch diſorders rare and occaſional merely, they might perhaps be forgotten and forgiven. But, nouriſhed by repetition and habit, they grow up among too many, to become the buſineſs and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life. By theſe unfortunate votaries of pleaſure, they are accounted eſſential to happineſs, life appears to ſtagnate without them. Having no reſource within themſelves, their ſpirits ſink, and their very being ſeems annihilated, till the return of their favourite pleaſures awaken within them ſome tranſient ſparkles of joy. —Idleneſs, eaſe, and proſperity, have too natural a tendency to generate the follies and vices now deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Becauſe they have no changes,</hi> ſaid the Pſalmiſt, <hi>therefore they fear not God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lv. 19.</note> They are the dark and ſolitary hours of life, which recal men to recollection and wiſdom. They ſhow to the unthinking what
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028306_0068_0FD8953846200DE0"/>this world really is, and what may be expected from it. But the day that is always bright and unclouded, is not made for men. It flatters them with the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous illuſion, that it is in their power to render life one ſcene of pleaſure; and that they have no other buſineſs on earth but to ſpread the <hi>feaſt,</hi> and call <hi>the harp and the viol</hi> to ſound. But the examples are ſo frequent, of the dangers and the crimes which ariſe from an intemperate abure of pleaſure, that on this part of the ſubject it ſeems needleſs to inſiſt any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I proceed, therefore.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the duties which men are accuſed of having neglected; and which, it is here ſuppoſed, if duly attended to, would have acted as the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of diſſolute and irreligious luxury; thoſe are, to <hi>regard the work of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>conſider the operation of his hands.</hi>—By recommending ſuch duties. I do not mean to repreſent it as requiſite that the feaſt ſhould be turned into an act of worſhip? that the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of men ſhould be always grave; or that, in the hours of amuſement and of ſocial feſtivity, no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may employ their thoughts and their diſcourſe, except God and a future ſtate. All extremes in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are dangerous; and, by carrying auſterity too far, we are in hazard of only promoting hypocriſy. But though ſome, in the laſt age, might be prone to this extreme; yet, at the preſent day, there is not much occaſion for warning men againſt it.—What I now inſiſt upon is, that all our pleaſures ought to be tempered with a ſerious ſenſe of God; that ſcenes of gaiety and enjoyment ſhould never make us forget that we are ſubjects of his government, and have a part allotted us to act in his world; that on no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they ſhould be prolonged ſo much, repeated ſo often, or ſuffered to tranſport us ſo far, as to lead us to break any of the divine laws, or to act inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028306_0069_0FD8953AFB60AF00"/>with the character of men and Chriſtians. A prevailing ſenſe of God on the mind is to be ever hold the ſureſt guard of innocence and virtue, amidſt the allurements of pleaſure. It is the ſalutary mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which muſt be infuſſed into the cup of joy, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to render it ſafe and innoxious.</p>
            <p>This ſenſe of God ſhould lead us, in the language of the prophet, to <hi>regard the work of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>conſider the operation of his hands;</hi> which expreſſions may be underſtood as requiring us to have God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our thoughts under two views: <hi>to regard his work,</hi> as the Author of nature; and <hi>to conſider the operation of his hands,</hi> as the Governor of the world. Let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more particularly to each of theſe views of the Supreme Being.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, we are to view God as the Author of nature, <hi>or to regard the work of the Lord.</hi> With his works we are in every place ſurrounded. We can caſt our eyes no where, without diſcerning the hand of Him who formed them, if the groſſneſs of our minds will only allow us to behold Him. Let giddy and thoughtleſs men turn aſide a little from the haunts of riot. Let them ſtand ſtill, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the wondrous works of God; and make trial of the effect which ſuch contemplation would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. —It were good for them that, even independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently of the Author, they were more acquainted with his works; good for them, that from the ſocieties of looſe and diſſolute men, they would retreat to the ſcenes of nature; would oftener dwell among them, and enjoy their beauties. This would form them to the reliſh of uncorrupted, innocent pleaſures; and make them feel the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to higher and more ſerious thoughts theſe works of nature give occaſion, when conſidered in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Creator who made them.—Let me call on you, my friends, to catch ſome interval of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſome ſerious moment, for looking with thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye on the world around you. Lift your view to that immenſe arch of heaven which encompaſſes you above. Behold the ſun in all his ſplendor rolling over your head by day; and the moon, by night, in mild and ſerene majeſty, ſurrounded with that hoſt of ſtars which preſent to your imagination an innumerable multitude of worlds. Liſten to the awful voice of thunder. Liſten to the roar of the tempeſt and the ocean. Survey the wonders that fill the earth which you inhabit. Contemplate a ſteady and powerful Hand, bringing round ſpring and ſummer, autumn and winter, in regular courſe; decorating this earth with innumerable beauties, diverſifying it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable inhabitants; pouring forth comforts on all that live; and, at the ſame time, overawing the nations with the violence of the elements, when it pleaſes the Creator to let them forth.—After you have viewed yourſelves as ſurrounded with ſuch a ſcene of wonders; after you have beheld on every hand, ſuch an aſtoniſhing diſplay of majeſty united with wiſdom and goodneſs; are you not ſeized with ſolemn and ſerious awe? Is there not ſomething which whiſpers you within, that to this great Creator reverence and homage are due by all the rational beings whom he has made? Admitted to be ſpectators of his works, placed in the midſt of ſo many great and intereſting objects, can you believe that you were brought hither for no purpoſe, but to immerſe yourſelves in groſs and brutal, or, at beſt, in triſting pleaſures; loſt to all ſenſe of the wonders you behold; loſt to all reverence of that God who gave you being, and who has crect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028306_0071_0FD8953E00118078"/>this amazing fabric of nature, on which you look only with ſtupid and unmeaning eyes?—No: Let the ſcenes which you behold prompt correſpondent feelings. Let them awaken you from the degrading intoxication of licentiouſneſs, into nobler emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Every object which you view in nature, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great or ſmall, ſerves to inſtruct you. The ſtar and the inſect, the fiery meteor and the flower of ſpring, the verdant field and the lofty mountain, all exhibit a ſupreme Power, before which you ought to tremble and adore; all preach the doctrine, all inſpire the ſpirit, of dovotion, and reverence. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding,</hi> then, <hi>the work of the Lord,</hi> let riſing emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of awe and gratitude call forth from your fouls ſuch ſentiments as theſe:— <q>Lord, wherever I am and whatever I enjoy, may I never forget thee, as the Author of nature! May I never forget that I am thy creature and thy ſubject! In this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent temple of the univerſe, where thou haſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me, may I ever be thy faithful worſhipper; and may the reverence and the fear of God be the firſt ſentiments of my heart!</q>—It is to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God I would now recal your thoughts, from the <hi>wine and the feaſt,</hi> as proper to check the ſpirit of levity and folly; and to inſpire manly and becoming ſentiments, in the place of criminal diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. But,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, there is a conſideration of a nature ſtill more ſerious, to be employed for the ſame purpoſe; the conſideration of God as not only the Author of nature, but the Governor of his creatures. While we <hi>regard the work of the Lord,</hi> we are alſo to <hi>conſider the</hi> never ceaſing <hi>operation of his hands.</hi> We are to look up to an awful and irreſiſtible Providence, ſtretching its arm over our heads; directing the fate of men, and diſpenſing at its pleaſure happineſs or
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028306_0072_0FD8953F7A713650"/>miſery. In the giddy moments of jollity, the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and thoughtleſs are apt to ſay: <q>
                  <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.</hi> Nothing is better for man, than to rejoice as much as he can all the days of his vain life; and to keep himſelf undiſturbed by ſuperſtitious terrors. He who ſitteth in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens beſtows no minute attention on the ſons of earth. He permits <hi>all things to come alike to all; one event to happen to the righteous and to the wicked.</hi>
               </q>— Be aſſured, my brethren, it is not ſo. You greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive yourſelves, by imagining that your Creator and Governor is indifferent to the part you are now act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or that the diſtribution of good and evil, which now takes place, has no relation to your moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. In ſome inſtances, that relation may not be apparent, becauſe the moral government of God is not complete in this world. But a multitude of proofs ſhow government to be already begun; and point out to you the train in which you may expect it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>In the hiſtory of all ages and nations, you cannot but have obſerved a thouſand inſtances, in which <hi>the operation of the divine hand</hi> has been diſplayed; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking evil doers ſooner or later with puniſhment, and bringing on their own heads the ruin they had deviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for others. You are not to imagine that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of Providence is exerted only againſt the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, the treacherous, and the cruel, who are the authors of extenſive miſery to the world. Under this idea, perhaps, you may be deſirous to ſhelter your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that your exceſſes are of a harmleſs kind; that you ſeek nothing more than the enjoyment of your own pleaſures; that your <hi>feaſt</hi> and your <hi>wine</hi> interfere not with the order of the world; and that therefore you have done nothing which ſhould awaken the ſleeping thunder, and bring it dow from heaven on your heads.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028306_0073_0FD8955D94850570"/>Though not ſtained with the blackeſt colour of guilt, your conduct may nevertheleſs be highly offenſive to the Ruler of the world. His government is not of that indolent inattentive kind, which allows impun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to every leſſer criminal. He beholds with diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the behaviour of thoſe who degrade their nature by vitious diſorders; and contaminate, by their example, every ſociety with which they are connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His meaſures are taken, that in one way or other, they ſhall ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Look around the circle of your acquaintance, and obſerve, whether they are not the ſober, the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the virtuous, who viſibly proſper in the world, and riſe into reputation and influence; obſerve whether the licentious and intemperate are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly humbled and checked by ſome dark reverſe either in their health or their fortune; whether the irreligious and profligate are ever ſuffered to eſcape long, without being marked with infamy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming objects of contempt.—I aſk, to what cauſe this is to be aſcribed, but to that <hi>operation of the hand of God,</hi> which I am now calling you to conſider? Does it not obviouſly carry the marks of a plan, a ſyſtem of things, contrived and fore-ordained by Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, for rewarding virtue, and puniſhing vice in every form of its diſorders?—The Governor of the world need not for this purpoſe ſtep from his throne, or put forth his hand from the clouds, With ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wiſdom he hath ſo ordered the train of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, that, in their natural courſe, men's <hi>own wickedneſs ſhall reprove them, and their back ſlidings cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them; that they ſhall be made to eat the fruit of their doings, and to fall into the pit which themſelves had dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things have been always ſo apparent to obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that though a man may have been ſeduced into irregular and evil courſes during his life, yet, at the cloſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028306_0074_0FD895667A57A758"/>of it, it ſeldom happens but he diſcerns their pernicious nature, and condemns himſelf for them. Never, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, was there a father, who after he had ſpent his days in idleneſs, diſſipation, and luxury, did not. when dying, admoniſh the children whom he loved, to hold a more honourable courſe, to follow the paths of virtue, to fear God, and to fulfil properly the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their ſtation.—To yourſelves, indeed, I can confidently appeal, whether what I am now ſaying, be not confirmed by your own teſtimony. After you have been guilty of ſome criminal acts, in the courſe of thoſe riotous pleaſures which you indulge, have you not at certain times, felt the ſtings of remorſe? Were you not obliged to confeſs to yourſelves that a ſad proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of miſery was opening before you, if ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were to continue? Did you not hear an inward voice upbraiding you for having ſunk and degraded your character ſo far below that of many of your equals around you?—My friends, what was this but the voice of God, ſpeaking, as the Govenor of his creatures, within your heart; teſtifying loudly that your courſe of life was diſpleaſing to him; and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you of puniſhments that were to follow? If his diſpleaſure againſt you is already begun to be teſtified, can you tell where it is to ſtop, or how long it may continue to purſue you throughout future ſtages of your exiſtence? <hi>Who knoweth the power of his wrath?</hi> —To this awful, this warring voice, will you not be perſuaded reverently to liſten! Impreſſed by the dread authority which it carries, ſhall you not fall down on your knees before your Maker, imploring his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to pardon your paſt offences, and his grace to rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ify your future way?</p>
            <p>Such ought to be the effects of the conſideration of God as the Governor of the world. It leads to thoughts of a very ſerious nature. When we <hi>regard
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028306_0075_0FD87F3EDEF5D3B8"/>the work of the Lord,</hi> and contemplate him as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the univerſe, ſuch contemplation prompts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. But when we <hi>conſider the operation of his hands</hi> in providence, and contemplate him as the Govenor of mankind, ſuch contemplation prompts humiliation before him for offences committed. The former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes itſelf to the ingenuous ſentiments that are left in the heart; and awakens a ſenſe of our unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in neglecting the Author of nature, amidſt our riotous pleaſures. The latter addreſſes itſelf to our regard for ſafety and happineſs; and awakens fear and dread, from conciouſneſs of the guilt we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Hence ſprings up in every thoughtful mind an anxious concern to avert the diſpleaſure, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the favour of that Supreme Being to whom we are all ſubject. This, among unenlightened nations, gave riſe to ſacrifices, expiations, and all the rites of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though ſuperſtitious worſhip. Among nations who have been inſtructed in true religion, ſentiments of the ſame nature pave the way for prayer, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith, and all thoſe duties, by means of which we may hope, through a divine Mediator and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, to be reconciled to heaven. Natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion here appear in concord. We behold the original dictates of the human heart laying a foundation for the glad reception of the comfortable tidings of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>I have thus endeavoured to ſhow in what manner, by <hi>regarding the work of the Lord, and conſidering the operation of his hands,</hi> we may prevent the dangers ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a thoughtleſs indulgence of pleaſure; we may be furniſhed with an antidote to the poiſon which is too often mixed in that intoxicating cup.—Human life is full of troubles. We are all tempted to allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them as much as we can, by freely enjoying the pleaſurable moments which Providence thinks fit to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028306_0076_0FD89540FA1120A8"/>allow us. Enjoy them we may: But, if we would enjoy them ſafely, and enjoy them long, let us tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them with the fear of God. As ſoon as this is forgotten and obliterated, the ſound of <hi>the harp and the viol</hi> is changed into the ſignal of death. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent comes forth from the roſes where it had lain in ambuſh, and gives the fatal ſting. Pleaſure in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is the cordial, in exceſs it is the bane, of life.</p>

            <p>THE apoſtle Peter, in a diſcourſe which he held to the Jews, applies this paſſage, in a myſtical and prophetical ſenſe, to the Meſſiah.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts ii. 25, 28.</note> But, in its literal and primitive meaning, it expreſſes the exalted hopes by which the Pſalmiſt David ſupported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amidſt the changes and revolutions, of which his life was full. By theſe hopes, when flying before Saul, when driven from his throne, and perſecuted
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028306_0077_0FD895433A0D9A50"/>by an unnatural ſon, he was enabled to preſerve his virtue, and to maintain unſhaken truſt in God.—In that early age of the world, thoſe explicit diſcoveries of a ſtate of immortality, which we enjoy, had not yet been given to mankind. But though the <hi>Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> was not ariſen, the dawn had appeared of that glorious day which he was to introduce. Even in thoſe antient times, holy men, as the apoſtle writes to the Hebrews, <hi>ſaw the promiſes afar off, and were perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them and embraced them; and confeſſing that they were ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth, declared that they ſaught after a better country, that is an heavenly.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xi 13, 16.</note> Indeed in every age, God permitted ſuch hopes to afford ſupport and conſolation to thoſe who ſerved him. The full effect of them we behold in thoſe triumphant expreſſions of the text, which are to be the ſubject of this diſcourſe. They lead us to conſider; firſt, The hope of the Pſalmiſt in his preſent ſtate; <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life.</hi> And, ſecondly, the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his hope in that future ſtate, where <hi>in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God is fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand there are pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life.</hi> This plainly imports that there are different <hi>paths</hi> or courſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which may be purſued by men in this world; a path which leads to life or happineſs, and a path which iſſues in death or deſtruction. Theſe oppoſite lines of conduct are determined by the choice which men make of virtue or of vice; and hence men are divided into two great claſſes, according as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations lead them to good or to evil. <hi>The path of life</hi> is often a rough and difficult path, followed only by a few. The oppoſite one is the broad way, in which the multitude walk; ſeemingly ſmooth, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028306_0078_0FD89544BB4683C8"/>ſtrewed with flowers; but leading in the end to death and miſery. <hi>The path of life</hi> conducts us up a ſteep aſcent. The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repreſented as placed on the ſummit of a hill; in the aſcent of which labour is requiſite, and difficulties are to be ſurmounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our ſteps.</p>
            <p>Now, the hope which good men entertain is, that this <hi>path of life</hi> ſhall be ſhewn them by God; that, when their intentions are upright, God will both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them concerning the road which leads to true happineſs, and will aſſiſt them to purſue it ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Among nations where any ſuitable ideas of God or of virtue began to be formed, hopes of this nature alſo began to be entertained. It was conſonant to the nature of man, to think that the Supreme Being was favourable to virtue. Accordingly, in the writings of ſome of the ancient philoſophers, we find various obſcure traces of this belief, that there was a benign heavenly ſpirit, who illuminated the minds of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and aſſiſted their endeavours to obtain wiſdom and happineſs. They even aſſerted, that no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came great or good without ſome inſpiration of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>But what they indiſtinctly conceived, and could not with confidence rely upon, the doctrine of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity hath clearly explained and fully confirmed; expreſsly and frequently teaching that, not only by the external diſcoveries of revelation, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operations of his Spirit, he <hi>ſhows</hi> to the humble and virtuous the <hi>path of life.</hi> While, by his word, he inſtructs them in their duty, by the influence of his grace he aſſiſts them in the performance of it. In all revelation there is certainly no doctrine more comfortable than this. It is to good men a noble and pleaſing thought, that they are purſuing a path which
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:028306_0079_0FD89547002BB768"/>God has diſcovered and pointed out to them. For they know that every path, in which he is their conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, muſt be honourable, muſt be ſafe, muſt bring them in the end to felicity. They follow that <hi>ſhepherd of Iſrael,</hi> who always leads his flock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>

This unqueſtionably forms a primary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of happineſs. Ignorance. or the want of light, is the ſource of all our preſent miſconduct, and all our misfortunes. The heart of man is dark; and in the darkneſs of his heart is the ſeat of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. He is unable to diſcern what is truly good. Perpetually employed in ſearch of happineſs, he is

Hence ſenſuality, covetouſneſs and all the violent conteſts with others about trifles, which occaſion ſo much miſery, and ſo many crimes in the world. <hi>He feedeth of aſhes: a deceived heart hath turned him aſide, that he cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, Is there not a lie in my right hand</hi>

Hence follows the entire purification of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from all thoſe malevolent paſſions, which have ſo long rendered our abode on earth the abode of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. We greatly deceive ourſelves, when we charge our cheif diſtreſſes merely to the account of our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal condition in the world. From the diſadvantages attending it, I admit, that we may often have been expoſed to ſuffer. We may have met with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in our purſuits. By the arrows of misfortune we may have been wounded. Under infirmities of body we may have languiſhed. But on this we may depend, that the worſt evils of our preſent condition ariſe from the want of goodneſs and love; from the diſorders of ſelfiſh paſſions: from the irritation which theſe occaſion when working within ourſelves, and the diſtreſſes which they produce when braking out upon us from others; in a word, from that corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate of temper, and that reciprocation of jealouſies, ſuſpicions, and injuries, which is ever taking place among the ſocieties of men. Could you baniſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, craft, and uncharitableneſs, from the earth, and form all mankind into an aſſembly of the juſt and the benevolent; could you inſpire every heart with kind affections, and render every one friendly and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous to his neighbour; you would baniſh at once the moſt afflictive tribe of human evils. Seldom would the voice of complaint be heard. All nature would aſſume a different aſpect. Cheerfulneſs would be ſeen on every countenance. Paradiſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. The wilderneſs would ſmile: <hi>the deſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028306_0086_0FD8955186984738"/>no appearances ever preſent themſelves but thoſe of peace and joy.</p>
            <p>Thus, conſidering God under theſe two illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous characters which are given of him in ſcripture, as, <hi>light</hi> and as <hi>love,</hi> it follows that in his preſence there muſt be <hi>fulneſs of joy.</hi> But I am far from ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e few imperfect hints I have now given, exhauſt, or even approach to, the ſum of thoſe <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for evermore which are at God's right hand.</hi> Ten thouſand pleaſures are there, which now we have neither faculties to comprehend, nor powers to enjoy.

Content with our humble and diſtant ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt as yet remain. Faith can only look to thoſe glories from afar. In patient ſilence, It muſt wait, turſt, and adore.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing the ideas which I have ſet before you in this diſcourſe, to be no more than they ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a contemplative mind, ſuch as were wont of old to be indulged by the philoſophers of the Platonic ſchool, ſtill they would deſerve attention, on account of their tendency to purify and elevate the mind. But when they are conſidered in counection with a revelation, which, upon grounds the moſt unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, we believe to be divine, they are entitled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not attention only, but reverence and faith.—They preſent to us ſuch high expectations are are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to determine every reaſonable man to the choice of virtue to ſupport him under all its preſent diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements, and to comfort him in the hour of death. Juſtly may they excite in our hearts that ardent aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God for the living God; O when ſhall I come and appear before him</hi>—But, with this wiſh in our hearts, never I beſeech you, let us forget what was ſet forth in the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028306_0087_0FD895530022A330"/>firſt part of this diſcourſe; that, in order to arrive at the preſence of God, the <hi>path of life</hi> muſt previouſly be ſhewn to us by him, and that in this path we muſt perſevere to the end. Theſe two things cannot be disjoined, a virtuous life and a happy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend unto the hill of the Lord? and who ſhall ſtand in his holy place?

But of this we may reſt aſſured, that the path of piety and virtue, purſued with a firm and conſtant ſpirit, will, in the end, through the merits of our bleſſed Redeemer, bring us to that preſence, where <hi>is fulneſs of joy, and where are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

            <p>THESE words occurred in a conference which our Lord held with Simon Peter, after his reſurrection from the dead. Conſcious of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace which he had incurred by his late denial of his
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028306_0088_0FD895547B713D48"/>Maſter, Peter muſt at this time have appeared before him with ſhame. Our Lord, after a tacit rebuke, implied in the queſtion which the repeatedly puts to him, <hi>Simon ſon of Jonas, loveſt thou me?</hi> reſtores him, with great benignity, to his office as an apoſtle, by giving the commandment to <hi>feed his ſheep;</hi> and intimates alſo that it ſhould be his lot to ſuffer death in the cauſe of his maſter. The apoſtle John, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed here by the denomination of <hi>the diſciple whom Jeſus loved,</hi> being preſent at this converſation, Peter, who was always eager and forward, looking to John, puts this queſtion to our Saviour, <hi>Lord, and what ſhall this man do?</hi> 
               <q>What ſhall be his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? what his rank and ſtation in thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? what his future fate in life?</q>—By what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple Peter was moved to put this unſeaſonable and improper queſtion to his Maſter; whether it aroſe from mere curioſity, of from ſome emotion of rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and jealouſy, does not appear; but it is plain that our Lord was diſſatisfied with the inquiry which he made; and preſently he checks Peter's curioſity, by a ſevere reply; <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> 
               <q>What is it to thee what <hi>this man ſhall do;</hi> what ſhall be his rank; or what the circumſtances of his life or his death? Attend thou to thine own duty. Mind thy proper concerns. Fulfil the part which I have allotted to thee. <hi>Follow thou me.</hi>
               </q>—The inſtruction which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from this converſation of our Lord's with Peter, is, That all prying inquiries into the ſtate, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or character of others, are reprehenſible and improper; that to every man a particular charge is aſſigned by his Lord and Maſter, the fulfillment of which ought to be the primary object of his attention, without officiouſly thruſting himſelf into the concerns of others. The illuſtration of theſe points ſhall make the ſubject of the preſent diſcourſe.</p>

That idle curioſity, that inquiſitive and meddling ſpirit, which leads men to pry into the affairs of their neighbours, is reprehenſible on three accounts. It interrupts the good order, and breakes the peace of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It brings forward and nouriſhes ſeveral bad paſſions. It draws men aſide from a proper attention to the diſcharge of their own duty.</p>
            <p>It interrupts, I ſay, the order, and breaks the peace of ſociety. In this world we are linked together by many ties We are bound by duty, and we are prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by intereſt, to give mutal aſſiſtance, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form friendly offices to each other. But thoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offices are performed to moſt advantage, when we avoid to interfere unneceſſarily in the concerns of our neighbour. Every man has his own part to act, has his own intereſt to conſult, has affairs of his own to manage, which his neighbour has no call to ſcrutin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ize. Human life then proceeds in its moſt natural and orderly train, when every one keeps within the bounds of his proper province; when, as long at his purſuits are fair and lawful, he is allowed, without diſturbance, to conduct them in his own way. <hi>That ye ſtudy to be quiet, and to do your own buſineſs,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ vi. 11.</note> is the apoſtolical rule, and indeed the great rule, for preſervation of harmony and order. But ſo it is, that in every age, a ſet of men have exiſted, who, driven by an unhappy activity of ſpirit, oftner perhaps than by any ſettled deſign of doing ill, or any motives of ambition or intereſt, love to intermeddle where they have no concern, to inquire into the private affairs of others, and from the imperfect information which they collect, to form concluſions concerning their circumſtances and character. Theſe are they who in ſcripture, are characteriſed as <hi>tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlers, and buſy

            <p>Though perſons of this deſcription ſhould be prompted by nothing but vain curioſity, they are, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, dangerous troublers of the world.

For every man conceives himſelf to be injured, when he finds another intruding in to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and, without any title, taking upon him to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine his conduct. Being improperly and unneceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturbed, he claims the right of diſturbing in his turn thoſe who wantonly have troubled him. Hence, many a friendſhip has been broken; the peace of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a family has been overthrown; and much bitter and laſting diſcord has been propagated through ſociety.</p>
            <p>While this ſpirit of meddling curioſity injures ſo conſiderably the peace and good order of the world, it alſo nouriſhes, among individuals who are addicted to it, a multitude of bad paſſions. Its moſt frequent ſource is mere idleneſs, which, in itſelf a vice, never fails to engender many vices more. The mind of man cannot be long without ſome food to nouriſh the activity of its thoughts. The idle, who have no nouriſhment of this ſort within themſelves, feed their thoughts with inquiries into the conduct of their neighbours. The inquiſitive and curious are always talkative. What they learn, or fancy themſelves to have learned, concerning others, they are generally in haſte to divulge. A tale which the malicious have invented, and the credulous have propagated; a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour which, ariſing among the multitude, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by one to another, has, in every ſtep of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs gained freſh additions, becomes in the end the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028306_0091_0FD8955A803D3BC8"/>foundation of confident aſſertion, and of raſh and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere judgment.</p>
            <p>It is often by a ſpirit of jealouſy and rivalry, that the reſearches of ſuch perſons are prompted. They wiſh to diſcover ſomething that will bring down their neighbour's character, circumſtances, or reputation, to the level of their own; or that will flatter them with an opinion of their own ſuperiority. A ſecret malignity lies at the bottom of their inquiries. It may be concealed by an affected ſhow of candour and impartiality. It may even be veiled with the appearance of friendly concern for the intereſts of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and with affected apologies for their failings. But the hidden rancour is eaſily diſcovered.—While, therefore perſons of this deſcription trouble the peace of ſociety, they at the ſame time poiſon their own minds with malignant paſſions. Their diſpoſition is entirely the reverſe of that amiable ſpirit of charity, on which our religion lays ſo great a ſtreſs. Charity <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the multitude of ſins;</hi> but this prying and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling ſpirit ſeeks to diſcover and divulge them. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>thinketh no evil;</hi> but this temper inclines us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſuſpect the worſt. Charity <hi>rejoiceth not in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity:</hi> this temper triumphs in the diſcovery of errors and failings. Charity like the ſun, brightens every object on which it ſhines; a cenſorious diſpoſition caſts every character into the darkeſt ſhade it will bear.</p>
            <p>It is to be farther obſerved, that all impertinent curioſity about the affairs of others tends greatly to obſtruct perſonal reformation; as it draws mens thoughts aſide from what ought to be the chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of attention, the improvement of their own heart and life. They who are ſo officiouſly occupied about their neighbours, have little leiſure, and leſs inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to obſerve their own defects, or to mind their
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028306_0092_0FD8955C070B96C0"/>own duty. From their inquiſitive reſearches, they find, or imagine they find, in the behaviour of others, an apology for their own failings: And the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite reſult of their inquiries generally is, to reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with themſelves. They are at leaſt as good, they think, as others around them. The condemnation which they paſs on the vices of their neighbours, they interpret to be a ſentiment of virtue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They become thoſe hypocrites deſcribed by our Lord, who ſee clearly <hi>the more that is in their neighbour's eye, while they diſern not the beam that is in their own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In oppoſition to ſuch a character as this, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine plainly inculcated by the text is, that to every man a particular charge is given by his Lord and Maſter, a part is aſſigned him by Providence to act; that to this he ought to bend his chief attention; and, inſtead of ſcrutiniſing the character or ſtate of others, ought to think of himſelf, and leave them to ſtand or fail by their own maſter. <hi>What ſhall this man do?</hi> ſaid Peter <hi>What,</hi> replies our Lord, <hi>is that to thee? Follow thou me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where perſons poſſeſs any important ſtation, or diſtinguiſhed rank, in the world, the application of this doctrine to them is manifeſt. It they have any candour, they cannot refuſe to acknowledge that God and the world have a title to expect from them a dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igent attention to their proper part in life; and that to waſte their time in idle inquiries about others, with whom they have nothing to do, is reprehenſible and ſinful. But there are multitudes of mankind, to whom this appears in a very different light. They are humble and private men, who are willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves as of little importance in the world. Having no extenſive influence, and no call, as they think, to diſtinguiſh themſelves by active exertions
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028306_0093_0FD87F38E0D476F8"/>in any ſphere, they imagine that they may innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead an idle life, and indulge their curioſity, by canvaſſing at pleaſure the character and the behaviour of thoſe around them. With perſons of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every ſociety too much abounds.—My brethren, no one ought to conſider himſelf as inſignificant in the ſight of God. In our ſeveral ſtations we are all ſent forth to be labourers in God's vineyard. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he might, in one way or other, ſerve God, promote virtue, and be uſeful in the world. <hi>Occupy till I come,</hi> is the charge given to all Chriſtians without exception. To be entirely unemployed and idle is the prerogative of no one, in any rank of life.</p>
            <p>Even that ſex, whoſe taſk is not to mingle in the labours of public and active buſineſs, have their own part aſſigned them to act. In the quiet of domeſtic ſhade, there are a variety of virtues to be exerciſed, and of important duties to be diſcharged. Much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on them for the maintenance of private econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy and order, for the education of the young, and for the relief and comfort of thoſe whoſe functions engaged them in the toils of the world. Even where no ſuch female duties occur to be performed, the care of preparing for future uſefulneſs, and of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch accompliſhments as procure juſt eſteem, is laudable. In ſuch duties and cares, how far better is time employed, than in that ſearch into private concerns, that circulation of rumours, thoſe diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the conduct and deſcants on the character of others, which engroſs converſation ſo much, and which end, for the moſt part, in ſeverity of cenſure!</p>
            <p>In whatever condition we are placed, to act always in character ſhould be our conſtant rule. He who acts in character is above contempt though his ſtation
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028306_0094_0FD8955EFAF1B8C0"/>be low. He who acts out of character is deſpicable, though his ſtation be ever ſo high. <hi>What is that to thee,</hi> what this man or that man does? Think of what thou oughteſt to do thyſelf; of what is ſuitable to thy character and place; of what the world has a title to expect from thee. Every excurſion of vain curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity about others, is a ſubtraction from that time and thought which was due to ourſelves and due to God. <hi>Having gifts,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle Paul <hi>differing according to the grace that is given us, whether miniſtry let us wait on our miniſtring; or he that teacheth on teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or he that exhorteth, on exhortation. He that giveth let him do it with ſimplicity; he that ruleth with diligence; he that ſheweth mercy, with cheerfulneſs.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In the great circle of human affairs there is room for every one to be buſy and well employed in his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, without encroaching upon that of others. It is the province of ſuperiors, to direct; of inferiors, to obey; of the learned to be inſtructive; of the ignorant, to be docile; of the old to be communicative; of the young to be adviſeable and diligent. Art thou poor? Show thyſelf active and induſtrious, peaceable and contented. Art thou wealthy? Show thyſelf benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and charitable, condeſcending and humane. If thou liveſt much in the world, it is thy duty to make the light of a good example ſhine conſpicuouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others. If thou liveſt private and retired, it is thy buſineſs to improve thine own mind, and to add, if thou canſt do no more, one faithful ſubject to the Meſſiah's kingdom. There is indeed no man ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered from active life, but within his own narrow ſphere he may find ſome opportunities of doing good; of cultivating friendſhip, promoting peace, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028306_0095_0FD895607B87C6D0"/>many of theſe leſſer offices of humanity and kindneſs, which are within the reach of every one, and which we all owe to one onother. In all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious relations which ſubſiſt among us in life, as huſband and wife, maſter and ſervants, parents and children, relations and friends, rulers and ſubjects, innumerable duties ſtand ready to be performed; innumerable calls to virtuous activity preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on every hand, ſufficient to fill up with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and honour the whole time of man.</p>
            <p>There is, in particular, one great and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive object of attention, which, in the text, is placed in direct oppoſition to that idle curioſity repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our Lord; that is, to follow Chriſt. <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thou me.</hi> What this man or that man does; how he employs his time; how he ſucceeds in the world; are matters concerning which the information we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive can never be of great importance to us; often, is of no importance at all. But how our Saviour behaved while he was on earth, or how, in our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would have behaved, are matters of the high<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſt moment to every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>The commandment given in the text to <hi>follow him,</hi> includes both obſervance of his words, and imitation of his example. The words of Chriſt contain, as we all know, the ſtanding rule of our life. His exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exhibits the great model on which our conduct ought to be formed and it is to this that the precept here delivered directly refers.—Examples have great influence on all. But by all human examples, we are in danger of being occaſionally miſled. We are ever obliged to be on our guard, leſt the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what is eſtimable, betray us into a reſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of what is blemiſhed and faulty. For the moſt perfect human characters, in the midſt of their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028306_0096_0FD89561F9DC39B0"/>and beauty, are always marked with ſome of thoſe dark ſpots which ſtains the nature of man. But our Lord poſſeſſed all the virtues of the greateſt and beſt men, without partaking any of their defects. In him, all was light without a ſhade, and beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtain.—At the ſame time, his example is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with this ſingular advantage, of being more accommodated than any other to general immitation. It was diſtinguiſhed by no unnatural auſterities, no affected ſingularities; but exhibits the plain and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tenor of all thoſe virtues for which we have moſt frequent occaſion in ordinary life. In order to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it of more univerſal benefit, our Lord fixed his reſidence in no particular place; he tied himſelf down to no particular calling or way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but gives us the opportunity or viewing his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, in that variety of lights which equally and indifferently rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll mankind. His life was divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the retired and the active ſtate. Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and buſineſs equally ſhared it. In the diſcharge of that high office with which he was veſted, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the perfect model of a public character; and we behold the moſt beautiful example of private life, when we contemplate him among his diſciples, as a Father in the midſt of his family.—By ſuch means he has exhibited before us ſpecimens of every kind of virtue; and to all ranks and claſſes of men has afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a pattern after which they may copy. Hardly is there any emergency which can occur in life, but from ſome incident in our Saviour's conduct, from ſome feature diſplayed in his character, we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſay to ourſelves, <q>Thus Chriſt would have ſpoken, thus he would have acted, thus he would have ſuffered, if he had been circumſtance das we are now.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Inſtead, therefore, of thinking of thy neighbours
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028306_0097_0FD8956383CE55B0"/>around thee, and of inquring how they behave, keep Chriſt in thine eye, and in thy whole conduct follow him. <hi>Follow him</hi> in his ſteady and conſcientious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of duty, amidſt oppoſition from evil men, and a corrupted world. Follow him in his patient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Father's will, and the calmneſs of his ſpirit under all trials. Follow him in his acts of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted benevolence, in his compaſſion to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, in readineſs to oblige, to aſſiſt, and to releave. Immitate the mildneſs and gentleneſs of his manners. Imitate the affabiiity and condeſcenſion which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his behaviour. Imitate the uncorrupted ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and purity which diſtinguiſhed his whole life.</p>
            <p>Theſe are much worthier and nobler objects of your attention, than any of thoſe triſting varieties which you can explore and diſcover in the characters of thoſe among whom you live. By lifting your view to ſo high a ſtandard, you will be preſerved from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to thoſe futile and corrupting employments of thought, which occupy the idle, the vain, and the malignant. It is incredible, how much time and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention are thrown away by men, in examining the affairs of others, and diſcuſſing their conduct. Were their time and attention thrown away only, the evil would in ſome degree, be leſs. But they are worſe than thrown away; they are not merely fruitleſs, but productive of much miſchief. Such a habit of thought is connected with a thouſand vices. It is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſource of raſh and ſevere cenſure. It ariſes from envy and jealouſy. It foments ill nature and pride. It propagates miſunderſtanding and diſcord. All thoſe evils would be prevented, if the reproof which our Lord adminiſters in the text came oftener home, with proper authority, to the reflection of men: <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> Each of us have more material and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs of our own to fulfil. Our taſk is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned;
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028306_0098_0FD89564FB7B37F8"/>our part allotted. Did we ſuitably examine how that part was performed, we ſhould be leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to buſy ourſelves about the concerns of others. We would diſcover many a diſorder to be corrected at home; many a weed to be pulled out from our own grounds; much remaining to be done, in order to render ourſelves uſeful in this world, and fit for a world to come.—Wherefore, inſtead of being critics on others, let us employ our criticiſm on ourſelves. Leaving others to be judged by Him who ſearcheth the heart, let us implore his aſſiſtance for enabling us to act well our own part, and to follow Chriſt.</p>

            <p>THESE words of our Lord were occaſioned by a circumſtance in his behaviour which appeared myſterious to his diſciples. When about to celebrate his laſt paſſover, he meant to give them an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive leſſon of condeſcenſion and humility. The mode which he choſe for delivering this inſtruction, was the emblematical action of waſhing their feet. When Simon Peter ſaw his Maſter addreſſing himſelf to the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028306_0099_0FD895C205FA5988"/>performance of ſo menial an office, he exclaims with the greateſt ſurpriſe, <hi>Lord doſt thou waſh my feet?</hi> Our Lord replies, in the words of the text, <hi>What I do thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi>

               </gap>ight and darkneſs preſents it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, when we attempt to trace the affairs of the world up to any wiſe and righteous adminiſtration. We ſee juſtice and order begun; but on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they ſeem to be deſerted. The ray of light which we had traced for a while, ſuddenly forſakes us; and, where we had looked for the continuance of order, we meet with confuſion and diſappointment. —For inſtance; when we examine the conſtitution of the human mind, we diſcern evident marks of its being framed with a view to favour and reward virtue. Conſcience is endowed with ſignal authority to check vice. It brings home uneaſineſs and remorſe to the bad; and it ſooths and ſupports the righteous with ſelf approbation and peace. The ordinary courſe of human things is made to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>All this carries the impreſs of a juſt Providence, of a wiſe and bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job. xxvi. 9.</note> For in looking abroad into the world how many ſcenes do we behold, which are far from correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with any ideas we could form of the government of Heaven? Many nations of the earth we ſee lying in
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028306_0101_0FD87F887786C860"/>a ſtate of barbarity and miſery; ſunk in ſuch groſs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance as degrades them below the rank of rational beings; or abandoned to be the prey of cruel oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and tyranny. When we look to the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals around us, we hear the lamentations of the unhappy on every hand. We meet with weeping pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and mourning friends. We behold the young cut off in the flower of their days, and the aged left deſolate in the midſt of ſorrows. The uſeful and virtuous are ſwept away, and the worthleſs left to flouriſh. The lives of the beſt men are often fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with diſcouragements and diſappointed hopes. Merit languiſhes in neglected ſolitude; and vanity and preſumption gain the admiration of the world. From the ſcourge of calumny, and from the hand of violence the injured look up to God as the Avenger of their cauſe; but often they look up in vain. He is <hi>a God that hideth himſelf.</hi> He dwelleth, as to them, in the ſecret place of darkneſs; or if he dwelleth in light, it is in <hi>light to which no man can approach.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation may ſeal up their lips; but in ſilence they drop the tear, and mourn while they adore.</p>
            <p>Such, it muſt not be diſſembled, are the difficulties which encounter us when we attempt to trace the preſent ways of God. At the ſame time, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, we may be ſatisfied that cauſes can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for things appearing in this unfavourable light; and that there is no reaſon to be ſurpriſed at the divine conduct being myſterious at preſent.</p>
            <p>The monarchy of the univerſe is a great and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated ſyſtem. It comprehends numberleſs generations of men, who are brought forth to act their parts for purpoſes unknown to us. It includes two worlds at once; the world that now is, and which is only a ſmall portion of exiſtence; and a world that is to come, which endures for eternity. To us, no more
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028306_0102_0FD87F8A8C7A61B8"/>than the beginnings of things are viſible. We ſee only ſome broken parts of a great whole. We trace but a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the univerſe, we attempt in vain to explore the counſels that govern the world.

In order to exerciſe both our intellectual and moral powers, and to carry them forward to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, we muſt be left to find our way in the midſt of difficulties and doubts, of hardſhips, and ſufferings. We muſt be taught to act our part with conſtancy, though the reward of our conſtancy, be diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant. We muſt learn to bear with patience whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Creator judges proper to lay upon us, though we ſee not the reaſon of the hardſhips he inflicts. If we were let into the ſecret of the whole plan of Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence; if the juſtice of Heaven were, in every ſtep of its procedure, made manifeſt to our view, man would no longer be the creature he now is, nor would his preſent ſtate anſwer any purpoſe of diſcipline or trial.</p>
            <p>Myſtery and darkneſs, therefore, muſt of neceſſity now take place in the courſe of things. Our preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ate can be no other than a ſtate of twilight or dawn, where dubious forms ſhall often preſent themſelves to us, and where we ſhall find ourſelves in a middle condition between complete light and total darkneſs. Had we enjoyed no evidence of a juſt Judge ruling the earth, and of his providence, interpoſing in our affairs, virtue would have been altogether de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

Had the evidence, on the other hand, been ſo ſtrong as to place the Almighty conſtantly before our eyes, the intention of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exiſtence would have been defeated, and no trial of virtue have remained. Inſtead therefore, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the obſcurity which at preſent covers the conduct of Providence, we ſee that, on the whole, we have reaſon to ſubmit and adore.</p>

In like manner, with reſpect to individuals, there is often a <hi>hereafter</hi> in the courſe of their lives, which diſcloſes and juſtifies the ways of God. Not to mention the good effects which misfortunes are found to produce on the minds of men, by checking their vices, and correcting their errors, innumerable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifications can be given, of misfortunes paving their way to future advancement in the world. We are always querulous and impatient when deſigns ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not according to our wiſh, Ignorant of what futurity is to bring forward, occupied with nothing but the preſent, we exclaim, Where is God?

Conſider only in how different a light the Patriarch Joſeph would view the events of his life after he had ſeen in what they had terminated, from the light in which he ſaw them, when led away by Iſhmaelites as a ſlave, or when thrown by Potiphar into the Egyptian priſon. We murmur againſt Providence, juſt as the impetuous youth frets againſt his inſtructors and tutors, who are keeping him under a ſtrict, and as he thinks a needleſs, diſcipline. He knows not tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What may juſtly be ſaid to him by his tutors and inſtructors, is equally applicable to us all under our preſent ſtate of education; <hi>What! do, thou knoweſt not now, but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi> —Regarding, then, the unknown iſſue of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly events in this life, let us never deſpair; let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think diſhonourable of the government of God;

            <p>In the ſecond place, the expreſſion of <hi>hereafter</hi> in the text muſt be underſtood to refer, in its full extent, not to future events in this life, but to a ſubſequent ſtate of being. For this life is no more than the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the mighty and extenſive plans of Providence. The ſeeds are only now ſown, of what is to ripen and come forth, at the harveſt of the world; when the revolution of the great moral year ſhall be finiſhed, and the government of God ſhall obtain its full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion. It is the chief ſcope of religion to direct our view to this period; and it hath often taught us that the knowledge of the ways of God, then enjoyed by the bleſſed, ſhall conſtitute a chief article of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. <hi>Now we ſee through a glaſs darkly; but then face to face. Now we know in part; but then we ſhall know even as we are known. When that which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is come, then that which is in part ſhall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. In God's light we ſhall ſee light</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiii. 10 12. Pſalm xxxvi. 9.</note>. The reaſons that required obſcurity to remain for a while on the ways of God no longer ſubſiſt. The education of good men is completed; and the intention of thoſe ſteps of education, which once they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, now becomes apparent—Why this man was prematurely carried away from the world in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a promiſing courſe; why that deſerving family were left overwhelmed with grief and deſpair, by the loſs of one who was their ſole benefactor and ſupport; why friendſhips cemented by tender ties were ſuddenly torn aſunder by death: Theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries to which we can now make no reply; and
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028306_0107_0FD87F920526E0D0"/>which throw a dark gloom over the conduct of the Almighty. But the ſpirits of the juſt above, who are admitted to a larger view of the ways of God, ſee the reaſons of ſuch counſels. They ſee that one man was ſeaſonably taken away from dangers and evils to come, which, unknown to him, were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering over his head. They ſee that Providence was in ſecret preparing unexpected bleſſings for the family who appeared to be left diſconſolate and hopeleſs. They ſee that it was time for friendſhips to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when their longer continuance would to ſome of the parties have proved a ſnare. Where we behold nothing but the rod of power ſtretched forth, they diſcern an interpoſition of the hand of mercy.</p>
            <p>Let us wait till this promiſed <hi>hereafter</hi> arrive, and we ſhall in like manner be ſatisfied concerning the events that now diſturb and perplex us. We ſhall then know why ſo much darkneſs and miſery have been ſo long permitted to remain on the earth, and ſo much oppreſſion and tyranny to prevail among the nations. We ſhall ſee riſing, as from the aſhes of the old world, a new and beautiful ſtructure; <hi>new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs.</hi> As wide as is the difference between the appearance of the world, when it lay in its primitive chaos, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out form and void,</hi> and the appearance which it has now aſſumed, when reſplendent with the light of the ſun, and decked with the beauties of nature; ſuch is the difference between the divine plans in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and in their full completion. At the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not till then, the glory of the Lord ſhall-become manifeſt to all; and as it is deſcribed in the book of the Revelation, a voice ſhall be heard <hi>from every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, ſaying.

            <p>Application of the doctrines that have been illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may be made to two claſſes of men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> To ſceptics; who, from the preſent myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conduct of Providence, haſtily draw the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that no government is exerciſed over human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but that all things are ſuffered indiſcriminately to come alike to all men.—I have ſhown that from the inadiquate views which we are at preſent able to take of the general ſyſtem, ſuch myſterious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Providence muſt be expected to take place. Not only ſo, but I have alſo ſhown it to be fit and neceſſary that this mixture of obſcurity ſhould now remain; as a full diſplay of regular juſtice and order would be inconſiſtent with the moral improvement of men in this life.—Let me deſire the ſceptic to look to the ſtate of the natural world. When he thinks of the order and magnificence that prevails in it, he will perhaps, be unwilling to pronounce it the mere proudction of chance. He cannot but recogniſe the hand of Intelligence, and acknowledge it to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a deſigning Cauſe. I aſk him, Whether in the natural world he diſcerns not as many myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and puzzling appearances as are to be found in the moral world? Are not deſtructive ſtorms, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountains, uninhabitable deſerts, as difficult to be reconciled to his pre-conceived ideas of ſupreme wiſdom and goodneſs in the Creator, as the ſufferings and afflictions which in the courſe of Providence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the juſt? The natural and the moral world are, in this reſpect, counterparts to one another. Both are marked with the ſame characters, and carry the impreſs of the ſame powerful and gracious hand. In
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028306_0109_0FD87F95C5B63FF0"/>both, it is evidently the intention of the firſt Author not to render every thing level to our capacity; but in the midſt of high deſign and order, to allow certain objects <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o appear, which contradict the ideas we had formed, and mock our vain reſearches. Now, if we are obliged to admit that the order and beauty of the natural world ſufficiently prove it to be the work of a wiſe Creator, notwithſtanding the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deformities which it exhibits; are we not led by the ſame train of reaſoning, to conclude that the moral world is under the direction of a wiſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, though much of what he now does we cannot ſatisfactorily explain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The doctrine of the text is to be applied not only for ſilencing ſceptics but for comforting the pious. Never let them be dejected by the darkneſs which now covers the ways of the Almighty. If he withdraws himſelf from their view, it is not becauſe he neglects them; but becauſe they are incapable of comprehending his deſigns; becauſe it were not for their good that all his deſigns were revealed to them. —Inſtead of perplexing themſelves about what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, let them reſt on the clear and authentic diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries that have been given of, the divine goodneſs. Let them reſt on thoſe great and ſignal facts that prove it; particularly on that illuſtrious fact, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world by Jeſus Chriſt, He that <hi>ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son, but gave him up for us all,</hi> will aſſuredly not always conceal himſelf from thoſe who ſerve him.

            <p>BONDAGE and ſubjection are diſagreeable ſounds to the ear, diſagreeable ideas to the mind. The advocates of vice, taking advantage of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural impreſſions, have in every age employed them for diſcrediting religion. They repreſent it as the bondage and confinenement of the free-bron ſoul of man; as a ſtate of perpetual conſtraint, formed by a ſyſtem of ſevere rules, which deſigning men have contrived to impoſe as fetters on the multitude. On the other hand, they paint a licentious courſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hold it out to the world, as the gay and pleaſurable enjoyment of life; whore, having ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the prejudices of education, and timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcruples of conſcience, men can think and act at pleaſure, and give full ſcope to every wiſh of the heart.— But what if thoſe pretended ſons of freedom be them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028306_0111_0FD87F98C5288E80"/>held in miſerable ſubjection, and their boaſts of liberty be no more than the <hi>ſwelling words of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> The Apoſtle aſſerts in the text, that while they <hi>promiſe liberty</hi> to others, they are <hi>the ſervants,</hi> or ſlaves, of <hi>corruption, overcome, and brought into bondage by it.</hi> This aſſertion of the Apoſtle I purpoſe to illuſtrate. I ſhall endeavour to make it appear, that no true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty can ariſe from vice; that bad men undergo the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t ſervitude; and that no one is free, but he who is virtuous and good.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to begin with removing falſe ideas of liberty, and ſhowing in what it truely conſiſts. We are not to imagine that to be free imports our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet looſe from reſtraint or rule of every kind. No man, in any condition of life, is at liberty to act always as he pleaſes, and to gratify every wiſh he forms. The nature of the human ſtate necerſarily impoſes on all men various reſtraints. The laws of ſociety allow no one to indulge himſelf in purſuits or pleaſures that are injurious to his neighbour. Even our own nature limits our pleaſures within certain bounds. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l our deſires cannot be gratified together. They frequently interfere, and reqiure im who would indulge one favourite paſſion, to deny himſelf in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Diſtinctions, therefore, muſt be made, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerences be given, and ſome general regolation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct be obſerved, by every one who conſults his own welfare. If there be any regulation which enſures us of ſafety and happineſs, to be diſengaged from the obſervance of that regulation is no article of liberty; at leaſt of ſuch liberty; as a wiſe man would with to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. It is in effect to be turned looſe to our own ruin. It is ſuch liberty as a blind man enjoys, of wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at random, and ſtriking into every devious path, without a guide to direct his ſteps, and ſave him from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="unknown:028306_0112_0FD87F9A466CCA68"/>
That unbounded licentiouſneſs, therefore, which ſinners prefer to every regulation of conduct, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether different from true freedom. It is in moral behaviour the ſame as anarchy is in a ſtate, where law and order are extinct. Anarchy, ſurely, is no leſs incompatible with true liberty than abſolute deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and of the two it is hard to ſay which is the leaſt eligible, or the moſt miſerable ſtate. Liberty by no means ſuppoſes the abſence of all government. It only ſuppoſes that the government under which we are placed is wiſe; and that the reſtraints to which we voluntarily ſubmit ourſelves have been contrived for the general intereſt.</p>
            <p>To be free, therefore, imports, in general, our being placed in ſuch circumſtances, that within the bounds of juſtice and good order, we can act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own deliberate choice, and take ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for our conduce as we have reaſon to believe are conducive to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lfare; without being obſtructed either by external force, or by violent internal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. This is that happy and dignified ſtate which every wiſe man earneſtly wiſhes to enjoy. The advantages which reſult from it are chiefly theſe three; freedom of choice; independence of mind boldneſs and ſecurity. In oppoſition to theſe diſtinguiſhing characters of liberty, I now proceed to ſhow that, in the firſt place, vice deprives bad men of free choice in their actions; that, in the ſecond place, it brings them under a ſlaviſh dependence on external circumſtances; and that, in the third place, it reduces them to that abject, cowardly, and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted ſtate which is eſſentially characteriſtic of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Vice is inconſiſtent with liberty, as it deprives ſinners of the power of free choice, by bringing them under the dominion of paſſions and habits. Religion
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028306_0113_0FD87F9BE2F7CC28"/>and virtue addreſs themſelves to reaſon. They call us to look round on every ſule; to think well of the conſequences of our actions; and, before we take any ſtep of importance, to compare the good with the evil that may enſue from it. He therefore who follows their dectates, acts the part of a man who freely conſults, and chuſes, for his own intereſt. But vice can make no pretenſions of this kind. It awaits no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the teſt of deliberate compariſon and choice; but overpowers us at once by ſome ſtriking impreſſion of preſent advantage or enjoyment. It hurries us with the violence of paſſion; captivates us by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of pleaſure; or dazzels us by the glare of riches. The ſinner yields to the impulſe, merely becauſe he cannot reſiſt it. Reaſon remonſtrates; conſcience endeavours to check him; but all in vain. Having once allowed ſome ſtrong paſſion to gain the aſcendant, he has thrown himſelf into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>dle of a torrent, againſt which he may ſometimes faintly ſtruggle, but the impetuoſity of the ſtream bears him along. In this ſituation he is ſo far from being free, that he is not maſter of himſelf. He does not go, but is driven; toſſed, agitated, and impelled; paſſive, like a ſhip to the violence of the waves.</p>
            <p>After paſſion has for a while exerciſed its tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſway, its vehemence may by degrees ſubſide. But when by long indulgence, it has eſtabliſhed habits of gratification, the ſinner's bondage becomes then more confirmed, and more miſerable. For during the heat of purſuit he is little capable of reflection. But when his ardour is abated, and nevertheleſs, a vitious habit rooted, he has full leiſure to perceive the heavy yoke he has brought upon himſelf. How many ſlaves do we ſee in the world to intemperance, and all kinds of criminal pleaſure, merely though the influence of cuſtoms which they had allowed to become ſo inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028306_0114_0FD87F9E246A28A8"/>that it was not in their power to alter them? Are they not often reduced to a condition ſo wretched, that when their licentious pleaſures have become utterly inſipid, they are ſtill forced to continue them, ſolely becauſe they cannot refrain: not becauſe the indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gives them pleaſure, but becauſe abſtinence would give them pain; and this too, even when they are obliged at laſt to condemn their habits of life, as injuring their fortune, impairing their conſtitution, or diſgracing their character? Vice is not of ſuch a nature that we can ſay to it, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come and no further.</hi> Having once entered into its territories, it is not in our power to make a retreat when we pleaſe. <hi>He that committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> No man who has once yielded up the governmen of his mind, and given looſe rein to his deſires and paſſions can tell how far theſe may carry him. He may be brought into ſuch a deſperate ſtate, that nothing ſhall remain for him but to look back with regret upon the forſaken path of innocence and liberty; and, ſeverely conſcious of the thraldom he ſuffers, to groan under fetters which he deſpairs of throwing off. <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his ſkin, or the leopard his ſpots? then may ye alſo do good who are accuſtomed to do evil.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jeremiah xiii. 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Vice confirms its dominion, and extends it ſtill farther over the ſoul, by compelling the ſinner to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port one crime by means of another. Not only is he enſlaved to thoſe vices which take their riſe from his one inclination, but they render others neceſſary, to which, againſt his inclination, he muſt ſubmit; and thereby ſtrengthen the commanding power of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity within him. The immoderate love of pleaſure for inſtance, leads him into expenſe beyond his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. In order to ſupport that expenſe, he is oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028306_0115_0FD8802209167A20"/>to have recourſe to low and diſhonourable methods of gain, which originally he deſpiſed. To cover theſe, he is forced upon arts of diſſimulation and fraud. One inſtance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> obliges him to ſupport it by another; till, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> there ariſes a character of complicated vice; of luxury ſhooting forth into baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, diſhoneſty, injuſtice, and perhaps cruelty. It is thus that one favourite paſſion brings in a tribe of auxiliaries to complete the dominion of ſin. Among all our corrupt paſſions there is a ſtrong and intimate connection. When any one of them is adopted into our family, it never quits us until it has fathered upon us all its kindred.—By ſuch means as theſe, by the violence of paſſions, by the power of habits, and by the connection of one vice with another, ſin eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes that ſervitude over the will, which deprives bad men of all power of free choice in their actions.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſlavery produced by vice appears in the dependence under which it brings the ſinner, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of external fortune. One of the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite characters of liberty, is the independence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows. He who is truly a freeman is above all ſervile compliances, and abject ſubjection. He is able to reſt upon himſelf; and while he regards his ſuperiors with proper deference, neither debaſes himſelf by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purchaſe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by diſhonourable means. But the ſinner has forfeited every privilege of this nature. His paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and habits render him an abſolute dependant on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickel humours of men. For it is by theſe he ſubſiſts, and among theſe his happineſs is ſought; according as his paſſions deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him to purſue pleaſures, riches, or preferments. Having no fund within himſelf whence to draw en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, his only reſource is in things without. His
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028306_0116_0FD88023545CB138"/>hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in all its viciſſitudes; and is moved and ſhaken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſe a ſlave to the world.</p>
            <p>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. <hi>The up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man is ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> He deſpiſes not the advantages of fortune; but he centers not his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in them. With a moderate ſhare of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in his own integrity, conſcious of the eſteem of good men, repoſing firm truſt in the providence, and the promiſes of God, he is exempted from ſervile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on other things. He can wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in a good conſcience, and look forward, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out terror, to the change of the world. Let all things ſhift around him as they pleaſe, he believes that, by the divine ordination, they ſhall be made <hi>to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> in the iſſue <hi>for his good:</hi> And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be eaſy in every ſtate. One who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes within himſelf ſuch an eſtabliſhment of mind, is truly free—But ſhall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property aſſured; whoſe very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and the ſport of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever ſo ſplendid, whom his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paſſions detain at their call, whom they ſend forth at their pleaſure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the caſual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies of the world? Is he free, who muſt flatter and lie to compaſs his ends; who muſt bear with this man's caprice, and that man's ſcorn; muſt profeſs friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip where he hates, and reſpect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028306_0117_0FD88024B5CAA528"/>nor to ſpeak his own ſentiments; who dares not be honeſt, leſt he ſhould be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind ſo hard, no ſetters are ſo heavy, as thoſe which faſten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the voluptuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man lies to the means of pleaſure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boaſred liberty, which vice promiſes, as the recompenſe of ſetting us free from the ſalutary reſtraints of virtue.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another character of the ſlavery of vice, is that mean, cowardly, diſquieted ſtate, to which it reduces the ſinner. Boldneſs and magnanimity have ever been accounted th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> native effects of liberty. He who enjoys it, having nothing to apprehend from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive power, performs the offices, and enjoys the comforts of life, with a manly and undiſturbed mind. Hence his behaviour is dignified, and his ſentiments are honourable; while he who is accuſtomed to bend under ſervile ſubjection, has always been found mean-ſpirited, timorous, and baſe.—Compare, in theſe reſpects, the virtuous and the vicious man, and you will eaſily ſee to which of them the characteriſtics of freedom moſt juſtly belong. The man of virtue, relying on a good conſcience and the protection of Heaven, acts with firmneſs and comage; and in the diſcharge of his duty, fears not the face of man. The man of vice, conſcious of his low and corrupt aims, ſhrinks before the ſteadfaſt and piercing eye of integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; is ever looking around him with anxious and fearful circumſpection, and thinking of ſubterfuges, by which he may eſcape from danger. The one is <hi>bold as a lion;</hi> the other <hi>ſticth when no man purſueth.</hi> To the one, nothing appears contemptible, by which he can procure any preſent advantage. The other looks with diſdain on what ever would degrade his
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028306_0118_0FD880264DDD02E0"/>character. "I will not," ſays he, <q>ſo demean my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to catch the favour of the greateſt man, by this or that low art. It ſhall not be ſaid or thought of me, that I did what was baſe in order to make my fortune. L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hers ſtoop ſo low, who cannot be without the ſavours of the world. But I can want them, and therefore at ſuch a price I will not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe them.</q> This is the voice of true liberty; and ſpeaks that greatneſs of mind which it is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inſpire.</p>
            <p>Correſponding to that abject diſpoſition which characteriſes a bad man, are the fears that haunt him. The terrors of a ſlave dwell on his mind, and often appear in his behaviour. For guilt is never free from ſuſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cion and alarm. The ſinner is afraid, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, of the partners of his crimes, leſt they betray him; ſometimes, of thoſe who have ſuffered by his crimes, leſt they revenge themſelves; frequently, of the world around him, leſt it detect him; and what is worſt of all, he is reduced to be afraid of himſelf. There is a witneſs within him that teſtifies againſt his miſdeeds; and threate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> him in ſecret, when other alarms leave him. Conſcience holds up to his view the image of his paſt crimes, with this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion engraved upon it, <hi>"God will bring every work into judgment."</hi> How oppoſite is ſuch a ſtate as this, to the peaceful ſecurity ariſing from the liberty enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the virtuons?—Were there nothing more in the circumſtances of ſinners to affix upon them the marks of ſervitude, this alone would be ſufficient, that, as the ſcripture expreſſes it, <hi>through fear of death they are all their lifetime ſubject to bondage.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 15.</note> Death ſets all other captives free. The ſlave who digs in the mine, or labours at the oar, can rejoice in the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028306_0119_0FD88027E50C3CD8"/>proſpect of laying down his burden together with his life; and taſtes the hope of being at laſt on equal terms with his cruel oppreſſor. But to the ſlave of guilt there ariſes no hope from death. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he is obliged to look forward with conſtant ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to this moſt certain of all events, as the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all his hopes and the commencement of his greateſt miſeries.</p>
            <p>I have thus ſet before you ſuch clear and unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal marks of the ſervitude undergone by ſinners, as fully verify the aſſertion in the text, that a ſtate of vice and corruption is a ſtate of bondage. In order to perceive how ſevere a bondage it is, let us attend to ſome peculiar circumſtances of aggravation which belong to it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is a bondage to which the mind itſelf, the native feat of liberty, is ſubjected. In other caſes, a brave man can comfort himſelf with reflecting that let tyrants do their worſt, let priſons or fetters be his lot, his mind remains unconquered and free. Of this liberty they cannot rob him; here he moves in a higher ſphere, above the reach of oppreſſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement. But what avails the ſhow of external lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to one who has loſt the government of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? As our Saviour reaſons, in another caſe, <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> So we may reaſon here, if that part of thy nature, thy mind, thy will, by which only thou canſt enjoy and reliſh liberty, be itſelf in bondage to evil paſſions and habits, how miſerable muſt be that bondage?</p>
            <p>Next. It is aggravated by this conſideration, that it is a bondage which we have brought upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To have been forced into ſlavery, is mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and miſery. But to have renounced our lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and choſen to be ſlaves, is the greateſt reproach
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028306_0120_0FD880294C0E4208"/>added to the greateſt miſery. Moments there fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt be, when a ſinner is ſenſible of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his ſtate; when he feels with pain the ſlaviſh dependence under which he is brought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the world, to violent paſſions and ſettled ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and to fears and apprehenſions ariſing from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious guilt. In ſuch moments, how cruel is the reflection, that of all this diſgrace and miſery he has been the author to himſelf; that by voluntary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, he has given to his paſſions that haughty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant which they now exerciſe over him; has forged the chains with which he is bound; and ſold himſelf to do iniquity!</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The ſervitude of vice is accompanied with this farther aggravation, that it is ſubjection to our own ſervants. Thoſe deſires and paſſions, which the ſinner has raiſed to lawleſs rule, were given us as inſtruments of ſelf-preſervation; but were plainly deſigned to be under the direction of a higher power. Of themſelves, they are head-ſtrong and blind; they bear all the marks of intended ſubordination; and conſcience is inveſted with every enſign of authority and ſupremacy. But ſin inverts the whole frame of human nature. It compels reaſon to bow down before thoſe paſſions which it was formed to command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and leads it, as is were in triumph, to grace the ſhameful conqueſt of its miniſters and ſervants. It has been always obſerved that none are ſo inſolent in power, as they who have uſurped an authority to which they had no right; and ſo it is found to hold in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The deſires and paſſions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited ſway, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to divers, and contradictory as well as imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſters, who often pull him different ways. His ſoul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:028306_0121_0FD8802AAD999580"/>and jarring diſpoſitions; and reſembles ſome barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous country, cantoned out into different principalities, who are continually waging war on one another.— Such is the ſtate into which ſinners have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in order to be free from the ſuppoſed confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of virtue. Where they had promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nothing but eaſe and pleaſure, they are made to experience reſtraints more ſevere, and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more painful, than any which they would have undergone under the diſcipline of religion.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be contended by ſome, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the repreſentation which has now been given of the ſlavery of ſin holds true in certain inſtances, yet that is applicable only to thoſe who come under the diſcription of atrocious ſinners. They imagine that a certain moderate courſe may be held in vice, by means of which, men, without throwing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether aſide the reſtraints of reaſon, may enjoy an eaſy and pleaſurable life.—By reaſoning thus, my friends, you flatter and deceive yourſelves to your own deſtruction. Be aſſured, that by every vitious indulgence, you are making an approach to a ſtate of complete ſlavery; you are forfeiting a certain ſhare of your liberty; how ſoon the whole of it may be forfeited, you are not aware. It is true that all which has now been ſaid of the ſervitude of ſin, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies only to a character corrupted in the extreme. But, remember that to this extreme no man ever arrives at once. He paſſes through many of thoſe intermediate ſtages, in one of which you are now perhaps found. Vice always creeps by degrees; and inſenſibly twines around us thoſe concealed fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by which we are at laſt completely bound.—As you value therefore your liberty and your happineſs, avoid every approach to evil. Conſider all vicious pleaſures as enchanted ground, by entering on which,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028306_0122_0FD87F7ED1666C08"/>you will be farther and farther enſnared within the magic circle, till at length you are precluded from all retreat. The moſt pure and virtuous man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the freeſt. The religion of Chriſt is juſtly entitled the <hi>perfect law of liberty.</hi>

               </gap>om its effects in purifying the heart, and reforming the life. All external ſervices, which have not this tendency, are entirely inſignificant. They degenerate into mere ſuperſtition, equally un-acceptable to God, and unprofitable to man. Hence they are ſo often treated in ſcripture with high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, when ſubſtituted in the room of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant duties of a virtuous life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:028306_0123_0FD8802C2BE4E488"/>
Notwithſtanding this, it is certain that external ſervices have their own place, and a conſiderable one too, in the ſyſtem of religion. What their proper place is no one can be at a loſs to diſcern, who will only make a juſt diſtinction between the means, and the end, in religion. It is evident there is danger of mens erring here, either on one ſide or other; and it is certain that they have erred on both. After it was obſerved, that mankind were prone to lay too much weight on the external parts of religion, it began to be thought, that no weight was to be allowed to them at all. The time was, when all religion cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in attending the duties of the church, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veneration to whatever was accounted ſacred. This alone ſanctified the character, and compenſated every blemiſh in moral conduct. From this extreme, the ſpirit of the age ſeems to be running faſt into the oppoſire extreme, of holding every thing light that belongs to public worſhip. But if ſuperſtition be an evil, and a great one it undoubtedly is, irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a ſmaller evil. And though the <hi>form of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may often remain, when <hi>the power</hi> of it is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet the <hi>power</hi> cannot well ſubſiſt where the <hi>form</hi> is altogether gone.—The holy Pſalmiſt, whoſe words are now before us, diſcovers much better principles. Expreſſing always the higheſt regard for the laws of God, and the precepts of virtue, he breathes, at the ſame time, a ſpirit of pure devotion. Though load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the cares of royalty, and encircled with the ſplendour of a court, he thought it well became him to ſhow reſpect to the great Lord of nature; and on many occaſions expreſſes, as he does in the text, his delight in the public ſervice of the temple. <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy houſe, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.</hi> In diſcourſing from which words I purpoſe to ſhow the importance of
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028306_0124_0FD8802ED58B9060"/>the public worſhip of God, and the benefits reſulting from it. I ſhall conſider it in three lights; as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects God; as it reſpects the world; as it reſpects ourſelves.</p>
            <p>I. Let us conſider it with reſpect to God. If there exiſt a Supreme Being, the Creator of the word, no conſequence appears more natural and direct than this, that he ought to be worſhipped by his creatures, with every outward expreſſion of ſubmiſſion and honour. We need only appeal to every man's heart, whether this be not a princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ple which carries along with it its own obligation, that to Him who is the Fountain of our life, and the Father of our mercies; to Him who has raiſed up that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>autiful ſtructure of the univerſe in which we dwell, and where we are ſurrounded with ſo many bleſſings and comforts; ſolemn acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of gratitude ſhould be made, praiſes and prayers ſhould be offered, and ali ſuitable marks of dependence on him be expreſſed.—This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation extends beyond the ſilent and ſecret ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our hearts. Beſides private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it naturally leads to aſſociations for public worſhip; to open and declared profeſſions of reſpect for the Deity. Where bleſſings are received in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, an obligation lies upon the community, jointly to acknowledge them. Sincere gratitude is always of open and diffuſive nature. It loves to pour itſelf forth; to give free vent to its emotions; and, before the world, to acknowledge and honour a Benefactor.</p>
            <p>So conſonant is this to the natural ſentiments of mankind, that all the nations of the earth have, as with one conſent, agreed to inſtitute ſome forms of worſhip; to hold meetings, at certain times, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their deities. Survey the ſocieties of men in their rudeſt ſtate; explore the African deſerts, the wilds of America or the diſtant iſlands of the ocean;
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028306_0125_0FD880319BF6DBF8"/>and you will find that over all the earth ſome religious ceremonies have obtained. You will every where trace, in one form or other, the temple, the prieſt, and the offering. The prevalence of the moſt abſurd ſuperſtitions furniſhes this teſtimony to the truth, that in the hearts of all men the principle is engraved, of worſhip being due to that inviſible Power who rules the world.—Herein conſiſts the great excellency of Chriſtian religion, that it hath inſtructed us in the ſimple and ſpiritual nature of that worſhip. Diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered of idle and unmeaning ceremonies, its ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual is pure, and worthy of a divine Author. Its poſitive inſtitutions are few in number, moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant of ſpiritual things, and directly conductive to good life and practice. How inexcuſable then are we, if, placed in ſuch happy circumſtances, the ſenſe of thoſe obligations to the public worſhip of God ſhall be obliterated among us, which the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inculcated, in ſome meaſure, on the moſt wild and barbarous nations?</p>
            <p>The refinements of falſe philoſophy have indeed ſuggeſted this ſhadow of objection, that God is too great to ſtand in need of any external ſervice from his creatures: that our expreſſions of praiſe and honour are miſplaced with reſpect to him, who is above all honour and all praiſe; that in his ſight the homage we ſeek to pay muſt appear contemptible; and is therefore in itſelf ſuperfluous and trifling.—But But who hath taught thoſe vain reaſoners, that all expreſſions of gratitude and honour towards a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior become unſuitable, merely becauſe that ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior needs not any returns? Where they ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to one whoſe favours they had it not in their power to repay; and, did they, on that account, feel themſelves ſet looſe from every obligation to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and to praiſe their benefactor? On the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028306_0126_0FD88032FB039EC8"/>contrary, the more diſintereſted his beneficence was, did not gratitude, in any ingenuous mind, burn with the greateſt ardour, and prompt them the more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeize every opportunity of publicly teſtifying the feelings of their hearts?—Almighty God, it is true, is too great to need our ſervice or homage. But he is alſo too good not to accept it, when it is the native expreſſion of a grateful and generous mind. If pride and ſelf-ſufficiency ſtiffle all ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of dependence on our Creator; if levity, and attachment to worldly pleaſures, render us totally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glectful of expreſſing our thankfulneſs to Him for his bleſſings; do we not hereby diſcover ſuch a want of proper feeling, ſuch a degree of hardneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in our affections, as ſhows us to be immoral and unworthy; and muſt juſtly expoſe us to the high diſpleaſure of heaven? On the contrary, according to every notion which we can form of the Father of the univerſe, muſt it not be acceptable to him to behold his creatures properly affected in heart towards their great benefactor; aſſembling together to expreſs, in acts of worſhip, that gratitude, love, and reverence which they owe him; and thus nouriſhing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting in one another an affectionate ſenſe of his goodneſs? Are not ſuch diſpoſitions, and ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as this, intimately connected with all virtue?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O Come, let us worſhip and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God; and we are the flock of his paſture. Enter into his gates with thankſgiving and his courts with praiſe. The prayer of the upright is his delight. It cometh before him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and the uplifting of their hands as the evening ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice.</hi>—Having thus ſhown the reaſonableneſs of public worſhip with reſpect to God, let us now.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider its importance in another view, as it reſpects the world. When we ſurvey the general
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028306_0127_0FD88034843554E0"/>ſtate of mankind, we find them continually immerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in worldly affairs; buſied about providing the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life, occupied in the purſuits of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or eagerly proſecuting the advancement of their intereſts. In ſuch a ſituation of things, a ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of reflection might convince any one, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome returns of ſacred days, and ſome ſolemn calls to public worſhip, it were impoſſible to preſerve in the world any ſenſe of objects, ſo foreign to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral current of thought as an inviſible Governor, and a future ſtate. If it be of importance to the peace and good order of ſociety, that there ſhould prevail among men the belief of One in the heavens, who is the protector of righteouſneſs and the avenger of crimes; if it be of importance that they be taught to look forward to a day of judgment, when they are to be brought to account for their moſt ſecret actions and eternally rewarded or puniſhed, according as their conduct has been good or evil; if ſuch principles as theſe, I ſay, be of conſequence to the public welfare, they certainly enforce the authority of public worſhip, and prove the neceſſity of religions inſtruction.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak now particulary with a view to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the great maſs and body of the people. We all know, how ſeldom from education, or private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, they have the advantage of deriving ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of religion or morality. Early obliged to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for their bread, they would remain all their days in groſs ignorance of every moral or ſacred principle, were it not for thoſe public aſſemblies in which they hear of God, and Chriſt, and judgment, and heaven and hell.

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028306_0128_0FD880367A8D26A8"/>rabble, who ſet free from checks of conſcience, and fears of divine vengeance, would be prone to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry outrage which they could commit with impunity. It is well known that, in the early ages of the world, ſages and legiſlators who endeavoured to ſame and aſſociate the barbarous hordes of men, ſound it neceſſary for this purpoſe, to have recourſe to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By bringing the rude multitudes to worthip toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at ſtated times and places, to join in hymns and ſongs to their deities, they gradually <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>trained them from violence, and trained them to ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and civilized life.</p>
            <p>During the progreſs of ſociety in after periods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious aſſemblies at church continue, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have a very conſiderable influence on the civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization and improvement of the people. Even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of effect upon their moral pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciples, by leading numbers of them to meet together in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way, and in their moſt decent appearance, they tend to humanize and poliſh their manners. They ſtrengthen the ſocial connections, and promote friendly intercourſe among thoſe who are in the ſame neighbourhood, and in the ſame lines of life. It muſt at the ſame time, be agreeable to every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane mind to think, that one day in ſeven is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for reſt to the poor from their daily labours, and for ſuch enjoyments of eaſe and comfort as their ſtation affords. It is the only day which gives them occaſion to feel themſelves as belonging to the ſame claſs of beings with their ſuperiors; when joining with them in the ſame acts of worſhip, and recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing a common Lord. Amidſt thoſe diſtinctions which the difference of ranks neceſſarily in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>oduces into human ſociety, it is ſurely fit that there be ſome occaſions when man can meet with man as a brother, in order that the pride of the great may be checked;
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028306_0129_0FD8803842B976C8"/>and the low may be taught that, if they diſcharge prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly their appointed part, they have reaſon to expect, from the Lord of the univerſe, the ſame rewards with the rich and the mighty.</p>
            <p>It will, I believe, be generally admitted that forms of public worſhip, and means of religious inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are important, on ſeveral accounts, for the body of the people, and belong to the maintenance of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety and order. But many who admit this are apt to think, that to the common people alone they may be left. To perſons of liberal education and enlarged minds, what benefit can ariſe from hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the already know; and what, perhaps, is to be inculcated on them by thoſe who are of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or capacity to themſelves?—Admitting this plea of ſuperiority which their vanity forms, and ſetting aſide for the preſent any perſonal obligation they are under to worſhip God, I muſt aſk ſuch perſons, how they can expect that religious aſſemblies will be long reſpected by the lower ranks of men, if by men of rank and education they are diſcountenanced and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faken? Do not they know, that thoſe lower ranks are ready to copy the manners, and to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their ſuperiors in all things; but aſſuredly in nothing more, than in what appears to ſet them free from reſtraint, and to gratify licentiouſneſs? While they acknowledge the importance, and even the neceſſity, of public religion to certain claſſes of men, do they, nevertheleſs, contribute by their behaviour to defeat the end of public religion, and to annihilate that importance which they aſcribe to it?—They are employed in framing laws and ſtatutes for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crimes, and keeping the diſorderly multitude with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds; and at the ſame time, by perſonally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing public worſhip, they are weakening, they are even aboliſhing, among the multitude, that
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028306_0130_0FD88039CFCC3080"/>moral reſtraint, which is of more general influence upon manners than all the laws they frame. In vain they complain of the diſhoneſty of ſervants of the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of mobs, of the attacks of the highwayman. To all theſe diſorders they have themſelves been acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory. By their open diſregard of ſacred inſtitutions, they have diſſeminated profligacy among the people. They have broken down the floodgates which ſerved to reſtrain the torrent; they have let it looſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow the land; and by the growing deluge may them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be ſwept away.—But I muſt next argue upon a different ground; and proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſet forth the importance of the public worſhip of God to every individual, in every rank of life. Whatever his ſtation be, he is ſtill a man; and has the duties of a man to perform. Were his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on divine worſhip of no other effect, than to add countenance to a ſalutary inſtitution, this alone would render it his duty. But moreover, we aſſert it to be his duty on his own account; if it be the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to uſe the proper means of preſerving and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying his virtue. All the Chriſtian inſtitutions have a direct tendency to this end. They all ſerve to give warmth to piety, and to add ſolemnity to moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. A very high opinon, indeed, that man muſt have of his own character, who imagines that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all the follies and corruptions of the world, he, ſtands in need of no aſſiſtance for enabling him to act his part with propriety and dignity.</p>
            <p>The queſtion is not, whether perſons of rank and education are to learn any thing that is new to them by frequenting the places of public worſhip. The great principles of piety and morality are obvious and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily known; and we ſhall readily admit, that there are many to whom no new inſtruction is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the houſe of God. But, my friends, the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028306_0131_0FD8803B43BF4E08"/>purpoſe of your going there is to have known truths recalled to your mind, and their dormant influence awakened; is to have ſerious meditations ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; to have good diſpoſitions raiſed; to have the heart adjuſted to a compoſed and tranquil frame. Is there any man of reaſon and reflection, who will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſuch effects, as far as they follow from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on religious ordinances, to be of the moſt beneficial nature? Theſe occaſional ceſſations from the cares and anxieties of life, theſe interruptions to the buſtle and paſſions of the world, in order to think and hear of eternity, are both a relief and an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the mind. By this retreat from its ordinary circle of thoughts, it is enabled to return, with more clearneſs and more vigour, to the buſineſs of the world, after a ſerious and proper pauſe.</p>
            <p>But I muſt aſk the perſons with whom I now reaſon, whether there be no other call to come to God's houſe, than to hear inſtruction there? Is not the devout adoration of the God of heaven the principal object of our religious aſſemblies; and is this what any man of reflection, and of ſober mind, dare to make light of? In the temple of the Lord, the rich and the poor, the prince and the peaſant, appear as ſuppliants alike for the protection and favour of the Almighty.—Great and flouriſhing as thou mayeſt think thyſelf, know that thou ſtandeſt as much in need of that protection, as the meaneſt of the crowd whom thou beholdeſt worſhipping, with lowly reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the God of their fathers. The ſun of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity ſhines at preſent on thy head, and the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gale carries thee ſof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ly along the ſtream of life. But the Almighty needs only to give the word, and inſtantly the tempeſt ſhall riſe; and thy frail bark ſhall be driven into the ocean, and whelmed in the deep. <hi>In my proſperity I ſaid I ſhall never be moved.
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028306_0132_0FD8803CD328B578"/>Thou, Lord, didſt hide thy face, and I was troubled.</hi>— Look up, with dread, to that awful hand of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is ſtretched over your heads.

            </p>
            <p>But after all that has been urged on this ſubject, I am ſenſible it may be objected, that many who make conſcience of paying ſtrict regard to the inſtitutions of religion, do not appear to have derived much ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit from them. They are not, it will be ſaid, more improved in moral conduct, and the proper diſcharge of the ſeveral duties of life, than others who have been apparently negligent of the ſervices of the church. On the contrary, a formal regard to theſe appears to be ſubſtituted by many, in the room of the weightier matters of the law.—Though this ſhould be admitted, it goes no farther than to ſhow that human weakneſs, or corruption, may defeat the purpoſe of the moſt promiſing means of moral im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. That a ſuperſtitious attention to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worſhip, has to often uſurped the character, and ſupplanted the place of real virtue, will not be denied. Admonitions againſt ſo dangerous an error cannot be given too often. But becauſe the beſt things have been often miſapplied and abuſed, no argument thence ariſes for their being undervalued, and thrown aſide. So alſo reaſon, inſtruction, and diſcipline of every kind, have been frequently perverted to bad ends; and yet their intrinſic worth and uſefulneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main untouched and acknowledged.—Beſides this, it cannot be admitted that, becauſe religious inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028306_0133_0FD8803E4DBC20E8"/>produce not all they good the might be wiſhed, and hoped for, they therefore do no good at all. This were a raſh and ill-ſounded concluſion. If the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of men are not always amended by them as they ought to have been, there is reaſon, however to think that they would have been worſe without them. Some check is always given by them to open proſligacy. Some aſſiſtance is furniſhed to good diſpoſitions of heart; at leaſt, to decency of manners. Even mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary impreſſions of ſeriouſneſs made on the thoughtleſs by the ſolemnities of religion, are not without their fruit. They leave generally ſome trace behind them; and when the traces are often renewed, they may be hoped, through the divine bleſſing, to form at laſt a deep impreſſion on the mind.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, I do not ſay that religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions work upon the mind like a charm; and that mere bodily attendance on them will always enſure us of ſome profitable effect. Let the means that are employed, for the improvement of rational beings, be ever ſo powerful in themſelves, much of their ſucceſs will always depend on the manner in which they are received and applied. I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my reaſonings on this ſubject, with a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations concerning the diſpoſitions requiſite on our part, for deriving benefit from the public ordinances of religion.</p>
            <p>The ends for which we aſſemble in the houſe of God are two; to worſhip God, and to liſten to relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious inſtructions.</p>
            <p>The public worſhip of God is the chief and moſt ſacred purpoſe of every religious aſſembly of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Let it here be remembered, that it is not the uttering, or the hearing of certain words, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes the worſhip of the Almighty. It is the heart that praiſes, or prays. If the heart accompany not
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028306_0134_0FD88040CA746C10"/>the words that are ſpoken or heard, we <hi>offer the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice of fools.</hi> By the inattentive though, and the giddy and wandering eye, we proſane the temple of the Lord, and turn the appearance of devotion into inſult and mockery. With regard to religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, attention and reverence are unqueſtionably due. All religious and moral knowledge comes from God. It is a light from heaven, firſt tranſmitted to man by the orginal conſtitution of his nature, and afterwards made to ſhine with fairer and fuller luſtre by the revelation of the goſpel in Jeſus Chriſt. Its brightneſs may ſometimes be ſtronger, and ſometimes weaker, according to the mediums by which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed. But ſtill, as far as the inſtructions delivered from the pulpit are illuminated by the ray from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they are the truths of God, and ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as ſuch. Refinements of vain philoſophy, or intricate ſubtilities of theological controverſy, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly not intitled to ſuch regard. But when the great principles of natural or revealed religion are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; when the important doctrines of the goſpel concerning the life, and ſufferings, and death of our bleſſed Redeemer are diſplayed; or uſeful inſtructions regarding the regulation of life, and the proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our ſeveral duties, are the ſubjects brought into view; it is not then the human ſpeaker, but the divine authority that is to be regarded.</p>
            <p>In the ſpeaker, many imperfections and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be diſcovered. The diſcoveries of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are repreſented in ſcripture, as a hidden treaſure brought to light; but, by the appointment of God, <hi>we have this treaſure in earthen veſſels.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor iv. 7.</note> It is not the ſpirit of curioſity that ought to bring us to church. Too often, is to be feared, we aſſemble there merely as crities on the preacher; crities on his ſentiments,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028306_0135_0FD88042464F18D8"/>his language, and his delivery. But, ſuch are not the diſpoſitions which become us on ſo ſerious an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is with humility, with fairneſs, and candour, with an intention to improve ourſelves in piety and virtue, with a view to make perſonal application to our own character, that we ought to hear the word of God.—When we enter the ſacred temple, let us ever conſider ourſelves as creatures ſurrounded with darkneſs, ſeeking illumination from heaven; as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty creatures, imploring forgiveneſs from our judge; as frail and mortal creatures, preparing for that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal habitation into which we know not how ſoon we are to paſs.</p>
            <p>If, with ſuch ſentiments and impreſſions we join in the worſhip of God, and the ordinances of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may juſtly hope that they ſhall be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us with the divine bleſſing. It is the expreſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God. <hi>not to forſake the aſſembling of ourſelves together.</hi>

               </gap>ſſons which religion teaches. By ſo many deſires and paſſions we are connected with the objects around us, that our attachment to them is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in hazard of becoming exceſſive and ſinful. Hence religion is often employed in moderating this attachment, by rectifying our erroneous opinions, and inſtructing us in the proper value we ought to ſet on worldly things. Such was particularly the ſcope of the Apoſtle in this context. He is putting the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthians in mind that their <hi>time is ſhort:</hi> that every thing here is tranſitory; and therefore, that in all the different occupations of human life, in <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing,</hi> and <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſing,</hi> they were ever to keep in view this conſideration, that <hi>the faſhion of this world paſſeth away.</hi> The original expreſſion imports, the figure or form under which the world preſents itſelf to us. The meaning is. All that belongs to this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſtate is continually changing. Nothing in human affairs is fixed or ſtable. All is in motion and fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028306_0137_0FD89567FA645570"/>altering its appearance every moment, and paſſing into ſome new form. Let us meditate for a little on the ſerious view which is here given us of the world, in order that we may attend to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which it ſuggeſts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The faſhion of the world paſſeth away,</hi> as the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ideas, and the manners of men are always changing. We look in vain for a ſtandard to aſcertain and fix any of theſe; in vain expect that what has been approved and eſtabliſhed for a while, is always to endure. Principles which were of high authority among our anceſtors are now exploded. Syſtems of philoſophy which were once univerſally received, and taught and as infallible truths. are now obliterated and forgotten. Modes of living behaving, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, the purſuits of the buſy, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the gay, have been entirely changed. They were the offspring of faſhion, the children of a day. When they had run their courſe, they expired; and were ſucceeded by other modes of living, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and acting, which the gloſs of novelty recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for a while to the public taſte.</p>
            <p>When we read an account of the manners and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations, of the ſtudies and opinions, even of our own countrymen, in ſome remote age, we ſeem to be reading the hiſtory of a different world from what we now inhabit. Coming downwards through ſome generations, a new face of things appears. Men begin to think, and act, in a different train; and what we call refinements gradually opens. Arriving at our own times, we conſider ourſelves as having widely enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſphere of knowledge on every ſide, having form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſt ideas on every ſubject; having attained the proper ſtandard of manners and behaviour; and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the ignorance, the uncouthneſs, and ruſticity of our forefathers. But, alas! what appears to us ſo
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028306_0138_0FD89569948E0DF0"/>perfect ſhall in its turn paſs away. The next race, while they ſhove us off the ſtage, will introduce their favourite diſcoveries and innovations; and what we now admire as the height of improvement, may in a few ages hence be conſidered as altogether rude and imperfect. As one wave effaces the ridge which the former had made on the ſand by the ſea ſhore, ſo eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceeding age obliterates the opinions and modes of the age which had gone before it. <hi>The faſhion of the world</hi> is ever paſſing away.</p>
            <p>Let us only think of the changes which our own ideas and opinions undergo in the progreſs of life. One man differs not more from another, than the ſame man varies from himſelf in different periods of his age, and in different ſituations of fortune. In youth, and in opulence, every thing appears ſmiling and gay. We fly as on the wing of fancy; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey beauties wherev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> we caſt our eye. But let ſome more years have paſſed over our heads, or let diſappointments in the world have depreſſed our ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its; and what a change takes place? The pleaſing illuſions that once ſhone before us; the ſplended fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bries that imagination had reared; the enchanting maze in which we once wandered with delight, all vaniſh and are forgotten. The world itſelf remains the ſame. But its form, its appearance, and aſpect, is changed to our view; its <hi>faſhion,</hi> as to us hath <hi>paſſed away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. While our opinions and ideas are thus chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, the condition of all external things is, at the ſame time, ever changing without us, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us. Wherever we caſt our eyes over the face of nature, or the monuments of art, we diſcern the marks of alteration and viciſſitude. We cannot tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel far upon the earth, without being preſented with many a ſtriking memorial of the changes made by
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028306_0139_0FD8956AF9CF7FE0"/>time. What was once a flouriſhing city, is now a neglected village. Where caſtles and palaces ſtood, fallen towers and ruined walls appear. Where the magnificence of the great ſhone, and the mirth of the gay reſounded, there, as the prophet Iſaiah deſcibes, <hi>the owl and the raven now dwell, thorns come up, and the nettle and the bramble grow in the courts.</hi>—When we read the hiſtory of nations, what do we read but the hiſtory of inceſſant revolution and change? We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold kingdoms alternately riſing and falling; peace and war taking place by turns; princes, heroes, and ſtateſmen, coming forth in ſucceſſion on the ſtage, attracting our attention for a little by the ſplendid figure they make, and then diſappearing and forgotten. We ſee the <hi>faſhion of the world</hi> aſſuming all its differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent forms, and in all of them, <hi>paſſing away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to hiſtorical annals there is no occaſion for our having recourſe. Let any one, who has made ſome progreſs in life, recollect only what he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held paſſing before him, in his own time. We have ſeen our country riſe triumphant among the nations; and we have ſeen it alſo humbled in its turn. We have ſeen in one hemiſphere of the globe new domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions acquired, and in another hemiſphere, our old dominions loſt. At home, we have ſeen ſactions and parties ſhift through all their different forms; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, in ſucceſſion, riſe and fall. What were once the great themes of eager diſcuſſion, and political conteſt, are now forgotten. Fathers recount them to their children as the tales of other times. New actors have come forth on the ſtage of the world. New objects have attracted the attention, and new intrigues engaged the paſſions of men. New mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers fill the ſeats of juſtice; new miniſters the temples of religion; and a new world, in ſhort, in the courſe of a few years, has gradually and inſenſibly riſen around us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:028306_0140_0FD8956C9D8B6E48"/>
When from the public ſcene we turn our eye to our own private connections, the changes which have taken place in the <hi>faſhion of the world,</hi> muſt touch eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reflecting mind with a more tender ſenſibility. For where are now, many of the companions of our early years; many of thoſe with whom we firſt began the race of life; and whoſe hopes and proſpects were once the ſame with our own? In recollecting our old acquaintance and friends, what devaſtations have been made by the hand of time? On the ruins of our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er connections, new ones have ariſen; new relations have been formed; and the circle of thoſe among whom we live is altogether changed from what it once was. Comparing our preſent ſituation with our former condition of life; looking back to our father's houſe, and to the ſcenes of youth; remembering the friends by whom we were trained, and the family in which we grew up; who, but with inward emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, recollects thoſe days of former years, and is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to drop the ſilent tear, when he views the <hi>faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world</hi> thus always <hi>paſſing away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Not only our connections with all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us change, but our own life, through all its ſtages and conditions, is ever paſſing away. How juſt, and how affecting is that image, employed in the ſacred writings to deſcribe the ſtate of man, <hi>we ſpend our years as a tale that is told!</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xc. 9.</note> It is not to any thing great or laſting that human life is compared; not to a moment that is built, or to an inſcription that is engraved; not even to a book that is written, or to a hiſtory that is recorded; but to a <hi>tale,</hi> which is liſtened to for a little; where the words are fugitive and paſſing, and where one incident ſucceeds and hangs on another, till, by inſenſible tranſitions, we
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028306_0141_0FD8956E0259D268"/>are brought to the cloſe; <hi>a tale,</hi> which in ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages may be amuſing, in others, tedious; but wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it amuſes or fatigues, is ſoon told, and ſoon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. Thus, year ſteals upon us after year, Life is never ſtanding ſtill for a moment; but continually, though inſenſibly, ſliding into a new form. Infancy riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es up faſt to childhood; childhood to youth; youth paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es quickly into manhood; and the grey hair and the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed look are not long of admoniſhing us, that old age is at hand. In this courſe all generations run. The world is made up of unceaſing rounds of tranſitory exiſtence. Some generations are coming foward into being, and others haſtening to leave it. The ſtream which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries us all along it ever flowing with a quick current, though with a ſtill and noiſeleſs courſe. The dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place of man is continually emptying, and by a freſh ſucceſſion of inhabitants, continually filling anew. <hi>The memory of man paſſeth away, like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of a gueſt who hath tarried but one night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the life of man, conſidered in its duration, thus fleets and paſſes away, ſo during the time it laſts, its condition is perpetually changing. It affords us noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on which we can ſet up our reſt; no enjoyment or poſſeſſion which we can properly call our own. When we have begun to be placed in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as we deſired, and wiſh our lives to proceed in the ſame agreeable tenor, how often comes ſome unexpected event acroſs, to diſconcert all our ſchemes of happineſs? Our health declines; our friends die; our families are ſcattered; ſomething or other is not long of occurring, to ſhow us that the wheel muſt turn round; <hi>the faſhion of the world</hi> muſt <hi>paſs away.</hi> Is there any man who dares to look to futurity with an eye of confident hope; and to ſay, that againſt a year hence, he can promiſe being in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health of fortune, as he is at preſent? The
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028306_0142_0FD8956F7A30ED48"/>ſeeds of change are every where ſown in our ſtate; and the very cauſes that ſeemed to promiſe us ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are often ſecretly undermining it. Great fame provokes the attacks of envy and reproach. High health gives occaſion to intemperance and diſeaſe. The elevation of the mighty never ſails to render their condition tottering; and that obſcurity which ſhelters the mean, expoſes them, at the ſame time, to become the prey of oppreſſion. So completely is the <hi>faſhion of this world</hi> made by Providence for change, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for <hi>paſſing away.</hi> In the midſt of this inſtabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it were ſome comfort, did human proſperity decay as ſlowly as it riſes. By ſlow degrees, and by many interveining ſteps, it riſes. But one day is ſufficient to ſcatter, and bring it to nought. I might add,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the world itſelf in which we dwell, the baſis of all our preſent enjoyments, is itſelf contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for change, and deſigned to paſs away. While the generations of men come forth in their turns, like troops of ſucceeding pilgrims, to act their part on this globe, the globe on which they act is totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under their feet. It was once overflowed by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge. It is ſhaken by earthquakes; it is undermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſubterraneous fires; it carries many a mark of having ſuffered violent convulſions, and of tending to diſſolution. Revelation informs us, that there is a day approaching, in which <hi>the heavens ſhall paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a great noiſe: the elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat; and the earth and the works therein ſhall be burnt up.</hi> When this deſtined hour arrives, the <hi>faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the world</hi> ſhall have finally <hi>paſt away.</hi> Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſpirits ſhall then look back upon this world, as we do at preſent on cities and empires, which were once mighty and flouriſhing, but now are ſwept from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and their place is no more to be found.</p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt no longer on this repreſentation of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028306_0143_0FD89571B9D6F220"/>things. Enough has been ſaid, to ſhow that the <hi>faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the world,</hi> in every ſenſe, <hi>paſſes</hi> away. Opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and manners, public affairs and private concerns the life of man, the conditions of fortune, and the earth itſelf on which we dwell, are all changing around us.—Is every thing, then, with which we are connected, paſſing and tranſitory? Is the whole ſtate of man no more than a dream or fleeting viſion? Is he brought forth, to be only the child of a day? Are we thrown into a river, where all flows, and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtays; where we have no means of reſiſting the current; nor can reach any firm ground, on which to reſt our foot?—No, my brethren; man was not doomed to be ſo unhappy; nor made by his Creator ſo much in vain. There are three fixed and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent objects, to which I muſt now call your attention, as the great ſupports of human conſtancy amidſt this fugitive ſtate. Though this world changes and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es away, virtue and goodneſs never changes; heaven and immortality paſs not away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Virtue and goodneſs never change. Let opinions and manners, conditions and ſituations, in public and in private life, alter as they will, virtue is ever the ſame. It reſts on the immovable baſis of Eternal Truth. Among all the revolutions of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man things it maintains its ground; ever poſſeſſing the veneration and eſteem of mankind, and conferring on the heart, which enjoys it, ſatisfaction and peace. Conſult the moſt remote antiquity. Look to the moſt ſavage nations of the earth. How wild, and how fluctuating ſoever the ideas of men may have been, this opinion you will find to have always prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that probity, truth, and beneficence, form the honour and the excellency of man. In this, the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and the ſavage, the warrior and the hermit, join. At this altar all have worſhipped. Their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028306_0144_0FD895733AC77C40"/>many have been unſeemly. Their notions of virtue may have been rude, and occaſionally taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ignorance and ſuperſtition; but the fundamental ideas of moral worth have ever remained the ſame.</p>
            <p>Here then is one point of ſtability, affected by no viciſſitudes of time and life, on which we may reſt. Our fortunes may change, and our friends may die; but virtue may ſtill be our own; and as long as this remains, we are never miſerable. <hi>Till I die I will not remove my integrity from me. My righteouſneſs I hold faſt, and will not let it go. My heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxvii. 5, 6.</note> He who, with the holy man of old, can hold this language, may with undiſturbed mind ſurvey time flying away, life decaying, and the whole faſhion of the world changing around him. He hath within himſelf, a ſource of conſolation and hope, independent of all earthly objects. Every terreſtrial glory ſparkles only for a little, with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient brightneſs. But virtue ſhines with eternal and unalterable ſplendour. It derives its origin from heaven; and partakes both of the luſtre, and the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, of celeſtial objects. <hi>It is the brightneſs of the everlaſting light; the unſpotted mirror of God, and the image of his goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, God never changes. Amidſt the unceaſing viciſſitude of earthly things, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains at the head of the univerſe an eternal protector of virtue, whoſe <hi>throne is eſtabliſhed for ever.</hi> With him there is <hi>no variableneſs, neither any ſhadow of turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> no inconſtancy of purpoſe, and no decay of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or of power. We know that he loved righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from the beginning of days, and that he will continue to love it unalterably to the laſt. Foreſeen by him was every revolution which the courſe of ages has produced. All the changes which happen in the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028306_0145_0FD89574BA709A10"/>ſtate of nature, or the life of men, were comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his decree. How much ſoever worldly things may change in themſelves, they are all united in his plan; they conſtitute one great ſyſtem or whole, of which he is the Author; and which, at its final com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, ſhall appear to be perfect. His dominion holds together, in a continual chain, the ſucceſſive variety of human events; gives ſtability to things that in themſelves ars fluctuating; gives conſtancy even to the <hi>faſhion of the world</hi> while it is <hi>paſſing away.</hi> Wherefore, though all things change on earth, and we ourſelves be involved in the general mutability, yet as long as, with truſt and hope, we look up to this Supreme Being, we reſt on the <hi>rock of ages,</hi> and are ſafe amidſt every change. We poſſeſs a fortreſs to which we can have recourſe in all dangers; a refuge under all ſtorms; <hi>a dwelling place in all generations.</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> and laſt place, heaven and immortality paſs not away. The fleeting ſcenes of this life are to be confidered as no more than an introduction to a nobler and more permanent order of things, when man ſhall have attained the maturity of his being. This is what reaſon gave ſome ground to expect; what revelation has fully confirmed; and in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, has agreed with the ſentiments and anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the good and wiſe in every age. We are taught to believe that what we now behold, is only the firſt ſtage of the life of man. We are arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no further than the threſhold, we owell as in the outer courts of exiſtence. Here, tents only are pitched; tabernacles erected for the ſojourners of a day. But in the region of eternity, all is great, ſtable, and unchanging. There, the <hi>manſions</hi> of the juſt are prepared: there, the <hi>city which hath foundations</hi> is built; there is eſtabliſhed, the kingdom <hi>which cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Here, every thing is in ſtir and fluctuation; becauſe here good men continue not, but paſs onward
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:028306_0146_0FD8957639D1BA30"/>in the courſe of being. There, all is ſerene, ſteady and orderly; becauſe there remaineth the final <hi>reft of the people of God.</hi> Here, all is corrupted by our folly and guilt; and of courſe muſt be tranſient and vain. But there, purchaſed by the death, and ſecured by the reſurrection of the Son of God, is an <hi>inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</hi> There reigns the tranquillity which is never troubled. There ſhines that ſun which never ſets. There flows that river of pleaſures, which is always unruffled and pure. Looking forward to thoſe divine habitations, the changes of the preſent world diſappear to the eye of faith; and a good man becomes aſhamed of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be dejected by what is ſo ſoon to paſs away.</p>
            <p>Such are the objects you ought to oppoſe to the tranſient <hi>ſaſhion of the world;</hi> Virtue, and God, and Heaven. Fixing your regard on theſe, you will have no reaſo to complain of the lot of man, or the world's mutability.—The deſign of the preceding repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation which I gave of the world, was not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge vain declamation; to raiſe fruitleſs melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; or to throw an unneceſſary cloud over human life. But to ſhow the moderation requiſite in our attatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the world; and at the ſame time, to point out the higher objects both of attention and conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which religion affords.—Paſſing and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as all human things are, among them, however, we muſt at preſent act our part; to them we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from religious meditation. They are not below the regard of any Chriſtian; for they form the ſcene which providence has appointed at preſent for his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and his duty. Trials and dangers they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preſent to him; but amidſts theſe he will ſafely hold his courſe, if, when engaged in worldly affairs, he keep in view thoſe divine objects which I have
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:028306_0147_0FD87F80A7676318"/>been ſetting before him. Let him ever retain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Virtue, and God, and Heaven. By them let his conduct be regulated, and his conſtancy ſupported. So ſhall he <hi>uſe this world</hi> without <hi>abuſing it.</hi> He ſhall neither droop under its misſortunes, nor be vainly elated by its advantages; but through all its changes ſhall carry an equal and ſteady mind; and in the end ſhall receive the accompliſhment of the promiſe of ſcripture, that though <hi>the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof, he that doth the will of God ſhall abide for ever.</hi>

               </gap> diſquieted by the accidents of life, is undoubtedly one of the greateſt bleſſings that we can poſſeſs on earth. It is here, mentioned as the reward of the man, whoſe character had been deſcribed in this pſalm, as leading a virtuous life, and diſcharging his duty towards God and his neighbour. It is indeed the ultimate aim, to which the wiſhes of the wiſe and reflecting have ever been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028306_0148_0FD895798E808258"/>that with a mind undiſturbed by anxieties, cares, and fears, they might paſs their days in a pleaſing ſerenity. They juſtly concluded that, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying themſelves in peace, they would enjoy, to the greateſt advantage, all the comforts of life that came within their reach.</p>
            <p>This happy tranquillity, the multitude conceive to be moſt readily attainable by means of wealth, or, at leaſt, of an eaſy fortune; which they imagine would ſet them above all the ordinary diſturbances of life. That it has ſome effect for this purpoſe, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. Poverty and ſtraitened circumſtances are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inconſiſtent with tranquillity. To be deſtitute of of thoſe conveniencies that ſuit our rank in the world; to be burdened with anxiety about making proviſion for every day which paſſes over our head; inſtead of bringing comfort to a family who look up to us for aid, to behold ourſelves ſurrounded with their wants and complaints, are circumſtances which can not fail to give much uneaſineſs to every feeling mind. To take meaſures, therefore, for attaining a competent fortune, by laudable means, is wiſe and proper. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ligence of our affairs, and indifference about our worldly circumſtances, is, for the moſt part, the conſequence of ſome vice, or ſome folly.—At the ſame time, I muſt obſerve, that the attainment of opulence is no certain method of attaining tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Embaraſſments and vexations often attend it; and long experience has ſhown, that tranquillity is far from being always found among the rich. Nay, the higher that men riſe in the world, the greater degrees of power and diſtinction which they acquire, they are often the farther removed from internal peace. The world affords ſo many inſtances of miſeries abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the higher ranks of life, that it were needleſs to enlarge on a topic ſo generally known and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:028306_0149_0FD87F81EB38D990"/>
Aſſuming it, therefore, for an undoubted truth, that the mere poſſeſſion of the goods of fortune may be conſiſtent with the want of inward tranquillity, we muſt look around for other more certain grounds of it. We muſt inquire whether any line of conduct can be pointed out, which, independent of external ſituation in the world, ſhall tend to make us eaſy in mind; ſhall either beſtow, or aid, that tranquillity which all men deſire. The remaining part of this diſcourſe ſhall be employed in ſuggeſting, with great plainneſs of ſpeech, ſuch directions as appear to me moſt material on this important ſubject.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> direction, which I have to ſuggeſt, is, that we imitate the character of the man who is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in this pſalm as <hi>walking uprightly, working righteouſneſs, and ſpeaking the truth, as he thinketh in his heart;</hi> that we ſtudy to preſerve a clear conſcience, and to lead a virtuous and honourable, at leaſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive and innocent, life. Of ſuch a man only it can be ſaid, that <hi>doing theſe things be ſhall never be moved.</hi> So great is the power of conſcience over every human being, that the remembrance of crimes never fails to overthrow tranquillity of mind.

Even the ſenſe a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and trifling conduct, of a life paſt in idleneſs and diſſipation; by which, though a man has not been guilty of great crimes, he has however waſted his ſubſtance, miſpent his time, and brought upon himſelf juſt reproach; even this, I ſay, is ſufficient to or the much uneaſineſs and diſquiet to the heart.

            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place to join humble truſt in the favour of God. As, after the beſt endeavours we can uſe, no man's behaviour will be entirely faultleſs, it is eſſential to peace of mind, that we have ſome ground for hope in the Divine mercy, that through the merits of Jeſus Chriſt, our defects ſhall be forgiven, and grace be ſhewn us by Heaven. This includes all the duties of faith and repentance that are required by the Goſpel; the faithful diſcharge of which duties is abſolutely neceſſary for delivering us from thoſe fears of another world, which, if not allayed, are ſufficient to baniſh all tranquillity from the heart. Our relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious principles muſt at the ſame time be ſound and pure; and carefully preſerved from the taint of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, whoſe gloomy horrors, taking poſſeſſion of weak and ill-informed minds, convert what they miſtake for religion, into a ſource of miſery.—More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it is neceſſary, that we be able to place truſt in God, not only as our future Judge, but as the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Govenor of human affairs. So uncertain is the continuance of every earthly comfort, that he, who repoſes no confidence in the Supreme Diſpoſer of events, muſt be often diſquieted and dejected. He alone poſſeſſes firm tranquillity, who, amidſt all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man viciſſitudes, looks up, with ſettled truſt, to an almighty Ruler, as to one under whoſe conduct he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>. To him alone belongs that happy privilege,

            </p>
            <p>I have pointed out the primary and eſſential foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of tranquillity; virtuous conduct, good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and pious diſpoſitions. At the ſame time, a man may be both pious and virtuous, and yet, through ſome defects in the management of his mind and temper, may not poſſeſs that happy ſerenity and ſelf-enjoyment, which ought to be the portion of virtue and piety. Inſtances of this will occur to every one who is acquainted with the world. We too often behold perſons, whoſe principles, and whoſe moral conduct, are in the main unexceptionable, leading an uncomfortable life; throught fretfulneſs of temper, peeviſhneſs of manners, or ſullenneſs of diſpoſition. There is, therefore, ſome diſcipline to be ſtudied; there are ſome ſubſidiary parts of character to be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to, in order to give piety and virtue their full ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for conferring tranquillity. To the conſideration of theſe ſecondary means I now proceed. Let me then adviſe you.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, to attend to the culture and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of your minds. A fund of uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a ſtock of ideas, afford much advantage for the enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not mean, that every man muſt ſtudy to become deeply learned. The ſituation of many would not allow it. The taſte, and the habits of others, prevent it. But what I mean is, that every man who wiſhes to lead a comfortable life ſhould provide for himſelf, as much as he can, by means of obſervation, reading, and reflecting, a large field of uſeful thoughts. In a mind abſolutely vacant, tranquillity is ſeldom found. The vacancy too often will be filled up by bad deſires and paſſions.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028306_0152_0FD8957E8374AC90"/>Whereas, the mind of a wiſe man is a kingdom to itſelf. In his lonely, or melancholy hours, he finds always reſources within himſelf, to which he can turn for relief. As there are many occaſions when exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal objects afford no pleaſure, it is only by being able to reſt on the entertainments afforded to himſelf by his mind, that any one can paſs his days with ſelf-enjoyment Let me recommend for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, that we be always careful to provide proper employment for our time. Regular induſtry and labour, with intervals of eaſe, is perhaps the ſtate moſt conducive of any to tranquillity. If our ſtation give no call to induſtry, it will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that we ſtudy to have ſome end or object in view, to which our attention ſhall be directed. Relaxation from intenſe, of inceſſant purſuit, is requiſite for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But if relaxation degenerate into total idleneſs, it becomes in a high degree adverſe to tranquillity. Every man by his nature, is formed, more or leſs, for action. In a mind that is entirely quieſcent, and that has no object to put it into motion, inſtead of ſelf-enjoyment, there will be conſtant languor, tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and miſery. Life ſtagnates in ſuch a ſituation, like a pool of dead waters; and the man becomes a burden to himſelf. Violent and dangerous purſuits, which diſtract and embroil thoſe who are engaged in them. I cannot be underſtood to recommend. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſees how foreign theſe are to a ſtate of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. But in the ordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nor of calm and eaſy l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ject be innocent, and of no unſuitable or degrading nature, it may anſwer this purpoſe, though it ſhould not be in itſelf of high importance. It is
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028306_0153_0FD8957FFB8DC5F8"/>better for the mind to have ſome determinate directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given it, than to be always left floating, as it were, in empty ſpace.—But about whatever objects we are employed, it is ſtill more material to tranquillity that, in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth</hi> place, we learn to govern our paſſions. Theſe are the moſt frequent diſturbers of our peace. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as their impulſe is to give activity to the mind, yet if they are not kept in ſubordination to reaſon, they ſpeedily throw all things into confuſion. Such of them as belong to the malignant and unſocial claſs, evidently tend to produce vexation and diſquiet. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuffering theſe to gain poſſeſſion of the heart, admonition is ſcarcely neceſſary. But I muſt admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh you, that even thoſe which are accounted of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent nature, and which therefore may lay hold of virtuous minds, if they obtain the entire maſtery, are ſufficient to overthrow the tranquillity of life. Let every one, therefore, who values that tranquillity, ſtudy to retain moderation and ſelf-command, even in the midſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> paſſions which have a fair and bland appearance. He will find that the gratification of any one of them, compenſates not that perpetual ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very to which it will reduce him, when it becomes inordinate.</p>
            <p>I have farther to admoniſh you, that this ſelf-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is particularly neceſſary in all that relates to habitual temper. Even where ſtrong paſſions are out of the queſtion, thoſe ſlighter emotions which ruffle or four the temper, are ſufficient, by their frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, to poiſon all ſelf-enjoyment. He who would poſſeſs a tranquil ſtate, muſt, above all things, culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate calmneſs and gentleneſs of diſpoſition. He ought eſpecially to cultivate it in that ſociety, whether do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic or ſocial, with which he has moſt frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. We all know, that there are thouſands
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028306_0154_0FD895818AF8FD90"/>who in pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>d in formal companies, appear to be all gentleneſs and ſweetneſs, but who, at home, and among their neareſt relations, give vent, with freedom, to the moſt harſh and peeviſh diſpoſitions. Such perſons are not likely to enjoy much real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For it is in the daily and familiar intercourſe of life, that temper chiefly exerts its power, either for promoting or for diſturbing, the tranquillity of our days. On occaſions when men come cloſeſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if, inſtead of meeting in ſmooth contact, they rub and grate on one another, the feelings produced on both ſides are of the moſt offenſive and diſpleaſing kind. Nothing can be aſſumed as a more certain ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iom, than that he who allows either inordinate paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or a croſs temper, to govern him, muſt, though he ſhould poſſeſs all that flouriſhing fortune can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow, be a ſtranger to tranquillity.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſixth</hi> place, let me adviſe you never to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect too much from the world. High hopes, and florid views, are great enemies to tranquillity. When raſhly indulged, they are conſtantly producing diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. Their indulgence, in the mean time, occaſions diſcontent with our preſent f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ion; and he who is diſcontented cannot be happy. One of the firſt leſſons, both of religion and of wiſdom is, to mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate our expectations and hopes; and not to ſet forth on the voyage of life like men who expect to be always carried forward with a favourable gale. Let your views be ſuited to your rank and ſtation in the world; and never ſoar fantaſtically beyond them. Content yourſelves with ſober pleaſures, and form your reliſh to them. Be thankful when you are free from pain, though you be not in the midſt of high enjoyment, Be ſatisfied if the path you tread be eaſy and ſmooth, though it be not ſtrewed with flowers. Human life admits not of continued pleaſure; nor is it always
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028306_0155_0FD895830C519C38"/>rendered happy by great exaltation. Remember, that it is a middle region which is the native ſtation of tranquillity. It neither aſpires to thoſe heights of the atmoſphere where the thunder is formed; nor creeps always on the ground. Affect not, on every occaſion, to put yourſelves forward. Be content to retire ſometimes into the ſhade; and allow others to take their proper place.—It will be eaſily ſeen, that I ſpeak not now to the ambitious and aſpiring; but to thoſe who value tranquillity more than ſplendid appearance in the world.</p>
            <p>Such perſons I alſo adviſe, while they expect not too much from the world, neither, alſo, to form too high expectations from the characters of thoſe on whoſe friendſhip they reſt, and with whom it is their lot to be connected, either in ſocial or domeſtic rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If you have looked for perfection any where, you will find yourſelf diſappointed; and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this diſappointment will be, that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will cool, and diſguſt ſucceed. If you wiſh to enjoy comfort in any of your connections, take your fellow-creatures as they are, and look for their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to appear. You know you have your own; bear with thoſe of others, as you expect that they are to bear with you. As no one is without his failings, few alſo are void of amiable qualities. Select for your companions, thoſe who have the greateſt ſhare of ſuch qualities; and value them accordingly.—In a word make the beſt of this world as you find it. Reckon both on the ſtate of human life, and on the ſociety of men, as mixed and cheek quered with good and evil. Carrying always in your eye ſuch views of things, you will be beſt formed to thoſe equal ſpirits, and that reaſonable diſpoſition of mind, which make the baſis of tranquillity.

I before adviſed thoſe who are not particularly engaged in active life, to form to themſelves ſome object of purſuit, in order to furniſh proper employment to time and thought. But the great multitude of men are in a different ſituation. Induſtry is required of them; buſineſs and cares preſs; and active purſuits occupy their cloſeſt attention. He, who, in this ſituation, pours himſelf fourth inceſſantly on the world, cannot eſcape partaking much of its diſturbance and trouble. Amidſt buſtle, intrigue, and diſſenſion, he muſt paſs many an uneaſy hour. Here an enemy encounters him; there, a rival meets him. A ſuſpicious friend alarms him one hour; an ungrateful one provokes him the next. I do not recommend, that for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, he who ſtudies tranquillity ſhould retire from all public buſineſs, and forſake the haunts of men. This were the retreat of a monk, not of a good and a wiſe man. Tranquillity were too dearly purchaſed by the neglect of thoſe duties which belong to a man, and a Chriſtian. Nor indeed in abſolute ſecluſion from the world is tranquillity ever found. On the contrary, when the human mind is cut off from thoſe employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for which it was deſigned by nature and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it preys on itſelf, and engenders its own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. Tranquillity is always moſt likely to be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the buſineſs of the world is tempered with thoughtful and ſerious retreat. <hi>Commune with your hearts on your bed, and be ſtill.</hi> Leaving this world to itſelf, let there be ſeaſons which you devote to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to God. Reflection and meditation allay the workings of many unquiet paſſions; and place us at a diſtance from the tumults of the world. When the mind has either been ruffled or caſt down, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with God and heaven we find a ſanctuary
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:028306_0157_0FD89585F9E27B40"/>to which we can retreat. In the hours of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and devotion, a good man enjoys himſelf in peace. He beholds nobler objects than what worldly men can behold. He aſſumes a higher character. He liſtens to the voice of nature and of God; and from this holy ſanctuary comes forth with a mind fortified againſt the little diſturbances of the world. Such habits, therefore cannot be too much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the lovers of tranquillity, as powerful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidiary means for attaining that happy ſtate.</p>
            <p>I have thus pointed out what appears to me the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of religion and wiſdom for tranquillity of mind. <hi>He that doth theſe things ſhall never be moved.</hi> During the early periods of life, vivid ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pleaſure are the ſole objects thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of purſuit. Mere eaſe and calmneſs are deſpiſed, as the portion of the aged only and the feeble. Some longer acquaintance with the world, with its diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hopes and fallacious pleaſures, teaches almoſt all men, by degrees, to wiſh for tranquillity and peace. But you muſt not imagine, that theſe are bleſſings which will drop on men of their own accord, as ſoon as they begin to deſire them. No: the thoughtleſs, and the profligate, will ever remain ſtrangers to them. They will remain the ſport of every accident that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to derange their minds, and to diſturb their life. —The three great enemies to tranquillity are, Vice, Superſtition, and Idleneſs: Vice which poiſons and diſturbs the mind with bad paſſions; Superſtition, which fills it with imaginary terrors; Idleneſs, which loads it with tediouſneſs and diſguſt. It is only by following the path which Eternal Wiſdom has pointed out, that we can arrive at the bleſſed temple of Tranquillity, and obtain a ſtation there: By doing, or at leaſt endeavouring to do, our duty to God and man; by acquiring a humble truſt in the mercy and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:028306_0158_0FD8958779C513E8"/>favour of God through Jeſus Chriſt; by cultivating our minds, and properly employing our time and thoughts; by governing our paſſions and our temper; by correcting all unreaſonable expectations from the world, and from men; and, in the midſt of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſs, habituating ourſelves to calm retreat and ſerious recollection.—By ſuch means as theſe, it may be hoped, that, through the divine bleſſing, our days ſhall flow in a ſtream as unruffled as the human ſtate admits. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea, when it cannot reſt. But the work of righteouſneſs is peace; and the effect of righteouſneſs is quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi>

            <p>HOW many complains do we hear from every quarter, of the miſery and diſtreſs that fill the world! In theſe the high and the low, the young and the aged, join; and ſince the beginning of time, no topic has been more fertile of declamation, than the
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:028306_0159_0FD89589F80946A0"/>vanity and vexation which man is appointe to ſuffer. But are we certain that this vexation, and this vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is altogether to be aſcribed to the appointment of heaven? Is there no g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to ſuſpect that man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the chief and immediate author of his own ſufferings? What the text plainly ſuggeſts is, that it is common for men to complain groundleſly of Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence; that they are prone to accuſe God for the evils of life, when in reaſon they ought to accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and that after their <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> hath <hi>perverted their way,</hi> and made them undergo the conſequences of their own miſconduct, they impiouſly <hi>fret in heart againſt the Lord.</hi> This is the doctrine which I now purpoſe to illuſtrate, in order to ſilence the ſceptic, and to check a repining and irreligious ſpirit. I ſhall for this end make ſome obſervations, firſt, on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and next, upon the internal, condition of man; and then conclude with ſuch ſerious and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful improvement as the ſubject will naturally ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us conſider the external condition of man. We find him placed in a world where he has by no means the diſpoſal of the events that happen. Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities ſometimes beſal the worthieſt and the beſt, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is leſt them, but to acknowledge and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the high hand of Heaven. For ſuch viſitations of trial, many good and wiſe reaſons can be aſſigned, which the preſent ſubject leads me not to diſcuſs. But though thoſe unavoidable calamities make a part yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and ſorrows that diſtreſs human life. A multitude of evils beſet us. for the ſource of which we muſt look to another quarter. — No ſooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumſtances of men, gone croſs to their wiſh, than they begin to talk of the unequal diſtribution of the good things of this life; they envy
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:028306_0160_0FD8958BFAA7CEE0"/>the condition of others, they repine at their own lot, and fret againſt the Ruler of the world.</p>
            <p>Full of theſe ſentiments, one man pines under a broken conſtitution. But let us aſk him, whether he can, fairly and honeſtly aſſign no cauſe for this but the unknow decree of heaven? Has he duly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the bleſſing of health, and always obſerved the rules of virtue and ſobriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his pleaſures; If now he be only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, as if he were ſuffering unjuſtly? Were you to ſurvey the chambers of ſickneſs and diſtreſs, you would find them peopled with the victim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and ſenſuality, and with the children of vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indolence and ſloth. Among the thouſands who languiſh there, you would find the proportion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſufferers to be ſmall. You would ſee faded youth, premature old age, and the proſpect of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely grave; to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought thoſe evils on themſelves; while yet theſe martyrs of vice and folly have the aſſurance to arraign the hard fate of man, and to <hi>fret againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you, perhaps, complain of hardſhips of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind; of the injuſtice of the world; of the poverty which you ſuffer, and the diſcouragements under which you labour; of the croſſes and diſappointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you give too much ſcope to your diſcontent, let me diſires you to reflect impartially upon your paſt train of life. Have not ſloth, or pride, or ill temper, or ſinful paſſions, miſled you often from the path of ſound and wiſe conduct? Have you not been wanting to yourſelves in improving thoſe opportunities which Providence offered you, for bettering and advancing
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:028306_0161_0FD8958D7B4FF9A8"/>your ſtate? If you have choſen to indulge your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or your taſte, in the gratifications of indolence or pleaſure, can you complain becauſe others, in pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence to you, have obtained thoſe advantages which naturally belong to uſeful labours, and honourable purſuits? Have not the conſequences of ſome falſe ſteps, into which your paſſions, or, your pleaſures, have betrayed you, purſued you through much of your life; tanted, perhaps, your character, involved you in embaraſſments or ſunk you into neglect?—It is an old ſaying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world ſeldom turns wholly againſt a man, unleſs through his own fault. <hi>Godlineſs is,</hi> in general, <hi>profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all things</hi> Virtue, diligence and induſtry, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the ſureſt road to proſperity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of ſucceſs is far oftener ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered inſuperable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being fickle and changeable, are diſtruſted by all.—The caſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is, that men ſeek to aſcribe their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to any cauſe, rather than to their own miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and when they can deviſe no other cauſe, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they <hi>fret againſt the Lord.</hi> They are doubly unjuſt towards God. In their proſperity, they are apt to aſcribe their ſucceſs to their own diligence, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to God's bleſſing; and in their adverſity, they impute their diſtreſſes to his providence, not to their own miſbehaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very reverſe of this. <hi>Every good and every perfect gift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:028306_0162_0FD8958F4C370F58"/>from above;</hi> and of evil and miſery, man is the author to himſelf.</p>
            <p>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public ſtate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this aſſertion. We ſee great ſocieties of men torn in pieces by inteſtine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions, tumults, and civil commotions. We ſee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, againſt each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils theſe are, to which this miſerable world is expoſed.—But are theſe evils, I beſeech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who ſent forth ſlaught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with maſſacres and blood? Are theſe miſeries any other, than the bitter fruit of mens violent and diſorderly paſſions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the turbulence of the people?— Let us ſay them entirely out of the account, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Providence; and let us think only of the <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men.</hi> Did man controul his paſſions, and form his conduct according to the dictates of wiſdom, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and virtue, the earth would no longer be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated by cruelty; and human ſocieties would live in order, harmony and peace. In thoſe ſcenes of miſchief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with ſhame, the picture of his vices, his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own <hi>perverſeneſs;</hi> but let not <hi>his heart fret againſt the Lord.</hi>—From the external condition, let us proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider the internal ſtate of man. It is certain that much diſquiet and miſery may be found there, although his outward condition appear undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, and eaſy. As far as this inward diſquietude
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:028306_0163_0FD89590807DC738"/>ariſes from the ſtings of conſcience, and the horrors of guilt, there can be no doubt of its being ſelf-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated miſery; which it is altogether impoſſible to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to Heaven. But even, when great crimes, and deep remorſe, are not the occaſions of torment, how often is poiſon infuſed into the moſt flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of fortune, by the follies and the paſſions of the proſperous? We ſee them peeviſh and reſtleſs; corrupted with luxury, and enervated by eaſe; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the ſmalleſt diſappointment oppreſſed with low ſpirits, and complaining of every thing around them. How many <hi>Hamans, Hazaels,</hi> and <hi>Herods,</hi> are there in the world, who, from that they ſuffer within, paſs their days in more vexation and miſery, than they who undergo the hardſhips of poverty? Dare ſuch men, in their moſt diſcontented moments, charge the providence of Heaven with miſeries of their own procuring? Providence had put into their hands the faireſt opportunity of paſſing their life with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. But they themſelves blaſted every comfort that was offered; and verified the prediction, that <hi>the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. i. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As it is man's own <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> which ruins his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, we muſt not omit to remark, that it is the ſame cauſe which aggravates and embitters his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. That you ſuffer from the external afflictions of the world, may often be owing to God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but when, in the midſt of theſe, you alſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the diſorders of your mind and paſſions, this is owing to yourſelves; and they are thoſe inward diſorders which add the ſevereſt ſting to external af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Many are the reſources of a good and a wiſe man, under all the diſaſters of life. In the midſt of them, it is always in his power to enjoy
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:028306_0164_0FD89591F9A90450"/>peace of mind, and hope in God. He may ſuffer; but under ſuffering he will not ſink, as long as all is ſound within. But when the ſpirit has been wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by guilt and folly, its wounds open, and bleed afreſh, upon every blow that is received from the world. The mind becomes ſenſible and ſore to the ſlighteſt injuries of fortune; and a ſmall reverſe is felt as an inſupportable calamity.</p>
            <p>On the whole; the farther you ſearch into human life, and the more you obſerve the manners and the conduct of men, you will be the more convinced of this great truth, that of the diſtreſſes which abound in the world, we are the chief authors. Among the multitudes who are, at this day, bewailing their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and lot, it will be found to hold of far the greater part, that they are reaping the <hi>fruit of their own doings; their iniquities are reproving them, and their backſlidings correcting them.</hi> Unattainable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fooliſhly purſued, intemperate paſſions nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vicious pleaſures and deſires indulged, God and God's holy laws forgotten; theſe, theſe are the great ſcourges of the world; the great cauſes of the life of man being ſo embroiled and unhappy. God hath ordained our ſtate on earth to be a mixed and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate. We have ourſelves to blame for its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an inſupportable one. If it bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to us but vexation and vanity, we have ſown the ſeeds of that vanity and vexation; and as we have ſown, we muſt reap.—I now proceed to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of thoſe truths which we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, let us be taught, to look upon ſin as the ſource of all our miſeries. It may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſſume the gentler names of folly, irregularity, or levity; but under whatever form it appears, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imports a deviation from that ſacred law which
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:028306_0165_0FD89593C127AB68"/>ought to regulate our conduct. It is ſtill the <hi>root that beareth gall and wormwood;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxix. 18.</note> and in exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the quantity of this poiſonous weed, which we ourſelves have infuſed into our cup, we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to drink the waters of bitterneſs. If the <hi>fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man</hi> did not <hi>pervert his ways,</hi> his heart would have no occaſion to <hi>fret againſt the Lord.</hi> He would enjoy competent ſatisfaction in every ſituation of life; and under its unavoidable evils, would derive conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from religion and virtue.—Indeed, of every evil which we now endure, of thoſe evils which we look upon to be the appointment of providence, as well as of others, ſin is ultimately the cauſe; as it was man's revolt from God, which gave riſe original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe evils, and which rendered the chaſtiſements we undergo, in this ſtate of diſcipline, neceſſary, even for the <hi>ſons of God.</hi>—But at preſent, we confine our obſervation to thoſe miſeries of which men are the immediate procurers to themſelves; and from them alone, we find ſufficient reaſon to conſider ſin as the capital foe to man; as the great troubler and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, as the hidden ſnake lurking among the graſs, from whoſe fatal touch we muſt fly in haſte, if we would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience its ſting.—Too many have no juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of this danger. <hi>Fools,</hi> ſaid the wiſe man <hi>make a mock at ſin.</hi> A fool indeed he muſt be, who dares to think lightly of it. He ſhows not only the depravity of his heart, but, what perhaps he will be
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:028306_0166_0FD8959680EAF088"/>more aſhamed to be charged with, he ſhows his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the world. He ſhows that he knows not, he underſtands not, even his worldly intereſt, nor the intereſt and happineſs of human ſociety.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, let us learn from what has been ſet forth, one of the moſt awful and important of all truths, the reality of a divine government exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed over the world. Blind muſt that man be, who diſcerns not the moſt ſtriking marks of it, in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which has been under our review. If there be a ſceptic, who contends, that unreſtrained liberty in the gratification of deſire is given to man; that in the ſight of his Creator, all actions are equal; and that no rule of moral conduct hath been preſcribed, or by any penalty enforced; in order to confute ſuch a man, we have not recourſe to reaſonings, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply appeal to plain and obvious facts. We bid him look only to the life of man; and take notice how every vice, is by the conſtitution of things, connected with miſery. We bid him trace the hiſtory of any one, with whoſe conduct he had particular occaſion to be acquainted; and obſerve, whether the chief misfortunes which purſued him were not brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by his own miſbehaviour. We bid him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark in the hiſtory of nations, whether public virtue has not always exalted them; and whether licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and crimes have not paved the way for their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Theſe are teſtimonies to the truth of religion, which cannot by any ſophiſtry be evaded. This is a voice, which ſpeaks its warnings loud and ſtrong to every heart.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem upon which the divine government at preſent proceeds, plainly is, that mens <hi>own wickedneſs</hi> ſhould be appointed to <hi>correct them;</hi> that ſinners ſhould <hi>be ſnared in the work of their hands, and ſunk in the pit which themſelves had digged: that the backſlider in heart
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:028306_0167_0FD89597FB0A8850"/>ſhould be ſilled with his own ways.</hi>—Of all the plan; which could have been deviſed for the government of the world, this approves itſelf to reaſon, as the wiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t and moſt worthy of God; ſo to frame the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things, that the divine laws ſhould in a manner execute themſelves, and carry their ſanctions in their own boſom. When the vices of men require puniſhment to be inflicted, the Almighty is at no loſs for miniſters of juſtice. A thouſand inſtruments of vengeance are at his command; innumerable arrows are always in his quiver. But ſuch is the profound wiſdom of his plan, that no peculiar interpoſals of power are requiſite. He has no occaſion to ſtep from his throne, and to interrupt the order of nature. With that Majeſty and ſolemnity which befits om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, He pronounces, <hi>Ephraim is joined to his, idols; let him alone;</hi>

They lift the ſcourge; and with every ſtroke which they inflict on the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal, they mix this ſevere admonition, that as he is only reaping the fruit of his own actions, he deſerves all that he ſuffers.—From what has been ſaid, I might take occaſion,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, to ſhow the injuſtice of our charging Providence with a promiſcuous and unequal diſtribution of its favours, among the good and the bad. That unequal diſtribution takes place in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance only, not in reality. The whole conduct of Providence ſufficiently marks, which of thoſe claſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of men it bleſſes and protects. The proſperity of ſinners is no more than a deceitful ſhow. The great materials of happineſs are provided for the virtuous; and <hi>evil</hi> never faits to <hi>purſue the wicked.</hi> I ſhall cloſe the diſcourſe with obſerving,</p>

In the <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt place, the neceſſity which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſes from our preſent condition, of looking up to God for direction and aid, in the conduct of life. The reſult of the whole doctrine I have now deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, that man's happineſs or miſery is, in a great meaſure, put into his own hands.

            </epigraph>
            <p>RIGHTEOUSNESS and ſin are, in this book of Proverbs. frequently contraſted with each other, and the advantages of the former diſplayed. The righteous man in ſhown to be <hi>more excellent than his neighbour,</hi> as <hi>the ways in which he walks are ways of pleaſantneſs,</hi> while <hi>the way of tranſgreſſors is hard.</hi> Honour is repeſented as attending the one, while ſhame is the portion of the other. The path of the one leads to life; that of the other to diſtruction. In the text, an advantage of righteouſneſs is ſpecified, which is not commonly attended to, and which ſome will not readily allow that it poſſeſſes. We are told by the wiſe man, that it affords light and direction to conduct, and will prove our beſt guide through all the intricacies of life. <hi>The integrity of the upright ſhall guide them;</hi> or, as it is added, to the ſame purpoſe, in a following verſe, <hi>the righteouſneſs of the perfect ſhall direct his way.</hi> There are many who will admit, that integrity is an amiable quality; that it is entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:028306_0170_0FD8959C7ACBA2C0"/>to much reſpect, and in moſt caſes ought to influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our behaviour; who nevertheleſs are unwilling to allow it the chief place in the direction of their worldly conduct. They hold, that a certain artful ſagacity, founded upon knowledge of the world, is the beſt conductor of every one, who would be a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful adventurer in life; and that a ſtrict attention to integrity, as his only guide, would often lead him into danger and diſtreſs. In oppoſition to tenets of this kind, I now purpoſe to ſhow, that amidſt all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and dangers, there is no guide we can chuſe ſo ſafe, and ſo ſucceſsful on the whole, as the integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an upright mind; and that upon every trying occaſion, principles of probity and honour will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct a good man through life with more advantage, than if he were to act upon the moſt refined ſyſtem of worldly wiſdom.</p>
            <p>It will not take much time to delineate the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and eaſily underſtood. He is one, who makes it his conſtant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his conſcience, point it out to him. He is not guided merely by affections, which may ſometimes give the colour of virtue to a looſe and unſtable character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determins him to ſteem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is baſe and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence you find him ever the ſame; at all times, the truſty friend, the affectionate relation, the conſcientious man of buſineſs, the pious worſhipper, the public ſpirited citizen. He aſſumes no borrowed appearance. He ſeeks no maſk to cover him; for he acts no ſtudied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art; but he is in truth what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his purſuits,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:028306_0171_0FD8959E03B0EE58"/>he knows no path but the fair and direct one; and would much rather fail of ſucceſs, than attain it by reproachful means. He never ſhows you a ſmiling countenance, while he mediates evil againſt you in his heart. He never praiſes you among your friends; and then joins in traducing you among your enemies. You will never find one part of his character at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with another. In his manners, he is ſimple and unaffected; in all his proceedings, open and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.—Such is the man of integrity ſpoken of in the text. Let us now proceed to ſhow, in what manner, and with what effect, integrity ſerves for the guide of his life.</p>
            <p>Every one, who has begun to make any progreſs in the world, will be ſenſible, that to conduct him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in human affairs with wiſdom and propriety, is often a matter of no ſmall difficulty. Amidſt that variety of characters, of jarring diſpoſitions, and of interfering intereſts, which take place among thoſe with whom we have intercourſe, we are frequently at a ſtand, as to the part moſt prudent for us to chuſe. Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what is paſſing in the breaſts of thoſe around us, we can form no more than doubtful conjectures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the events that are likely to happen. They may take ſome turn altogether different from the courſe in which we had imagined they were to run, and according to which we had formed our plans. The ſlighteſt incident often ſhoots out into import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant conſequences, of which we were not aware. The labyrinth becomes ſo intricate, that the moſt ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous can lay hold on no clue to guide him through it: He finds himſelf embarraſſed, and at a loſs how to act.—In public and in private life, in managing our own concerns, and in directing thoſe of others, the doubt ſtarted by the Wiſe man frequently occurs; <hi>Who knoweth what is good for man in this life?</hi>—While
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:028306_0172_0FD8959F82311C88"/>thus fatigued with conjecture, we remain perplexed and undetermined in our choice; we are at the ſame time pulled to different ſides, by the various emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which belong to our nature. On one hand, pleaſure allures us to what is agreeable; on the other, intereſt weighs us down towards what ſeems gainful. Honour attracts us towards what is ſplendid; and indolence inclines us to what is eaſy. In the conſultations which we hold with our own mind, concerning our conduct, how often are we thus divided within ourſelves; puzzled by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of future events, and diſtracted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of different inclinations?</p>
            <p>It is in ſuch ſituations as theſe, that the principle of integrity interpoſes to give light and direction. While worldly men fluctuate in the midſt of thoſe perplexities which I have deſcribed, the virtuous man has one Oracle, to which he reſorts in every dubious caſe, and whoſe deciſions he holds to be infallible: He couſults his conſcience. He liſtens to the voice of God. Were it only on a few occaſions that this Oracle could be conſulted, its value would be leſs. But it is a miſtake to imagine, that its Reſponſes are ſeldom given. Hardly is there any material tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever in human life, any important queſtion, that holds us in ſuſpence as to practice, but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between right and wrong will ſhow itſelf; and the principle of integrity will, if we liſten to it impartially, give a clear deciſion. Whenever the mind is divided within itſelf, conſcience is ſeldom or never neutral. There is always one ſide or other to which it leans. There is always one ſcale of the balance, into which it throws the weight of <hi>ſome vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; or ſome praiſe:</hi> of ſomething that is <hi>juſt and true lovely, honeſt, and of good report.</hi> Theſe are the forms, which to the obſervation of the upright man. By
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:028306_0173_0FD895A1000DBF88"/>others they may be unſeen or overlooked; but in his eye, the luſtre of virtue outſhines all other brightneſs, Wherever this pole ſtar directs him, he ſteadily holds his courſe.—Let the iſſue of that courſe be ever ſo uncertain; let his friends differ from him in opinion; let his enemies clamour; he is not moved; his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is fixed. He aſks but one queſtion of his heart, what is the moſt worthy and honourable part; what is the part moſt becoming the ſtation which he poſſeſſes, the character which he wiſhes to bear the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which good men entertain of him? Being once decided as to this, he heſitates no more. He ſhuts his ears againſt every ſolicitation. He purſues the direct line of integrity, without <hi>turning either to the right hand or to the left.</hi>
               <q>It is the Lord who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth. Him I follow. Let him order what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in his ſight.</q>—It is in this manner that the <hi>integrity of the upright</hi> acts as <hi>their guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as, upon a ſuperficial view, it may appear haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous to place ourſelves entirely under ſuch a guide, let us now proceed to conſider what can be ſaid in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of this plan of conduct, and what advantages ſerve to recommend it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, I affirm, that the guidance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity is the ſafeſt under which we can be placed; that the road in which it leads us is, upon the whole, the freeſt from dangers. Perfect immunity from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is not to be expected in this life. We can choſe no path, in which we may not meet with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and misfortunes. Our life, at the beſt, is a pilgrimage, and perils ſurround it. Againſt theſe perils, the men of the world imagine that craft and dexterity furniſh the beſt defence; and if, in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, they over-reach the upright, they conſider it as a manifeſt deciſion in favour of their plan. But inſtead of reſting on a few inſtances, let us take an
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:028306_0174_0FD895A28843F398"/>extenſive ſurvey of the courſe of human affairs. Let us enquire who the perſons are that, in all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lines of life, have gone through the world with moſt ſucceſs; and we ſhall find, that the men of prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and honour form by far the moſt conſiderable part of the liſt; we ſhall find that men of plain under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, acting upon fair and direct views, have much oftener proſpered, than men of the deepeſt policy, who were devoid of principle. How few are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perſons who by fidelity, worth, and ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt adherence to their duty, have either loſt their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or incurred general diſpleaſure, in times when human affairs were proceeding in their ordinary train? But how numerous and frequent are the examples of thoſe whoſe proſpects have been blaſted, whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have been ruined, and their names ſunk into contempt by vice and diſhoneſty?</p>
            <p>The man of the world aims at higher things, and more rapid ſucceſs, than the man of moderation and virtue. But at the ſame time, he incurs greater riſques and dangers. No calculation of probabilities can enſure ſafety to him who is acting a deceitful part. Amidſt the unforeſeen viciſſitudes of the world, he has to dread, not only diſappointment to his plans, but the miſeries alſo which detected fallacies may bring on his dead. He walks on the edge of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, where a ſingle falſe ſtep may be fatal. He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a wandering light, which, if it fail of guiding him by a ſhort path to the Palace of ambition, lands him in the pit, or the lake. Whereas he who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the guidance of integrity, walks in the high road on which the light of the ſun ſhines. He ſees before him the Habitation of peace to which his ſteps are directed; and if he be longer of arriving at it, he is
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:028306_0175_0FD895A4CDDC6A88"/>ſure of neither wandering far aſtray, nor of meeting on his road with any forms of unuſual terror.— Let it be always remembered that the principle of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity which directs a good man, is far from exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding prudence in the conduct of life. It implies no improvident or thoughtleſs ſimplicity. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is cloſely connected with true wiſdom. A man of enlarged capacity, and extenſive views, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upright. Craft is merely the ſupplement of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior abilities. It characterizes a narrow compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and a little mind.—As the path of integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is on the whole the ſafeſt path of conduct; ſo,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, it is unqueſtionably the moſt honourable. Integrity is the foundation of all that is high in character among mankind. Other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may add to its ſplendor; but if this eſſential re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite be wanting, all their luſtre fades. Were I drawing the character of one who claimed the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the world; and after I had aſcribed to him eloquence, valour, and every endowment that is moſt ſhining and captivating, did I add, that he was a man of too much art to be truſted, I appeal to every one, whether, by this ſingle ſtroke, the whole character would not be ſunk and degraded? An intereſted and crafty man may perhaps riſe into influence and high ſtation; he may be a rich and a powerful, but will never be a great, man. He may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eared, and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally honoured and courted; but in the ſecret thoughts of men he finds no reſpect. We all feel, that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous ſentiments cannot dwell in the ſame breaſt with ſelfiſhneſs and deceit.</p>
            <p>He who reſts upon an internal principle of virtue and honour, will act with a dignity and a boldneſs, of which they are incapable who are wholly guided by intereſt. He is above thoſe timid ſuſpicions, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:028306_0176_0FD895A6927CBA20"/>reſtraints, which fetter and embarraſs their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. That firmneſs which the conſciouſneſs of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in ſpirits, gives vigour and force to his exertions on every great occaſion. It adds double weight to all the abilities of which he is poſſeſt. It even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the place of thoſe abilities in which he is defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. They who oppoſe him are obliged to honour him. They look up to him with a ſecret awe, as to one who moves above them in a ſuperior ſphere; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their good or ill opinion, of their prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes or their threatenings; like one of thoſe celeſtial luminaries which holds its courſe through its orbit, without being affected by any commotions among the elements below. Such a man is truſted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon, as well as eſteemed, becauſe all know where to find him, and upon what ſyſtem he acts. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taches friends and followers to himſelf, without court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and though his progreſs towards fame ſhould be ſlow, and interrupted at firſt by crooked arts, it is nevertheleſs certain and ſure. The public may be miſled for a while, in judging of real merit; but it is ſeldom unjuſt at the laſt. As perſons continue to come forward to view, and to act their part in trying circumſtances, their characters are at length ſully aſcertained; and, almoſt always, rated as they deſerve. How corrupt ſoever the world may be, they cannot with hold approbation from him, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is marked by unifor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> integrity and honour. Enemies he will have; but the public favours him; the multitude of men wiſh him ſucceſs; and deſtine him, in their thoughts, to every ſtep of his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before he arrives at it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, the plan of conduct, on which the man of integrity proceeds is the moſt comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that is, attended with the great at ſatisfaction in a man's own mind. Amidſt the various and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:028306_0177_0FD895A7BB994F18"/>events of life, it is of ſingular advantage to be kept free from doubt, as to the part moſt proper to be choſen. He who conſults nothing but worldly intereſt muſt, upon every turn of fortune, undergo much painful ſuſpence. He is obliged to liſten with anxious ear to every whiſper of report; and upon every new aſpect which the face of affairs aſſumes, muſt ſtudy how to place himſelf in a new poſture of defence. But the man of principle is a ſtranger to theſe inward troubles. His time is not loſt; nor his temper fretted by long and anxious conſultations. One light always ſhines upon him from above. One path, the path of integrity, always opens clear and diſtinct to his view.—But this is not his only advantage, to be freed from embarraſſments, by having placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the charge of one conſtant guide. He is alſo rewarded with the ſenſe of having choſen his guide well and wiſely. He is delivered from all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upbraidings, from all miſgivings of mind, from all alarms founded on the dread of diſcovery and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. A good conſcience enables him to look back on the part which he has acted with ſatisfaction; and to look forward to the iſſue which it may bring, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concern. It is in the caſe of one iſſue only, that the man who acts from worldy intereſt can enjoy ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction; that is when his deſigns have ſucceeded according to his wiſh. But it is the felicity of the man who acts under the direction of integrity, that in every iſſue, he has ſomething to comfort him. Though ſucceſs has failed him, the conſolation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of having done his duty, and ſtudied to approve himſelf to God.</p>
            <p>This reference of all his actions to divine appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, furniſhes another ſource of ſatisfaction and peace. He looks up, with pleaſing hope, to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector in the heavens, who <hi>loveth righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:028306_0178_0FD895A944A6CBC0"/>whoſe countenance beholdeth the upright.</hi> The man of worldly wiſdom is conſcious of having no title to the favour of that high adminiſtration which rules the univerſe. By quitting the path of righteouſneſs he has left that ſtraight road, in which God had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to walk. He has taken the direction of his way to himſelf; and choſen to be his own guide and maſter. To his own abilities, therefore, ſuch as they are, he muſt truſt; and is become wholly reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the iſſue of his conduct. But the man of virtue hath <hi>committed his way to the Lord.</hi> He follows the divine ſignal. He co-operates with the divine purpoſe. The power which ſways the univerſe is engaged on his ſide. By natural conſequence, he has ground to expect, that any ſeeming diſappointments which he may now incur, ſhall be over-ruled at the end to ſome ſalutary effect. Hence, that <hi>peace of God keeping the heart,</hi> to which worldly men are ſtrangers Hence a degree of firmneſs and reſolution in conduct, which it is impoſſible for them to poſſeſs. Eſpecially when we add,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt place, that he who thus purſues a courſe of integrity, has always in his view the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of immortal rewards. That ſurely is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt direction of conduct, which is moſt amply recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed at laſt. But what recompenſe can worldly wiſdom beſtow, comparable to what is promiſed by the goſpel to them who, <hi>by patient continuance in well doing, look for glory, honour, and immortality?</hi>—The recompenſe indeed is diſtant; but the hope of it is preſent; and hope is one of the moſt powerful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of human action. Let a man be firm in the belief that he is acting under the immediate protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, and that through all eternity he ſhall be rewarded for what he now performs; and, as far as this belief is prevalent, his conduct will be ſteady
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:028306_0179_0FD895ABB5D69F90"/>and determined. Wherever religion directs him to hold his courſe, he will advance with intrepidity. He will ſubmit to reſtraints without reluctance. He will meet dangers without fear. To every motive which reaſon ſuggeſts in favour of virtue, the hope of life eternal adds ſupernatural ſtrength.—Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, in the behaviour of many holy men under the moſt trying circumſtances of diſtreſs, we behold this effect eminently exemplified. It appears, with much luſtre, in the ſpirited and magnanimous ſentiments of the Apoſtle Paul, when he had the proſpect of death before him. <hi>Behold I go bound in the Spirit to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there, ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth that bonds and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I may fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh my courſe with joy.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſhow in what manner the <hi>integrity of the upright guides them;</hi> and what the advantages are of placing ourſelves under its guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. If it be the line of ſafety, or the line of honour, which we chuſe to purſue; if we conſult our preſent comfort, or look forward to future rewards; in all theſe reſpects, the courſe which integrity points out is by far the moſt eligible.</p>
            <p>It is a great recommendation of the guidance offered to us by integrity, that it is eaſily underſtood by all men. Plans of worldly policy are deep and intricate; and experience ſhows how often the ableſt perſons are
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:028306_0180_0FD895AD076FA408"/>miſtaken in the meaſures which they adopt for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on. But when men's intentions are fair and upright, it will be found, that a moderate ſhare of underſtanding and attention is all that is requiſite, for conducting themſelves with ſafety and propriety. Providence never intended, that the art of living hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily in this world ſhould depend on that deep pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, that acute ſagacity, and thoſe refinements of thought, which few poſſeſs. It has dealt more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly with us; and made happineſs to depend on uprightneſs of intention, much more than on extent of capacity. For the moſt part, the firſt ſentiment which ſtrikes a good man, concerning what he ought or ought not to do, is the ſoundeſt, and ſuggeſts the beſt and wiſeſt counſel. When he heſitates, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to deliberate how far his duty, or his honour, can be reconciled to what ſeems his intereſt, he is on the point of deviating into a dangerous path.—At the ſame time, it is of great conſequence, that he who ſeeks to ſurrender his conduct to the direction of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, ſhould be well apprized of what true integrity requires. Let him guard againſt burdening conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unneceſſarily; leſt a ſuperſtitious regard to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles lead him to relax in matters of higher obligation. Let him avoid minute ſcrupuloſity, on the one hand. Let him keep at a diſtance from looſe caſuiſtry, on the other. But when he is ſatisfied that his conſcience has been well informed, let him, without wavering, adhere to its dictates in the whole of his conduct. This will prove the trueſt wiſdom both for this world and the next. For <hi>he who walketh uprightly walketh ſurely. The path of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>FEW ſubjects of religions exhortation are of more general concern than thoſe which reſpect the diſtreſſes incident to human life. For no ſociety, no family, no perſon, can expect to be long exempted from them; and when we ſpeak of the proſperous, we can only mean thoſe who are more rarely ſubject to them than others. Now, under thoſe diſtreſſes, religion performs two offices: It teaches us how we ought to bear them; and it aſſiſts us in thus bearing them. Materials for both are found in the words of the text, which contain a ſentiment ſo natural and juſt, as to carry conviction to every reaſonable mind. They were the words of Job, at a time when, to his other calamities, this domeſtic affliction was added, that one, who ought to have aſſuaged and ſoothed his ſorrows, provoked his indignation by an impious ſpeech. <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt,</hi> Job replies, <hi>as one of the fooliſh women ſpeaketh: What? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi>—Three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions naturally ariſe from the text: Firſt, That this life is a mixed ſtate of good and evil: Secondly,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:028306_0182_0FD895B02AE5C7F0"/>That both the goods and the evils in it proceed from God: And, thirdly, That there are juſt reaſons for our receiving with patience the evils of life, from the ſame hand which beſtows its goods.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This life is a mixed ſtate of good and evil. This is a matter of fact, which will be denied by none, and on which it is not neceſſary to beſtow much illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration. It is evident to the ſlighteſt inſpection, that nothing here is unallayed and pure. Every man's ſtate is checquered with alternate griefs and joys, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and ſucceſs. No condition is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtable. No life preſerves always the ſame tenor. The viciſſitudes of the world ſometimes bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the afflicted into comfortable circumſtances; and often trouble the joy of the proſperous. This is the train in which human affairs have ever been found to proceed; and in which we may expect them always to go on.</p>
            <p>But though this be univerſally admitted in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and often confeſſed in diſcourſe, the misfortune is, that few think of applying it to their own caſe. The bulk of mankind diſcover as much confidence in proſperity, and as much impatience under the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, as if Providence had firſt given them aſſurance that their proſperity was never to change, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had cheated their hopes. Whereas, what reaſon ought to teach us, is, to adjuſt our mind to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate in which we find ourſelves placed; never to preſume, never to deſpair; to be thankful for the goods which at preſent we enjoy, and to expect the evils that may ſucceed.—Thou haſt been admitted to partake of the feaſt of life. Its good things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed. in various portions, among the gueſts. Thou haſt had thine allotted ſhare. Complain not, when thy portion is removed. It is not permitted to any, to remain always at the banquet.</p>

II. We are taught by the text, that both the goods and the evils which compoſe this mixed ſtate, come from the hand of God. A little reflection may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that, in God's world, neither good nor evil can happen by chance. If there were any one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which God quitted the reins of the univerſe, and ſuffered any power to interfere with his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is evident, that from that moment, the meaſures of his government muſt become disjointed and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. He who governs all things, muſt govern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; and govern the leaſt things as well as the greateſt. <hi>He never ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> There are no void ſpaces, no broken plans, in his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no bleſſings that drop upon us without his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; nor any croſſes that viſit us unſent by him. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none elſe. I form the light, and create darkneſs, I moke peace, and create evil. I the Lord do all theſe things.</hi>

            <p>How it has come to paſs, that this life ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a mixture of goods and evils, and that the mixture too ſhould be of God's appointment, gives riſe to a difficult inquiry. For how can any thing but what is good proceed from the God of love? Can darkneſs iſſue from the ſource of light? or can it be any ſatisfaction to the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> to behold the ſorrows of creatures whom he has made?—Here there was room for much perplexity, till revelation inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that the mixture of evils in man's eſtate is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to man himſelf. Had he continued as God ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally made him, he would have received nothing but good from his Creator. His apoſtaſy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption opened the gates of the taben ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> darkneſs. Miſery iſſued forth, and has ever ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>e purſued him. In the preſent condition of his nature, that miſery is
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:028306_0184_0FD87F83C5306650"/>partly puniſhment, partly trial. He is become inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bearing uninterrupted proſperity; and by the mixture of evils in his lot, merciful deſigns are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on for his improvement and reſtoration.</p>
            <p>What the text leads us at preſent to conſider is, the effect that will follow from imitating the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Job, and refering to the hand of the Almighty, the evils which we ſuffer, as well as the good, which we enjoy. Such a reference of the diſtreſsful events of our life to the appointment of Heaven, not only is a duty which piety requires, but tends alſo to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate diſtreſs, and to ſuggeſt conſolation. For to dwell, as is too commonly done, upon the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſubordinate means of our trouble, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the cauſe of much grief, and much ſin. When we view our ſufferings as proceeding merely from our fellow-creatures, the part which they have acted in bringing them upon us, is often more grating than the ſuffering itſelf. The unreaſonableneſs, perhaps, of an enemy, the treachery of a friend, the ingratitude or inſolence of one whom we had much obliged, add weight to a load laid upon us by means ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking. The thoughts of their malignity, or of our own neglect in guarding againſt it, ſerve to poiſon the ſore. Whereas, if inſtead of looking to men, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the croſs as coming from God, theſe aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circumſtances would effect us leſs; we would feel no more than our proper burden; we would ſubmit to it more patiently; and many reſources would open to us, as ſhall in a little be ſhown, from thinking of the hand that lays it on. Had Job, when deſpoiled of all his ſubſtance, thought of nothing but the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans and Sabeans who robbed him, with what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions would he have been tranſported, and with what eager deſires of revenge tormented? Whereas, conſidering them as rods and inſtruments
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:028306_0185_0FD895B3BB239278"/>only in the divine hand, and receiving the correction as from the Almighty himſelf, the tumult of his mind ſubſided; and with reſpectful compoſure he could ſay, <hi>The Lord gave; and the Lord hath taken away: Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> This leads me,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To conſider the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, and moſt important inſtruction, ariſing from the text; namely, that there are many reaſons why we, who receive good from the hand of God, ſhould receive with patience the evils which he is pleaſed to inflict. This is ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by that interrogatory form of ſpeech, in which the ſentiment of Job is expreſſed: <hi>What? ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive evil?</hi> In order to unfold all that is contained in this appeal made to every man's conſcience, let us conſider,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that the good things which God has beſtowed, afford ſufficient evidence for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that the evils which he ſends, are not cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly or wantonly inflicted. Did we live in a world which bore the marks of a malicious or cruel govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, there might be reaſon for diſtruſting every ſtep of his conduct. But in the world which we inhabit, we behold, on the contrary, plain marks of predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant goodneſs. We behold the ſtructure of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, the order of nature, the general courſe of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, obviouſly arranged with a benevolent regard to the welfare of men. All the art and contrivance of which the divine works are full, point to this end; and the more they are explored, create the firmer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the goodneſs of the Deity gave riſe to the ſyſtem of creation. What is the concluſion to be thence drawn, but that in ſuch parts of the divine adminiſtration as appear to us harſh and ſevere, the ſame goodneſs continues to preſide, though exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in a hidden and myſterious manner?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="unknown:028306_0186_0FD895B53A6D3EB0"/>
Let me deſire you to conſider, whether, if ſome powerful friend had placed you in an opulent and comfortable ſtation, and, in the general conduct of your affairs, had diſcovered the moſt diſintereſted kindneſs, you would not aſcribe any occaſional diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements you received, to ſome unknown reaſon or cauſe, rather than to his unfaithfulneſs or cruelty? Ought not the experience which we have had, and the diſcovery which all nature affords, of the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, lead us to put a like conſtruction on the evils which we ſuffer from a hand that hath ſo frequently loaded us with good?—Have we forgotten, in the midſt of our complaints, who brought us unto the light of day; who watched over our helpleſs infancy; who reared our growing childhood; and through ten thouſand ſurrounding dangers, has been our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and guardian until this day? How often has he reſcued us from ſickneſs and death, and made our hearts glad with unexpected comforts? Now, that ſome cloud is thrown over our proſperity, or ſome bleſſing withdrawn, in which for a time we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, can we imagine that there is no good cauſe for this change of his proceeding? Shall we ſuſpect that this nature is entirely altered? <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi> No, let us ſay with the Pſalmiſt. <hi>This is my infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; but I will remember the works of the Lord. I will remember the years of the right hand of the moſt High.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. lxxvii. ix. 10.</note>—One ſignal work of the moſt High, at leaſt, let us remember, and rejoice in the remembrance of it; even that final remedy which he has provided for all the evils occaſioned by ſin, in the redemption of the world accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>He who ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> will
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:028306_0187_0FD895B6C978F510"/>he, in any caſe, wantonly afflict the children of men with ſuperfluous and unneceſſary ſorrows? Is not this a proof ſo ſatisfactory, ſo expreſs and demonſtrative, of the gracious purpoſes of God, as ſhould diſpoſe us to take in good part, every thing which proceeds from him? Conſider,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, that the good things we receive from God are undeſerved, the evils we ſuffer are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly merited. Every reaſonable perſon muſt feel the weight of this conſideration, for producing patience and ſubmiſſion. For, though to ſuffer at any rate be grievous, yet to ſuffer unjuſtly, is doubly galling. Whereas, when one receives a mixed portion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the goods are above his deſerts, and the evils below his deſerts, to complain, in ſuch a caſe, is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; there is no more ground for being thankful. —All, it is true, have not deſerved evil equally. Yet all of us deſerve it moreor leſs; and to merit good at the hand of the Lord, is what none of us can pretend. At the beſt we are but <hi>unprofitable ſervants.</hi> Even this is more than we are entitled to claim. For if God were to <hi>enter into judgment</hi> with us, who could ſtand before him? who could juſtify himſelf in his ſight? When the moſt inoffenſive compare their conduct with God's holy law; when they reflect upon the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have omitted, and the actual guilt they have contracted, they will find more reaſon to accuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than to complain of the divine chaſtiſements. Whatever innocence any of us may plead, nay, whatever merit we may claim, with reſpect to men and the world, we ſuffer no more than what we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the Governor of the world; and of his diſpleaſure, we know that the wrath of man is no other than the inſtrument.</p>
            <p>Not only all of us have done evil, but, what ought to be particularly attended to, God has a juſt title to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:028306_0188_0FD895B84E2C0D40"/>puniſh us for it. Although a man know that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves puniſhment, yet he will not allow every one to inflict it. A child will ſubmit to his parents, a ſervant to his maſter, a ſubject to the magiſtrate, when he would not bear correction from another hand. But no parent can have ſo complete a right to author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity over his children, no maſter over his ſervants, no magiſtrate over his ſubjects, as the Almighty hath over us. When we were born, we brought nothing with us into God's world. During our continuance in it, we have lived on the good things which God was pleaſed to lend us; and of which, God and our own conſcience know that we have made but a ſorry improvement. When he thinks proper to take any of them away, no wrong is done us; for they were not ours. To have enjoyed them ſo long, was a favour. To enjoy them always, was what we neither deſerved, nor had any title to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, the good things which at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times we have received and enjoyed, are much greater than the evils which we ſuffer. Of this fact, I am ſenſible it will be difficult to perſuade the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But would they weigh, in a fair balance, the whole of their circumſtances, they would find it true. Whatever perſons feel at the preſent, makes ſo ſtrong an impreſſion upon them, as very commonly to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the memory of all the paſt. When one is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with ſome painful diſeaſe in his body, or wrung with ſome ſore diſtreſs of mind, every former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, at that moment, goes for nothing. Life is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in all its gloom. A dark cloud ſeems to hang over it; and it is reviled, as no other than a ſcene of wretchedneſs and ſorrow. But this is to be unjuſt to human life, as well as ungrateful to its author. —Let me only deſire you to think how many days,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:028306_0189_0FD87F8545488DE8"/>how many months, how many years, you have paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in health, and eaſe, and comfort; how many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable feelings you have had; how many friends you have enjoyed; how many bleſſings, in ſhort, of diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erent kinds you have taſted; and you will be forced to acknowledge, that more materials of thankſgiving preſent themſelves than of lamentation and complaint. —Theſe bleſſings, you will ſay, are paſt. But though paſt, ought they to be gone from your remembrance? Do they merit no place, in the comparative eſtimate of the goods and evils of your ſtate? Did you, could you expect, that in this mutable world, any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral joy was to laſt for ever? Has gratitude no influence to form your minds to a calm acquieſcence in your Benefactor's appointments? What can be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than to ſay. <q>Having in former times received ſo many good things from the hand of God, ſhall I not now, without murmuring, receive the few evils which it pleaſes him to ſend?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, not only the goods of life are upon the whole greater than its evils; but the evils which we ſuffer are ſeldom, or never, without ſome mixture of good. As there is no condition on earth of pure unmixed felicity, ſo there is none ſo miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to be deſtitute of every comfort. Entire and complete miſery, if ever it take place, is of our own procuring, not of God's ſending. None but the moſt groſs and atrocious ſinners can be in ſuch a ſituation, as to diſcover no ray of relief or hope. In the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary diſtreſſes of life, it is generally our own folly and and infirmity which, upon the loſs of ſome one bleſſing that we had highly prized, deprives us of ſatisfaction in all other things. Many of our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities are purely imaginary, and ſelf-created; ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from rivalſhip or competition with others, and from falſe opinions of the importance of objects, to
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:028306_0190_0FD895B9B984CAE0"/>which cuſtom and faſhion have annexed and idle val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue. Where theſe miſtaken opinions once corrected by reaſon, the evil would diſappear, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would reſume its place. With reſpect to thoſe calamities which are inflicted by God, his providence has made this wiſe and merciful conſtitution, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the firſt ſhock, the burden by degrees is lightened. Time brings a gentle and powerful opiate to all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. What is very violent cannot laſt long; and what laſts long we become accuſtomed to bear. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſituation that is permanent, at length is felt to be tolerable. The mind accomodates itſelf to it; and by degrees regains its uſual tranquillity. Hence the greateſt part of the evils of life are more terrible in the previous apprehenſion, than in the actual feeling; and it ſeldom happens but in one corner or other, ſomething is found on which the mind can lay hold for its relief.</p>
            <p>How many, for inſtance, do we behold around us, ſtraightened in their worldy circumſtances, and yet finding the means to live cheerfully, with poverty and peace in the ſame habitation? If we are deprived of friends whom we tenderly loved, are there not ſtill ſome remaining, from whom we may expect much comfort? If our bodies are afflicted with ſore diſeaſe, have we not reaſon to be thankful that our mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues vigorous and entire; that we are in a ſituation to look around us for whatever can afford us eaſe; and that after the decay of this frail and mouldering tab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernacle, we can look forward to a <hi>houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens?</hi>—In the midſt of all diſtreſſes, there remains to every ſincere Chriſtian, that mixture of pure and genuine conſolation, which ſprings from the promiſes and hopes of the goſpel. Conſider, I beſeech you, what a ſingularly happy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction this makes in your ſituation, beyond the ſtate
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:028306_0191_0FD895BB48F5D6A8"/>of thoſe who, under the various troubles of life, are left <hi>without hope, and without God in the world;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing to look t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the <hi>fifth</hi> and laſt place, as the evils which we ſuffer are thus eleviated by a mixture of good; ſo we have reaſon to believe, that the evils themſelves are, in many reſpects, good. When borne with patience and dignity, they improve and enoble our character. They bring into exerciſe ſeveral of the manly and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic virtues; and by the conſtancy and fidelity with which we ſupport our trials on earth, prepare us for the higheſt rewards in heaven.—It has always been found that the preſent conſtitution of human nature cannot bear uninterrupted proſperity, without being corrupted by it.

            <p>WHATEVER relates to the behaviour of men in their ſocial character, is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in religion. The duties which ſpring from that character, form many branches of the great law of charity, which is the favourite precept of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. They, therefore, who would ſeparate ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from a religious ſpirit, or who at moſt treat them as only the inferior parts of it, do a real injury to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They are miſtaken friends of piety, who, under the notion of exalting it, place it in a ſort of inſulated corner, disjoined from the ordinary affairs of the world, and the connections of men with one another. On the contrary, true piety influences them all. It acts as a vivifying ſpirit, which ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:028306_0194_0FD895C07A5D96E0"/>and enlivens, which rectifies and conducts them. It is no leſs friendly to men than zealous for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God; and by the generous affections which it nouriſhes, and the beneficent influence which it exerts on the whole of conduct, is fully vindicated from every reproach which the infidel would throw upon it.—In this view, I am now to diſcourſe on the nature and duties of virtuous friendſhip, as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with the true ſpirit of religion. It is a ſubject which the inſpired philoſopher, who is the author of this book of proverbs, has thought worthy of his repeated notice; and in many paſſages has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the higheſt elogiums on friendſhip among good men. <hi>As ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, ſo doth the ſweetneſs of a man's friend by hearty counſel. As iron ſharpeneth iron, ſo a man ſharpeneth the countenance of his friend. Make ſure of thy friend; for faithful are the wounds of a friend. A friend loveth at all times; and a brother is born for adverſity. There is a friend that ſticketh cloſer than a brother,—Thine own friend, and thy father's friend,</hi> it is ſaid in the text, <hi>forſake not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt begin the ſubject, by obſerving, that there are among mankind friendſhips of different kinds, or, at leaſt, connections which aſſume that name. When they are no more than confederacies of bad men, they ought to be called conſpiracies, rather than friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. Some bond of common intereſt, ſome league againſt the innocent and unſuſpecting, may have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them for a time. But they are held together only by a rope of ſand. At bottom they are all rivals, and hoſtile to one annother. Their friendſhip can ſubſiſt no longer than intereſt cements them. Every one looks with a jealous eye on his ſuppoſed friend; and watches the firſt opportunity to deſert, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray.</p>

Friendſhips too there are of a different kind, and of a more reſpectable nature, formed by the connection of political parties. It is not, pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When upon juſt and honourable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples this union is founded, it has proved, on vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous occaſions, favourable to the cauſe of liberty and good order among mankind. At the ſame time, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ready to be abuſed than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> name of public ſpirit, and a public cauſe. It is a name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which private intereſt is often ſheltered, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh deſigns are carried on.

            <p>It is not of ſuch friendſhips, whether of the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or the ſuſpicious kind, that I am now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but of private friendſhips, which grow nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of intereſted deſigns, nor party zeal; but which flow from that ſimilarity of diſpoſitions, that correſponding harmony of minds, which endears ſome perſon to our heart, and make us take as much part in his circumſtances, fortunes, and fate, as if they were our own. <hi>The ſoul of Jonathan was knit with the ſoul of David; and Jonathan loved him as his own ſoul.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Samuel xviii. 1.</note> Such friendſhips certainly are not unreal; and for the honour of human nature, it is to be hoped are not altogether unfrequent among mankind.— Happy it is, when they take root in our early years; and are engrafted on the ingenuous ſenſibility of
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:028306_0196_0FD895C43B3C6DC0"/>youth. Friendſhips then contracted, retain to the laſt a tenderneſs and warmth, ſeldom poſſeſſed by friendſhips that are formed in the riper periods of life. The remembrance of ancient and youthful connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons melts every human heart; and the diſſolution of of them is, perhaps, the moſt painful feeling to which we are expoſed here below.—But at whatever pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of life friendſhips are formed, as long as they continue ſincere and affectionate, they form, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, one of the greateſt bleſſings we can enjoy. By the pleaſing communication of all our ſentiments which they prompt, they are juſtly ſaid to double our pleaſures, and to divide our ſorrows. They give a brighter ſunſhine to the gay incidents of life; and they enlighten the gloom of its darker hours. <hi>A faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend,</hi> it is juſtly and beautifully ſaid, by one of the Apocryphal writers <hi>is the medicine of life.</hi>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> when to pour forth the heart to one whom we love and truſt, is the chief comfort, perhaps the only relief, we can enjoy. Miſerable is he who, ſhut up within the narrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of ſelfiſh intereſt, has no perſon to whom he can at all times, with full confidence, expand his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Since cordial friendſhip is ſo great a bleſſing to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, let us proceed to conſider what duties it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and by what methods it may be cultivated to moſt advantage. The fundamental qualities of true friendſhip are, conſtancy and fidelity. Without theſe material <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngredients, it is of no value. An incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant man is not capable of friendſhip. He may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have affections which occaſionally glow in his heart; which excite fondneſs for amiable qualities; or connect him with ſeeming attachment to one
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:028306_0197_0FD895C5C0C50968"/>whom he eſteems, or to whom he has been obliged. But after theſe feelings have laſted for a little, either fancied intereſt alienates him, or ſome new object at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts him; and he is no longer the ſame perſon to thoſe whom he once loved. A man of this inconſtant mind cannot be ſaid to have any mind at all. For where there is no fixedneſs of moral principle, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional feelings are of no value; mind is of no effect; and with ſuch perſons it is never deſirable to have any connection. Where conſtancy is wanting, there can be no fidelity, which is the other baſis of friendſhip. For all friendſhip ſuppoſes entire confidence and truſt; ſuppoſes the ſeal of ſecrecy to be inviolable; ſuppoſes promiſes and engagments to be ſacred; and no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of our own to be purſued, at the expenſe of our friend's honour. An inconſtant man, is deſpicable. A faithleſs man, is baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing neither conſtancy nor fidelity to be altogether wanting, ſtill however friendſhip is in haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of ſuffering from the follies, and unreaſonable humours, to which all of us are liable. It is to be regarded as a tender plant in an unfavourable foil, which in order to its flouriſhing, requires to be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and nurſed with care. The following directions may be of uſe for promoting its cultivation, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it from whatever might be apt to blaſt and wither it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, let me adviſe you not to expect perfection in any with whom you contract friendſhip. It holds in general, with reſpect to all worldy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, that the more moderate our expectations are, they are likely to be the more ſucceſsful. If, in any ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of life, we hope to poſſeſs complete happineſs, we may depend on receiving mortifications. If, in any perſon, we truſt to find nothing but perfection, we may be aſſured that, on longer acquaintance, we
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:028306_0198_0FD895C797EC30F8"/>ſhall meet with diſappointments. In the caſe of friendſhip, this admonition is the more neceſſary to be given, as a certain warmth and enthuſiaſm belong to it, which are apt to carry us beyond the bounds of nature.

Hence many a friendſhip, haſtily perhaps contracted, is as haſtily diſſolved, and diſguſt ſucceeds to violent attachment.—Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my friends, that a faithleſs character on earth is a mere chimera. Many failings you experience in yourſelves. Be not ſurpriſed, when you diſcover the like in others, of whom you had formed the higheſt opinion. The beſt and moſt eſtimable perſons are they, in whom the feweſt material defects are found; and whoſe great and ſoild qualities counterbalance the common infirmities of men. It is to theſe qualities you are to look in forming friendſhips; to good ſenſe and prudence, which conſtitute the baſis of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable character; to virtue, to good temper, to ſteadineſs of affection; and according to the union of thoſe diſpoſitions, eſteem yourſelves happy in the friend whom you chooſe.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, I muſt admoniſh you not to be hurt by differences of opinion ariſing in intercourſe with your friends. It is impoſſible for theſe not to occur.

It is a maxim which, not unreaſonably I admit, may find place in thoſe politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and party friendſhips, of which I before ſpoke, where perſonal advancement is always in view. But it, is altogether inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of thoſe friendſhips, which are formed, and underſtood to be nouriſhed, by the heart.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> advice which I give is, To cultivate, in all intercourſe among friends, gentle and obliging manners. It is a common error to ſuppoſe, that familiar intimacy ſuperſedes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ttention to the leſſer du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of behaviour; and that under the notion of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it may excuſe a careleſs, or even a rough, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour. On the contrary, an intimate connection can only be kept up, by a conſtant with to be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and agreeable.

               </gap>cta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuperiority, occur in the intercourſe of friends. A tart reply, a proneneſs to rebuke, a captions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions ſpirit, are often known to embitter domeſtic life, and to ſet friends at variance. In thoſe ſmaller articles of behaviour, where men are too apt to be careleſs, and to indulge their humour without reſtraint, the real character is often underſtood to break forth, and ſhew itſelf. It is by no means enough, that, in all matters of ſerious intereſt, we think ourſelves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to prove the ſincerity of our friendſhip. The
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:028306_0201_0FD87FAAC53FE710"/>ordinary tenor of life is compoſed of ſmall duties and offices, which men have occaſion daily to perform; and it is only by rendering daily behaviour agreeable that we can long preſerve the comforts of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fifth</hi> place, let me caution you not to liſten raſhly to evil reports againſt your friends. When up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper grounds you have formed a connection, be flow of believing any thing againſt the friend whom you have choſen. Remember, that there is among mankind a ſpirit of malignity, which too often takes pleaſure in diſturbing the ſociety of thoſe who appear to enjoy one another. The ſcripture hath warned us, that there is <hi>a whiſperer who ſeparateth chief friends; there is a falſe witneſs who ſoweth diſcord among brethren.</hi> Give not therefore a ready ear to the officious inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of thoſe who, under the guiſe of friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, come to admoniſh you, that you ought to ſtand on your guard againſt thoſe whom they ſee you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to truſt. Conſider, whether, under this fair appearance, there may not lurk ſome ſecret envy and rivalry, or ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ncealed intereſt. Chaſe not every flying report. Suffer not the poiſon of jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy eaſily to taint your mind, and break your peace. A wide difference there is between that weak credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which allows itſelf to be impoſed upon blindly, and that dark and ſuſpicious ſpirit which is always inclined to the evil ſide. It forms part of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a wiſe and good man, that he is not prone to <hi>take up a reproach againſt his neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſixth</hi> and laſt place, let me exhort you not to deſert your friend in danger or diſtreſs. Too many there are in the world, whoſe attachment to thoſe they call their friends is confined to the day of their proſperity. As long as that continues, they are, or appear to be, affectionate and cordial. But as ſoon as their friend is under a cloud, they begin to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:028306_0202_0FD87FAD9C314130"/>and to ſeparate their intereſts from his. In friendſhips of this ſort, the heart, aſſuredly, has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had much concern. For the great teſt of true friendſhip, is conſtancy in the hour of danger, adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the ſeaſon of diſtreſs.—When your friend is calumniated, then is the time, openly and boldly to eſpouſe his cauſe. When his ſituation is changed, or his fortunes are falling, then is the time of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prompt and zealous aid. When ſickneſs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity occaſion him to be neglected by others, that is the opportunity which every real friend will ſeize of redoubling all the affectionate attentions which love ſuggeſts, Theſe are the important duties, the ſacred c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aims of friendſhip, which religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue enforce on every worthy mind.—To ſhow your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves warm, after this manner, in the cauſe of your friend commands eſteem, even from thoſe who have perſonal intereſts in oppoſing him. This honourable zeal of friendſhip, has, in every age, attracted the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of mankind. It has conſecrated to the lateſt poſterity the names of thoſe who have given up their fortunes, and have even expoſed their lives, in behalf of the friends whom they haved; while ignominy and diſgrace have ever been the portion of them, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their friends in the evil day. <hi>Thine own friend forſake not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before concluding, it muſt not be forgotten, that the inj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ion of the Wiſe Man in the text, is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ith this remarkable expreſſion; not only <hi>thine own friend,</hi> but alſo, <hi>thy father's friend forſake not.</hi> Theſe words bring back to our remembrance the days of former years; and ſuggeſt a ſentiment, which cannot but touch every feeling heart. Thine own friend may be dear; thy father's friend ought to be ſacred. As long as life remains in any human breaſt, the memory of thoſe ancient ties ſhould remain,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:028306_0203_0FD87FAE85385978"/>which connected us once with our father, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe.—Thy father has perhaps, long ago, gone down to the duſt. But when you recal the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent days of childhood and youth; when you think of thoſe family tranſactions which once gladdened your hearts; your father's friend in the midſt of theſe will riſe to your remembrance. There was a time when you accoſted him with reſpect, or looked up to him with fondneſs, and was made happy by his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice. Does ſuch a one now ſurvive, and ſhall he not receive from you ſome portion of filial rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and honour? To diſregard and neglect him, is to ſpurn your father's memory; is to inſult the aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of him who now ſleeps in the grave; is to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit yourſelves to thoſe who ſhall ſucceed you, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling and baſe. <hi>Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forſake not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have pointed out ſome of the chief duties which belong to virtuous friendſhip; and ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means by which this ſacred bond ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unbroken; this holy flame ſhould be kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in the human breaſt.

               </gap>d with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to futurity, amidſt the preſent uncertainties of uſe. Time and life are always going on, and to each of us are preparing changes in our ſtate. What theſe may be, whether for the better or for the worſe, we cannot tell; as it hath pleaſed the wiſdom of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to cover futurity with a veil which no mortal can lift up. In the mean time, none of us can avoid forming deſigns, and laying plans, for the time to come. The preſent-moment is never ſufficient to give full employment to the active mind of man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome excurſions into futurity; and in theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, the preſent is often wholly ſpent. It is therefore of the higheſt conſequence, that a proper direction be given to the mind, in its employments of thought relating to futurity. Otherwiſe, in the proſpects which we take of that unknown region, falſe hopes, or ill-grounded <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ars, ſhall ſlatter or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us in vain. <hi>We know not,</hi> as the Wiſe Man
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:028306_0205_0FD8801027F03E40"/>Yells, <hi>what a day may bring forth.</hi> It may, very probably, produce ſomething that we had not looked for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and therefore, inſtead of <hi>boaſting ourſelves of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow,</hi> as the multitude are apt to do, it becomes us to be diſciplined and prepared, for whatever it may bring.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to ſpend much time in confirming the truth, which is the foundation of the admonition in the text; in proving, either that change and mutabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity belong to our preſent ſtate, or that the changes of it cannot be foreſeen by us. Theſe are truths ſo obvious and confeſſed, that an attempt to confirm them is like proving, that all men are to die. At the ſame time, obvious as they are, it were to be wiſhed, that the thoughts of men dwelt upon them more. For, by a ſtrange but prevailing deception, it would ſeem, from the general conduct of mankind, that almoſt every one thinks his own caſe an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the general law; and that he may build plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with as much confidence on his preſent ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if ſome aſſurance had been given him that it were never to change. Hence it has been often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſerious perſons, that there is no more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral cauſe to which the vices of men can be aſcribed, their forgetfulneſs of God, and their neglect of duty, than to their preſuming upon the continuance of life, of pleaſure, and proſperity.</p>
            <p>Look but a little way, my friends, into your own ſtate; and you muſt unavoidably perceive that, from the beginning, it has been ſo contrived by Providence, that there ſhould be no permanent ſtability to man's condition on earth. The ſeeds of alteration are every where ſown. In your health, life, poſſeſſions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, pleaſures, there are cauſes of decay imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly working; ſecretly undermining the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what appears to you the moſt ſtable; contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Fit and proper it is, that life ſhould thus proceed. For the uncertainty of to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was never deſigned by Providence, to deter us from acting or planting to day; but only to admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh

I now proceed to ſhow. They may be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following directions. Boaſt not thyſelf of to-morrow; Deſpair not of to-morrow; Delay not till to-morrow what is proper to be done to day; Prepare thyſelf for whatever to-morrow may bring forth; Build thy hopes of happineſs on ſomething more ſolid and laſting than what either to-day or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow will produce.</p>

It may bring forth ſome unforeſeen relief; and therefore thou ſhouldeſt hope under diſtreſs.—It is too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with mankind, to be totally engroſſed, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by preſent events. Their preſent condition, whatever it is, they are apt to imagine, will never change; and hence by proſperity they are lifted up. and by adverſity are dejected and broken; prone, in the one caſe, to forget God, in the other, to repine againſt him. Whereas, the doctrine, which the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the world perpetually inculcate is, that no ſtate of external things ſhould appear ſo important, or ſhould ſo affect and agitate our ſpirits, as to deprive us of a calm, an equal, and a ſteady mind.

Here is the object to which a wiſe man will bend his chief attention, that, after having acted his part on earth with fidelity and honour, he may be enabled, through the merits of his Saviour, to look for a place in the manſions of eternal and untroubled peace. This proſpect is the great corrective of the preſent vanity of human life. It gives ſignificancy and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to its moſt tranſitory ſcenes; and in the midſt of its mutability, diſcovers one fixed point of reſt. He who is habitually influenced by the hope of immortality, will be able to look without diſmay, on the changes of the world.

            </p>
            <p>To acquire a full view of any danger to which we are expoſed, is the firſt meaſure to be taken, in order to our ſafety. Let us then begin the ſubject, with conſidering how much we are in hazard of being miſſed into vice by the general manners which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold around us.—No virtue is more neceſſary to a Chriſtian, but ſcarcely is there any more difficult to be put in practice, than that firmneſs of mind which can enable a man to maintain his principles, and to ſtand his ground againſt the torrent of cuſtom, faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and example. Example has upon all minds a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and inſinuating influence, even when we ourſelves are inſenſible of its operation. We imperceptibly ſlide into ſome reſemblance of the manners of thoſe with whom we have frequent intercourſe. This often ſhows itſelf, in the moſt indifferent things. But the reſemblance is ſtill more readily contracted, when there is ſomething within ourſelves, leans to the ſame ſide which is countenanced by the practice of others. We are always glad to find any apology for indulging our inclinations and paſſions; and the example of the multitude too readily ſuggeſts that apology. Even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore corruption has made great progreſs in our hearts, ſometimes, mere complaiſance and good nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to fall in with the ways of others. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:028306_0217_0FD895CA3995F950"/>timidity and falſe ſhame prevent our differing from them: Frequently, expectation and intereſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us ſtrongly to comply. How great is the danger we incur, when, in times of prevailing vice, all theſe principles of imitation and compliance unite togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt our virtue?</p>
            <p>The world is too juſtly ſaid by ſcripture, to <hi>lie in wickedneſs.</hi> It is a ſchool wherein every vice is taught, and too eaſily learned. Even from our earli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when, as we advance in life, we become initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that myſtery of iniquity, which is called, the way of the world; when we meet with deceit and artifice in all ranks of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The countenance which ſin receives from the practice of the multitude, not only removes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints which are impoſed by modeſty and ſhame; but ſuch is the degeneracy of the world, that ſhame is too often employed againſt the cauſe of religion and virtue.

            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, Let us remember that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are very bad guides; are ſo far from having a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to implicit regard, that he who blindly follows them, may be perfumed to err. For prejudice, and paſſion, are known to ſway the crowd. They are ſtruck by the outſide of things; they inquire ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, admire falſe appearances, and purſue falſe goods. Their opinions are for the moſt part haſtily formed, and of courſe are variable, floating, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent. In every age, how ſmall is the number of thoſe who are guided by reaſon, and calm inquiry? How few do we find, who have the wiſdom to think and judge for themſelves, and have ſteadineſs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low out their own judgment; Ignorance, and low education, darken the views of the vulgar. Faſhion and prejudice, vanity and pleaſure, corrupt the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the great. The example of neither, affords any ſtandard of what is right and wiſe. If the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, when employed in the purſuit of truth, finds it neceſſary to diſregard eſtabliſhed prejudices and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinion, ſhall we, in the more important inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after the rule of life, ſubmit to ſuch blind guidance as the practice of the many; eſteeming whatever they admire, and following wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="215" facs="unknown:028306_0220_0FD895CF8CA52EC0"/>Popery; for theſe latter have ever had, and ſtill have, the numbers and the multitude on their ſide.—Our Saviour has ſufficiently characteriſed the way of the world, when he deſcribes the <hi>broad road</hi> in which the multitudes go as the <hi>road which leads to deſtruction;</hi> and the path which leads to happineſs, as a <hi>narrow path,</hi> which fewer find. From which it is an eaſy inference, that to have the multitude on our ſide, is ſo far from affording any preſumption of our being ſafe, that it ſhould lead us to ſuſpect that we are hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of danger.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, as the practice of the multitude is no argument of a good practice, ſo it cannot afford us either juſtification, or ſafely, in what is evil.—It affords, us, I ſay, no juſtification. Truth and error, virtue and vice, are things of immutable nature. The difference between them is grounded on that baſis of eternal reaſon, which no opinions or cuſtoms of men can effect or alter. Whether virtue be eſteemed, or not, in the world, this makes it neither more nor leſs eſtimable in itſelf. It carries always a divine author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which men cannot impair. It ſhines with an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential luſtre, which praiſe cannot brighten, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach tarniſh. It has a right to regulate the opinions of men; but by their opinions cannot be controlled. Its nature continues invariably the ſame, though all the multitude of fools ſhould concur in endeavouring to turn it into ridicule. <hi>Wo unto them,</hi> ſays the prophet Iſaiah, <hi>that call evil, good, and good, evil; that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.—Their root ſhall be as rottenneſs, and their bloſſom ſhall go up as duſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have caſt away the law of the Lord of hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of Iſrael.</hi>

As the practice of the multitude furniſhes no juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the ſinner, ſo neither does it afford him any ſafety. Religion is altogether a matter of perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. God hath delivered to every man the rule of life; and every man muſt think and act for himſelf; becauſe for himſelf he is to anſwer. If others be wicked, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> will be the worſe for them; but it will not, on that account, be the better for us, if we ſhall be evil alſo. Let vice be ever ſo prevalent, it is ſtill that <hi>evil thing which the Lord abhorreth;</hi> and, <hi>though hand join in hand,</hi> the wicked ſhall not eſcape unpuniſhed. So far is the number of offenders from furniſhing any ground of ſafety, that it calls more loudly for divine juſtice to interpoſe. It is as eaſy for the Almighty arm to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruſh a whole guilty ſociety, as to puniſh a ſingle individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual; and when the diſobedient ſubjects of God coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſtrengthen one another in licentiouſneſs, by tranſgreſſing in troops and bands it becomes high time for his government to exert itſelf, and let its vengeance forth.—One could ſcarcely think that any profeſſor of Chriſtian faith would fancy to himſelf any apology from the way of the world, when he knows that the declared deſign of his religion was, to diſtinguiſh him from the world, which is ſaid to <hi>lie in ſin;</hi> and that Chriſt came to call out for himſelf <hi>a peculiar people,</hi> whoſe character it ſhould be, <hi>not to be conformed to the world, but transformed by the renewing of their minds.</hi>—So little, indeed, can the practice of the world either juſtify or extenuate vice, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our ſerious conſideration,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, whether there be not ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which peculiarly aggravate the guilt of thoſe who follow the multitude in evil. Do you not, thereby, ſtrengthen the power of ſin, and perpetuate the pernicious influence of bad example? By ſtriking off from the corrupted crowd, you might be eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:028306_0222_0FD895D3397503D0"/>uſeful. You might animate and recover many, whom weakneſs and timidity keep under bondage to the cuſtoms of the world; whereas, by tamely yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the current of vice, you render that current ſtronger for carrying others along; you add weight and ſtability to the bad cauſe; you lend to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude all the force of your example, for drawing others after them, to the commiſſion of evil.—While you are thus acceſſory to the ruin of others, you are, at the ſame time, ſtamping your own character with the fouleſt and deepeſt impreſſions of corruption. By ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering your judgment, and your conſcience, to the multitude, you betray the rights, and degrade the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, of rational nature. Nothing great or worthy can be expected of him, who, inſtead of conſidering what is right in itſelf, and what part it is fitteſt for one in his ſtation to act, is only conſidering what the world will think, or ſay of him; what ſort of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour will paſs with the faireſt ſhow, and be moſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to pleaſe the many. When a man has thus given up the liberty and independence of his mind, we can no longer reckon upon him in any thing. We cannot tell how far he may be carried in vice. There is too much ground to dread, that he will lie, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and betray; changing himſelf, without ſcruple, into every ſhape that will find favour among thoſe whom he ſeeks to gain.—While this ſervility to the world infers baſeneſs towards men, it involves alſo the higheſt imprety towards God. It ſhows that we yield to the world that reverence and ſubmiſſion, which is only due to the divine law. We treat the government of the Almighty with ſcorn; as if his precepts deſerved to be obeyed, only when they ſuited the caprice and the follies of the multitude; and were entitied to no regard, as ſoon as they contradicted the reigning cuſtoms and faſhions of the world.—While
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:028306_0223_0FD895D4C7F97160"/>ſuch conduct carries in it ſo much wickedneſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us obſerve,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, that the moſt excellent and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable character which can adorn a man and a Chriſtian, is acquired, by reſiſting the torrent of vice and adhering to the cauſe of God and virtue againſt a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all thoſe, who, in any of the great lines of life, have diſtinguiſhed themſelves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have deſpiſed popular prejudices, and departed, in ſeveral things, from the common ways of the world. On no occaſion is this more requiſite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned.

            <p>IT is of the higheſt importance to religious conduct, that our minds be filled with ſuitable conceptions of the attributes of God. They are the foundations of our reverence for him and reverence is the foundation of religion. All the divine perfections are intereſting to man. Almighty power, in conjunction with eternity and Omnipreſence, naturally inſpires ſolemn awe. Infinite Goodneſs relieves the mind from that oppreſſion which Power alone would produce; and, from our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of preſent benefits, and our remembrance of the paſt, creates love, gratitude, and truſt. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle between theſe, ſtands the contemplation of divine Wiſdom, which conjoins impreſſions of awe with thoſe of comfort; and while it humbles us into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:028306_0228_0FD87FA40633A198"/>ſubmiſſion, encourages, at the ſame time our reliance on that <hi>King eternal, immortal, and inviſible,</hi> who is juſtly ſtiled in the text, <hi>the only wiſe God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among men, wiſdom is a quality entirely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from cunning or craft. It always ſuppoſes good and fair intention in the perſon who poſſeſſes it; and imports, that laudible ends are purſued by proper and juſtifiable means. In like manner, wiſdom in the Supreme Being cannot be ſeparated from the rectitude of his nature. It is, in him, an exertion of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence; and imports, that the purpoſes of juſtice and goodneſs are carried on and accompliſhed, by means the moſt effectual. To meditate on ſome of thoſe inſtances in which this divine wiſdom is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, cannot but be highly favourable to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions both of piety, and of virtue.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to ſay, whether the natural, or the moral, world, afford the moſt conſpicuons and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſplays of the wiſdom of God. Not one, nor many diſcourſes, nor indeed the ſtudy and labour of a whole life, were, in any degree ſufficient to explore them. Of the proofs of wiſdom which the natural world affords. I cannot attempt now to diſcourſe. Any illuſtration of theſe would lead to diſcuſſions of a ſcientific <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind, which more properly belong to the philoſopher; and on which philoſophy has often em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed itſelf, with much utility and honour. I ſhall only take notice that in proportion as human knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge hath enlarged its ſphere of a reſearch and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, in the ſame proportion, hath the wiſdom of the Creator ſtruck the minds of all inquirers and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with the higheſt admiration. All nature is in truth a ſcene of wonders. In the diſpoſition of the heavenly bodies, and the general arrangement of the ſyſtem of the univerſe; in the ſtructure of the earth: in the endleſs variety of living creatures that fill it;
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:028306_0229_0FD895DC46B56C28"/>and in the proviſion made for them all, to enable them to fulfil the ends of their being, it is not eaſy to determine, whether power, wiſdom, or goodneſs be moſt conſpicuous. It belongs not only to <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens to declare the glory of God, and to the firmament to ſhew forth his handy-work;</hi> in the ſmalleſt and moſt inconſiderable, as well as in the moſt illuſtrious works of God, equal marks appear of profound deſign and conſummate art. It has been juſtly ſaid, that there is not a vegetable that grows, nor an inſect that moves but what is ſufficient to confound the atheiſt, and to afford the candid obſerver endleſs materials of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout adoration and praiſe.</p>
            <p>When we turn to the moral world, the field of admiration which opens to us is no leſs extenſive and ſtriking. I can only mention a few inſtances of that exquiſite wiſdom which every where meet us.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, let us attend to the conſtitution of human nature. Though we are taught by revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to conſider it as now impaired by the fall, yet, as it ſtands, we behold the traces of a noble ſtructure planned and executed with the higheſt ſkill. All the powers and faculties beſtowed on man are ſuch, as perfectly ſuit is condition, and adapt him to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which he was deſigned.—Senſes were given him, that he might diſtinguiſh what is neceſſary for the preſervation and welfare of his body. Now, ſuppoſe that any one of thoſe ſenſes, the ſight, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or the hearing, or the touch, had been in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree either more blunt, or more acute, than it is at preſent, what an unhappy change would this have made upon our ſtate? On the one hand, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er imperfections of the organs, would have deprived us of all the comfort and advantage which we now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy from ſuch powers. On the other hand, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, degree of exquiſite ſenſibility in them, would have
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:028306_0230_0FD895DDBA91C640"/>rendered life a burden to us. Our ſenſes, inſtead of being inlets to knowledge and pleaſure, would then have become conſtant avenues to uneaſineſs and pain. Their powers therefore, are ſkilfully adjuſted to that meaſure of ſtrength, which allows them to anſwer the purpoſes of health, ſafety, and comfort; without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falling ſhort of this line of uſefulneſs, or improp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erely, and hurtfully, ſtretching beyond it.</p>
            <p>In the mind, appetites and paſſions were placed, as the moving powers of the ſoul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o impel its activity. But as their impulſe required regulation and reſtraint, reaſon was, at the ſame time, conferred as the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting power.—Of all our paſſions, ſelf-love, and the deſire of ſelf-preſervation were, with the utmoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, made the ſtrongeſt, for a reaſon which the meaneſt capacity may comprehend. Every man is moſt immediately committed by P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>widence to his own care and charge. He knows his own ſituation beſt; and has more opportunities of promoting his own happineſs, than he can have of advancing the happineſs of any other perſon. It was therefore fit and wiſe, that, by the ſtrongeſt inſtinct, he ſhould be prompted to attend to himſelf.—At the ſame time, as no man ſtanding alone is ſufficient for his own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, it was neceſſary that, by mutual ſympathy and ſocial inſtincts, we ſhould be drawn to give aid to one another. Here it deſerves our particular notice that the force of thoſe ſocial inſtincts is, with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable propriety, proportioned by Providence to the degree of their uſefulneſs and importance.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm. X. Vol. ii.</note> Thus that parental affection, which the helpleſs ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and childhood renders ſo needful, is made the ſtrongeſt of them all. Next, come thoſe ties of blood, which prompt mutual kindneſs among thoſe
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:028306_0231_0FD895DF4AF6CEF8"/>who are intimately joined together by brotherhood, and other family connections. To theſe ſucceeds that valuable inſtinct of pity which impels us to aſſiſt the diſtreſſed, wherever we behold them. To take part with others in there good fortune belongs to man's ſocial nature, and increaſes the ſum of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. At the ſame time, to take part with the proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is leſs neceſſary than to ſympathiſe with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; and therefore the principle which prompts us to <hi>rejoice with them that rejoice,</hi> is made not to be ſo ſtrong, as that which impels us to <hi>weep with them that weep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they are not only the laudable and important parts of our diſpoſition, which diſcover the wiſdom of the Author of our frame; even our imperfections and follies, are by him rendered ſubſervient to uſeful ends.—Amidſt thoſe inequalities of condition, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the ſtate of human life required, where it was neceſſary that ſome ſhould be rich, and others poor, that ſome ſhould be eminent and diſtinguiſhed, and others obſcure and mean, how ſeaſonable is that good opinion which every one entertains of himſelf; that ſelf-complacency with which he compares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to others; and that fond hope, which is ever pleaſing him with the proſpect of future pleaſures and advantages in life? Without thoſe flattering ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, vain as they often are, how totally inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would this world become, to many of its inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? Whereas, by means of them, Providence hath contrived to balance, in a great meaſure, the inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of condition among mankind. It hath contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diffuſe pleaſurs through all ranks; and to bring the high and the low nearer to a level with each other than might at firſt be ſuppoſed. It hath ſmoothed the moſt rugged tracts of human life; and hath gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with rays of borrowed light its moſt dreary ſcenes.</p>
            <p>

One inſtance of Divine wiſdom, in framing our nature, is ſo remarkable as to demand particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that is, the meaſure according to which God hath diſpenſed knowledge and ignorance to man. There is nothing of which we are more ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, than of our narrow and confined views of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of Providence, and of all things around us: And yet, upon examination, it will be found, that our views extend, on every ſide, juſt as far as they ought; and that, to ſee and know more than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us, inſtead of bringing any advantage, would produce certain miſery.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm. IV. Vol. i. and Serm. IX. Vol. iv.</note>—We pry, for inſtance with impatient curioſity, into future events. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for us, they are veiled and covered up; and one peep behind that veil, were it permitted, would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to poiſon the whole comfort of our days, by the anticipation of ſorrows to come.—In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, we often wiſh with eagerneſs to penetrate into the ſecrets of nature, to look into the inviſible world, and to be made acquainted with the whole deſtiny of man. Our wiſh is denied; we are environed on all hands with myſtery; and that myſtery is our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For were thoſe great inviſible objects fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, the ſight of them would confound and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm us. It would either totally derange our feeble faculties; or would engroſs our attention to ſuch a degree, as to lay us aſide from the buſineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of this world. It would have the ſame effect, as if we were carried away from the earth, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among the inhabitants of ſome other planet.—The knowledge that is allowed to us, was deſigned to fit us for acting our part in our preſent ſtate. At the exact point therefore, where uſefulneſs ends, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſtops, and ignorance commences. Light ſhines
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:028306_0233_0FD895E245F78EB0"/>upon us, as long as it ſerves to guide our path; but forſakes us, as ſoon as it becomes noxious to the eye; and ſalutary darkneſs is appointed to cloſe the ſcene.—Thoughtleſs and ſtupid muſt that man be, who, in all this ſurniture of the human mind, in this exact adjuſtment of its ſeveral powers to the great purpoſes of life, diſcerns not the hand of adorable Wiſdom, as well as of infinite Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, Let us contemplate the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as exhibiting itſelf to us in the moral government of the world. We are informed by revelation, that this life is deſigned by Providence to be an introductory part of exiſtence to intelligent beings; a ſtate of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and diſcipline, where creatures fallen from their original rank, may gradually recover their rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and virtue. Under this view, which is in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perfectly conſonant to all that reaſon diſcovers, we ſhall find the general courſe of human affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed as it may ſometimes appear, to have been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with exquiſite wiſdom.—It was neceſſary to ſuch a ſtate, that all the active powers ſhould be brought forth into exerciſe, and completely tried. It became proper, therefore, that there ſhould be a mixture of characters in the world; and that men ſhould be ſhewn in a variety of ſituations.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm. IV. Vol. iv.</note> Hence that diverſity of tempers and diſpoſitions which are found in ſociety; thoſe inequalities in rank and ſtation, which we ſee taking place; and thoſe different talents <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, which prompt men to different pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits. By theſe means, every department in ſociety is filled up? and every man has ſome ſphere prepared for him, in which he can act. He is brought forth as on a buſy ſtage, where opportunity is given for his character to diſplay itſelf fully.—His life is, with
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:028306_0234_0FD895E3BA29E868"/>great propriety, varied by interchanges of proſperity and adverſity. Always proſperous he would become, diſſipated, indolent, and giddy: Always afflicted, he would be fretful dejected, and ſullen. There are ſew perſons, therefore, or none, whoſe lot ſhares not of both theſe ſtates; in order that every diſpoſition of the heart may be explored, and every mean of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment afforded.—As man is ultimately deſigned for a higher ſtate of exiſtence than the preſent, it was not proper that this world ſhould prove a paradiſe to him or ſhould afford him that complete ſatisfaction which he inceſſantly purſues. Diſappointments, therefore, are often made to blaſt his hopes; and, even while the comforts of life laſt, they are always mixed with ſome troubles; in order that an exceſſive attachment to this world may gradually be looſened. The courſe of things is evidently ſo ordered by Providence, that occurrences ſhall be always happening, to bring down the moſt proſperous to a level with the reſt of his brethren, and to raiſe up, in their turn, the low and the diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of thoſe viciſſitudes, which are ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly conducive to improvement, both wiſdom and goodneſs required, that the ſupreme Governor of the world ſhould be ſeen to protect the intereſts, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the ſide of virtue. But in the degree of evidence, with which this was to be ſhown, it was no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that a proper temperament ſhould be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Had virtue been always completely rewarded, and made happy on earth, men would no longer have had a motive for aſpiring to a more bleſſed ſtate. In the caſe of every crime, had divine juſtice interpoſed to bring complete puniſhment on the head of the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal; or had all the felicity which is prepared for the juſt in a future world, and all the miſery which there awaits the wicked, been already diſplayed to the view,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:028306_0235_0FD895E53A5C23C8"/>and rendered ſenſible to the feelings of men, there would have been an end of that ſtate of trial, for which our whole condition on earth was intended. It was neceſſary, therefore, that, at preſent, we ſhould <hi>ſee through a glaſs darkly.</hi> A certain degree of myſtery and obſcurity was, with perfect wiſdom, left on the conduct of the Almighty.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm. IV. Vol. i.</note>—But, amidſt that obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſufficient encouragement and ſupport is in the mean time given to virtue; ſufficient ground is afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the full belief, that it is what the Deity loves, and will finally reward. His approbation of it is ſignified to every man by the voice of conſcience. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſatisfaction and peace are made always to belong to it; and general eſteem and honour, for the moſt part, to attend it. On the other hand, the wicked, in no ſituation of life, are allowed to be truly happy. Their vices and their paſſions are made to trouble their proſperity; and their puniſhment to grow out of their crimes. Let any one attentively recollect the material incidents of his life; and he will, for the moſt part, be able to trace the chief misfortunes which have befallen him, to ſome guilt he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or ſome folly he has committed.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Serm. XIII. Vol. iii.</note> Such is the profound wiſdom with which Providence conducts its counſels, that, although is does not appear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, men are made to reap from their actions, the fruits which they had deſerved; their iniquities <hi>to correct them, and their backſlidings to reprove them;</hi> and while they ſuffer, they are forced to acknowledge the juſtice of their puniſhment.—Theſe are not mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of rare or occaſional obſervation; but deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the texture of human affairs. They diſcover a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ular plan, a formed ſyſtem, according to which the whole train of Providence proceeds;
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:028306_0236_0FD895E6CE3F00D0"/>and which manifeſts to every ſerious obſerver the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom of its Author.—As thus, in the conſtitution of human nature, and in the moral gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the world, divine wiſdom ſo remarkably appears, I muſt obſerve,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>third</hi> place, That in the redemption of the world, and in the economy of grace, it ſhines no leſs conſpicuouſly. The ſubject which opens to us here is too extenſive to be fully illuſtrated at preſent; but the great lines of it are obvious.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm. V. Vol. i.—Serm. XX. Vol. i.—Serm. XXIII. Vol. ii. Serm. V. Vol. iii.</note>—In carrying on a plan, by which forgiveneſs was to be diſpenſed to an offending race, wiſdom required that the author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the legulator ſhould be fully preſerved, and no ſuch relaxation be introduced into government as might give licenſe or encouragement to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Accordingly, the moſt admirable proviſion was made for theſe important purpoſes, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Son of God ſuffering and dying for ſinners. The ſovereign awe of juſtice is maintained, while juſtice is tempered with mercy. Men are bound to righteouſneſs, under the higheſt ſanctions; and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſecurity and conſolation are, at the ſame time, afforded to the penitent. By the inſtructions, and example, of their Saviour, they are inſtructed in their duty; and through a Mediator and Interceſſor, they are encouraged to offer their worſhip and prayers to the Almighty. They are aſſured that, in whatever is too ardous for human nature to perform, they ſhall be aſſiſted by a Divine Spirit; and under all trials and difficulties, they are ſported by the expreſs promiſe of that eternal life, which is brought to light by the goſpel.—It is not poſſible for the underſtanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any method of ſalvation, planned with more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:028306_0237_0FD895E839ACCD10"/>and executed with more wiſdom, than what is ſhown in the goſpel of Chriſt. The conſideration of this conſtitution alone, gives us full reaſon to join in that exclamation of the Apoſtle: <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and the knowledge of God! How unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 33.</note>
            </p>
            <p>From this ſhort ſurvey which we have taken of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom, as diſcovering itſelf, in the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex frame of the moral world; in the conſtitution of human nature; in the government of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and in the redemption of the human race; we cannot but perceive how much reaſon we have to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate ourſelves before God, and with all humility to worſhip and adore.—When we view that immenſe ſtructure of the univerſe in which we dwell; when we think of Him, whoſe wiſdom has planned the whole ſyſtem of being; whoſe mind comprehends, whoſe counſels direct, the whole courſe of events, from the beginning to the end of time; by whom nothing is ſo inconſiderable as to be overlooked, or ſo tranſient as to be forgotten; who attends to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the poor man in his cottage, while he is ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſun and the moon in their courſe through the heavens; into what aſtoniſhment and ſelf-annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do we fall! Before him all our boaſted knowledge is ignorance, and our wiſdom is folly. Wherever we caſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>It is the power of God, which produces among the multitude of men any impreſſions of religion. When thunder roars in the heavens, or an earthquake ſhakes the ground, they are ſtruck with awe, and diſpoſed
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:028306_0238_0FD895EAA6614970"/>to worſhip an inviſible power. But ſuch impreſſions of Deity are occaſional, and tranſitory. The laſting reverence of a Supreme Being ariſes, in a well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed mind, from the diſplay of that infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which all the univerſe preſents. Its operations are conſtantly, though ſilently, going on around us. We may view it in the peaceful and ſedate ſtate of the univerſe, as well as in its greateſt commotions; we behold it in every inſect that moves on the ground, at the ſame time that we admire it in the revolutions of the celeſtial bodies. Happy for us, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation ſhall nouriſh that temper of habitual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, which ſo well becomes dependent beings, and is ſo intimately connected with all virtue!<note n="*" place="bottom">See Serm.

            <p>But the chief effect that ought to be produced by meditation on the divine wiſdom, is perfect reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Governor of the univerſe, and entire truſt in his adminiſtration. Our private misfortunes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments are too often the ſubject of queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous complaints, and even of unjuſt ſuſpicions of Providence. But when in the whole natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral world, we behold an arrangement of things which plainly diſcovers the moſt conſummate wiſdom, can we believe, that in the arrangement of our petty concerns, this wiſdom is dormant and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glectful? How much more reaſon is there to think, that our ignorance of the divine plans miſleads our judgment, than that the wiſdom of the Almighty has erred in directing our private affairs.—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
