            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>JUSTICE.</head>
               <p>THE principle of justice in society, is that <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> principle which <hi>prohibits</hi> one person from taking another's property, but for an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; by which <hi>alone</hi> property is, or can be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually secured.</p>
               <p>But few of what we conceive to be real en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are given us from the open and liberal hand of Nature; however, by <hi>industry</hi> and <hi>art</hi> we can acquire them in profusion: hence the <hi>idea</hi> of property necessarily arose; the securing of which, is, in fact, one of the primary objects of society, and the only effectual stimulus to induce indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals to acquire, and, consequently, possess it.</p>
               <p>And, as individuals constitute society, or the nation, of course the <hi>sum</hi> of individuals wealth makes the national wealth. It therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follows, that the nation is <hi>benefited,</hi> or injured
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024076_0003_0FC3130229BBCAC8"/>
precisely in a ratio to the prosperity, or the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the individuals who constitute it; or, in other words, in the same ratio in which each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual's wealth is to the national wealth, will the nation or society be benefited by his prosperity, or, on the contrary, be injured by his adversity.</p>
               <p>Consequently, the <hi>security</hi> of property, and the <hi>protection</hi> of person, are essential to national pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and these are, in fact, the sole and primary objects of its existence.</p>
               <p>The only question then, is, In what does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty consist? Unquestionably, in <hi>any</hi> thing which it is lawful for any person exclusively to use or enjoy.</p>
               <p>Of property there are two species, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                  <hi>local</hi> and <hi>mental.</hi> By the former is understood personal and real property; the utility of securing which, the long experience of nations fully demonstrate<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: by the latter, is understood the <hi>products</hi> of <hi>genius,</hi> which consists in discoveries in science, and in the useful arts; by means of which agriculture, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, manufactures, and manual labor are, not only facilitated, but much promoted; and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to these they owe their present state of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Since, therefore, the improvements in the arts are so necessary in the chain, and do so <hi>essentially,</hi> not only enhance the value, but increase the net product of the sum-total of the local property; 'tis therefore the interest of the nation, that both should be equally secured.</p>
               <p>But, however obvious this may appear, there are several objections raised against it, of which the following appear most worthy of notice.</p>
               <p n="1">1st. It will be said that all discoveries ought to be free—Pray, why more free than local property? Was not the fertile soil, or land on which we live, previous to society, common property? and has
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024076_0004_0FC313039DBF0D20"/>
not long experience fully established, not only the justice, but the utility of securing to the loca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, their heirs and assigns, a perpetual right in their respective possessions? Unquestionably it has.</p>
               <p>Again, says popular prejudice, <hi>genius</hi> is the gift of the Deity, therefore its products ought to be common right—So is equally the land; which, upon the same principle, ought to have continued common right; the contrary of which, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the grand teacher, has long demonstrated.</p>
               <p>Another popular objection, is, that discoveries <hi>cost</hi> but little, if any thing—Neither in the first instance did the land; but, to demonstrate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of the last objection, when they <hi>advert,</hi> that, in <hi>most</hi> instances, the most important discoveries are brought into existence and matured only by a series of experiments, in making of which, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some years, but several thousand dollars are expended; <hi>surely</hi> they will <hi>not</hi> deny but such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors have <hi>property</hi> in their respective discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: this admitted, it follows, that since justi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> consists in doing equally and substantially right to all, which, in fact, is equity; and since <hi>equity</hi> i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the great <hi>standard rule</hi> of <hi>right,</hi> inventors are <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> entitled to have property secured in the products of their genius, thus brought into existence, as in the product of industry, or in possessions of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal property.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the <hi>adverse</hi> tendency of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling principle, relative to property, is too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to escape notice; suppose, for instance, that all the laws which secure property were repealed, what would be the consequence? Indubitably, the grand excitements or soul of society being destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all industry would <hi>necessarily</hi> cease, and the poor would <hi>subsist</hi> on the property of the rich, till the whole <hi>mass</hi> of wealth would be expended; hence the whole order of men would be reduced to a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024076_0005_0FC31317491AA0A0"/>
level, or to a natural state, in which they would necessarily continue till the <hi>cause</hi> were removed. Which being done, by a <hi>revival</hi> of all such <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting laws,</hi> consequently the revival of the <hi>soul</hi> of society, or the grand stimulus being the <hi>cause,</hi> the natural and necessary <hi>effect</hi> will be, a rivalship <hi>who</hi> should obtain and possess the most property, and, of course, a general attention to industry, till all things again were in the highest state of improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Since <hi>necessary causes</hi> will <hi>eternally</hi> produce ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <hi>effects,</hi> the consequence will follow relative to the improvements in the arts: for who, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>great</hi> his <hi>genius,</hi> having but a competency, would spend his time and money in a series of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to mature any discovery, when, its uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity being demonstrated, <hi>every</hi> person who pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would enjoy it equally with himself, and, indeed, in most instances, in a much greater degree; for the inventor having nearly exhausted his resources, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>uld not be able, whilst others with capitals would carry it into productive effect?</p>
               <p>Besides, this would be to <hi>confine</hi> improvements to the opulent class of men, among whom <hi>real</hi> genius seldom appears.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, an <hi>effectual</hi> system being esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for securing <hi>mental</hi> property, or property in the <hi>products</hi> of <hi>genius,</hi> or for giving other ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate rewards, being a <hi>cause,</hi> acting <hi>impulsively</hi> on the genius of men, will necessarily have the <hi>happy</hi> effect to bring into active existence many useful and important discoveries.</p>
               <p>A most remarkable instance of this is recorded concerning Archimedes, an eminent mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an at Syracuse, who, in consequence of a promised reward, effected one of the most important dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
               <p>And as some of the particulars relative to this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024076_0006_0FC313189CEA2538"/>
fact, may serve as a proof of what I have advanced, it may perhaps be proper to relate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hiero,</hi> king of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> had given a workman a certain quantity of gold to make a crown, which, when done, and presented to the king, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be <hi>alloyed</hi> with silver, and wished to know the proportion, but, as it was elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, he was not <hi>disposed</hi> to have it fused for that purpose; on this, he desired <hi>Archimedes,</hi> to find the precise quantity of gold and silver which was in the crown; the king also offered a handsome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary and honorary reward for the discovery, which tho' a <hi>necessary cause,</hi> operating impulsively on the <hi>genius</hi> of Archimedes, yet a considerable time elapsed without effect; at length, however, in the moment of relaxation, he discovered the principle by the simple, tho' natural, circumstance of going into his <hi>bathing tub,</hi> which being full of water, the idea of the crown being predominant, he observed, and was forcibly impressed with the idea, that the <hi>quantity</hi> of water which his <hi>body</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, must necessarily be <hi>equal</hi> to the bulk of his body, including even the hair of his head, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that the <hi>same</hi> principle would <hi>determine</hi> the bulk of the <hi>crown,</hi> which was the first thing he wished; he was so elated with the idea, that forgetting his situation, he instantly jumped out of his bath, and ran about the house crying out, "I have found it! I have found it!" 'Tis saidthat he offered a hecatomb <note n="*" place="bottom">A sacrifice of a hundred oxen.</note> to <hi>Jupiter</hi> for having inspir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the <hi>idea.</hi> Upon which, however, he immediately proceeded to experiments, and <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi> precisely the proportion of gold and silver in Hiero's crown. Thus was discovered one of the most useful sciences, to wit, that of weighing in fluids; and, in fact, the only <hi>unerring</hi> means in nature by which the solid contents of bodies, or their specific gravity, can be determined.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:024076_0007_0FC3131A3A4A7088"/>
For this purpose <hi>alone</hi> do all enlightened nations uniformly hold out inducements to genius: Some by bounties, and others by systems for securing the right in discoveries.</p>
               <p>For this purpose the English nation have had for many years a system for securing to inventors, by letters patent for a limited time, the <hi>sole</hi> right in their respective discoveries; by means of which it has concentrated such discoveries and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the several parts of the globe, as now enables them to manufacture with such facility, in such quantities, and at so low rates as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell almost every other nation.</p>
               <p>To this it owes, not only its eminence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, but the <hi>greater</hi> part of its wealth.</p>
               <p>For this purpose, the Portuguese uniformly hold out encouragement to genius, by giving liberal bounties for any new and useful discovery.</p>
               <p>And in those cases, where the discovery is considered to be of great importance, they also confer some honorary title.<note n="*" place="bottom">But <hi>away</hi> with titles, and secure our right.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The National Assembly of France, considering the justice and utility of securing to inventors their property in the products of genius, have passed an act for that purpose in January, 1791, which, though in some instances defective, is by far the most persect of any patent system now extant.<note n="†" place="bottom">For this system the reader is referred to the National Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette from July 7th, 1792.</note> In the preamble to that act, that august and truly enlightened body thus express themselves, That <q>
                     <hi>not</hi> to regard a discovery as the property of the author, would be to <hi>attack</hi> the <hi>rights</hi> of <hi>men</hi> in their <hi>essence.</hi>
                  </q> And who, after observing that the <hi>want</hi> of such a system had tended much to discourage all improvements in France, it having caused num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their most distinguished artists to emigrate,

and carry with them into foreign countries many new inventions, by which that nation ought to have been <hi>first</hi> benefited, add, <q>In fine, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that every principle of justice, public order, and national interest, positively <hi>commands</hi> to fix for the future, the opinion of every French citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen on this species of property by <hi>law;</hi> which shall be secured, and which shall be protected.</q> This is a language <hi>worthy</hi> of freemen, of men who <hi>wish</hi> for the prosperity of their country, who <hi>well</hi> understand the rights of mankind, and by whom those rights will <hi>ever</hi> be held <hi>most sacred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis, indeed, not only, <hi>cause</hi> of great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of much regret, that the American nation, tho' <hi>first</hi> in freedom, should be last, or at least should so long protract, or <hi>hesitate</hi> to establish an <hi>effectual</hi> system, for promoting science and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts.</p>
               <p>For, 'tis acknowledged by all enlightened men who have attended to the object, and an <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced</hi> fact by some on whom it operates, that the <hi>effect</hi> of the existing patent system is infinitely worse than none: consequently, it ought, <hi>at least,</hi> to be <hi>annihilated</hi> from the archives, for the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the United States.</p>
               <p>But, there is still more reason for amazement, when it is considered, that free governments have been always found most disposed to encourage the rise and progress of science, and the arts; for this obvious reason, that in republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments <hi>merit</hi> alone is, or <hi>ought</hi> to be the <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> for character; which necessarily <hi>excites</hi> that <hi>laudable</hi> spirit of emulation, so essential in society; and which never fails to produce celebrated phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, statesmen, husbandmen and artists; the necessary effect of which, is, not only, the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of science and useful arts, but, the <hi>happiness</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024076_0009_0FC31326848B5098"/>
of men,—the primary, the grand <hi>object</hi> of their existence.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, in despotic governments, the <hi>great mass</hi> of men, are from their infancy so <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi> with the infernal yoke of tyranny, that they have <hi>not</hi> even time to acquire useful knowledge; of necessity, they <hi>want,</hi> not only, the <hi>means,</hi> but the <hi>propensity</hi> to make useful researches.</p>
               <p>Besides, 'tis a fact acknowledged by the most <hi>celebrated</hi> philosophers, that in a <hi>precise ratio</hi> as the human species are <hi>degraded,</hi> so <hi>equally</hi> are their minds: which is but the <hi>consequent</hi> effect, from the <hi>cause;</hi> to wit, the <hi>annihilation</hi> of all <hi>rewards</hi> for <hi>merit,</hi> consequently, of all laudable motives.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, it is a fact <hi>equally</hi> acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that the <hi>genius</hi> of men is <hi>exalted</hi> in the same ratio with their persons. In republican govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, there are many instances <hi>demonstrative</hi> of this principle; as for example, certain individuals, by a chain of fortunate circumstances, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themselves famous in some particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; happy in the esteem of their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and anxious to merit the continuance of it, they will make the greatest exertions, and thus become truly celebrated: whereas, but for <hi>this cause,</hi> they would have remained common citizens.</p>
               <p>All these circumstances tend to demonstrate, that, <hi>free</hi> governments are the only <hi>asylum</hi> and nursery for <hi>science</hi> and the <hi>arts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philosophy</hi> being the <hi>source</hi> of liberty—<hi>liberty,</hi> of all the <hi>improvements</hi> in science and the arts; the improvements in science and the arts, of all the <hi>real accomplishments</hi> of the human species; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>philosophy</hi> is <hi>essentially</hi> the source of all vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue<note n="*" place="bottom">Virtue, indefinitely, comprehends all the <hi>praise-worthy</hi> acts of the human species.</note>—virtue, of all the happiness of the men kind.

                  <hi>more</hi> than a proportionable advantage from a <hi>perfect</hi> system assuring <hi>mental</hi> property, or property in the products of genius, than from an equally-perfect system for assuring <hi>local</hi> property; I proceed as follows—</p>
               <p n="1">1. Discoveries, however important in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have their origin, and <hi>exist</hi> but in the minds, and, consequently, are <hi>exclusively</hi> the property of those who have conceived them: it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, if sufficient inducement be <hi>not</hi> held out by a system, or by other means, to excite such genius to <hi>disclose</hi> their discoveries, they will, of necessity, <hi>sink</hi> into oblivion at the death of the inventors; consequently, society will lose the benefit which would have resulted from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a well known fact, that patents for secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>mental</hi> property, or property in the <hi>products</hi> of <hi>genius,</hi> of however great utility, are granted for but a <hi>limited</hi> time; after which the discoveries, which are the objects of them, become <hi>common</hi> property; of course, every person, who may have occasion, in addition to his usual stock of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will <hi>avail</hi> himself of their advantages; by means of which, the whole mass of the people will be benefited, in a certain ratio.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, patents for <hi>land</hi> are granted to the locators, their heirs and assigns, for <hi>ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Suppose, for instance, a person to have made such discovery, or improvement in the arts, that by the aid thereof <hi>one</hi> man could raise from his land a quantity of produce equal to that, which, <hi>previously,</hi> would have required <hi>two</hi> men to effect; it follows, that by means of such discovery, the addition to the <hi>net</hi> produce of the sum total of the local property, would be as 1 to 2.</p>
               <p>Even, upon a more moderate calculation, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, by the aid of such art, three men would only be enabled to effect as much as four men other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024076_0012_0FC31334640EE560"/>
could do, he would add to the <hi>net</hi> product of the sum of local property, as 1 to 4.</p>
               <p>Again, supposing a <hi>genius</hi> to have made such discovery or improvement in hydraulics, as to <hi>cause</hi> an <hi>equal</hi> quantity of water, under <hi>equal</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to produce <hi>twice</hi> the effect, which <hi>otherwise</hi> can be produced, (and proofs are not wanting, of this improvement being now accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished;) and, suppose the relative number of mills in the United States, to be 1 for every 50 farms, and that the average product of the mills were but <hi>equal</hi> to the average product of the farms; it is obvious by such discovery he will add to the <hi>net</hi> product of the sum of local property, as 1 to 50.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, supposing a man to have locat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, surveyed and patented a tract of uncultivated land, and cultivated the same; and suppose there exists in the United States 500,000 <hi>equally</hi> culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated farms (which, agreeably to the census, is nearly one farm for every eight persons), he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by adds to the <hi>net</hi> product of the sum of local pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but as 1 to 500,000; from which, to find the <hi>ratio</hi> in which society is <hi>more</hi> benefited by such discovery, than by such additional farm, we need only divide 500,000 by 50, and we will find the quotient to be 10,000. So that the <hi>ratio</hi> in which society is benefited in the <hi>former,</hi> to the <hi>ratio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in the <hi>latter,</hi> is, as 10,000 to 1; consequently, he who made such discovery, has rendered <hi>service</hi> to society, greater, than he who added such tract of land, in the same <hi>advanced</hi> ratio. And, as <hi>servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> rendered to society ought to be the <hi>only stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> of <hi>merit,</hi> it follows, that the former is entitled to <hi>merit</hi> in proportion to his <hi>superior</hi> services.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>demonstrative</hi> instance is, the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the manufacturing of flour, by Mr. Oliver Evans, as represented by a writer in the Delaware Gazette; who observes, <q>It must afford great
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024076_0013_0FC31335D9A1CC50"/>
pleasure to the friends of the American manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, to see the rapid improvements, which, within these few years, have been made in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinery, within the United States; nor, can <hi>too</hi> much praise be given to those individuals, who, notwithstanding the numerous <hi>obstacles</hi> which present themselves against new inventions, in a <hi>young</hi> country, by study and perseverance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete valuable machines.</q> After passing some encomiums on said Evans's mill, further observes, <q>From a certificate lately published in the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware Gazette, signed by Messrs. Shallcross and Stroud, it appears, that four men, with the aid of Mr. Evans's machinery, will do the business of <hi>two</hi> mills, with as much ease as four men, without them, did the business of <hi>one</hi> mill; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by saving one half the labor.<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of the principal Brandywine millers informed the author, that Mr. Evans's machinery saved them, <hi>at least,</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half the manual labour, otherwise necessary.</note> In consequence of which, if we suppose 2000 mills in the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States,<note n="†" place="bottom">This calculation gives 133 mills to each state, which, tho' considerably short of the total number, in all probability <hi>exceeds</hi> the number which will adopt the improvements.</note> each to have adopted said machinery, and by means of which two men are saved in each mill, there will be a saving of the labor of 4000 men at 200 dollars per annum, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to a saving of 800,000 dollars annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q> Though this calculation is extravagant, yet 'tis possible; therefore tends to demonstrate the proposed object. Even supposing the said cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations to be much more moderate, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages society will receive, from said improvements, will nevertheless be in a much greater ratio than those derived from a common citizen; and hence the inventor is entitled to <hi>merit,</hi> in proportion to his superior services.</p>

To which it may <hi>not</hi> be improper to add, a state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conformably to the latest British writers, of the amazing number of persons employed in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manufactures in England, consequent on the great improvements made in, and degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to which the arts are carried in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>'Tis said, that Mr. Peele, member of the House of Commons for Tamworth, &amp; Co. employ, in their manufactory at Manchester, from 19 to 20,000 work-people.</p>
               <p>That Messrs. Philips &amp; Co. employ from 12 to 15,000 ditto.</p>
               <p>That Sir Richard Arkwright,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Richard Arkwright invented the machine for spinning, reeling, and twisting of silk and cotton, for which he obtained a patent, and with which, in the course of seven years, before his patent was made void, consequent on his having made some addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he had not specified, he made a competency; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless continues his manufactures in that business.</note> in his cotton ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactory, employs from 8 to 9,000 persons.</p>
               <p>That, Mr. Wodgwood, in his potteries, about 20,000 persons.</p>
               <p>That, Messrs. Barclay &amp; Co. about 1,000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>That, Messrs. Bolton and Watt,<note n="†" place="bottom">Messrs.

               <p>These various manufactures are of much a greater advantage to the people of England, than almost any person can at first conceive; for, exclusive of the amazing wealth brought into the country for articles exported, they <hi>cause</hi> a considerable trade in the several parts of the country with each other, by means of which the people are, not only reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024076_0015_0FC3134416420B38"/>
accommodated, but benefited: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if the country trader sells to the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer any <hi>rude</hi> material to the amount of 20<hi>s.</hi> and in exchange receives goods on which he clears 5<hi>s.</hi> he undoubtedly gains 25 per cent.—and, on the other part, if the latter sells the manufactured ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, made of the 20s. worth of rude material, for 25<hi>s.</hi> he also makes 25 per cent.; consequently, each party has an equal balance of trade in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. Which, necessarily adds 100 per cent <hi>more</hi> to the <hi>net</hi> product, than if either the <hi>rude</hi> mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, or the <hi>manufactured</hi> article was imported from any foreign country; which, of course, is so much added to the wealth of the individuals concerned. Hence, (according to the previous position, that, in the same ratio in which each individual's wealth is to the <hi>sum</hi> of individuals wealth, will the nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al society be benefited by his prosperity, or the contrary, by his adversity) the <hi>nation</hi> must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily in a <hi>ratio</hi> thereto be benefited.</p>
               <p>Exclusive of the above reasons, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive <hi>fully demonstrate</hi> the intended <hi>object;</hi> and, exclusive of the natural and <hi>equal</hi> right which inventors have to <hi>claim</hi> of society to have property secured in the <hi>products</hi> of their <hi>genius,</hi> as in the products of industry or local property; each Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican citizen has a <hi>constitutional</hi> right to claim that his property in the products of his genius, should be secured by the National Legislature.</p>
               <p>And, it being, not only, an acknowledged, but an <hi>experienced fact,</hi> that, the existing system pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the <hi>contrary</hi> of the intended effect; 'tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his indispensible duty, constantly to solicit till the <hi>object</hi> shall be obtained.</p>
               <p>It has been already proved, that great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges would accrue to society, from the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a proper patent system: and, as there is not a possibility that any loss should arise from it,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024076_0016_0FC3134887BCA2F8"/>
either to the public or to any individual, it is somewhat surprising, that there should be any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it. That <hi>no</hi> evil can accrue from it, is obvious from the following considerations—</p>
               <p>First, Because they are left in <hi>full</hi> possession of every thing of which they <hi>ever</hi> were possessed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Because, it being <hi>optional</hi> with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic or the people, the inventor must necessarily make it <hi>their interest</hi> to purchase his discovery, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they surely would not; consequently, he would derive <hi>no</hi> benefit from it. Hence, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic have <hi>no</hi> more to apprehend from establishing a system for securing <hi>mental,</hi> than from a system for securing <hi>local property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since, therefore, the <hi>fact</hi> is, that the public <hi>cannot</hi> be injured, but may be <hi>greatly</hi> benefited; <hi>surely</hi> the <hi>utility</hi> of the object must appear <hi>too</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, to every intelligent being, to admit of <hi>any</hi> further hesitation.</p>

               <p>In this there is something so contradictory to the very first <hi>principles</hi> of justice, that one would think there would be little occasion for arguments to induce the national Legislature to pass an act for the protection of this most valuable of all proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as it is, nor only, of the highest value to the proprietor, but to society in general.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>not</hi> sufficient as provided in the 5th section of said bill, that such inventor can make <hi>void</hi> a patent for a discovery, having been <hi>filched</hi> from him; because, this would be but <hi>negative</hi> patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage—but <hi>negative</hi> reward indeed for <hi>merit;</hi> more especially as he had <hi>not</hi> been a defaulter, had <hi>not</hi> committed a crime; consequently had <hi>not</hi> given <hi>any cause</hi> on which the public could have the <hi>least</hi> right to found a plea to <hi>forfeit</hi> his rightful property in the <hi>products</hi> of his <hi>genius;</hi> a genius which he had received—<hi>not</hi> of men, but of the great GENI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>US of Nature. Wherefore, consistently with every <hi>possible</hi> construction of <hi>equity,</hi> the <hi>great standard rule of right,</hi> such inventor ought <hi>equally</hi> to have his property secured in his discovery, having been so filched from him, and patented by another person, provided he shall have commenced the action within one year after the date of such patent, by which the same was made <hi>void,</hi> as though it had <hi>not</hi> been so filched, patented, and made void. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>intuitively</hi> appear to every intelligent mind, to be essential to the <hi>purpose</hi> of the bill, that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso be added, to the 9th section, giving the <hi>true</hi> inventor, who shall have been supplanted, one year to come forward and commence an action, to make <hi>void</hi> a patent for his discovery, having been so obtained, and to <hi>obtain</hi> one in his own name for the same thing.</p>

Note—The first specified exception, being obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the provision suggested to supply the first deficiency, I therefore pass it.</p>
               <p>Relative to the second specified exception; as this <hi>also</hi> relates to one of the principal objects of the bill, I beg leave to observe, that the <hi>m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>de</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the 8th section, in and by which all <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> claims for patents shall be determined, is <hi>highly</hi> ineligible: first, because it will be attended with much greater <hi>delay</hi> and <hi>expence</hi> than claimants for patents are generally able to bear, it being a <hi>known</hi> fact, that inventors generally have been, and are rather <hi>necessitous,</hi> and, in fact, their disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of <hi>necessity;</hi> for, as the great first and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual CAUSE of all existing order, relative to men, must have <hi>instruments</hi> to bring into effect his <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and having proposed to cause new and useful arts to be introduced into the world, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and happiness of men, and, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired certain men, on the several parts of the globe, with <hi>inventive</hi> talents, he, of course, so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders their <hi>local</hi> circumstances, as <hi>necessarily</hi> to induce them to <hi>exert</hi> their <hi>mental</hi> faculties; and <hi>thus</hi> useful arts are introduced.</p>
               <p>This being the <hi>fate</hi> of an inventor, it will by <hi>no</hi> means suit his circumstances, after having come seven or eight hundred miles to the seat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to claim a patent for his discovery, upon any persons presenting a caveat, however groundless, to be obliged to wait the next supreme, or circuit court of the United States, and give bond and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to prosecute his <hi>rightful</hi> claim, and to pay such <hi>costs</hi> as may be incurred; in addition to which, to run the risk, in case of default, of losing his discovery:—This, indeed, would create a <hi>source</hi> of evil; suppose, for instance, the meritorious tho' necessitous inventor having thus come forward, fond of every appearance of patronage, to have
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024076_0021_0FC313579E9DE018"/>
communicated his discovery to a designing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary character, who, being impressed with its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, shall have indirectly, in another's name, presented a caveat to stay the issue of the patent to such inventor, and the matter and decision of course referred to the next supreme or circuit court of the United States. Pray, what would be the consequence? Such inventor being <hi>discouraged</hi> at the idea of the <hi>procrastination,</hi> which would neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be the result of such litigation; and having employed an attorney, though with but a <hi>small</hi> stimulus, would dejectedly return to his obscure residence; and such pecuniary character being present with his influence, would, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>cause</hi> the trial to be put off till some circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance should <hi>cause</hi> a default on the part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor, then the <hi>adverse</hi> party having obtained a copy of the same, and presented it to the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of State, would, <hi>instead</hi> of the inventor, obtain a patent for the thing in question.</p>
               <p>Since such the <hi>negative</hi> patronage of the law, should the bill pass in its present form, <hi>hard</hi> indeed would be the fate of the inventor.</p>
               <p>Again, 'tis a well known fact, at least, by all who understand the subject, that, in all instances of interfering claims for patents, for any new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, the <hi>first</hi> question or <hi>inquiry,</hi> is, to <hi>determine</hi> whether the discovery so claimed, be <hi>substantially</hi> the <hi>same,</hi> both in <hi>principle</hi> and <hi>operation;</hi> which involves the most complicated philosophical and mechanical principles; and, 'tis <hi>equally</hi> a well known fact, that a jury is <hi>entirely</hi> incompetent to make such enquiry, consequently, to <hi>determine</hi> such question.</p>
               <p>To enforce this fact, I beg leave to <hi>query,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the House of Representatives, the collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wisdom of the United States, twelve gentlemen could be selected, who would be fully competent
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024076_0022_0FC3136012D64018"/>
                  <hi>rightly</hi> to decide on such <hi>principles:</hi> if, then, it be admitted, that twelve men selected from 360,000 persons, would <hi>not</hi> be competent; pray, what would be the decision of twelve men chosen in any town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? surely superficial and improper—<hi>not</hi> philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical—<hi>not</hi> mechanical <hi>enquiries,</hi> but <hi>facts</hi> are the <hi>sole</hi> object of a jury, and in which alone it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent. The <hi>law</hi> must specify the <hi>penalty,</hi> and the jury having enquired into and determined the facts, the penalty lies of course.</p>
               <p>Since, therefore, the mode proposed in said bill, for deciding interfering claims for patents, will be attended with great expence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> protraction, and risk to the real inventor—since it is an <hi>axiom</hi> in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and mechanics, it must be <hi>equally</hi> so in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, to wit, that the <hi>most simple</hi> is the <hi>most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> mode of effecting any object—since a few philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical mechanists can in most cities be selected, who would be <hi>fully</hi> competent to determine the most minute distinctions in the most involved prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which may occur—and, since a <hi>reference</hi> to such characters, would be, not only, the <hi>most</hi> sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>least</hi> expensive, and <hi>most</hi> speedy, but the <hi>most certain</hi> and <hi>equitable</hi> mode of determining interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing claims for patents for mental property; in the name of <hi>simplicity,</hi> and <hi>equity,</hi> why not adopt this mode? that is, in all instances, interfering claims for patents shall be determined by <hi>referees</hi> chosen by the parties, as follows, to wit, each party to chuse one, and in case of disagreement, they two shall choose the third, whose decision shall be final.</p>
               <p>Relative to the third specified exception; from the face of <hi>this</hi> 10th section, 'tis in full demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a <hi>tax</hi> is contemplated on the <hi>American</hi> GENIUS. I therefore beg leave to query: If this was <hi>contemplated</hi> by the people, in their original character, who formed the <hi>federal</hi> constitution?
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024076_0023_0FC3136434298BD0"/>
If this be the mode to promote the progress of use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts? If this be the means to <hi>foster</hi> and <hi>nurse</hi> the <hi>infant,</hi> the <hi>growing genius</hi> of America? Surely <hi>not,</hi> but the contrary. The extensiveness of the territory of these United States, the <hi>novelty</hi> of the arts, and the <hi>want</hi> of experience of the utility of the same, are <hi>demonstrative</hi> reasons <hi>against</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated tax.</p>
               <p>In addition to which, the <hi>time</hi> which will <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily</hi> be required, and the <hi>money</hi> expended in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the people of America, who are scattered over such an <hi>expanse</hi> of country, of the utility of any new art, however important, <hi>before</hi> it can be introduced into such general use as to be advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to the public, or productive to the inventor, is, another <hi>equally</hi> demonstrative reason <hi>against</hi> the proposed tax.</p>
               <p>Finally, in fact, the public have <hi>no</hi> right, <hi>neither</hi> natural <hi>nor</hi> constitutional, to <hi>oblige</hi> any person to <hi>pay</hi> for his discovery, for the following <hi>obvious</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to wit, The property or right in a discovery being exclusively the inventor's, having had its origin, and existing but in his mind; it follows, that a system for securing property in the products of genius, is a <hi>mutual</hi> contract between the <hi>inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and the <hi>public,</hi> in which the <hi>inventor</hi> agrees, on <hi>proviso</hi> that the public will secure to him his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in, and the exclusive use of his discovery for a limited time, he will, at the expiration of such time, <hi>cede</hi> his right in the same to the public: thenceforth the discovery is common right, being the compensation required by the public, stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the contract, for having thus secured the same.</p>
               <p>The inventors, however, will most chearfully pay to the officer who shall be employed in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out patents, a sum fully adequate to his time
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024076_0024_0FC3136520CA8030"/>
and attention; because they do <hi>not</hi> solicit any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, but their <hi>constitutional</hi> right, of their Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives in Congress.</p>

            <head>NOTES, RELATIVE TO THE DEFICIENCY OF THE EXISTING PATENT SYSTEM; TENDING TO DEMONSTRATE THE NECESSITY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN EFFECTUAL SYSTEM.</head>
            <p>FROM the deficiency of said system, added to the <hi>indeterminate</hi> principle upon which patents are granted under the same, <hi>no</hi> property is secured in any new discovery, however important in its nature, for the following obvious reasons; to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>penalty</hi> which the existing patent law inflicts on any person who shall have construct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without licence, any patented machine, or art, being <hi>only</hi> such damages as a jury <hi>may</hi> assess, will <hi>not</hi> amount to a prohibition; for, 'tis a well-known fact, that the people, in the remote parts of the states, for <hi>want</hi> of <hi>right</hi> information, are opposed to all patent rights, upon this principle, that <hi>they</hi> conceive them to be <hi>monopolies:</hi> in consequence of which, should one of their neighbours construct, for instance, one of J. R.'s improved mills, by which they were <hi>really</hi> benefited, it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, they would <hi>not</hi> be disposed to assess damages against such neighbour; therefore, in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a jury of them would bring in a verdict of <hi>one dime</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Equal to Ninepence.</note> damages in favor of the patentee, as an <hi>indication</hi> for him, <hi>not</hi> to visit them again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because, consequent on a resolution of the existing patent board, patents are granted to <hi>two</hi> 
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:024076_0026_0FC3136C9C4DE538"/>
or more persons at the <hi>same</hi> time, purporting to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to each the <hi>sole</hi> property in the <hi>same thing;</hi> and, of course, if any number of others were to apply, they would <hi>all</hi> obtain patents for the <hi>same</hi> object. In consequence of which, the <hi>original</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor is under the <hi>unhappy</hi> necessity of going throughout the Union to seek, bring actions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such patentees, and make <hi>void</hi> their patents, or they will respectively enjoy, in his discovery, <hi>equal</hi> benefits with himself; which, however, they will do till such actions shall be determined. And, should <hi>he</hi> be so circumstanced, as <hi>not</hi> to be able to prosecute the suits (which, as the law now stands, may often happen), he must submit to live in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence and obscurity, whilst the other, who has <hi>filched</hi> from him his property, may arrive at afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and independence.</p>
            <p>Even suppose the original inventor to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sources sufficient to prosecute actions against <hi>all</hi> those who shall have obtained patents co-equal with, and after his patent for the same discovery—Pray, what would be the consequence? That, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, with all his <hi>efforts,</hi> he would <hi>not</hi> get such actions decided in <hi>less</hi> than two years; in the mean while, all such <hi>subversive</hi> patentees, conscious of <hi>not</hi> being the real inventors, would exert their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>most</hi> powers to dispose of as many privileges as possible, and at such <hi>low</hi> premiums as would, not only effectually prevent the real inventor from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of any, during such periods, but, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence thereof, the public would be so generally possessed of his discovery, that it would produce him but little, if any thing, after he shall have <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> a determination of all such actions; suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>no</hi> other persons, during such period, shall have obtained patents essentially interfering with his discovery. But, the presumption being, that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> such interfering patents would be obtained dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024076_0027_0FC3136E15C51AD8"/>
such period, of necessity, such <hi>litigations</hi> would end <hi>but</hi> with his <hi>patent term.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, supposing the latter part of his patent term to be <hi>free</hi> from litigation, yet, in consequence of there being equal to <hi>no</hi> penalty for the <hi>violation</hi> of his patent-right, the public would possess themselves of his discovery, of which he therefore could <hi>not</hi> dispossess them, consequently, he could derive <hi>no</hi> benefit from his discovery the latter part of the term on that account.</p>
            <p>So, that from the <hi>whole,</hi> under the existing system an <hi>original</hi> inventor has <hi>not</hi> the <hi>least</hi> grounds on which he can rest a hope of obtaining any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage or profit from his discovery.</p>
            <p>But, on the contrary, when such inventor <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts</hi> to the <hi>complicated</hi> scene of <hi>litigation,</hi> into which he must, of necessity, be involved, and which will necessarily exhaust <hi>all</hi> his resources and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable time; in this <hi>dilemma,</hi> notwithstanding all his <hi>efforts</hi> of <hi>genius,</hi> his <hi>time</hi> and <hi>money</hi> expended in bringing into active existence and maturing his discovery, and notwithstanding its importance and promising utility, he will <hi>necessarily</hi> be induced, as the <hi>least</hi> evil, to <hi>chuse</hi> the disagreeable alternative of desisting, or giving up his pursuit, and of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some other more <hi>peaceful</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> vocation.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>unhappy</hi> predicament stands J. R. in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense! from which he can <hi>only</hi> be relieved by the most speedy establishment of an effectual system; otherwise, his <hi>rightful</hi> property in the <hi>products</hi> of his <hi>genius</hi> will be irrecoverably involved, or so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, that it would be <hi>impossible</hi> for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it again to <hi>any</hi> advantage.</p>
            <p>☞ J. R. has very great <hi>cause</hi> to complain, not only of the <hi>negative</hi> patronage of the United States, relative to his discoveries, but, from the <hi>principle</hi> upon which patents have been
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024076_0028_0FC31376384AACD0"/>
granted, they have <hi>violated</hi> his rights in the same; in that, thereby they have <hi>equally</hi> vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and secured to <hi>other</hi> persons, the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> in <hi>his discoveries,</hi> which he had previously secured in two of the most important states, by legislative grants, under a <hi>positive</hi> penalty of one hundred pounds, exclusive of jury dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for a violation of his rights in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, secured by such grants; and that, <hi>too,</hi> for the above specified reasons, <hi>without</hi> the means of recovering the same.</p>

                  <p>First, On proof being given of his <hi>not</hi> having specified the <hi>true</hi> means of producing the <hi>proposed effect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, On proof being given of his having obtained a patent for a discovery which shall have been in <hi>use,</hi> or deposited, or published in any print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed work <hi>anterior</hi> to the period at which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to have made such discovery.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, On proof being given of his having obtained a patent <hi>simply</hi> for a change of the form, or proportions of any machine in <hi>free</hi> use, or <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented;</hi> or of his <hi>not</hi> having discovered a <hi>new</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in any composition of matter which shall have been free, or patented.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:024076_0031_0FC3137EA4862C88"/>
Fourthly, On proof being given, of his having obtained a patent <hi>surreptitiously,</hi> for another's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; provided that if in any and every such instance, in which the action shall have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced within one year after the date of such pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the <hi>first</hi> discoverer shall be entitled to obtain a patent for the <hi>same</hi> thing, having been by him discovered.</p>

               <p>To demonstrate the necessity of creating the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed officer, it will be sufficient to observe, that, no withstanding the <hi>acknowledged</hi> abilities of the Secretary of State,<note n="*" place="bottom">The virtuous T. Jefferson.</note> whom the aforesaid proposed bill contemplates to be the patent officer; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and importance of the business of his office, at this time, requiring his <hi>whole</hi> attention, of course, he must necessarily order patents to issue to all applicants without any enquiry relative to, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther merit, or originality; the consequence of which will be, that patents will often be granted for <hi>assumed</hi> discoveries, or for things which are <hi>not</hi> new: hence the public will frequently be involved in unnecessary and expensive litigations, in suing for their own property or right. Which would, not only, be <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>purpose</hi> of the patent system, but to that which ought to be the <hi>standard</hi> maxim in legislation, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
                  <hi>not</hi> in any instance to make it the <hi>interest</hi> of any person to do wrong, that is to say, to do any thing <hi>offensive</hi> or <hi>injurious</hi> to society; but <hi>ever</hi> the contrary.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>evils</hi> will be almost, if not wholly avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the existence of the proposed officer, having competent abilities, whose <hi>duty</hi> it shall be, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to issuing a patent, to enquire, so far as he can

conveniently obtain the means, whether the thing <hi>

               <p>And to whose judgment interfering claimants will generally submit the decision of their claims, because, it will be the most simple, speedy, and least expensive mode. And who shall receive for his compensation a limited fee for each patent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. B.</hi> It will, however, be most <hi>consistent</hi> with the above <hi>standard maxim,</hi> for the money to be received into the treasury, and the patent officer to have an equivalent salary, paid out of the treasury of the United States.</p>
