            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Flemish</hi> Farmers are so thoroughly convinced of this, that in their light and drier Soils, they make no Trenches, but commonly lay down whole Fields, as flat and even as a Bowling-Green; and this in order to retain all the Moisture they can get, and thereby protect their Crop from the Dryness and Heat of Summer, I have now finished what I think necessary to be said concerning the Choice of Soils, and the Manner of preparing them for Flax. Upon the whole, there is no Room to doubt, that were the Method I have pointed at diligently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, the succeeding Profit and Advantage would abun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I proceed at present to give you my Thoughts upon the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of good Flax-Seed, and the Time and Manner of sowing it. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is plainer, than that the Farmer cannot be too nice in the Choice of his Seed, since the Value of his Crop must chiefly depend upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>

                     </gap> Goodness. In general, the shortest, plumpest, thickest, oilyest, heaviest Seed, of a bright brown Colour, is esteemed the best. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Boor is very exact in examining these several Qualities, and makes his Trials in the following Manner. In order to discover it's Thickness, he takes a large Handful, and squeezes it until the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ges appear plainly between his Finger and Thumb; for it is intirely from the Edge he forms his Judgment in that particular. To try it's Weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, he throws a Handful into a Glass of Water; if it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nks soon, he is sure it is heavy and good; if otherwise, he judges it unfit for his Purpose. To examine it's O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lyness, he throws a Quantity into the Fire; if it blaze soon, and crackle much, he thinks he may depend upon it. After all, he sometimes sows it in a Hot-bed, and in short, leaves no Method un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried, which will insure him that his Seed is of the best Kind.</p>
                  <p>I have only mentioned these minute Circumstances, to shew how curious we ought to be in the Choice of our Seed.</p>

What I have now to add is an Advice of great Importance to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and particularly so to the Flax Farmer; namely, not to depend on a Succession of good Seed from the same Soil. The best Clays will not preserve the Seed from degenerating by Degrees, if it be sown for a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Time on the same Kind of Soil, from which it has been sav'd. It loseth every where something of it's Goodness by that Management; and though less in Clays than in any other Ground, yet even in those it will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally decay. For that Reason it is necessary in all Soils to change the Seed; and the more frequently it is done, the better, The common Rule in this case is, to buy from lighter Grounds to sow on Clay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, and to buy from clayey Soils to sow on lighter Grounds; and the Rule, well understood, is undoubtedly a good one. But as I am perfectly convinced that light Grounds do not afford good Seed, I must beg Leave to explain the Rule at large, and prevent all Mistakes about it. Where the Farmer intends to raise a good Crop of Flax-Seed, he must avoid light, dry, and sandy Grounds. They are never to be used with any other purpose, than to procure fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m. 'Tis not therefore those light Lands that can be dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ange. The Farmer who expects good Seed, must confine himself to Clays of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent sorts, which will afford sufficient Room for Change. The Seed raised in the stiffer Kind will be best sown on the loos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have been the more particular on this Point; because the common Prejudices entertained in this Country against Clays, appear to me of very pernicious consequence. They so materially affect our Linnen trade, that no Pains can be bestowed to more Advantage, than those whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I shall therefore add, to what I have hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from the Practice of other Countries, a remarkable Instance of the Usefulness of clayey Soils in this Kingdom. 'Tis known, that the <hi>Corcus</hi> Lands in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> are deep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> strong Clays. An experiment was made some time ago, to determine what Effect they would have upon decay'd Seed.

                  <p>THE next Article to be considered by the Flax-Farmer, is the Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Seed which he ought to sow. And here it will be proper to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>own. For, should a smaller Parcel of good Seed be made use of, it will yield a plentiful Crop of good Seed and strong Flax: But should the Farmer sow a larger Quantity of the same Goodness, his Flax would indeed be finer, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncrease great, but then his Seed would be much less valuable. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> who are not at all apprehensive of wanting Seed, generally practise the latter Method. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Were I therefore to advise, I should choose to recommend the former Method, until we had brought our Seed to an equal Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Plenty. Upon the Whole, a great deal must be referred to the Discretion of the Farmer, and an Allowance made for the Difference of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Every Flax-Farmer, I believe, is sufficiently apprized, that good Weather and a wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet we do not seem to have sufficiently attended to this particular in <hi>Ireland</hi>; otherwise we should not, as is generally done, defer the sowing of Flax-seed until the Spring is so very far advanced. In order to rectify this Error, it would be adviseable to sow the Seed the first good Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Since I am engaged in giving Directions for sowing of Flax, I hope I shall be forgiven a short Digression, which may be very useful to the Farmer; when he designs to lay down his Lands, he may safely sow Clover or other Grass-seeds, a few D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ys after his Flax seed. The Clover is so far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing Flax, that it is ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erved to be of remarkable service to it. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that it preserves the Dew and Rain about it's Roots, and shelters the Ground around them from the Heat of the Sun; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e that the cause or not, long Experience has demonstrated, that they thrive perfectly well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Clover producing a good Crop of Grass soon after the Flax is pull'd. This Method is constantly practised in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> with good Success, and therefore I can recommend the Use of it amongst our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>I have very little to observe about the Manner of sowing Flax seed, I shall just take Notice, that the Seeds man must go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er this, if he intends to lay down his Grounds, he must sow his Grass seeds, and cover them by Bush-harrowing and Rolling; the Manner of doing which is so well known already, that I need not enlarge upon it. For the same Reason I need say little upon weeding the Flax: It must be done at the time when it is between two and five Inches high. The Treading upon it with the Heels of Shoes will prejudice the Flax, but sitting upon it will do it no Harm.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the Consideration of an Article of the greatest consequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from it's Quantity and Quality, by being allowed to ripen. Upon a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Computation, the Farmer who pulls green loseth, besides his Seed, more than half of his Flax crop; his weak green Flax breaks under the dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, runs to Tow, and disappoints him of his Quantity; and what is still of more Importance, the little he has is every Way inferior to what it would have been, had he suffer'd it to stand 'til it were ripe.

In general, when the Field appears of a bright Yellow, inclining a little to the Lemon Colour, 'tis Time to try the Seed of a few Stalks, which, when arrived to it's Maturity, will be found firm and full like that of other Plants, and of a light brown Colour.

By this Disposition the Flax receives the full Benefit of the Sun and Air, and is preserved from the Damage it would sustain by Rain. This is the Method constantly practised in uncertain dropping Seasons; but should the Weather be settled and very good, and the Farmer desirous of making his Flax expeditiously, all he has to do is to lay it in Handfuls on the Ground, and turn it frequently, carefully observing to keep the Ends regular. If the Weather continues fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, twelve or fourteen Days generally suffice for this part of the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Work; but if it be showery, the Flax must lie in the little Heape be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described about eighteen or twenty Days, and sometimes longer, until it be sufficiently made, and then it is bundled up for Carriage.</p>
                  <p>It has been recommended to our Farmers, in some Instructions published with your Approbation, and made a Condition of their Contracts with the Linnen-Board, That they should stack the Flax immediately from the Field, and keep it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Holland</hi> the Flax is never stacked at all, either rippled or unrippled.

                  <p>AS I have chiefly confin'd myself in the Course of these Letters to the Use of Arguments, drawn from the Practice of other Countries, I shall not engage very far in those of another Kind to shew the Disadvantages of stacking the Flax unrippled. I am indeed convinc'd, and so will every one I believe, who seriously considers it, that the Seed can receive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o Benefit from a sapless dry Stalk, which retains no Moisture, and consequently no Nourishment, if it has been made with proper Care. But as I have often wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Considerations of this Kind, I hope to be excused by the more curious Observers upon Nature, if I continue to do so at present. There are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against this Practice more obv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>es, and for that very Reason of more general Use. Upon these I choose to let the Matter rest, and beg Leave to insist upon each of them distinctly.</p>
                  <p>The Receipt inserted in the Society's former Instructions, to destroy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in the Stacks of unrippled Flax, is a sufficient Proof that they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of an Inconvenience in stacking the Seed and Flax together. They were sensible this Practice would invite Rats and Mice to make their Nests among the Flax, and accordingly prescrib'd a Remedy. I have not heard with what Success it has been tried, but I must beg Leave to think, 'twould be a more prudent Cond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

The Vermin must make their Way to the Poison through the Flax, and cut and mangle it before they meet their Bane; and therefore, notwithstanding all Precautions, the Farmer is visibly a Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by this Method, and must lose a considerable Portion of his Flax. Should Vermin come at his Seed, when it is separated from the Stalk; which howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is more easily prevented since they have no Concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hazards of pernicious Damps, when you have both Stalks and Seed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Nor is it less notorious, that notwithstanding all Precautions, the Heart of a large Stack may be considerably damaged before any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. And in the third particular, the Disproportion is still plainer: —A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

These are Inconveniencies inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to this Method in all Seasons, and in unsettled Weather they become intolerable. Some Harvests are so wet, that it is hardly possible perfectly to make the Flax; and should the Farmer at such Times be prepossessed with the Necessity of stacking, he has scarce a single Chance to save his Crop.

                  <p>The Delays which attend this practice afford another and an unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Argument against it. The watering of the Flax is prevented for one Seaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urn, one of the greatest Encouragements to Trade, is lost in some Degree to every Person concerned in our Staple, and intirely so to the poor Farmer. The Sale of his Flax and Seed being delayed 'til <hi>January,</hi> comes too late to pay his Rent, and defray the necessery Expence of preparing his Lands for the next Crop; or should he borrow to answer those Demands, he must pay an heavy Interest for his own, which eats out his little profit. Let us suppose a Farmer has twenty Acres under Flax, if the Land be good and well prepared, and the Season fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, his Crop at a moderate computation is worth five hundred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and consequently the half Year's Interest, which he loseth by bad Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, amounts to fifteen Pounds. Few Farmers can bear so considerable a Draw back upon their Profit, and I can see no Reason to encourage them to do it. The only shadow of an Argument in favour of this Method is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from a supposition that the Seed is the better for it; and this grounded upon the Farmer's practice in his Wheat, which he generally sows immediately from the Flail. But as it is impossible to assign any Reason for this Assertion from the Nature of the Thing, so the Presumption drawn from the practice of our Husbandmen is intirely built on a Mistake 'Tis not from Choice, but from Necessity, that the Farmer pursues that Method. The sowing Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son comes so close upon his Harvest, that he has no Time to spare; and if he will sow Wheat at all, he must do it from the Threshing-floor. In other Grains the ease is different, and so also is the practice; and I never heard that any understanding Husbandman objected to Seed of the same Season from it's being thresh'd too early. The Seed therefore, by any Thing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the Bunn ferments with Ease, before it has had Time to harden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Harle, by a necessary Consequence, comes out the stronger and the finer. The sole Design of watering the Flax is to rot the Bunn in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that it may part more readily from the Harle; and the sooner the Flax can be brought into a proper State for that only End intended, 'tis certainly so much the better. When it remains a considerable Time in Water, the Harle itself ferments, suffers considerably in strength and softness, and at last will rot together with the Bunn. Too long watering therefore is evidently pernicious, and yet by slacking the Flax unrippled 'til the Winter, is really unavoidable; the Bunn by lying so many Months unwatered becomes hard and tough, adheres strongly to the Harle, and will not part from it without a long and violent Fermentation; which, tho' it be then inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It would be a considerable Satisfaction to me, if I could hope that what I have already said could be useful to my Country.

                  <p>According to some Naturalists there are many sorts of Soils, which differ from one another in their Ingredients, Weights, Colours, and Consistencies; but to take in at present the most co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Under the Class of sandy Soils will be comprehended not only mere Sands, but all gravelly, stony, hazely, light, loose Soils which do not hold Water; and under Clay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> besides the stiffer Kinds properly so called, Marle, Chalk, and other binding Soils, which naturally retain it.</p>
                  <p>Neither Sands nor Clays are, separately taken, good vegetative Soils: But when mixed in due proportion, they become rich Loams, and afford the best of Crops; not indeed every Crop indifferently, but according to the several distinct proportions of Sand and Clay which they contain, some one and some another.

                  <p>Those Soils which incline most to Sand are readily exhausted, and afford little Nourishment. Sand itself, which is no more than a Collection of small Pebbles, can yield none, and the Earth which is mixed among it, when in a small proportion, can't supply the large Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then they are apt to bind and cling, and in that State are as absolutely useless as the very Sands themselves.</p>

Sand, Gravel, or other Mixtures will facilitate their Culture, and lessen the strong Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their parts, which is otherwise too stubborn for the Patience of any but a <hi>Zealand</hi> Farmer.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore an Advantage that none of our Clays are intirely free from Sand, but incline all of them to Loams. These abound in several parts of the Kingdom, especially <hi>Leinster, Munster,</hi> and <hi>Connaught,</hi> where many of our Pastures consist of a deep, rich, black Mold, made up of a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Clay, broken and divided by a Mixture of some Sand.

Without this indeed the best of them will not answer, and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Soils less than any other. Several have plowed up these Loams, and were greatly disappointed in the Produce: They trusted wholly to the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Soil, and that very Richness was the cause of their Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They neglected to give it proper Tillage, and when they expected a Crop of Corn or Flax, had little else but Grass. Natural Grass thrives so well in these rich Soils, that unless the Roots are carefully destroyed it springs up immediately, grows to a great Height, and gets the better of every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>hority to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me in this Opinion, and I hope what you have lately published to that purpose will meet with the Regard it certainly deserves.</p>
                  <p>Before I go upon particulars, I beg Leave to observe, that the Business of the Flax dresser in <hi>Holland</hi> begins considerably before the Place I assign'd him in these Papers. 'Tis there the Rule, that the Husbandman concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no farther with his Crop after it is sown. The Flax dresser buys it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeds, pulls and saves it his own Way, and at his own Expence. This Custom, I imagine, it would be difficult to introduce among our Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ple, and as I don't perceive a strict Necessity of conforming to their Practice in this Point, tho' some Advantages undoubtedly attend it, I choose to hint it only, and leave the Whole to the Discretion of the Reader, with this cursory Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation to direct him; that the Farmer who makes his Flax, must provide Conveniencies at home to receive it from the Field; whereas, in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Method he is no ways encumbered with it, but discharged at once from all Care and Concern about it. This to him is a considerable saving, and can be no Hardship on the Flax-dresser; who, in either Way, to carry on his Business to purpose, must provide himself with proper Housing, and have Room sufficient to dispose of it.</p>
                  <p>But not to dwell any longer on this Head, where I see but little Hopes of prevailing;—I shall proceed upon a Supposition that he has sav'd his Flax in the Manner directed in my former Letters, and then sold it to the Dresser.— The first Business of the Flax-dresser is, in this Case, rippling or taking off the Boles. This is done with an Instrument in common Use, and too well known to need a Description. In <hi>Holland</hi> two Men work at the same Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is fix'd on the middle of a Bench, while they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He said nothing, but led me to his Hay-Rick, and taking out a Handful, desired me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how the Outsides were damaged; how rotten, and consequently how weak and brittle, the weather-beaten Hay. Then ask'd me in his Turn if this were Flax, what kind of Cloth would you expect from it?—The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy undoubtedly will hold, and I own the Peasant's Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is indeed a Difference between Hay and Flax; as the latter is much stronger, it does not rot entirely and go to Powder between your Fingers like the other: It will even stand the Dressing, notwithstanding the Injury it has received. But this aggravates the Evil, instead of alleviating it —If the Flax were so far damaged, as not to bear the Dressing, someth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But however, when that was over, the Manufacture could receive no Damage; whereas now it is spun into our Yarn and wove into our Cloths, which are therefore of unequal Strength in different Parts, and must break into Holes whenever the weaker rotten Threads meet with any Stress, either in the bleaching or the wearing.</p>
                  <p>I hope, Gentlemen, you will forgive me this Digression; I was led into it by the great Importance of the Subject. Housing is so necessary, and at the same Time so much neglected, that I cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our general Negligence, in an Article of so much Moment, makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to recommend the Choice of proper Water in the first place. Two parts in three of those who deal in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>'TIS the natural Consequence of the Observations in my last, that a convenient Situation is nearly of the same Importance to the Flax-dresser, as it is universally allowed to be to the Bleacher. Our Dressers, if any there be among us who deserve the Name, do not seem to be aware of this, and while they undertake only small Quantities of Flax, and allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the indiscriminate Use of any Kind of Water, 'tis no wonder they should not. But whenever they enlarge their Business, grow nice and curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Management, and commence Flax dressers in good earnest, they will find the Command of Water immediately requisite to their Success. 'Tis as material a Circumstance as any other, as even the Choice of proper Water, that there be a sufficient Supply at hand; otherwise the Charge of Carriage to and from a distant place must be laid upon the Dressing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Give me Leave to observe as I go on, that the Necessity of having settled Flax dressers resident in convenient Habitations, and disposed about the Country, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It may perhaps be difficult readily to engage our People in a Method so widely different from their own:—But I would willingly persuade myself that it is however not impossible. Could I see but one good Flax dresser fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a proper Habitation, and provided with all Conveniencies at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Charge, I should hardly entertain a Doubt of convincing the most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. The Success which must infallibly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> him would be an Argument to all Capacities alike, and give irresistable Encouragement to this Branch of the Linnen Manufacture. The proper End of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Encouragements is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Doubts and Fears which throw a Damp on every new Attempt, and to engage the Timerous to venture an Experiment. And surely nothing could answer that Purpose more effectually, than a standing Instance of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess always before their Eyes. It has been frequently proposed as a Scheme likely to succeed, to bring over Flax-dresse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s to instruct and direct our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:— But without they are disposed of in proper and convenient Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I must think the Scheme deficient, and to speak out sincerely, of very little Use. The same Objections which now lie against our rambling Flax-dressers, will equally affect the other. They will do their Business as clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily when they are destitute of their Conveniencies; or should they exceed a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s among ourselves, yet a full and sufficient Instance of regular and masterly Flax-dressing they cannot possibly afford us. To the perfect Execution of this Art, there are so many Things required as can no where else be had but in a well-chosen Settlement; and to what Height it may be carried we shall never know, 'til we set about it in that Way.</p>
                  <p>I beg Leave to observe beside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> offered,—That without an Instance of the real Advantages of good and regular Flax dressing, our People will scarce be persuaded to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it.—Whereas, if a single Flax dresser had enriched himself by that one Business, thousands would immediately fall into it. Instructions and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections can only then take place, when due Care has been bestowed, that some there should be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e will probably avail but little, 'til they have palpable experimental Proof, that it is their Advantage to be taught.</p>
                  <p>You may think this Hint a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttle out of place, but if you consider it as I do, you'll easily forgive me. It will, methinks, should it ever be laid hold of, effectually promote Flax-dressing, and in the readiest Manner introduce that valuable Art, so greatly wanted and so little understood.</p>
                  <p>To return,—The most eligible Situation for the Flax-dresser is in the Neighbourhood of a large Lough, or a still River, and there in the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Spot for laying out his Ponds and Reservoirs. For however strange it may appear to us, who unhappily are used to a slovenly Negligence in this point, the Dresser, who would perfectly succeed, must have Ponds in every Situation. 'Tis true, large Basins of standing Water and slow Current are naturally good for Flax, and may be used with tolerable Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

a large Lake. 'Tis probable our People will object, that it cannot possibly quit Cost, to provide against the accidental Inconveniencies of a sudden Storm, or the small Loss of Time which attends watering in a Current at so considerable an Expence.—But I beg Leave to refer them to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who by long Experience are convinced that the best Conveniencies are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways cheapest, and proceed accordingly in this and every other Case. I should not indeed despair assigning good Reasons for their Practice, if this were a proper Place to indulge philosophical Speculations. 'Tis certain, the longer the Water settles the softer it always proves, and the more kindly it ferments with the saponuceous Juice of Plants. And it might be easily made out, that the slowest Currents, and even standing Waters, exposed to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Wind, want some Assistance to make them as soft as could be wished. But as in the cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To proceed,—As a Situation favourable in every Circumstance cannot always be obtained, the Flax dresser m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Admitting it into his Ponds betimes, and allowing it a longer Season to deposit gross, hard, and stony Particles, and receive the Influence of Sun and Air, will make indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Water equal to the best. Where he has capacious Ponds, 'tis the Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser's Fault if he has not good Water; and without entering into the Reasons of the Thing, 'tis indisputably certain from Experience, that Heat and Rest, which he may bestow upon it, by filling his Reservoirs early in the Summer, will take off all that Hardness which may hurt him.—Indeed differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>IN the several particulars mentioned in my former Letters I had invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Prejudices, and the Weight of antient Custom against me. They were Directions to our People intirely new, and for that very Reason hard to inculcate: —That the Dresser should have a settled Habitation;—Avoid Bog holes and Rivers, the only Conveniencies almost we are acquainted with for wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they would appear extraordinary to most among us, and require all the Assistance I could give them to make their Way against received Opinions. What I am at present to proceed upon is of a different Nature, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly this Letter will consist of little more than plain Instructions, deliver'd in as plain a Manner.</p>
                  <p>When the Flax is laid in Water, it must be covered with a Weight to keep it down. Clay, Rushes, Fern, or Timber, answer this purpose equally;— and indeed any Thing will do tolerably well, sharp Stones excepted, which are apt to cut the Flax. However, if the <hi>Dutch</hi> are to be believed,—there is even in this a Choice: And tho' it seems in Speculation perfectly indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent what your Flax is cover'd with, Experience, they will tell you, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it is otherwise in Fact. They use the Slutoh or Mire at the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their Pond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, which is scarce any thing besides the Dirt of the Flax it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which in those standing Waters forms in Time a black and heavy Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This they imagine gives the Flax that light grey Tincture, which is perhaps less pleasing to an unskilful Eye, but takes the Bleach more kindly, and brightens better in the Cloth than the white or yellow Cast of ours. Whether they are right in their Opinion, a few Trials will inform us. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that their Flax is of a different Hue, and takes a better Colour in the bleaching Green than the greater part of ours. And should this peculiar Kind of Slime contribute in any measure towards it, an additional Motive must arise from thence to use Ponds and Reservoirs, where alone it can be had.</p>
                  <p>'Tis impossible exactly to determine how long the Flax should lie in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Fermentation necessary to free the Harle from the Bunn is over in a longer or a shorter Time, according to the Quality of both Flax and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sometimes where the Water is exceeding soft, the Weather warm, and the Flax easy to be wrought upon, three or four Days will be sufficient. In different Circumstances the Fermentation lingers a Week, ten Days, and, as I am informed, in some Cases, sixteen or eighteen Days. There can be therefore no general Directions on this Head.—But the Dresser who knows his Flax and Water, and has made proper Observations on the different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of different Weather, cannot be greatly at a Loss.</p>
                  <p>However, it will be an useful Precaution in the Dresser, to make repeated Trials of his Flax after it has lain three Days.—If the Bunn parts freely from the Harle, and the Flax dresses kindly after drying, it should be drawn imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it has received all the Benefit of watering, and is impaired consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably every Hour it steep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, when that is over. I shall add, that it is not to be expected that Flax should have lost all Harshness when it comes directly from the Water:—The Dresser who waits for that, will have weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and half rotten Flax:—An Allowance must be made for Grassing, which takes off something of the Stubbornness the very best Flax retains, if it be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver watered.—Our People have the more Occasion for an Admonition of this Kind, because among us it is a common Error to let Flax waste itself by Fermentation.—And we are so fond of Softness, that for it's Sake, in this and every other Article of Management, we give up Strength and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Qualities incomparably more valuable. The <hi>Dutch</hi> are on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sollicitous in the first place for Strength, and will run every other Hazard

But to overlook a Conveniency for drying, of daily Use in other Cases, and which alone could answer all the Dresser's purposes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is unaccountable Negligence indeed; and I cannot help blushing for my Countrymen, that it should still be necessary to recommend an Oven to them.</p>

this I mention as the first of those Advantages, which may be obtained by a little Skill and good Oeconomy.</p>
                  <p>He secures a second, and more considerable one, by proportioning exactly the size and capacity of his Oven to the Dimensions of his Work-house. When the Flax is warm and crisp it works with greater Ease, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at lower Rates; and in other Respects also to more Advantage. As it cools and gives, it again grows tough, requires more Stress and Time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Break, cuts frequently by the Violence which then becomes necessary in the stroke, runs more to Tow of course, is charged with a higher Price for Labour, and is considerably worse. Hence the Dresser takes peculiar care to bring his Flax in full Crispness to break, and builds his oven so, that in one Day he may work off what it has dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I believe our People will imagine, that they have upon those Terms an heavy Task to go through. In our slovenly Way of doing Business, half the Quantity would be too much for twice the Hands. So great are the Advantages of Skill and proper Management.</p>
                  <p>It will be necessary to observe, that the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as an Improvement upon the former Caution, never draw two sheaves together. They take them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly from the Oven as they want them, and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Before I proceed to other Circumstances of their Practice, since I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Dimensions of the Oven, it will be proper to finish the Description of it. From the Size of it, it must be stronger than the Baker's, well roofed, thoroughly secured, and shut with a wooden Door. The Entrance may be in every Oven equal, —just large enough to admit a Man with tolerable Ease.</p>
                  <p>To return,—The next Thing the <hi>Dutch</hi> provide for is to save the Charge of firing. In the first heating of the Oven there is no Room for this, and proper Fuel must be had; but when once they have begun to break and scutch, the Dirt and Straws, which are beat out of the Flax in working, serve them ever after without any additional Expence; and each Parcel affords fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the next, in a regular Succession, 'til the whole is dried.

                  <p>Of this Kind, more especially than any other, is the Waste of Time and Labour. Three or four Minutes lost cannot well be charged in an Account, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> are aware of this more than any Nation under Heaven, and therefore lay out all their Art in saving Time and Labour. In the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us they kindle Fire in the Oven early in the Evening,—some Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Work is over. The Sweepings of the Flax are soon thrown in and lighted, and the Oven heats and cools again sufficiently before the Breaks and Scutches are laid by. 'Tis ready to be fill'd, when the Business of that Day is ended, and when the next begins, 'tis again ready to be drawn;— not a Minute is lost in the whole Round, and the Work proceeds in a regular Succession no where interrupted.</p>

                  <p>Could our Journeymen hereafter, as theirs actually do, work off twenty Pounds of Flax a Day, they might afford their Labour for a Half penny per Poun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
