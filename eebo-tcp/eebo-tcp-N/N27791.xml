            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A BRIEF NARRATIVE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON a subject of this important magnitude, in which the Public Mind is irresistibly interested; where a transaction is to be developed, the mere contemplation of which makes the soul shudder with horror; where the guilt or innocence is to be ascertained, of a man crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with an accusation of ſuch diabolic import, we deem it our <hi>duty</hi> to give the earliest information in our power.</p>
            <p>Is he guilty, let the culprit be held up to public detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in all his blackneſs, and receive the punishment of his crime; but if innocent, let the unfortunate youth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as public an acquittal. Let us wipe from his fair fame every foul stain of suspicion—let us regret that his character has been traduced, his feelings lacerated, his very existence endangered by an accuſation as falſe as it was cruel, as unfounded as it was destructive.</p>
            <p>This celebrated cauſe brought forth the talents, as well of the proſecutor for the people, as of the advocates for the prisoner. But the profeſsional activity of the former,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037039_0003_100C8AB341956540"/>
was not the only power with which the unfortunate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner had to cope.</p>
            <p>A thouſand rumors of a vague and incongruous nature, were circulated by the tongue of public report. Abſurd and malignant stories were at every corner repeated, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to prejudice the public mind.</p>
            <p>It is unfortunately too common for the leſs liberal part of the community, to transfer their abhorrence of the <hi>crime</hi> to the <hi>perſon</hi> who is ſuſpected of its commiſsion; forgetful of that golden maxim, that we should deem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man innocent, until, to an impartial jury of his fellow citizens, his guilt is made manifest.</p>
            <p>We have alſo heard, but for the honor of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we hope our information is not correct, that one or more diſintereſted individuals, have exerted themſelves with peculiar activity to procure the conviction of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
            <p>However deſirous we may be that truth should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and crime brought under the ſword of juſtice— and however we may applaud the exertions of thoſe whoſe profeſsional duty calls on them to drag the aſsaſſin from his concealment into open day; yet our feelings recoil at the idea of <hi>intruding</hi> ſervices in a caſe where the life of the priſoner is at stake—where a conviction will crimſon the altar of public juſtice with the blood of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creature.</p>
            <p>But we cut short our preliminary remarks, and haſter to the more important occurrences of the trial.</p>
            <p>A bill having been found by the grand jury, and the priſoner duly arraigned, Monday was appointed as the awful—the eventful aera of his fate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:037039_0004_100C8AB5E22E84D0"/>On this momentous occaſion, the chamber of juſtice, the avenues of the city-hall, and the ſtreets adjacent, were thronged with an eager multitude of our enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened populace;—A multitude, whoſe patience was only equalled by their clemency.</p>
            <p>Preciſely at ten o'clock, the ſun ſhining with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able brilliancy, and the weather being a little windy, the priſoner arrived, properly guarded. He was also attended by a numerous train, a volunteer guard of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, as diſtinguished for decorum of behavior, as for reſpectability of appearance.</p>
            <p>The court being opened in due form, and the jury ſworn, the priſoner was brought to the bar.</p>
            <p>Here let us remark the collected compoſure of his manner, and the open expreſſion of his countenance. His appearance intereſted us greatly in his favor. We waited with anxiety for the teſtimony—convinced that if his was not the expreſſion of conſcious innocence, he was indeed a man incapable of feeling, whoſe boſom was not to be aſſailed by any remorſeful ſenſations.</p>
            <p>The court room being exceſſively crowded, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables were directed to clear it of all ſuperfluous ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators; and we were much delighted to ſee the alacrity with which this reſpectable claſs of officers exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the execution of the power delegated to them; —an alacrity which we have in every inſtance witneſſed. They appear fully convinced of the authority they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, and perfectly diſpoſed to exerciſe it in its ampleſt extent.</p>
            <p>The priſoner being placed at the bar, was then called by name, and directed to hold up his <hi>right hand.</hi> Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing complied with this eſtabliſhed uſage, his indictment was read, in which the accuſation was contained, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037039_0005_100C8AB8239CB300"/>
a number of other important and truly relevant allegations cuſtomary on ſuch occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Attorney general then opened the proſecution, and introduced the witneſses on the part of the people. These being fifty or sixty in number, and many of them depoſing matters of trivial import, we ſhall not go into the detail; but merely remark, that the general tenor went to connect circumſtances of a preſumptive nature; but which ſo connected, might eſtabliſh a concluſive maſs. The nature of the caſe being ſuch, that in proof of the priſoner's guilt, preſumptive evidence only could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>The teſtimony was brought forward to eſtabliſh certain particulars which, if properly proved, would have formed a connected chain of evidence, from which <hi>preſumption</hi> would ariſe ſufficiently pointed to <hi>convince</hi> the <hi>minds</hi> of the jury, producing the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his guilt, that would ariſe from <hi>poſitive</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. But if theſe proofs were rebutted, or differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently explained by oppoſing teſtimony, it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the moſt violent ſuſpicions might originate from circumſtances of a harmleſs nature, and the moſt pointed evidence might take its riſe in error and miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>The following is the import of the material part of this evidence, which we have ſelected from a confuſed maſs of tedious unimportant matter.</p>
            <p>It was endeavored on the part of the proſecution to prove, that the priſoner had been in the habit of paying very particular attentions to the deceaſed—that about 8 o'clock of the evening on which ſhe was miſsing, he had come to her uncle's, where ſhe resided, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted about the ſame time at which ſhe was ſuppoſed to have left the houſe, which was about twenty minutes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037039_0006_100C8ABAEF910080"/>
eight o'clock. A woman living in the neighborhood of the yard in which the horſe and ſleigh of Ezra Weeks, brother to the priſoner, were kept, depoſed, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time about eight o'clock, being in her houſe, with her doors ſhut, ſhe heard the gate of the above yard open, and a carriage come out, whether a ſleigh or chair, ſhe could not tell, and in about half an hour, ſhe heard it return, and the gate again ſhut. She admitted that ſhe had never heard this gate open or ſhut, except at this particular time, though it was in continual uſe—ſhe was alſo certain that the evening was Sunday, though ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very incorrect with reſpect to the time of the month. She alſo admitted that ſhe did not recollect any of thoſe particulars till about twelve days after, when ſhe was informed of the unfortunate end of the young woman, and of the time when the event happened. It is alſo to be noted, that this witneſs appeared to be greatly advanced in age, and her memory not very tenacious on moſt particulars.</p>
            <p>An evidence was adduced to prove, that about the time mentioned, a one horſe ſleigh without bells, was ſeen on the road, containing a woman and two men, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared laughing very merrily.</p>
            <p>Three other witneſſes depoſed that about half after eight o'clock, being in a ſleigh in the middle road, a one horſe ſleigh paſſed them on a gallop, without bells, and containing two or three persons, but from the darkneſs of the night, they were not able to speak decidedly as to the number, nor were they certain as to the ſex of all the perſons it contained. As the sleigh paſsed them, the witneſses huzza'd, in the manner frequently cuſtomary on ſuch occasions. The perſons in the one horſe sleigh took no notice of their ſhouting, but paſsed them in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect silence.</p>
            <p>Two witneſses, a man and his wife, who reside in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037039_0007_100C8ABC807C4098"/>
vicinity of the Manhattan Well, being regularly ſworn, declared, that about tbe hour in which this cataſtrophe is ſuppoſed to have happened, they heard exclamations of a female in diſtreſs, and diſtinguiſhed the words "O Lord have mercy, do help me!" The old man looked through his window; but on being aſked, declared that he did not diſcover any sleigh; though it was obſerved that from the nature of the ground, it was not <hi>impoſſible</hi> but a sleigh might have been kept from his view in a kind of hollow between his houſe and the well.</p>
            <p>Another witneſs depoſed, that he paſſed not far from the Manhattan Well about <hi>nine</hi> o'clock.</p>
            <p>The time was aſcertained by his having noticed the hour a few minutes before, at the houſe he left.</p>
            <p>He heard a voice, as of a female in diſtreſs, and went in the direction of the Well to discover the cause. He heard the voice twice, but did not diſtinguiſh any words. His wife called him, and told him ſhe believed it came from a houſe in the neighborhood—he therefore desiſted from his examination. He declared that he ſaw no ſleigh, and the ſounds were not again repeated.</p>
            <p>Another witneſs depoſed, that paſſing near the well the morning after the event, he ſaw the traces of a one-horſe ſleigh, which had went out of the road and ſtruck into the field, turning extremely near to the well. He remarked, that the circumſtance being very ſingular, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted his attention: he did not perceive whether it bore the marks of a pleaſure ſleigh, or a wood ſleigh. The latter appeared to have been the impreſſion on his mind, as he thought that some carmen, riding for ſport, had turned out of the road through whim.</p>
            <p>From the unfrequented nature of the ground, it being out of the common road, the counſel for the priſoner
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037039_0008_100C8ABE10A5A860"/>
diſcovered, by their queſtions, their opinion that theſe traces of a ſleigh might not have been made on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night.</p>
            <p>Two other circumſtances were adduced, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at firſt view, extremely unfavorable to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
            <p>He had declared, that he had never been at the well in his life, and a witneſs was brought to prove, that he had ſeen him examining the depth of the well, a week before this unfortunate circumſtance occurred. This evidence depoſed, that about eleven o'clock on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning, a week before the young woman was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, he ſaw a young man by the well, with whom he had ſome converſation; and this young man faſtening two pieces of wood together, which had been left from the wood work, ſounded the well in different places, mentioning to him the depth. But the witneſs declined ſwearing to the identity of the perſon, declaring that he could not take his oath that the priſoner was the man.— He alſo deſcribed accurately the dreſs of the perſon he ſaw at the well, which happened to be particularly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</p>
            <p>The perſons who lived in the houſe with the priſoner, and the man with whom he boarded, being called, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they had never ſeen clothes of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The attorney general ſeeing the incompetence of this teſtimony, diſmiſſed it.</p>
            <p>The other unfavorable circumſtance was, that the priſoner, immediately on being taken, asked if they had found the body in the MANHATTAN WELL.</p>
            <p>But it was proved by ſeveral witneſſes, that the muff
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037039_0009_100C8AC0782AE418"/>
of the deceaſed being diſcovered, had led to a ſuſpicion that her remains would be found in the well. It was also <hi>clearly proved,</hi> that this circumſtance of the finding of the muff, had <hi>already</hi> been communicated to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the material evidences againſt the priſoner; To ſave time we have accompanied ſome of them with the manner in which they were opposed or proved groundleſs.</p>
            <p>The evidence on the part of the priſoner was opened by Colonel Burr, in an eloquent and maſterly manner.</p>
            <p>It went to prove, that he was a young man of much worth, of mild and amiable manners, and of a very gentle and affectionate diſpoſition. Several witneſſes were brought to ſhew, that his conduct to the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate young woman in queſtion, had been civilly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not more ſo than to other young women in the houſe, or than was conſiſtent with propriety.</p>
            <p>It was clearly proved by a number of witneſſes, that he was at Mr. Ezra Weeks, his brother's, on that even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from before candle-light till eight o'clock. It was proved by a witneſs who lodged in the family of the deceaſed, that he came home about two minutes before or after eight o'clock: that the priſoner, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed and family, were together: that ſhortly after, one of the company looking at his watch, it was ten minutes after eight: that about four minutes after this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he left the room. It appears from the evidence of the family, that about this time, the priſoner took his leave; and it was ſuppoſed by the family, that the young woman, who had gone up ſtairs, went away with him. This from the evidence, muſt have been about a <hi>quarter</hi> after eight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037039_0010_100C8AC268C6D3D8"/>It was further proved, that ſome company who had been at Mr. Ezra Weeks's, (the brother of the priſoner) remained with him till about twenty or twenty-five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes after eight, when they departed; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the darkneſs and ſlipperineſs of the evening, Mr. Ezra Weeks ſtood at the door with the candle, and lighted them. He returned, but had not ſat down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his brother, the priſoner, came in as uſual, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive directions for the work of the next day. The interval unaccounted for, of the priſoner's abſence, was thus reduced to ten or fifteen minutes; in which time, if at all, he muſt have perpetrated the crime—muſt have gone to the Manhattan well, about a mile, and returned; and muſt have compoſed his appearance, and overcome all kind of agitation, and all signs of haſte or exertion.</p>
            <p>It was proved by evidence, that the sleigh of Mr. Ezra Weeks had bells: that the boy who took care of the horſe had ſed him as uſual, locked the door, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kept the key in his pocket, or placed it in the kitchen. It appears that the bells were on the harneſs before and after this tranſaction, and in the opinion of the lad who had the care of the horſe, it would have taken about ten minutes to remove the bells from the harneſs, and put the horſe to the sleigh.</p>
            <p>It was ſatisfactorily proved by numerous witneſses, that the behavior of the priſoner in the evening prior to the young woman being miſsing, was perfectly compoſed and cheerful as uſual. It appears that on his return, his conduct was the ſame, perfectly free from every kind of agitation, that he eat a hearty ſupper, and received di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for making 8 doors of different dimensions, and executed them accurately without further inſtructions.</p>
            <p>It alſo was proved, by a perſon who worked in the ſame ſhop with him, and who having heard ſome ſurmiſes
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037039_0011_100C82A2723C9498"/>
hinted to his diſadvantage, paid very particular attention to his appearance; that his ſubſequent conduct was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly the same as ever; that he paid the same attention to the superintendance of the work, and never exhibited the smalleſt sign of guilt or agitation.</p>
            <p>A variety of other witneſses were brought forward— some invalidating the teſtimony brought againſt him and others, tending to eſtabliſh his innocence; but thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready detailed, appeared to remove every doubt from the minds of the ſpectators.</p>
            <p>The evidence of ſeveral medical gentlemen of reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, who had examined the body, was also taken; as was likewiſe the profeſſional opinion of a physician of eminence, who had not inſpected it.</p>
            <p>From their teſtimony, it would appear poſſible, that the deceaſed had received her death from drowning, without having ſuſtained any previous violence.</p>
            <p>Some evidence was produced to show, that for a short time prior to her unfortunate end, she had exhibited marks of occasional gloom and melancholy; but several witneſses also deposed to the gaiety and cheerfulneſs of her disposition.</p>
            <p>As the counsel for the priſoner did not sum up, we had not an opportunity of judging how far they meant to enforce this point; and we could only infer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion they were disposed to draw.</p>
            <p>The evidence on both sides being closed, we anticipated that flow of eloquence which was to be expected from the abilities of General Hamilton and Brockholſt Livingſton, for the prisoner, and of Mr. Colden, the prosecutor for the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:037039_0012_100C8AC6095684A8"/>But the Attorney general rose and requeſted that the court would poſtpone the pleadings on the cause, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsing his inability of entering into it at this hour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he had not slept in eight and forty hours; and that if after hearing the summing up of the gentlemen for the prisoner, he was obliged at five or six o'clock in the morning to enter upon a reply, in which he muſt consider the evidence, it would be totally out of his power.</p>
            <p>The harraſſed appearance of the attorney general, sufficiently subſtantiated his aſſertions, as he appeared sinking under the fatigues he had suffered in the course of this lengthy trial.</p>
            <p>The court declined a compliance with this requeſt, alledging the exhauſted ſtate of the jury, who had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been locked up one night in the picture room, and that if the court adjourned, the jury muſt of neceſſity be committed to the ſame kind of durance, and that two nights paſſed in this manner, might make ſome of them sick, and prevent a determination of the cause.</p>
            <p>We heartily concurred with the court in opinion; for though the examinations of the paintings, must doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have been very edifying and amusing to the jury on the former night, yet it is doubtful whether a repetition of the pleasure, would not have been so exquisite as to have produced a cloying effect.</p>
            <p>The counsel for the priſoner expreſſed their opinion that the merits of the cause, by no means required any length of time in ſumming up the evidence; and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed leaving the matter to the court and jury without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comment. This propoſal was accordingly acceded to.</p>
            <p>Chief juſtice Lansing, then aroſe and delivered a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037039_0013_100C8AC7C935BE08"/>
and appropriate charge to the jury. He declined going into the maſs of the evidence, but detailed the most ſtriking and important testimony; ſhowing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of motives to induce the priſoner to the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the crime, entering into conſideration of the moſt material evidence againſt him, and evincing the opinion of the court, of its deficiency to prove the guilt of the priſoner. He concluded, by directing them to decide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conviction produced in their own minds, by the evidence produced, without being biaſſed, by any report they might have heard circulated, before their arrival at court, or by any regard to the consequences which would result to the priſoner.</p>
            <p>The jury retired, and returned in leſs than two min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes; their names were then called over; the prisoner was ordered to hold up his right hand, and having again complied with this eſtabliſhed and important custom. The jury pronounced him NOT GUILTY.</p>
            <p>We again remark the priſoner's collected behavior thro' the whole course of the trial—the perfect innocence and artleſsneſs of his countenance. Guilt could never have lurked under ſuch a conduct. His face appeared the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex of a virtuous and benevolent heart; his deportment that of a man incapable of the smalleſt approach to the crimes with which error had accused him.</p>
            <p>We participated in the indignation excited by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution he had suffered—by the malignant attempts which had been made to inflame the public mind, and prejudge his cause. The most shameful falshoods had been circulated. A ſtory had been spread abroad res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a witneſs in New-Jersey, who had come forward and confeſſed himself an acceſſary in the murder.</p>
            <p>This tale was deſtitute of the smalleſt foundation, and perhaps originated in the sanguinary malice of some
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037039_0014_100C8ACA0CF00EB8"/>
wretch, who, for purposes unknown, was eager to bring this unfortunate young man to an untimely end.</p>
            <p>Other ſtories of a similar nature were diffuſed, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to criminate the prisoner with the blackeſt character; and to have credited the account of popular rumor, we would have supposed his whole life had been one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued tiſſue of enormities.</p>
            <p>This affair is thus brought to a conclusion, as far as it implicated the character of the priſoner. He has been tried by a jury of his peers, the whole transaction has been minutely inveſtigated, and he is declared Guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
            <p>It only remains to warn our fellow-citizens of one too common error:—When a man has been ſuſpected of an offence of this horrid nature, a degree of odium not to be removed, is apt to attach itſelf to his character.</p>
            <p>The world cannot easily forget that he has been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and even an acquittal does not always convince them of his innocence. Yet the injuſtice of this proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure muſt be evident, on a moment's reflection. How many guiltleſs perſons may, by circumſtances, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered liable to ſuſpicion? Is it not then dreadful, if even innocence, publicly eſtabliſhed, ſhall not be reſcued from the moſt degrading puniſhment of guilt—the loſs of public good opinion!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have attempted in this narrative, to give a juſt account of the trial, and a faithful ſtatement of the evidence, together with every circumſtance worthy of note, that fell under our obſervation. The careleſs and inelegant ſtyle in which theſe are recited, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for on three principles, independent of deficiency in point of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

extreme haſte which we, though thus fatigued, are obliged to exert —writing and printing at the ſame time, that our competitors in this</hi> hiſtorical <hi>employment, may not get the ſtart of us. The third is, our entire indifference whether our readers are pleaſed with our ſtyle or not. We are faithful in giving them the</hi> matter, <hi>and we care very little about the</hi> manner.</p>
            <p>We now conclude with aſſuring our enlightened fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, of the full acquaintance we poſſeſs with their fondneſs for the marvellous. We well know the gratification they receive from the ſtory of a ghoſt, the hiſtory of a murder, or any other agreeable ſource of amusement. And they may reſt aſſured, that we will let ſlip no opportunity of delighting them with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant recitals of this kind, provided they remunerate, our ſervices, by purchasing our publications with the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary liberality.</p>
