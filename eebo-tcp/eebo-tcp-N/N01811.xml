            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>MAy our <hi>Goſpellized People,</hi> now give Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a juſt &amp; ſtrong Attention, to the moſt Important Matters, that ever any People had, or can have, Set before them. The Moſt-concerning, the All-concerning, Matters are Set before us, in thoſe Words,
<q>
                  <bibl>I. Pet. I. 9.</bibl>
                  <hi>The</hi> END <hi>of your</hi> FAITH, <hi>the</hi> SALVATION <hi>of your</hi> SOULS.</q>
            </p>
            <p>EVERY Word is Ponderous; it weighs like the <hi>Mountains</hi> of GOD. The <hi>Inſpiration of the Almighty,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the Pen of an Apoſtle from Him, to Recommend unto us, a <hi>Faith</hi> in a Lovely JESUS; the <hi>Faith</hi> of what He will do for His Followers, at that <hi>Second Coming</hi> of His, which is to be looked for. In the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Intention, We are here treated with Two Things; Firſt, An Incomparable <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> for the obtaining of which every Man has cauſe to be unſpeakably Sollicitous;
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002144_0003_0FBC2225DFC456E8"/>
An Ineſtimable <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> which if thou <hi>Loſe,</hi> O Man, <hi>What will it profit thee, if thou gain the whole World?</hi> This <hi>Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is, <hi>The Salvation of the Soul</hi> But then, Secondly; The <hi>Way</hi> wherein we are made Partakers of this <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> T'wil be the <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>; Our <hi>Way</hi> to it, is by a Genuine <hi>Faith</hi> in the JESUS, who alone can <hi>Lead us into the Reſt which remains for the people of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which I am in the moſt awakening Terms, to oblige your moſt Serious Thoughts upon, is This <hi>Faithful ſaying of GOD</hi>; Oh! Let it be counted <hi>worthy of all Acceptation</hi> with you!</p>
            <p>The <hi>SALVATION</hi> of the <hi>SOUL,</hi> will be the <hi>END</hi> of a True <hi>FAITH</hi> in Our Glorious and Mighty, and Only <hi>SAVIOUR.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seaſonably &amp; Effectually to make ſure of a part in the <hi>Salvation,</hi> whereof the Bleſſed JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS is <hi>the Author, to as many as obey Him</hi>; This, This is the Thing, which you are now with an Uncommon Importunity to be preſs'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For, my Friends, Our SAVIOUR has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us, Tis not every one that ſhall be <hi>Saved</hi>: No, Tis not every one that pretends to own Him for a <hi>Lord,</hi> and makes a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion to <hi>Religion,</hi> that ſhall be <hi>Saved. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, Multitudes,</hi> are they who periſh, by a moſt Sottiſh <hi>Neglect</hi> of their GRAND IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEREST; And you have cauſe to Think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Queſtion,</hi> which GOD now puts unto <hi>You,</hi> but which indeed all the Angels in Heaven
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002144_0004_0FBC22281D4E55A8"/>
can give no Anſwer to; That very Solemn <hi>Queſtion,</hi> Heb. II. 3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we Neglect ſo great Salvation</hi>!</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing that is now to be done, is to aſſert the <hi>Existence</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> the <hi>Welfare</hi> whereof we are now Entreating you to be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned about; And this is, The SOUL. This Aſſertion is to be introduced, as an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Preliminary, to what we are going upon; Job XXXII. 8 <hi>There is a SPIRIT in Man.</hi> A SPIRIT capable of Diſcerning and Arguing and Affecting: A SPIRIT which Reaſons, and Compares, and Judges, and Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; A SPIRIT which a Man of Reaſon, when he feels himſelf a <hi>dying,</hi> does commit into the Hands of a <hi>Faithful Creator.</hi> O Man, Thou haſt a SOUL, the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> whereof ought to be how <hi>Real,</hi> and how <hi>Awful,</hi> to thee! Indeed, it might ſeem a Needleſs <hi>Labour,</hi> yea, and a Cutting <hi>Satyr,</hi> to take any Pains for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of a Man, that he has a <hi>Soul</hi> within him. Should any Man <hi>Doubt</hi> whether he has a SOUL within him, his very <hi>Doubt</hi> would be an <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of it. So wondrouſly would that Man <hi>Confute</hi> himſelf, who ſhould thus go to degrade himſelf into the claſs of the <hi>Beaſts that Periſh.</hi> It was the Ridiculous Miſtake of the poor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> who when they firſt ſaw ſome <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans</hi> on Horſe back, took the Horſe and his Rider to be but One Animal. But much more worthy to be Ridiculed, arc the <hi>Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> who take not the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Soul,</hi> for very Different Subſtances. My Friend, Thy <hi>Body</hi> is but a <hi>Cabinet</hi> unto a <hi>Jewel,</hi> the moſt precious
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002144_0005_0FBC222BADB6F8F0"/>
in the World; A SOUL, A SOUL which has many Inconteſtible Demonſtrations (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of well-atteſted <hi>Apparitions,</hi>) of its <hi>Immortality.</hi> A SOUL which is capable of <hi>Doing</hi> more for GOD, and of <hi>Tasting</hi> more from Him, than all the Creatures in the whole Viſible Creation. A SOUL, whereof a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR who has <hi>been Powerfully declared, The SON of GOD</hi>; and the <hi>True Witneſs, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth Souls</hi>; has declared unto us, Matth. X. 28. <hi>It cannot be killed, by that which Kills the Body.</hi> A Text, which the <hi>Men of corrupt minds,</hi> who are for that Scandalous Epitaph on a Dead Man, <hi>Here lies the whole of the Man,</hi> in vain Study to make Evaſions from. That SOUL of thine, O Man, When will thine Ears be open unto the Cries which it makes unto thee? Verily, There is the <hi>Voice of GOD</hi> crying to Every Man, in the cry which his own SOUL makes unto him. <q>When, O Man, wilt thou <hi>ſhew thy ſelf a Man?</hi> Thy Dying <hi>Body</hi> is abundantly cared for. When ſhall the SOUL, that is to Survive the <hi>Body,</hi> have a due care beſtow'd upon it? Thy <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>fed</hi>; But thy SOUL is famiſh'd. Thy <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>cloath'd</hi>; But thy SOUL is naked. The Diſtempers of thy <hi>Body,</hi> thou ſeekeſt a cure for. Thy SOUL is <hi>pining away in its Iniquities.</hi> Thy <hi>Body</hi> is falling and haſt'ning down into the <hi>Pit of Corruption.</hi> Oh! what Proviſion haſt thou made, that thy SOUL may be then <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Everlaſting Habitations?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Subject</hi> is then agreed upon; The next
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002144_0006_0FBC222CCCD51C48"/>
thing to be done, is to prevail with you, that you would purſue the <hi>Welfare</hi> of this Noble <hi>Subject</hi>; A point which, One would think, ſhould now need no further to be ſpoken to. Do but Remember, O Man, That thou haſt a SOUL, and thou canſt not but Acknowledge, that it muſt be, <hi>The ONE THING that is Needful,</hi> to Conſult the Welfare of it. But that this Deſign may be well purſued, we will Maintain Two Poſitions.</p>
            <p>My Firſt POSITION is; The SALVATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON of the SOUL, is to be the <hi>Grand Point of Sollicitude,</hi> with all that <hi>are going down to the Dust,</hi> whereof <hi>none can keep alive his own Soul.</hi> But now, What is implied, what is contain'd, in, <hi>The Salvation of the Soul?</hi> SALVATION! O comprehenſive Word! O Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Good! SOUL, 'Tis beyond <hi>all that thou canſt Ask or Think</hi>!</p>
            <p>Firſt; In the <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> there is a <hi>Deliverance</hi> from all the Miſeries to which by our Fall from GOD, we are become Obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; all the Miſerable Circumſtances of thoſe whom <hi>GOD counteth for His Enemies.</hi> The doleful Outcry of all Mankind, may be That, Lam. V.16. <hi>The crown is fallen from our Head, and wo is unto us, in that we have Sinned.</hi> Soul, T'wil be thy Outcry, whenever the <hi>Sleep of Death</hi> upon thee, is going off. The <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> from GOD, begun by our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> has plunged us all into a <hi>woful</hi> Condition. The <hi>Soul,</hi> involved in the <hi>Sin</hi> of our <hi>Firſt Parents.</hi> and having by <hi>Actual Sin</hi> alſo <hi>Denied the GOD that is Above,</hi> may make its Bitter Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002144_0007_0FBC222E1D930F68"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>O wretched One that I am</hi>! I have the <hi>Wrath of GOD abiding of me</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and His dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Curſe</hi> is diſpenſed unto me, even in my <hi>Proſperity,</hi> as well as my <hi>adverſity.</hi> I am <hi>Sick</hi> of <hi>Greivous Diſeaſes.</hi> I am a <hi>Slave</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> and I <hi>ſerve diverſe Luſts.</hi> When I am <hi>driven</hi> out of this <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> I am like to fall into the Hands which it is a <hi>fearful thing to fall into.</hi> There is danger that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto it at a tremendous <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> will be only to undergo a <hi>Strange Puniſhment reſerved for the workers of Iniquity.</hi> And Oh! What will become of me, when This Earth ſhall become like a <hi>Fiery Oven,</hi> and as a mighty, flaming, blazing <hi>Furnace,</hi> which all the <hi>Wicked of the Earth</hi> ſhall be thrown into!</q> O <hi>Soul</hi> in wondrous Perils, To be Reſcued from all this Confuſion, is that <hi>Salvation,</hi> which is now ſet before thee, in the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> which is the <hi>Goſpel of thy Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, Secondly; There is in the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul,</hi> a <hi>Poſitive</hi> Good, conveyed; All the <hi>Good</hi> which is promiſed unto the <hi>Fear of GOD</hi>: and Oh! <hi>How Great is ihat Good,</hi> which GOD has laid up for them that <hi>Fear Him</hi>! The <hi>Salvation</hi> which we have in our <hi>View,</hi> is in the Sacred Oracles which deſcribe it unto us, called, <hi>Life Eternal.</hi> The Thing of which we are often and often informed in the <hi>Holy Book,</hi> which none but an <hi>Holy GOD,</hi> and <hi>One who cannot Lye,</hi> can be the Author of, is That; 1 Joh. II. 25. <hi>This is the promiſe that He has promiſed us, Eternal Life.</hi> Herein, firſt,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002144_0008_0FBC22313133CF58"/>
there is a <hi>Sentence of Life</hi> paſſed upon us, and our <hi>Sin</hi> is <hi>Pardoned.</hi> In our <hi>Pardon,</hi> GOD reſtores us to His <hi>Favour,</hi> and <hi>in His Favour there is Life.</hi> There is a <hi>Justification of Life,</hi> wherein a Gracious GOD ſays unto us, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sin; Thou ſhall not Dye:</hi> Says unto us, <hi>Be comforted, Thy Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi> Herein there is that thing done for us; Rom. V. 19. <hi>We receive the Gift of Righteouſneſs, and reign in Life by JESUS CHRIST.</hi> In the <hi>Salvation of the soul,</hi> there is a Releaſe given to the Soul, from the Bonds to ſuffer the <hi>Deſtruction from GOD,</hi> which His <hi>Violated Law</hi> lays upon the Sinner; and the Soul may Sing, <hi>Lord, I will praiſe thee; for that tho' thou waſt Angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou doſt comfort me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, Secondly; There is an <hi>Entrance into Life</hi>; which is made by our coming to <hi>Live unto GOD.</hi> We are <hi>Quickned</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences from Above, which Enliven us, and Enable us to pay thoſe Regards unto the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving GOD,</hi> which we have heretofore paid unto our <hi>Idols.</hi> We have that <hi>Life of GOD</hi> begun in us, wherein the <hi>Praiſing</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of GOD, becomes the <hi>Main Scope</hi> of our <hi>Life; Self</hi> is dethroned, and GOD reſumes His <hi>Throne</hi> in our Souls. We terminate our <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Joyes,</hi> no longer in <hi>Creatures,</hi> but paſs from them and through them unto GOD: We <hi>Dy</hi> to <hi>Creatures,</hi> and <hi>Live</hi> unto GOD. And it is with us accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to That; Rom. VIII. 2. <hi>The Law of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002144_0009_0FBC2232E718D1D0"/>
Spirit of Life in CHRIST JESUS hath made me free from the Law of Sin and of Death.</hi> The <hi>Salvation of the Soul</hi> does Relieve and Remove the Maladies which the SOUL is deprav'd withal, and fill the <hi>Soul</hi> with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, and of the <hi>Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p>Thirdly; The <hi>Life Eternal,</hi> which had its <hi>Inchoation</hi> in This World, has its <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in another and a better World, after our <hi>Departure</hi> out of This. And here firſt, There ſhall be that Word accompliſhed, Rom. VIII. 10. <hi>If CHRIST be in you, the Body is dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Sin, but the Spirit is Life, becauſe of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Our <hi>Spirits</hi> will, at our Expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>fly away,</hi> into a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where they <hi>Live unto GOD</hi> and are <hi>Comforted.</hi> But then, anon ſhall be that Word accompliſhed, 1 Cor. XV 53. <hi>This corruptible muſt put on incorruption; This mortal muſt put on immortality.</hi> The <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul,</hi> will prove the <hi>Salvation of the Body</hi> too. 'Tis obſervable, That the <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul,</hi> is to be received at the <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the Lord; even when He ſhall come to <hi>Raiſe</hi> the <hi>Dead</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> the World. The <hi>Soul</hi> will not be in all circumſtances as it would be, till that Great Revolution. We ſhall then have our <hi>Bodies</hi> fetch'd back from the dark Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Death,</hi> and given back to our <hi>Spirits,</hi> fill'd with an <hi>Ethereal matter,</hi> and made <hi>Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous</hi> and <hi>Vigorous,</hi> and <hi>Salted,</hi> or made <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible</hi> with the <hi>Fiery Robe,</hi> whereof we were ſtripped by the <hi>First Tranſgreſſion.</hi> Our <hi>Life</hi> being <hi>Redeemed from Deſtruction,</hi> at the <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002144_0010_0FBC22341C2D68D0"/>
of the Dead,</hi> our <hi>Youth</hi> will be <hi>Renewed,</hi> and we ſhall have <hi>Bodies,</hi> wherein we ſhall <hi>mount up as with the Wings of Eagles.</hi> Then we ſhall be ſheltered under the Wings of the JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, who <hi>Delivers from the Wrath to come</hi>; find with Him a ſhelter from the <hi>Devouring Fire,</hi> and the <hi>Everlasting Burnings,</hi> which they that <hi>Know not GOD, and Obey not His Goſpel,</hi> ſhall be doom'd unto. Then, Then we ſhall be taken into the <hi>Holy City,</hi> which has the <hi>Glory of GOD</hi> giving <hi>Light</hi> unto it. There we ſhall have <hi>all Tears wiped away from our Eyes.</hi> There<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ſhall be <hi>Filled with all the Fulneſs of GOD</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There GOD will become <hi>All in All</hi> unto us. But, O the <hi>Duration</hi> of this <hi>Felicity!</hi> An <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation!</hi> After we have been in that <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Immortality,</hi> for Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Myriads of Millions of Ages, and ſuch as it would even tire all humane Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to caſt up the Numbers of, we ſhall be no nearer the Period of it, than the Firſt Moment that we came into it.</p>

of entering into Reſt.</hi> SOUL, Delay no longer; but hearken to</p>
            <p>My Second Poſition which is, There is a Bleſſed SAVIOUR, a <hi>Faith</hi> in whom will, for the <hi>End</hi> of it, have the <hi>Salvation of the Soul.</hi> Men and Brethren, You are now coming to <hi>Know the way to the City.</hi> 'Tis after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the <hi>Servants of the most High GOD muſt ſhew unto you the way of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, We have a moſt powerful and moſt merciful SAVIOUR, whoſe Name is JESUS becauſe <hi>He ſaves His People from their ſins.</hi> In our Bleſſed JESUS, has our GOD fulfilled that Word unto us, <hi>He will ſend them a SAVIOUR, and a GREAT ONE.</hi> Meſſengers from Heaven have made this Proclamation unto us, Luke II. 10. <hi>I bring you good Tidings of Great Joy, which ſhall be to all People; unto you there is born a SAVIOUR, who is CHRIST the Lord</hi> O wonderful! O wonderful! The Eternal SON of GOD, a Perſon who is ONE GOD with His Eternal FATHER, has taken the Man JESUS into One Perſon with Himſelf This GOD man, is become the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> between GOD and <hi>Man,</hi> and gives to <hi>Man</hi> a view of Returning to GOD. By His <hi>Mediation</hi> it is, that His choſen People arrive to the <hi>Salvation of the Soul.</hi> That this our SAVIOUR <hi>Died,</hi> and <hi>Roſe</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and was <hi>Received</hi> up into the <hi>Heavens</hi>; this is a Thing whereof we have <hi>many Infallible Proofs.</hi> 'Tis a Thing that has been better proved, than any <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that ever was in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002144_0012_0FBC22372068B508"/>
World. There needs no more to prove, than He is the SAVIOUR, which His <hi>Goſpel</hi> has Reported Him to be, and that what He has Revealed in His <hi>Goſpel</hi> about the <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> is to be relied upon. This is the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, who preſents Himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the Juſtice of GOD, upon our pleading whereof we receive the <hi>Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This is the SAVIOUR, who by His <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to the Everlaſting Rules of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> has furniſhed them who have none of their own, with a Plea for their <hi>Acceptance</hi> with GOD. This is that SAVIOUR<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who appears as an <hi>Advocate</hi> for us in the <hi>most holy Place,</hi> and <hi>ſaves us to the uttermoſt,</hi> by <hi>Everliving to make Interceſſion for us.</hi> Here is the SAVIOUR who <hi>Guides our Feet into the way of Peace,</hi> and <hi>Inclines us to the Things that are Holy and Juſt and Good,</hi> and <hi>Works in us that which is well pleaſing in the ſight of GOD</hi> Here is the SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, who being the Lord of <hi>Angels,</hi> and having <hi>all power given to Him,</hi> orders our whole State, and <hi>performs the Thing that is appointed for us.</hi> In Him we have a SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, who having <hi>made us meet</hi> for the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings in the Heavenly places,</hi> does firſt of all take our <hi>Departed Spirits</hi> into His <hi>Cuſtody</hi>; and by'nd by, Revive our <hi>Bodies</hi> into Agreeable and Everlaſting <hi>Habitations</hi> for them; And ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Re-unite</hi> us unto GOD, in the endleſs enjoyment of Him, and of all things in Him. A SAVIOUR, who is very GOD; One whoſe Name is JEHOVAH; One Who is <hi>Over-all, GOD Bleſſed for ever:</hi> And
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002144_0013_0FBC223914E7CA98"/>
becauſe He is GOD <hi>Almighty</hi> therefore <hi>mighty to ſave.</hi> Becauſe He is JEHOVAH therefore <hi>Salvation</hi> is to be expected from Him; He is the <hi>True GOD</hi>; therefore <hi>Eternal Life</hi> is to be found in Him. Oh! what a SAVIOUR! Soul, How canſt thou hear of Him, and not Adore Him, not Embrace Him, not cry out unto Him; <hi>O my Lord, and my GOD; Say thou to my Soul, I am thy Salvation</hi>!</p>
            <p>Secondly, Our Great SAVIOUR in His Goſpel tenders the <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> to every Soul. Our SAVIOUR, <hi>Lo, He ſends forth His Voice, and that a mighty Voice</hi>; and it reaches to the Ends of the Earth: Shall not the very <hi>Dead</hi> now feel it reaching to them; and <hi>Live</hi> upon it! Iſa. XLV. 22. <hi>Look unto me and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the Earth.</hi> What is the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but the <hi>Salvation of the Soul</hi> tendered unto <hi>Every Soul of Man,</hi> that has <hi>done Evil,</hi> and would be <hi>ſaved</hi> from <hi>Evil?</hi> Now concerning this <hi>Goſpel,</hi> our SAVIOUR has given this Commiſſion, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> There is not one among all the Children of Men, to whom it may not be ſaid. <hi>Ah, Sinful Creature; Ah, Ruin'd Creature. There is a JESUS, able and willing to ſave thee, out of all the Ruins, which by ſinning againſt GOD thou haſt brought upon thee</hi>! Soul, What a Sweet Invitation has thy SAVIOUR given thee? <hi>Come to me, all you that Labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Reſt</hi>! What a Sweet Invitation; <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002144_0014_0FBC223A22AC2110"/>
come ye to the waters; Come unto me, Hear, and your ſoul ſhall live!</hi> To over come thy Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, O Invited Soul, He has kindly Spoken a word worth a World; A Word which has broken Millions of Hearts; And ſhall <hi>Thine</hi> be Obdurate! Joh. VI. 37. <hi>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Soul, Be thy <hi>Sins</hi> never ſo many, never ſo heinous, and be thy <hi>Plagues</hi> never ſo <hi>wonderful,</hi> thou ſhall yet be welcome to thy SAVIOUR, if thou come unto Him: His <hi>Grace</hi> is a <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Set Open</hi> for thee. Tho' thy caſe appear never ſo <hi>deſperate,</hi> yet there is <hi>Hope in Iſrael concerning this Thing.</hi> Thy <hi>Salvation</hi> may not be deſpaired of. T'will be a crime in thee, to conclude, That the <hi>Day of Grace</hi> is over with thee, or that thou haſt <hi>Sinned Unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. But the <hi>Salvation of the Soul</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had, without <hi>Believing</hi> in the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Mighty, and only SAVIOUR. The Greateſt CASE that ever was anſwered in the World, hear now what Anſwer is to be given unto it. The CASE has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and, Oh! that it were oftener ſo, and with a <hi>Soul full of Troubles,</hi> —Even this, <hi>What ſhall I do to be Saved?</hi> The Reply given to it, by the Apoſtles of GOD, is a very Authentick one; Act. XVI. 31. <hi>Believe on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and thou ſhall be Saved.</hi> FAITH is the <hi>Flight</hi> of a Diſtreſſed Soul, unto our Bleſſed SAVIOUR. The <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Flight</hi> is, <hi>The Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Soul.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>End</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002144_0015_0FBC223D50809FE8"/>
does <hi>Aim</hi> at; and the <hi>End</hi> which <hi>Faith</hi> does <hi>Come</hi> at. Our SAVIOUR has given us This Definition of the <hi>Faith</hi> which ſeeks and finds the <hi>Salvation of the Soul</hi>; Joh. V. 40. 'Tis a <hi>Coming to Him, that we may have Life.</hi> The proceſs of a <hi>Saving Faith</hi> ſhall be now Set before you. SOUL, Be Reſtleſs, till thou haſt paſſed through it, and made ſure of thy <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. Become ſenſible of what you are, and how much you want <hi>Salvation,</hi> while you are at a Diſtance from your SAVIOUR. To the <hi>Christleſs,</hi> muſt be ſaid, what we have in Rev. III. 17. <hi>Thou art wretched and miſerable and poor and blind and naked.</hi> O Fall into an Heart-melting Meditation; <q>What am I but a <hi>Child of Wrath,</hi> and a <hi>Prey to the Terrible,</hi> and Full of a lothſome <hi>Leproſy?</hi> Until my SAVIOUR Pitty me? Where muſt my Portion be, but in a <hi>Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> Except my SAVIOUR Pitty me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O my SAVIOUR, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me,</hi> to come unto thee, and <hi>Wo unto me, if I do it not</hi>!</q> But under the <hi>Convictions</hi> of this <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,</hi> at the ſame time confeſs your ſelves <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to come unto your SAVIOUR, yea, and <hi>Unworthy</hi> that GOD ſhould help you to come. Let the <hi>Soveraign Grace,</hi> that ſhines forth in <hi>Drawing</hi> to your SAVIOUR, all that come unto Him, have a due Confeſſion made of it. <hi>From the Depths cry unto the Lord: and ſay, Lord, I can Perform nothings, Lord, I do Deſerve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; But, O my SAVIOUR, Draw thou me, and I ſhall Run unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:002144_0016_0FBC223EA4C05340"/>Secondly Look for no leſs than the whole <hi>Salvation of the Soul,</hi> in Looking to your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR. You muſt come to your SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR in all His <hi>Offices</hi>; come to your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR for all His <hi>Benefits</hi>; come to your SAVIOUR, on all thoſe Purpoſes; 1 Cor. I. 30. <hi>Made of GOD unto us, Wiſdom, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, Holineſs, and Redemption.</hi> If your <hi>firſt</hi> Errand unto your SAVIOUR be, That by His <hi>Blood</hi> you may be <hi>cleanſed from all Sin</hi>; yet this muſt not be <hi>all</hi> your Errand. You muſt go to Him, That He would Inſtruct you, Govern you, Rectify all that is amiſs in you, and bring you to a <hi>Perfection of Holineſs is the Fear of GOD.</hi> It is by coming into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> that our <hi>Salvation</hi> is aſſured unto us: Even that <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is the Echo to that <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> wherein our SAVIOUR has Engaged for us, and <hi>Eternal Life was promiſed before the World begun.</hi> We come into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> by conſenting that our SAVIOUR ſhould be to us, do for us, according to His Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the <hi>Covenant of Redemption,</hi> on the behalf of them, whom in His <hi>Covenant</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an <hi>Head</hi> unto. Our SAVIOUR has Promiſed for His Elect, That <hi>He will make that Expiation for their Offences, which will bring them into a Reconciliation with GOD.</hi> Say now, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, I truſt in Thee So to Save me!</hi> Our SAVIOUR has alſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for His Elect, That <hi>He will Purify them, and make them zealous of Good Works, and write
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002144_0017_0FBC22421853EBA8"/>
the Law of GOD in their Hearts, and guide them with Counſil, and bring them to Glory.</hi> Say now, <hi>O my SAVIOUR, I truſt in Thee ſo to Save me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee <hi>Faith at Work,</hi> for the <hi>Salvation of the Soul.</hi> The Expreſſion leads me to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that: It muſt be a <hi>Working Faith</hi>; elſe, O <hi>Vain Man,</hi> 'Tis <hi>Dead,</hi> and will never bring thee to <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Your <hi>Faith</hi> muſt <hi>Work</hi> by <hi>Love.</hi> It muſt fill you with the <hi>Love</hi> of your SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR. This <hi>Love</hi> muſt keep you always at <hi>Work</hi> for Him, and in the work which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Life of PIETY: ſtill Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that He ſays unto you, <hi>I know thy works.</hi> You muſt come to that; Gal.

a <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> Let your SAVIOUR be the <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> of your Life; and <hi>walk even as he walked. Faith</hi> in your SAVIOUR, muſt bring the <hi>Blood</hi> of your SAVIOUR, to run warm in the Veins of your Souls; with Deſires and Studies of a <hi>Conformity</hi> to Him. You muſt Imitate a SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR who <hi>hates Wickedneſs and loves Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> Imitate a SAVIOUR, whoſe <hi>Meat</hi> and whoſe <hi>Drink</hi> it was to <hi>do the will of GOD.</hi> Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a SAVIOUR who took patiently whatever <hi>Cup</hi> His Father gave unto Him; and was a <hi>Sheep under the ſhearers</hi> when wrongs were done unto Him; and who <hi>went about</hi> ſtill every where <hi>doing Good.</hi> Let your SAVIOUR <hi>Live in you</hi>; and Oh!

If you felt your ſelves in the <hi>pangs of Death,</hi> what would be your <hi>Dying Sentiments?</hi> How will the <hi>Salvation of the Soul</hi> appear unto you, in your <hi>Dying Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi> Whatever you may think while you have the Amuſements and Enchantments of the World befooling of you, will not the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of a <hi>Dying Hour</hi> determine you to This? If a <hi>Dying Hour</hi> were at this Moment upon you, would you not ſay, <hi>The Salvation of my Soul, Oh! There is nothing in this World of ſo much Conſequence unto me. Oh! I would give all this World, that I had it aſſured unto me!
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002144_0021_0FBC2249024106C0"/>
Oh! That instead of throwing away ſo much of my Time in this World, I had ſpent more in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it</hi>! So do the <hi>Dying</hi> Think; Oh! that the <hi>Living</hi> would <hi>lay this to Heart</hi>; and not be miſled by <hi>madneſs in their Heart, while they live.</hi>

            <p>Expoſtulation, IV. What would you do if a Meſſage from GOD ſhould this Day come unto you; like what He ſent unto One of old; <hi>Set all in order, for thou art now to Dye, and not to Live one Month longer upon the Earth?</hi> What if the <hi>Angel of Death</hi> ſhould appear onto you, and <hi>Swear by Him who lives for ever and ever, Thy end is come; and no longer Time than one Month more ſhall be allowed unto thee?</hi> What would you now do for the <hi>Salvation of a Soul,</hi> juſt paſſing into the Eternal World? Would you not immediately Retire, and cry to the <hi>GOD of all Grace,</hi> That He would <hi>Aſſiſt</hi> you to Return unto Him? Would you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and bewail the <hi>Sins,</hi> which upon <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> you find you can be charged withal? Would you not beg with Tears, that for the ſake of the <hi>Blood</hi> of JESUS, your <hi>Sins</hi> which are <hi>many</hi> may be forgiven to you? Would you not give your ſelves up unto your SAVIOUR, and entreat that His Holy Spirit may poſſeſs you, and heal all that is amiſs in you, and make you <hi>meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light</hi>? Would you not be unpacified, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the <hi>Things that accompany Salvation,</hi> were plainly to be ſeen upon you? Then, go do theſe Things without any more ado. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,

NOW is <hi>the Day of Salvation</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>Expoſtulation, V. <hi>Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew you that I have yet Words for GOD,</hi> and for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of your SOULS. That <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Miniſtry,</hi> which does <hi>Preach the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> and bring the <hi>Glad Tidings of Good Things</hi> in the <hi>Great Salvation</hi>; ought not ſuch a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to be <hi>Beautiful</hi> in your Eyes? Can any but the Enemy of your <hi>Salvation</hi> perſwade you that the World can do well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a Miniſtry? Or, when 'tis <hi>Clothed with Salvation,</hi> and there is nothing but the <hi>Care of Salvation</hi> to be ſeen upon it, is not your Enemy at work in all the <hi>Contempt</hi> that ſhall be caſt upon it? Are any Men ſo much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned, Slandered, Reproached in the World, as they who <hi>do moſt</hi> for the <hi>Salvation</hi> of SOULS, and who after all, triumph in the Reproach as an Honour to them, and as a <hi>Revenge</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> is taking on them? Will you liſten to <hi>Satan,</hi> and be his <hi>Agents?</hi> Or, Do they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend the <hi>Salvation</hi> of SOULS, who go to inſinuate an opinion into you, That our <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry</hi> is Invalid, and can do nothing for your <hi>Salvation,</hi> becauſe our <hi>Ordination</hi> is defective? A moſt profane Inſinuation! What! when the <hi>Scriptures</hi> have ſo evidently aſſerted, the Validity of an <hi>Ordination</hi> by the <hi>Hands of the Presbytery</hi>; and informed us of no Order in the Church Superiour to it; but <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are expreſly called <hi>Biſhops</hi> there, [Acts XX. 17, 18.] When among the Faithful in

all Ages from the Days of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> down to ours, there has been ſuch a <hi>Cloud of Witneſſes</hi> unto it! And when it will be hard for you to find any <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> on the whole Continent of <hi>Europe,</hi> which do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon an <hi>Ordination,</hi> from an <hi>Order not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to that of our Paſtors!</hi> O our Evang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized People, 'Tis the <hi>Subſtantial</hi> PIETY of GOD Reigning in the SOUL, that we Preach, for your <hi>Salvation.</hi> To Trouble you with <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> will be of little uſe to your <hi>Salvation.</hi> I conclude with ſaying, 1 Cor. XII. 2. <hi>You are Saved, if you keep in Remembrance what I have Preached unto you.</hi>
