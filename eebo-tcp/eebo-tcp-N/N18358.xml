            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>IN addreſſing a ſociety inſtituted for the benevolent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of promoting the freedom of mankind, SLAVERY will be the proper theme of contemplation. So many vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes have been written on this ſubject, that nothing new can be expected; yet the ſubject ought never to be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exhauſted, while an individual of the human race is groaning in the ſhackles of ſervitude. The Divine, the Philoſopher, and the Poet, have united in reprobating the impiety, demonſtrating the immorality, and deſcribing the cruelty, of this practice. No writer of genius and ſenſibility, has ever avowed the doctrine, and attempted its juſtification and ſupport. Yet avarice has continued the practice in deſiance of the cleareſt dictates of reaſon, and the moſt vigorous efforts of learning and humanity. The liberty, and happineſs, of a large portion of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, are ſacrificed at the thrine of pride, ambition, and cruelty. One quarter of the globe has been depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:023816_0004_0FC137D7C08BE480"/>
by furniſhing ſlaves for another. This reflection ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites the keeneſt pain when we conſider that it is the pride, and the boaſt of this enlightened age, to excel former times in the improvements of literature, the refinement of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the practice of the gentle and ſocial virtues.</p>
            <p>SUCH diſtant proſpects of human woe can hardly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized by perſons who live in a country, where the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of government, the ſyſtem of law, and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of juſtice, ſecure to every member of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the higheſt political felicity. But America, the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and theatre of the moſt extenſive ſlavery known in any country, has peculiar reaſons to attend to this alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject, In America we have made unparrallelled ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions in the defence of the rights of man, and the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty and independence. On any part of this quarter of the globe ſhall we permit an unparrallelled vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of thoſe rights, ſo ineſtimable in the eyes of all mankind?</p>
            <p>TO excite the ſentiments of humanity, and animate us to a performance of our duty, let us conciſely trace the hiſtory of ſlavery from the earlieſt period, to the preſent time. In exploring the records of paſt ages we are ſtruck with the melancholy reflection, that hiſtory is chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in detailing the miſeries, that one part of mankind indict upon the other. Men in their moſt unpoliſhed ſtare of ſimplicity, and barbarity, are in perpetual warfare and contention. Remoteſt hiſtory ſhews them divided into ſmall tribes, inflamed againſt each other with the bittereſt animoſity, and delighting in deeds of heroiſm and martial enterpriſes—Prompted by revenge they frequently engage in the fierceſt conflicts. Strangers to the feeble voice of pity, they exercise the ſevereſt cruelties toward their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners—and thoſe who eſcape the ſtroke of death are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the moſt ignominious ſlavery. The claim found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the pretended right of conqueſt is unqueſtionably the origin of the practice and a practice that originates from the inhuman maxims of a barbarous age is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and becomes eſtablished, in the progreſs to civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, and government. New modes of acquiſition are introduced, and the power is protected by force of law. The offspring of ſlaves are doomed to follow the condition of their unhappy parents, and when the events of war fail of furniſhing the neceſſary ſupplies, a mart is opened for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023816_0005_0FC137E173E02E90"/>
the fale of rational beings. Theſe remarks are verified by the Grecian and Roman ſtory. While thoſe repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, ſo long erioneouſly celebrated as the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent models of a free government, were exulting in the exerciſe of political liberty, they unjuſtly withheld from the greater part of the people inhabiting their territories the ſame invaluable bleſſing, and ſubjected them to all the ſeverity of domeſtic ſlavery. When the iron hand of deſpotiſm had cruſhed the liberties of theſe republicks, and the Roman emperors tyrannized over the greateſt part of the civilized world, this practice was not only continued, but was confirmed and guarded by ſenatorial decrees, and imperial edicts. The laws of the Roman republic, and empire, delegated to the matter an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over the ſlave. The ſtare in legal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was deemed the property of the maſter as much as the beaſt of the field; and expoſed to the moſt rigorous puniſhment, and excruciating torture, which whim, rage, and revenge could dictate. The ſexes were reſtricted in forming that endearing connection, which might in ſome meaſure have alleviated their wretchedneſs—No marriages were permitted, unleſs the maſter was deſirous of propagating ſlaves; and then the connection was founded upon his will, instead of the inclination of the parties. The maſter at pleaſure with his own hand took away the life of a ſlave, without any form of trial; and without being reſponſible to any tribunal. If any of theſe wretches eſcaped the unrelenting hand of their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and ſurvived the period of their uſefulneſs, or by ſickneſs were rendered incapable of labor, they were expoſed helpleſs, and alone, on an iſland in the Tiber, to periſh by cold, and hunger. But to compleat our view of this iniquitous ſyſtem of ſlavery, we muſt take into conſideration the combats of the Gladiators—Theſe were ſlaves who were trained for the parpoſe of furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a barbarous ſpectacle that could only he reliſhed by a people who haw retined upon the principles of cruelty. The ſame Romans who were animated by the ſublime eloquence of Cicero, who were charmed by the tender ſentiments of Virgil, who were amuſed with the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrains of Horace, and who were corrupted by the wanton deſcriptions of Ovid, crouded. the amphitheatre to behold their fellow men ſtruggling in mortal fight; and ſmiled at their bravery, and heroiſm, exulted at their groans of anguiſh, and beſtowed the loudeſt acclamations
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:023816_0006_0FC137E3E669FFE8"/>on thoſe who met the fatal ſtroke, in the moſt elegant poſture, and graceful manner.</p>
            <p>WHILE the Roman Emperors were ſporting with the happineſs, and trampling on the privileges of mankind, the barbarians of the North iſſued from their frozen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, ſubverted the Roman empire and avenged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured rights of humanity. The followers of Odin deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their native wilds, and barren foreſts, for the cultivated fields and flowery gardens of Italy: they exchanged the bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ites, and horrid ſuperſtitions of the Druids, for the rational principles, and mild doctrines of chriſtianity; they abandoned their ſacred altars, and conſecrated groves, for the ſublime ceremonies, and ſplendid magnificence of the church. The conquerors were incorporated with the conquered; new forms of government aroſe, the laws were changed, and the feudal ſyſtem was eſtablished: yet ſlavery maintained its ground, accompanied with all its horrors and cruelty.</p>
            <p>BUT when the pure, and peaceable religion, of the meek and lowly JESUS, which taught the original equality of mankind, and brought life, and immortality to light, had ſpread its divine influence, a new aera commenced. The value of man was enlarged upon the ſcale of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and it was deemed impious to treat a candidate for eternal happineſs, in the character of a brute. The clergy exerted that amazing influence which they had obtained over mankind, in procuring for ſlaves their perſonal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But ſo gradual is the progreſs of truth, and ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult the abolition of long eſtabliſhed cuſtoms, founded on the apparent intereſt of the moſt influential part of the community, that ſeveral centuries elapſed before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of domeſtic ſlavery was accompliſhed in it's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent extent; for in ſome parts of Europe domeſtic ſlavery is not wholly extirpated.</p>
            <p>IT will not be pretended that the introduction of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, was the ſole cauſe of this happy revolution. Other cauſes unqueſtionably combined th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> effects in producing this ſalutary event. It is certain however that this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion firſt ſuggeſted the idea of the wickedneſs, and injuſtice of the practice. It opened the door, and led the way, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ſlaves. It's benevolent ſpirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the mind, to acquire and practice upon principles
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023816_0007_0FC137EAAD270560"/>
that would terminate in the gradual abolition of ſervitude. When it was by experience diſcovered, that liberty was productive of the greateſt political happineſs to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, intereſt co-operated with religion to eſtabliſh it upon the ruins of ſlavery. Before the promulgation of the chriſtian religion, there exiſted the ſame political, and moral cauſes, to produce the abolition of this cuſtom. Yet in pagan times, neither the voice of religion, or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was heard in defence of the violated rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. We have therefore a right to ſay, that if the chriſtian religion had never been promulgated, domeſtic ſlavery had never been aboliſhed. It may claim the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of originating in Europe, a political revolution of the greateſt importance to the welfare of mankind. Such ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eficial conſequences, though of a temporal nature, are a concluſive evidence, that the religion from whence they flow is the gift of heaven.</p>
            <p>WHILE the ſacred light of the goſpel was diffuſing itſelf through the world, and meliorating the condition of man, a new religion broke forth from the Eaſt. Endowed with the boldeſt genius and moſt enterpriſing ſpirit, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Arabia with the ſword and koran denounced death or ſlavery againſt his oppoſers, and promiſed to his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, eternal rewards of ſenſual pleaſure, in the arms of beauty, in the gardens of paradiſe. The Caliph's dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their religion, and extended their empire, with a rapidity never before known; and they threatened Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope with the danger of turning the courſe of their pilgrimages, from the tomb of Jeruſalem, to the Caa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba of Mecca—The religion of the koran is as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the religion of the bible is favourable, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happineſs. The moſlems filled with a ſupreme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for all other religions, and inſpired with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible zeal to propagate their own, have diſplayed the creſcent on the greater part of the eaſtern continent, and have reduced to ſlavery the conquered nation who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the faith of their prophet and the laws of the ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. The eſtabliſhment of polygamy has degraded the female ſex from companions to ſlaves, and doom'd them to waſte their youth, and beauty, in the gloomy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Seraglio. A ſtate very different from what the lovely ſex enjoy in this country, where in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their freedom, they exhibit the gentle vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in their moſt amiable light, and give the higheſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023816_0008_0FC137EDD98B2388"/>poliſh to our manners, and the pureſt joy to domeſtic life. The Turks, who conquered the empire and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the religion of Mahomet, have exhibited the blackeſt picture of human woe, and infamy, in the ſame countries, which once were the moſt ſplendid theatre of human glory and felicity. While chriſtianity was gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſhing domeſtic ſlavery, Iſlamism was ſtriving to riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et its ſhackles on all the nations of the earth. Theſe piratical barbarians were perpetually making incurſions into thoſe chriſtian countries, that were ſtruggling for perſonal freedom; and plundered from the inhabitants the children of both ſexes, to recruit the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nds of the Janizaries, and multiply, and vary the wanton pleaſures of the lords of the Harems. In that unhappy country there is no proſpect of reſtoring the rights of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unleſs by the utter extinction of the religion and government. Perhaps this event may not be far diſtant. Perhaps the inhabitants of the North will effect anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er revolution in the South, and the Ottoman empire fall by a female hand. Perhaps the imperial Catharine will diſplay the Ruſſian Eagle on the walls of Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, baniſh the Turkiſh creſcent to the deſerts of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia and abandoning the frozen ſhores of the Baltic, eſtabliſh her throne on the verdant, and blooming bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſea of Marmara. Every benevolent mind wiſhes for the deſtruction of a government that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to render the ſubjects poor and miſerable, to ſuppreſs every principle that leads to improvement in manners, arts, and ſciences, and to convert the moſt fertile countries into inhoſpitable deſerts. The Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean powers, actuated by narrow policy and illiberal jealouſy, are combining to ſave ſuch a government from impending ruin, and to prevent the accompliſhment of an event, which would open to the curioſity of the learned, the venerable remains of oriental antiquity.</p>
            <p>BUT we are to conſider domeſtic ſlavery in thoſe countries where there is a poſſibility, that our exertions may furniſh relief. I have obſerved that in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian kingdoms of Europe, this cuſtom was nearly abol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. It is remarkable that this event happened in Europe about the time of the diſcovery of America—a period when this practice was introduced into that quarter of the world, under circumſtances of cruelty unknown to ancient nations. The black native of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023816_0009_0FC137F574CCA9A0"/>burning climes of Africa, and the copper coloured ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the wilds of America, have long mourned the day, when Columbus failed from Europe, on an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which excited the wonder of his own, and has met with the applauſe of every ſucceeding age—An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe which has been celebrated in the ſublime ſtrains of Barlow, whoſe ſong will tranſmit the ſame of the hero, and the poet, to remoteſt time.</p>
            <p>AT this period America was peopled by a thouſand tribes, ſpeaking different languages, but all reſembling each other by their uniformity of manners, and ſimilarity of complexion. Excepting in a few inſtances, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be juſt emerging from a ſtate of nature, and were in that early age of ſociety, when they ranged the woods, and explored the ſtreams in purſuit of prey, and fed at the table prepared for them by the hand of nature.—Like all ſavage nations, addicted to war, they gloried in their ardent heroiſm in battle, their indefatigable perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in enterprize, their unſhaken independence of mind, and their ſupreme contempt of death. When re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge did not prompt them to the field, nor hunger impel them to the chaſe, they devoted themſelves to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Epicurean pleaſure, of <hi>indolence of body, and tranquility of mind.</hi> Diſdaining to labour, they peaceably ſlumbered away their time, while they devolved on their women the drudgeries of domeſtic life. A ſtate of ſociety which the romantic philoſophers Roffeau, and Raynal, have preferred to the luxurious refinements, and poliſhed pleaſures of civilized life.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the ſituation of the country when the Spaniards appeared on the coaſt—a nation whoſe avarice could be exceeded only by their inhumanity. Aided by the deciſive ſuperiority of their diſcipline, and the unknown thunder of their cannon, they impreſſed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal terror upon the defenceleſs ſavages, who fell an eaſy prey to their victorious arms, and irreſiſtable valour. The generous heart revolts at the idea, of deſcribing the unparrallelled tortures, and agonies, which theſe people ſuffered, and wiſhes for the honor of human nature, that they were blotted from the page of hiſtory, and obliter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from the memory of mankind. When the hand of deſtruction was weary of its work, avarice ſuggeſted the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023816_0010_0FC137F68EE892F8"/>idea of compelling the ſurvivors to labour for the benefit of their oppreſſors. Dragged from their groves and ſtreams, where they had lived in idleneſs, and freedom, and immured in the dreary caverns of mountains, they were doomed to waſte their lives in digging for thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious metals, whoſe imaginary value has been the ſource of infinite miſchief to mankind. Unaccuſtomed to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and by the imbecility of their conſtitutions incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuſtaining the rigor of ſervitude, they melted away beneath the rod of oppreſſion, with the ſame rapidity as they had been exterminated by the ſword. In their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate, an advocate appeared to plead their cauſe. Las Caſashas immortalized his name by his generous, but unſucceſsful endeavours, to reſtore them to their natural rights in this world, and ſecure them eternal happineſs in the world to come. But the intereſted views of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen defeated all his benevolent plans, and induced them to adopt one of his propoſals, which in the ardor of his zeal he did not thoroughly conſider. He approved of the expedient of ſupplying the place of the Americans whom he wiſhed to emancipate, by the importation of African ſlaves. This ſcheme was adopted, not with a view to relieve the Americans, but to recruit the country depopulated by rigor and cruelty, with a race of ſlaves, who by their ſtrength of body and vigor of conſtitution ſhould be capable of performing that hard ſervice which had proved ſo fatal to the feebler ſavages of America.—The Emperor Charles the Fifth, who by his frequent wars and barbarous perſecution of the proteſtant religion, during his long reign had rendered his extenſive domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a theatre of human calamity, granted to one of his favourites, the privilege of tranſporting a number of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſlaves to his American colonies. This ſtroke of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human policy introduced the practice, and it has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all the European powers who had ſettlements in America. For in America only has the African been deemed an article of property, and adjudged to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited his natural rights, on account of the blackneſs of his complexion, and the inferiority of his intellectual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</p>
            <p>THE untutored African was ſafely ſheltered in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive woods, without fear of any foreign power till the time of the Portugueſe diſcoveries. A ſhort time after the ſplendid adventure of Columbus, Vaſco de Gama
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023816_0011_0FC137F7EFA10228"/>
completed thoſe diſcoveries by ſteering round the Cape of Good Hope, and opening to his country the inexhauſtible riches of the Eaſt. This event produced a revolution that changed the channels of commerce, and poured upon Europe the delicacies, and luxuries of the Indus and the Ganges. The Portugueſe ſirſt imported the Africans into Europe, and made that miſerable nation an article of traffic. They were followed by the Spaniſh, and all the commercial nations, for the purpoſe of ſupplying with ſlaves their American colonies. All eagerly engaged in a branch of trade that held out ſuch lucrative profits as to ſlifle the feeble voice of compaſſion, and the unſupported claims of juſtice. In this manner the diſcovery of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca has proved a moſt calamitous event to Africa, and has extended the ſlave trade to ſuch a degree, as to call upon humanity, philoſophy, and religion to combine their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to aboliſh ſo deſtructive a cuſtom. America is the only chriſtian country where domeſtic ſlavery is tolerated in any considerable degree—May it be the glory of the preſent age to wipe away this reproach from our land.</p>
            <p>To attempt a refutation of the arguments advanced in defence of this cuſtom, in this enlightened period, and to this reſpectable auditory, would be a uſeleſs labour. Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fimilarity of complexion and inferiority of mind are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo far from juſtifying this conduct, that they ſerve to evince that the extreme baſeneſs of the perſons who advance them can only be exceeded by thoſe who carry them into practice, by taking an unfair advantage of the weak and defenceleſs ſtate of their fellow creatures, and doubling thoſe misfortunes which it is pretended they have inherited as their portion from the God of nature.</p>
            <p>THAT the condition of the African is meliorated by removing him from his native wilds to the cultivated fields of America will appear to be falſe upon an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the fact. In their own country, before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat was diſcovered by the European merchants, the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of Africa lived in the exerciſe of that freedom and independence which are natural to their ſtate in ſociety, and in the enjoyment of that repoſe and indolence which reſulted from the warmth of their climate and the fertility of their foil. Tho destitute of the security of a well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated government, and expoſed to all the diſtreſſes of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent wars; yet from their innocence and ſimplicity of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023816_0012_0FC137F9704B1920"/>
manners they derived a felicity and tranquility of mind which are unknown to their barbarous oppreſſors, and which perhaps fall not ſo far ſhort of the artificial pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of poliſhed life as pride and vanity have pretended—Such was their ſituation in their own country. Let us conſider the ſituation in which they are placed by the ſlave-trade. In order to realize the ſubject, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the ſcene which is now taking place on the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the earth—Let us extend our proſpect at once to the whole globe, and comprehend in one view all the miſeries of this unfortunate people.</p>
            <p>FROM the ports of commercial nations ſhips are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſailing to Africa, and the merchants at their eaſe are cooly calculating the accumulation of wealth which will accrue to them in proportion to the pain which they inflict upon their fellow men. On their arrival on the coaſt the natives are filled with fears and apprehenſions of danger. As far through the country as the name of the white people has been heard, ſo far the alarm is founded. Actuated by the hopes of gain, many of the natives are induced to engage in the trade, and become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reducing their wretched brethren to ſlavery—They procure by theft or purchaſe, and ſell for a trifling compenſation, perſons of every age, ſex, and condition. When their cargo is completed the traders frequently cloſe the buſineſs by detaining and carrying away thoſe very natives who have furniſhed them with their ſlaves—a juſt puniſhment upon them for their barbarity, but which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces our African traders to be as void of good faith as they are of humanity. Not only are individuals induced to commence robbers by this practice, but the kings and leaders of nations and tribes, are animated to undertake martial expeditions for the purpoſe of acquiring priſoners to ſell for ſlaves. Through the barbarous realms of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ble nations move from every ſide to mortal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat—the din of battle reſounds—death and ruin mark their progreſs, and the vanquiſhed who are taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are reſerved for diſtreſſes in compariſon with which death may be deemed a bleſſing. The theft of the rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the depredation of the warrior extend to every quarter, and no place can be found for the enjoyment of ſafety and repoſe. The father can never enjoy peace and tranquility in the boſom of his family. He is hourly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have his wife and children torn from his arms
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023816_0013_0FC137FAF35480C0"/>
and tranſported to a country from whence they can never return. Such incidents ſo frequently happen that they are the perpetual theme of converſation. They can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat a thouſand tales of the misfortunes of their friends and neighbours, which imprint the deepeſt gloom on their minds, and impreſs them with a conſtant fear and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuffering ſuch unſpeakable calamities.</p>
            <p>WHILE ſuch horrors deſtroy the tranquility of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of the country, behold on every hand innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable troops are deſcending to the ports frequented by the chriſtian traders. No language can deſcribe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and deſpair which they experience when they are dragged from their native land and deareſt friends, and tranſported to the place where they are expoſed to ſale. Imagine a father torn from the embraces of a diſtracted wife—children raviſhed from the arms of their parents, and lovers compelled to bid each other an everlaſting fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Perhaps they are all obliged to accompany each other in this ſcene of diſtreſs. Their tears, their lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and their intreaties would procure them relief were not the breaſts of the traders ſteeled againſt the ſoft emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pity, and the generous ſentiments of humanity. Theſe victims of avarice are fold with leſs ceremony than the beaſts of the field; they are ſtowed in the ſhips in a moſt uncomfortable ſituation, and loaded with ſhackles of iron. The father hears by turns the groans of a belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſon confined in chains, and the ſcreams of his faithful wife and innocent daughters, ſtruggling againſt the attacks of their brutal raviſhers. Can there be a human heart that does not ſoften with compaſſion at the cries of anguiſh and exclamations of ſorrow when the ſhips depart from the coaſt—when the ſlaves take a laſt view of their native crimes, to which they have no hopes ever to return—when they bid an eternal adieu to all that is dear to them, and find themſelves involuntarily embarking on a voyage, the unknown terrors of which give full ſcope to the moſt gloomy exerciſe of the imagination. I ſeem to hear the melancholy found of a thouſand voices united in deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their unſpeakable calamities, and which re-echo for the laſt time in their native groves and wilds, which have often witneſſed their joyous ſongs and innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But the African coaſt ſoon diſappears, and they purſue their trackleſs path, to the region deſtined to be the theatre of their wretchedneſs. In their paſſage they form
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023816_0014_0FC137FEA8647828"/>
ſuch dreary ideas of their future condition, that they vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untarily deprive themſelves of life to avoid approaching evil. Whenever they can break from their chains, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the proſpect of returning to their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they plunge themſelves into the ocean, and terminate at once their lives and their misfortunes. Not only do theſe ignorant ſavages put a period to their own exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but fired by rage and revenge they ſometimes burſt the bands that confine them and imbrue their hands in the blood of their oppreſſors. Inſtances have happened where the whole crew have fell victims to the rage and ſatiated the vengeance of their injured ſlaves. The Africans are there left alone in the ſhip without a pilot to direct their courſe. Imagine the horror of their condition—unſkilled in the art of navigation—incapable of ſteering the ſhip, and driven before the winds they are expoſed to the fury of the waves and depend on chance for relief. They wander round the ocean in the vain hopes of regaining their native ſhore till their food becomes exhauſted and they periſh by the unrelenting <hi>hand of famine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the traders eſcape the ſtorms of the ocean and the vengance of the Africans, and arrive in the Weſt-India iſlands and thoſe countries where there is a demand for their cargo, the ſale of theſe unfortunate people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleats their wretchedneſs. In diſtributing them thro the plantations no regard is paid to the tender ties of conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the ſacred bonds of friendſhip. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to undergo a ſeverity of ſervitude
unparalleled in the annals of mankind. They are doomed in the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing climes beneath a meridian ſun to inceſſant labor and fatigue. When their ſtrength is exhauſted, and they tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under their burdens the laſh of the whip quickens them to the laſh exertion of expiring life. They are denied a ſufficient reſpite from their labors to reſt their weary limbs and enjoy the neceſſary relaxation of <hi>repoſe.</hi> Their ſcanty ſubſiſtance is inſufficient to ſupply the calls of nature and ſatisfy the cravings of hunger. Not only do their unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maſters refuſe them a participation of the fruits of their labor, but they ſubject them to torture and cruelty which render life intolerable and at which humanity ſhudders. For the moſt trivial offences they inflict upon them the moſt barbarous puniſhments. In theſe countries nothing is more common than the ſound of the whip and the ſcreams and lamentations of the defenceleſs ſlays—when their bodies
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023816_0015_0FC1380266FAF160"/>
are <hi>gored</hi> with <hi>wounds</hi> and the blood flows in ſtreams they are plunged into the ocean whoſe waves ſharpen the pains with the keeneſt agony. Their barbarous oppreſſors are ſo far from compaſſionating their ſufferings that they laugh at their miſeries and mock at their calamities.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe people do not always tamely ſubmit to ſuch unprovoked injuries. Sometimes the voice of revenge is heard amongſt them—they ſuddenly ruſh to arms and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate upon their maſters all the cruelities they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at their hands. Animated with ſury and hatred they deal promiſcuous deſtruction on all their foes and the bloodieſt ſcenes of civil war are diſplayed. They ſpare neither age or ſex—the blooming virgin and the helpleſs infant are involved in one common ruin. Whole families enjoying the faireſt proſpect of affluence and happineſs are cut off at a ſtroke and ſwept to the duſt—The ignorant inſurgents after a ſhort gratification of their revenge are vanquiſhed and ſubjected to a repetition of cruelties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of language to deſcribe.</p>
            <p>THIS unhappy nation exhauſted by unremitting fatigue, depreſſed by the rigor of ſervitude and debilitated by the ſeverity of puniſhment, drag on a melancholy uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table exiſtence ſtrangers to the pleaſures of life. Their on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſolation is that the extreme torments they ſuffer in this life remove all apprehenſions about a future ſtate, and diſarm death of thoſe terrors which make ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon the minds of the reſt of mankind, as to deprive them of the tranſitory pleaſures of living by the perpetual fears of dying. To them the proſpect of terminating life furniſhes the pleaſing conſolation of terminating their wretchedneſs—To them the meſſenger of death is an angel of peace and they fondly believe that they ſhall have a day of <hi>retribution</hi> in another exiſtence in their native land—The funeral rites of a ſlave are performed by his brethren with every mark of joy and gladneſs—They accompany the corſe with the ſound of muſical inſtruments—They ſing their ſongs and perform their dances around the grave and indulge themſelves in mirth and pleaſantry upon an occaſion which the reſt of the human race contemplate with horror and anxiety.</p>
            <p>SUCH is a faint and imperfect picture of the miſeries; which the ſlave trade inflicts upon the defenceleſs natives of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023816_0016_0FC13806F01616D0"/>
Africa—Such is the melancholy condition to which they are reduced by thoſe who exult in the bleſſings of civil government, and who boaſt the exerciſe of the virtues ofjuſtice and humanity. Theſe ſufferings and cruelties are experienced by them not to ſupply their oppreſſors with the neceſſaries of life, but ſolely to furniſh them with the elegant conveniences, and ſuperfluous luxuries of ſenſuality. The product of their labour becomes a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal article of merchandize; and the nations of the earth derive their moſt luxurious enjoyments from the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded induſtry, and unparrallelled diſtreſſes of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſlaves. What muſt be our feelings when we conſider, while we are regaling our ſenſes and pampering our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites upon the rich delicacies and varied luxuries of the Indian Iſles, that their cultivation and growth have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the ſighs, the tears, and the groans of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ofour fellow creatures.</p>
            <p>To juſtify this wanton violation of the rights of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the tyrants' plea of neceſſity is advanced. It is ſaid that in no other way can the cultivation and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the moſt fertile countries be accompliſhed. It is painful to remark that this neceſſity has ariſen from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme cruelty—that the mode of treatment which the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have experienced, has rendered it neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate Africa of thouſands of the inhabitants annually, in order to ſupply the number that are deſtroyed in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. Had they been treated with mildneſs and clemency, and protected in the enjoyment of liberty by juſt and equal laws, without doubt their population would have furniſhed a ſufficient number of hardy and vigorous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers to cultivate the ground in the moſt profitable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It is a univerſal obſervation applicable to nations and individuals, that the value of the labor of their ſlaves increaſes in proportion to the kindneſs and humanity with which they are treated. A moſt powerful induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to check the progreſs of cruelty, and eſtabliſh a mild and generous rule of government. But ſhort-ſighted ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice has overlooked ſuch important advantages becauſe they appeared remote, and has prefered the immediate acquiſition of property to the welfare and happineſs of the human race. It is a mortifying truth that the Engliſh in their Weſt-India iſlands have exceeded any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the cruel treatment of their ſlaves. It is aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a people who know the bleſſings of a government
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023816_0017_0FC1380DE68534C0"/>
which remained unrivalled till the eſtabliſhment of the conſtitution of the United States, ſhould be guilty of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties ſo repugnant to the ſpirit and principles of their government. This circumſtance will call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance many events in the late war that gave birth to the American Empire. The unparrallelled cruelties exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the priſoners of war, by which many of our brethren ſuffered all the tortures of cold, hunger, and death, will be an eternal ſtigma on their national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the names of Howe and Clinton will be as infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to future times as the names of Nero and Domitian.</p>
            <p>HAVING contemplated the progreſs and extent of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in different ages and countries, we may with pleaſure turn our attention from ſuch dreary objects to the conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of it in our own country. Here a very different ſcene will be exhibited. In the ſettlement of this State, our anceſtors were animated by the principles of juſtice and benevolence. They obtained their title to the territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by fair purchaſe, and not by conqueſt—They never ſhed the blood of the natives but in ſelf defence—They never attempted to reduce them to a ſtate of ſervitude, or deprive them of their freedom; but they took them under their generous protection, and endeavoured to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the bleſſings of a mild government and a pure religion. Though the importation of African ſlaves was permitted, yet it was never authoriſed by law—They were under the protection of government, and their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was always diſtinguiſhed by that mildneſs and clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency which accorded with the characters of their maſters. If there can be any compenſation for the want of liberty, there can be no doubt but that their ſituation was made preferable to what it had been in their own country—And moſt clearly much greater profits have been derived from their ſervices under this mild uſage, than in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where they met with contrary treatment.</p>
            <p>THE Legiſlature has lately interpoſed in this State, and has enacted a ſtatute founded in tne higheſt wiſdom and the beſt policy, which in its operation will not only even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually produce the abolition of ſlavery, but will ſecure to the Africans in this country the ineſtimable bleſſing of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, againſt every ſpecies of encroachment and violation. Our own citizens are prohibited from embarking in this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023816_0018_0FC13818B6E417F0"/>
iniquitous traffic. No ſlaves may be imported by any perſons whatever, and heavy penalties and denounced againſt thoſe who ſend any Africans who have been eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated from ſlavery, from this ſtate to any other country. While we juſtly beſtow ſuch encomiums upon the laws and manners of our country, our regard to truth compels us with reluctance to obſerve that there are ſome individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſo deſtitute of humanity, that they have ſtained the honour, and violated the laws of their country, by embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this infamous commerce. In a very few initances, perſons have tranſported ſome emancipated Africans to the Weſt-Indies or ſouthern ſtates, and ſold them for ſlaves. An African who has thus been twice deprived of his lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, ſeems to excite a double ſhare of compaſſion. The villain who is capable of ſuch baſeneſs and cruelty, muſt be hardened in the ways of iniquity and regardleſs of the principles of juſtice.</p>
            <p>BUT we have ſome conſolation for the few inſtances of this kind which have happened, from the circumſtance that they have given birth to the inſtitution of a ſociety which will prevent their repetition. Animated with the pureſt ſentiments of benevolence, and anxious to ſoften the woes of human life, the ſociety which I have the honor to addreſs was eſtabliſhed for the noble purpoſe not only of combining its exertions with other ſocieties of a ſimilar nature, to procure the general abolition of ſlavery, but alſo to furniſh relief to perſons unjuſtly held in bondage, and incapable of claiming the protection of the law.</p>
            <p>THE contemplation of ſuch ſublime principles muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand every heart with the warmeſt rapture and pureſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. Humanity is exalted to it's higheſt exerciſe when it feels for the whole human race and prompts to actions which have for their object the glory and felicity of future ages. It is a pleaſing conſideration that the liberal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo prevalent at this period is invigorated and diffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the mild ſpirit of chriſtianity. That religion which has produced ſuch an aſtoniſhing difference of character between ancient and modern times, and has ſo greatly bettered the condition of mankind by aboliſhing domeſtic ſlavery in Europe, ſtill continues to extend the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of principles that are highly favourable to human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. It is a truth which ought not to be omitted, that the ambaſſadors of this holy religion, animated by the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023816_0019_0FC1381A64B212D0"/>
genuine ſpirit of the heavenly doctrines which they teach, and filled with a becoming zeal to promote the immortal welfare of their fellow-creatures, have taken an active and decided part in favour of the defenceleſs tribes of Africaf. What benefits may not civil ſociety expert from the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous exertions of a claſs of men who labour to reſtore mankind to their natural rights in this world, in order to prepare them for eternal felicity in the world to come.</p>
            <p>HAVING taken a conciſe view of the origin, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and the preſent ſtate of ſlavery, we are to conſider what meaſures can be ſuggeſted, adopted, and executed to accompliſh the important purpoſe of its abolition. In our own State a punctual obſervance of the laws in being will eventually anſwer the deſign. As there are ſome perſons in all countries ſo deſtitute of the principles of virtue that they will practice every expedient to elude and contravene the laws, it may be neceſſary not only to attend to the punctual execution of them, but alſo to intereſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic opinion againſt ſuch nefarious conduct. To deſignate the perſons who purſue this commerce, and brand them with ſome public mark of infamy, may reach offenders in certain caſes which are beyond the animad verſion of law—and there are but few ſo hardened as to brave that univerſal reproach and contempt which in a ſhort time the general voice of mankind will denounce againſt thoſe who engage in this iniquitous branch of buſineſs. The principles that conſtitute the baſis of the government of the United States will infallibly produce an extinction of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very throughout the empire, as ſoon as will be compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the ſafety of the public and the welfare of the ſlaves themſlaves. And I am fully convinced that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is not remote when the whole world will aſſent to the truth of the proportion, that in every ſpecies of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in every mode of cultivating the earth, the labor of freemen will be far more profitable than the labour of ſlaves.</p>
            <p>BUT every boſom glows with a deſire to furniſh a relief commenſurate to the injury. All wiſh that ſome plan might be adopted to procure the univerſal eſtabliſhment of liberty for this people—How can ſo deſireable a purpoſe be accompliſhed? Shall we apply to the ſupreme power of the empire, and requeſt their interpoſition witn foreign nations in favour of this people that liave ſo long been
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023816_0020_0FC1381BF03E72D8"/>
the object of contempt and indifference. Vain would be ſuch an interpoſition on the part of our government—The kings and princes of the earth who have ſo long ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their thrones in idleneſs and luxury, will be deaf to every meaſure that is calculated to augment the happineſs of mankind by the extenſion of liberty. No meaſure can be attended with ſucceſs unleſs it be directed to a univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſſemination of the principles of liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and to animate and rouſe all mankind to a general exertion in reclaiming their natural rights and privileges.</p>
            <p>IT is aſtoniſhing that rational beings have ſo long ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to governments which are ſo far from being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote the general good, that they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the happineſs of the ſubjects, and involve them in greater trouble and confuſion than would be experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in a ſtate of nature. The more information the people obtain, and the more they reflect on their degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their ſervile obedience to a few who ſport with their wretchedneſs and ruin, the ſtronger will be their induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſtruggle for a reſtoration of their natural rights, and the enjoyment of the ſecurity of a well regulated gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Let us ſee whether mankind are not haſtening to accompliſh this purpoſe. For a long time the eaſtern world has experienced no capital revolution—Knowledge has been ſpreading on all ſides and preparing the minds of men for ſome great event. The preſent kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope were founded upon the ruins of the Roman empire. The unwieldy deſpotiſm of that extenſive government ſeems to have thrown a langour on the human mind, to have enſeebled the vigor of genius and ſuppreſſed the power of imagination. The conquerors, ignorant of the arts of peace, eſtabliſhed their governments upon the ſame military principles which led them from the cold regions of the North to the delicious climes of the South. When men are united in ſociety and protected by government, the neceſſary conſequence is, a gradual progreſſion in the civilization of manners and the improvements of literature. Such has been the progreſs in Europe; and that country has exhibited a moſt ſtriking contraſt between the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the cuſtoms, and the literature of the dark ages, and the eighteenth century. Printing has furniſhed every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſo many monuments of literary excellence, that it has become impoſſible that they ſhould revert to that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023816_0021_0FC1381D6FEE85E8"/>
ſtate of ignorance and barbariſm which followed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the imperial power of Rome. The progreſs of learning has expanded the fire of genius, enlarged the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the mind, and unfolded a very different i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of the rights of man from that which was entertained at the formation of the preſent governments of Europe. In this progreſs religion has been refined and purified from the droſs of Pagan idolatry, and the abſurdities of enthuſiaſtic ignorance. No more do we ſee the flames of perſecution blazing through Europe, nor hear the groans of wretched victims reſounding thro the horrid dungeons of the inquiſition. The world has at length diſcovered this ſelf-evident propoſition, that faith in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is incapable of legal coercion—that uniformity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion can never be eſtabliſhed, and that variety is not inconſiſtent with the happineſs of the people and the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of government. A difference of opinion in point of ſpeculation has ceaſed to be criminal, and the ſacred right of private judgment is univerſally acknowledged. No more do the deepening glooms of ſuperſtition ſpread a torpor over the intellectual faculties, and deaden the ſprings of active life—No more do the flights of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm prompt to the wild deeds of faction, and the incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ravings of miſtaken devotion—No more does hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy aſſume the maſk of piety and the garb of innocence, for the purpoſe of impoſing upon the ſimplicity and the credulity of the ignorant—No longer is the merit of man eſtimated by high pretenſions of ſanctity and extreme auſterity of manners. But while ſuperſtition, enthuſiaſm, and hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy are retiring to the regions of primeval darkneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the mild beams of liberality, candour, and charity, are unfolding upon us in a blaze of glory, and commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their univerſal and eternal reign, The ſtandard of merit is founded upon vigor of underſtanding—extent of information—and purity of character. While theſe ſentiments are prevailing, it is neceſſary that an alteration ſhould take place in government correſpondent to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of mankind.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD that ſpirit of liberty which led the Americans to empire and fame, and laid the foundation of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which will be the glory of the preſent, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future ages has croſſed the atlantic and flies like the electric flame from breaſt to breaſt, and kingdom to kingdom. An important revolution is commencing—a new order of things is begun. In the kingdom of France
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023816_0022_0FC1382126FAE5A8"/>
we have witneſſed a change in government without a parallel in hiſtory. The people inſpired by the cool voice of reaſon, have by a deliberate act reſumed their natural rights, and have the faireſt proſpect to eſtabliſh a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of government upon the broad baſis of general liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which will ſecure to them the enjoyment of peace and proſperity. The lives and property of the citizens are no more dependent on the will of the ſovereign, and his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates are no longer the laws of the land. The Baſtile that deteſtable inſtrument of tyrrany, that public infuſe upon human nature, where ſo many perſons have languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away a miſerable exiſtence in the gloomy manſions of a dungeon, is levelled with the duſt. What heart is not animated to behold the ſame French Nation who had long trembled at the ſound of the name of the Baſtile, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the flame of liberty, marching with the firmneſs and intrepidity of heroes to the attack of deſpotiſm in the center of her capital. Hiſtory has never exhibited a more glorious triumph of liberty over arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>THE ſame ſpirit pervades the various kingdoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. From the ſhores of the atlantic to the confines of Aſia, the minds of men are inſpired with that ſpark of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which was kindled by nature, and the flame of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is ready to burſt on their unfeeling oppreſſors. The ſovereigns of Europe behold from their tottering thrones, theſe alarming proſpects with the deepeſt fear and concern. Even the Ottoman Deſpot, who from a capital calculated by nature to be the Emporium of commerce, and the miſtreſs of the world, has long diſtributed miſery and diſtreſs, thro his extenſive dominions, now views with horror and amazement, the ſpirit of freedom reviving among his ſubjects—Perhaps that fame may be rekindled, which produced ſuch wonders in the flouriſhing period of the Grecian republics.</p>
            <p>IT is impoſſible to predict what will be the event of this proſpect, that is unfolding to our view—But we may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit of prophecy, venture to aſſert that the world is on the eve of a great revolution—that if the forms of government are not materially altered, yet the ſpirit of them will be retined and ſublimated, and conformed to the intereſt and welfare of the human race—That ſovereigns will no longer dare to ſport with the feelings, and trifle with the happineſs of their ſubjects—That they will find
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023816_0023_0FC13826C42518A0"/>
their own preſervation and ſecurity dependent upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial adminiſtration of juſtice—The ſtate of the human mind moſt unqueſtionably renders neceſſary ſuch a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and we may anticipate the accompliſhment of it, with exultation and delight.</p>
            <p>THE illuſtrious head of the American Empire may contemplate with ineffable rapture, the extenſive bleſſings flowing to all mankind, from a revolution in which he bore a principal ſhare—Elevated to the ſupreme magiſtracy, by the unanimous voice of millions, as a reward for his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervices, and ſupported by the applauſe and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a grateful and proſperous nation, he ſurveys with conſcious ſuperiority the hereditary monarchs of Europe, trembling on their thrones of deſpotiſm, and ſuſtaining their authority by force, and fear amid the tears, the groans, and the execrations of their wretched ſubjects and vaſſals.</p>
            <p>OUR pleaſure in beholding this glorious proſpect opening upon mankind, is heightened by the conſideration, that the fable tribes of Africa will participate of the common bleſſings—That ſpirit of enquiry, and that liberality of ſentiment which are prompting mankind to a general ſtruggle for liberty and happineſs, will comprehend for their object, every nation on the globe.—Within a few years paſt, no ſubject has more warmly engaged the attention of the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary world, than African ſlavery—and the writings of the divine, the philosopher, the poet, and the noveliſt concur in reprobating the practice in terms of equal ſeverity—The rapid and extenſive diffuſion of theſe generous ſentiments, will in a ſhort time produce the total extirpation of a ſlavery which has exhibited the moſt complicated ſyſtem of baſeneſs and cruelty, that ever inſulted the dignity of human nature. Let us combine our exertions in accelerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the accompliſhment of this happy event—while our hearts are elevated at the pleaſing ſcene, let us addreſs the FATHER of MERCIES with this humble ſupplication—that all people may be reſtored to the ſafe and peaceable enjoyment of their natural rights and privileges—that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic and national ſlavery may be aboliſhed thro the the world—and that civil government may be every where eſtabliſhed upon the broad and permanent baſis of political liberty, and the general good, and flouriſh till time ſhall be no more.</p>
