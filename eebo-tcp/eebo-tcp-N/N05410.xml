            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved had, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Viſion, more than St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Wiſh of ſeeing <hi>Christ</hi> in the Fleſh; which was greater and more deſireable, than to have ſeen <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, or <hi>Rome</hi> in it's Glory. He <hi>ſaw in the midſt of ſeven golden Candleſticks one like unto the Son of Man</hi>—Our <hi>Lord Jeſus Christ</hi> in an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of human Shape as a Man. Which was a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, as the SCHECHINAH of old, of his divine Preſence in the Churches. The Appearance was very bright and majeſtick. A Perſon <hi>cloathed with a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment down to the Foot, and girt about the Paps with a golden Girdle.</hi>—Not leſs glorious in his <hi>Apparel,</hi> as the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> of our Profeſſion, than he was, as a mighty Conqueror, when the Prophet ſaw him coming from <hi>Edom,</hi> with dyed Garments from <hi>Bozrah.—His Head and his Hair were white like Wool, as white as Snow</hi>—
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006848_0004_102A8099DAC53DB0"/>denoting his perfect Purity.—And his <hi>Goings forth from of old, from everlaſting</hi>—"His hoary Head was no Sign of decay; but it was indeed a <hi>Crown of Glory,"</hi> being always found in the Way of Righteouſneſs. — <hi>And his Eyes were as a Flame of Fire</hi>—An Emblem of his quick and all-piercing Sight, who ſearcheth the Reins and Hearts.—<hi>And his Feet like unto fine Braſs, as if they burned in a Furnace:</hi>—He proceeding in his Work with irreſiſtible Strength, will tread down all his Enemies.— <hi>And his Voice as the Sound of many Waters:</hi>—loud, and full of Majeſty, and of Terror unto the Wicked, when he ſpeaks to them in his Wrath!—<hi>And he had in his right Hand ſeven Stars:</hi>—figurative Repreſentations of the Gifts he hath received for Men.—<hi>And out of his Mouth went a ſharp two-edged Sword:</hi>—for the Word of God is quick, and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joints and Marrow, and is a Diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart.—<hi>And his Countenance was as the Sun ſhineth in his Strength:</hi>—equalling, if not exceeding, the Brightneſs of the Sun at Noon-Day. <hi>Christ</hi>'s Face did ſhine as the Sun in it's full Luſtre, not only when he was transfigured before <hi>John</hi> and two other Diſciples on Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> but alſo when he was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him in the midſt of ſeven golden Candleſticks. —A very magnificent Deſcription is this of our bleſſed Saviour. Each Particular of it might well arreſt our Attention, and long employ our Thoughts: But we muſt at this Time, content ourſelves with a tranſient View of the ſeveral Glories of <hi>Christ</hi> here exhibited, and fix our Minds upon <hi>One</hi> of 'em, which will abundantly furniſh us with Matter ſuitable for our preſent Meditation. — <hi>He had in his right Hand Seven Stars.</hi>

1. The Subject of our firſt Inquiry is, The Myſtery of the <hi>Seven Stars:</hi> What we are to underſtand thereby. And this is plainly declared by him that had them in his Hand, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>of this Chapter. The Seven Stars are the Angels of the Seven Churches; and the Seven Candleſticks are the Seven Churches,</hi> i. e. of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly above named. The <hi>Seven Stars</hi> myſtically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the <hi>Angels,</hi> i. e. Paſtors of thoſe Churches.— Miniſters of the Goſpel, tho' <hi>Men of like Paſſions with others</hi> by Nature, are <hi>Angels</hi> by Office.—The Meſſengers of the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſent forth to miniſter unto thoſe who ſhall be Heirs of Salvation. And as the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven are called <hi>Stars,</hi> Job. 38.7. ſo likewiſe are the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Churches: And that fitly;—</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. In regard of the <hi>Eminence</hi> of their Place. <hi>Behold the Height of the Stars, how high they are?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 22 12.</note> It is a high Place which Miniſters have in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of the Church: An Office of ſpecial Dignity which they are rais'd to. Their Plate is between God and the People. They are taken nearer to Him, in a peculiar Relation, and ſuperior Employment. They are <hi>the Servants of the Lord,</hi> ſo ſtyled by way of excellency; his more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Attendants; do approach his Perſon in religious Addreſſes, and are the People's Mouth to God by Prayer, as well as God's Mouth to them by Preaching. They are <hi>Ambaſſadors for Christ,</hi> to manage his Concernments, and in a manner repreſent his Perſon; do ſpeak and act in his Stead
<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 5.20.</note>. Their Miniſtry is therefore a Preferment; their Calling high and heavenly. This Honour have not all the Saints; and no Man ſhould take it to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as was <hi>Aaron</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 5.4.</note>. Divinity is the Queen of Sciences: A Profeſſion in itſelf, and in the Eſtimation of all that are wiſe, the moſt noble: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men pour Contempt upon it, and count thoſe as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006848_0006_102A80A9F188B5B8"/>the Filth of the World, and the Dirt under their Feet, whom <hi>God hath ordained Stars.</hi> They are indeed as Men, <hi>formed out of the Clay,</hi> and in as low a State as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but as Miniſters of God, are raiſed above them in ſome Endowments and Prerogatives. And to deny or deſpiſe this Advancement, in the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> argues groſs Ignorance, or prophane Haughtineſs of Mind: While to aſſert it, may ſeem Pride and Vanity in the priviledg'd Subjects of it. But they may and ſhould magnify their Office, without vaunting and exalting themſelves. In their high Station Miniſters are to be very humble and condeſcenſive. The Stars in their Height ſhew a thouſand times leſs than really they be. An Affectation of Grandeur; an Oſtentation of Gifts and Graces, and Performances, is very unbecoming the Miniſters of <hi>Christ,</hi> who ſaith to them, <hi>He that is greateſt among you, ſhall be your Servant.</hi> And People ſhould not envy the Eminence of the miniſterial Order, and ſay as <hi>Corah</hi> and Company did to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> Numb. 16.3. <hi>Ye take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them; wherefore then lift you up yourſelves above the Congregation of the Lord?</hi> None would be proud of, nor envious at, ſuch a Place in the Church, did they rightly apprehend the Danger of it proportionable to the Dignity of it: And if by Tranſgreſſion any with <hi>Judas,</hi> fall from it, 'twill be into the greater Contempt and Miſery. Wo to any of us, that ſhall incur <hi>Capernaum</hi>'s Doom, and after we have been lifted up to Heaven, be caſt down to Hell; and be there upbraided and inſulted in ſuch Language as that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 14.12. <hi>How art thou fallen from Heaven, O</hi> Lucifer, <hi>Son of the Morning?</hi>

Every good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is, in a Degree, as his Fore-runner was, <hi>a burning and a ſhining Light,</hi> to give Knowledge of Salvation unto his People, by the Remiſſion of their Sins, through the tender Mercy of our <hi>God,</hi> whereby the <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> from on high hath viſited us, to give Light to them that ſit in Darkneſs, and in the Shadow of Death, to guide our Feet in the Way of Peace
<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 1.77.</note>.</p>
            <p>The bright <hi>Morning-Star,</hi> and all the other <hi>Planets,</hi> ſhine but with a borrowed Light: They only reflect on us the Light which the Sun caſts on them.— All the Light of heavenly Truth, of ſpiritual and divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Miniſters impart to others is received by them from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteouſneſs, and Fountain of Light, 1 Cor. 11.13. <hi>I have received of the Lord that which I alſo delivered unto you.</hi>—The Lord giveth the <hi>Sun</hi> for a Light by Day, and the Ordinances of the <hi>Moon</hi> and of the <hi>Stars</hi> for a Light by Night
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Jer. 31.35.</note>. The Stars ſhine only in the Night. It is only in this dark and benighted World, that Miniſters are of uſe, and do ſerve to the enlightning of Souls: Tho' in reſpect of the Glory, which, if they are wife and faithful, they ſhall attain to, they will ſhine as the Stars forever in the heavenly World; yet in reſpect of the Benefit of their Light, which is here ſo much wanted, they ſhall there ceaſe to ſhine, for the coeleſtial City, which hath no need of the <hi>Sun,</hi> nor of the <hi>Moon,</hi> certainly hath not of theſe Stars to ſhine in it;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006848_0008_102A80B247180658"/>for <hi>the Glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof.</hi> The Light of theſe Stars will be abſorpt in that World, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhineth in all his Glory. In compariſon of the Light which the Church ſhall enjoy in Heaven, it is Night with it on Earth. It is no more than Star-light,—a little glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light: We ſee darkly, and know but in part. That is applicable to the Goſpel, and the preſent Miniſtry of it, which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have a more ſure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well, that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-Star ariſe in your Hearts.</hi> The Goſpel, miniſtred by Men, is a Light that ſhineth in this dark World. We ſhould take heed to it, walk in it, and act by it. The Day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us, by <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming in the Fleſh, and finiſhing the Revelation of God to Men: The Day-Star begins to ariſe in our Souls, when he ſavingly viſits them with his Light and Grace. But then is a perfect Day of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and eternal Light of which that is the early Dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Forerunner: a glorious Day, which the Goſpel, and the Miniſtry of it, are appointed to uſher in.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, In reſpect of the <hi>Influence</hi> of their Authority and Example, Miniſters are Stars. The Stars are ſuppoſed to ſhed down their Influences, as well as reflect Light on the Earth. Thoſe are ſecret and inviſible. Their Light is ſeen, but their Operations (whatever they be) are not perceived by us. God ſpeaks of theſe among his wonderful, unſearchable Works, <hi>Job</hi> 38.31.
<q>Canſt thou bind the ſweet Influences of <hi>Pleiades?</hi> or looſe the Bands of <hi>Orion?</hi> Canſt thou bring forth <hi>Mazaroth</hi> in his Seaſon? or canſt thou guide <hi>Arcturus</hi> with his Sons? Knoweſt thou the Ordinances of Heaven? Canſt thou ſet the <hi>Dominion</hi> thereof on the Earth.</q> So far was <hi>Job</hi> from being able to order and direct, to reſtrain or cauſe the Influences of the Stars, that he could not tell
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006848_0009_102A80BC673E0D10"/>what, or how great, they were. Nor may all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Science, ſince his Time, ſhew us the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Manner; the Extent and Degree of 'em. Tho' Philoſophy hath not deſcrib'd the Rule which the Stars have over terreſtrial Bodies, yet the Goſpel hath ſetled the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Miniſters <hi>in</hi> his Churches, — ordained them to have a ſpiritual, paſtoral <hi>Rule</hi> over the People; and enjoyn'd the People's Obedience and Submiſſion to them in the Lord. What their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, and how they are to exerciſe it, may be learn'd from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Words to <hi>Peter,</hi> in Mat. 16.19. <hi>I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on Earth, ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> They are conſtituted <hi>Stewards</hi> of God's Houſe, to open the Door of Entrance thereinto unto the duely qualified, and to ſhut it againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and prophane. They have Power to bind on Earth, not by impoſing any Thing as Duty upon Men, which the evangelical Law doth not Command, but by declaring what that obliges them to, and calling them in the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to perform it. They have Power to looſe, not ſuch as the romiſh <hi>High Prieſt</hi> claimeth of granting <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> but to aſſert and maintain our Chriſtian <hi>Liberty.</hi> They are to bind by retaining, and looſe by remitting, of Sins. Joh. 20.23. <hi>Whoſe ſoever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whoſe ſoever Sins Ye retain, they are retained.</hi> They remit and retain Sins, by declaring and applying the Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Word; the former to the Penitent, and the latter to the Impenitent: And by adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Cenſures of the Goſpel.— They have Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to do ſuch Things for the Edification of his Churches; and the due Exerciſe of it, hath a great Influence into the well-being and flouriſhing of them. Miniſterial Authority is not to be deſpiſed as an empty Name, an inſignificant Power, a Shadow without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006848_0010_102A80BF8AF392D8"/>becauſe there is no external Force to abet it, or to avenge Diſobedience to it. The Influences of the <hi>Pleiades</hi> are not ſweeter or more powerful, than thoſe of the mild and gentle Adminiſtration of <hi>Elders that rule well</hi> and wiſely: Nor are the Bands of <hi>Orion</hi> ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, than thoſe with which they bind contumacious Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, ſo as not to be eaſily looſed therefrom. Great alſo is the Influence of Miniſter's Example upon the Minds and Conſciences and Actions of Men: And unleſs it be good, their Doctrine, how true and clear ſoever, will not lighten them to Heaven. Their vicious Practice will be of more force to lead People aſtray, than all their perſuaſive Preaching to bring them into the Way of Life.— The Summer-fruitfulneſs, or Winter-barrenneſs of the Church; it's peaceful, or troubled, it's healthful or ſickly State, may depend as much on the Lives of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, as the various Seaſons of the Year, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Men, do on the Starry-Heaven, whoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion God hath ſet in the Earth.</p>
            <p>4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>, In reſpect of the regular and conſtant <hi>Courſe</hi> of their Miniſtrations, the Angels of the Churches are Stars. There is exquiſite Order among the Stars: They keep in their proper Orbs, move in their proper Spheres, accompliſh their appointed Courſes, perform their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Revolutions with the greateſt Certainty and Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This is ſuch a clear and inconteſtible Proof of One original Being, the divine Architect and Ruler of the Univerſe, as made the Roman <hi>Philoſopher</hi> with good Reaſon conclude,
<q>That whoever thinks, that the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Order, and incredible Conſtancy of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies, and their Motions (whereupon the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Welfare of all Things depend) is not governed by an intelligent Being, Himſelf is to be accounted void of Underſtanding.</q> The orderly Behaviour of wiſe and faithful Miniſters in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006848_0011_102A80C6455C44C8"/>and ſteady proceeding in, and finiſhing their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Courſes, may be fitly compared to the Regularity and Conſtancy of the Motions of the Stars, without any deviation or confuſion: And 'tis, in like manner, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and uſeful. If the Stars did not keep in their Orbs, but wander up and down uncertainly, how could Paſſengers by Sea, or Land, be directed by them? If Miniſters are <hi>wandering Stars</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jude Ver. 13.</note>, wild and rambling in their Diſcourſes, unſtable in all their Ways, excentrick and retrogade, how ſhall People, in their difficult Paſſage to Heaven, take any ſure and ſafe Direction from them? If the Stars ſhould croſs one another's Motions and juſtle one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what Confuſion would the heavenly Syſtems be thrown into?—Such as the Churches are, when the Paſtors are envious toward, and do counter-work one another. —Theſe imperfect Hints may ſhew us the Reſemblance betwixt Miniſters and Stars.— We proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To enquire into the Meaning of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s having theſe Stars in his <hi>right Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. It ſignifies that they are ſome of his moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Gifts</hi> to the Churches. As the Purchaſe of his Death, and in Conſequence of his Aſcenſion, our Lord received a rich Variety of Gifts,—Gifts of all Sorts and Degrees, for Men, yea, for the Rebellious. But in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Enumeration of 'em, he mentions only the Miniſterial, as being of principal Worth and Uſe, Eph. 4.11. <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt. Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> are as truly the Gifts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> and are in his <hi>right Hand,</hi> as being of ſpecial Worth and Advantage: — more excellent and precious Gifts, than many other good Things which he
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006848_0012_102A80C7D3EDDE20"/>beſtows. They have the precedence in his right Hand: As <hi>Length of Days is in</hi> Wiſdom's <hi>right Hand; and in her left</hi> are <hi>Riches and Honour,</hi> Prov. 3. 16. <hi>Joſeph</hi> preſumed that <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> his firſt-born, would have the Preheminence in the Bleſſing of his Father <hi>Jacob;</hi> and therefore brought him to his <hi>right Hand.</hi> But the good Patriarch, tho' blind, fore-ſeeing by the Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that the Younger of the Lads would be greater, be more favoured and bleſſed of God than the Elder, to ſignify this, ſtretched out his <hi>right Hand,</hi> and laid it on <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 14. The Hands which <hi>Jeſus</hi> lifteth up to bleſs us
<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 24.50.</note>, are full of Bleſſings; Bleſſings of all kinds, which he hath to confer upon his People: And in his <hi>right Hand</hi> are <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> Theſe are ſome of his choiceſt Gifts to them. The <hi>Lord</hi> is ſpoken of as being very gracious to his People in the vouchſafement of ſuch ſpiritual Gifts to them, while he does withold thoſe which are temporal and bodily: Iſa. 30.20. <hi>Tho' the Lord give you the Bread of Adverſity, and the Water of Affliction, yet ſhall not thy Teachers be removed into a Corner any more, but thine Eyes ſhall ſee thy Teachers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, It imports their being abſolutely in his Power, intirely at his Diſpoſal, and under his Direction: As any Thing is which a Man hath in his Hand; eſpecially in his <hi>right Hand,</hi> which is uſually the ſtronger, and by which he has the greater Command of what he takes into it, and more eaſily doth what he pleaſeth. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is Head over all Things to the Church, hath the Stars in his right Hand, being the Ruler of them. They are all his Servants.— <hi>He telleth the Number of them, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them all by their Names.</hi> He aſſigns them their proper Place in the <hi>Heaven</hi> of his Church, according as it's various Needs require, and their different Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006848_0013_102A80CA5B86B508"/>Suit: 1 Cor. 12. 28. <hi>He hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</hi> Theſe Stars riſe and ſet at his Command; ſhed forth their Light and Influence when, and where, and in what meaſure, he ordereth them. He <hi>ſealeth up</hi> theſe Stars, <hi>looketh to them, and they ſhine not,</hi> and <hi>bindeth</hi> their <hi>ſweet Influences,</hi> at his Pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. It denotes his honouring of them. The right Hand excelling in Strength, is more honorable than the left: 'Tis a Mark of Reſpect to be placed at it, and held in it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf hath God <hi>exalted with his right Hand,</hi> a Prince and Saviour to give Repentance to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and Forgiveneſs of Sins; and his Miniſters doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> exalt with his <hi>right Hand,</hi> to preach Repentance and Forgiveneſs of Sins in his Name. As Chriſt's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement it expreſs'd by his being at the <hi>right Hand of God,</hi> ſo is their's ſignified by their being in the <hi>right Hand of Chriſt.</hi> People are ſometimes for having them under their Feet. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Treatment which he and his fellow-<hi>Apoſtles</hi> met with, ſaith, <hi>We are made as the Filth of the World, and the Off-ſcouring of all Things unto this Day</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 4.13.</note>. The two Words ſetting forth the contemptuous Uſage of Chriſt's Miniſters, are of the ſame Import, and both emphatical, denoting that which is moſt vile, and trodden under Feet by all Men. But however Men deſpiſe and degrade, with how much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſoever they trample on the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, yet Chriſt honoureth them with his <hi>right Hand.</hi> Tho' their Brethren may caſt <hi>them out as evil,</hi> and the unworthieſt of all Creatures, yet their Lord <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi> them <hi>in his right Hand,</hi> as a Man doth that which is peculiarly dear unto him. <hi>The Lord hath graven Zion on the Palms of his Hands</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. 49. 16.</note> Theſe precious Sons of Zion on the Palm of his right Hand.</p>
            <p n="4">

4<hi rend="sup">thly</hi>. It implies <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s upholding, ſtrengthening, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting, and proſpering them. The right Hand, often attributed to God in Scripture, ſignifies his divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exerted for ſuch Purpoſes.— This <hi>Chriſt</hi> employs for the ſuſtaining, ſtrengthening, defending, and ſucceeding of his faithful Miniſters: They are in that right Hand which upholds all Things, and is able to keep them from falling; — In that right Hand which can do every Thing; make <hi>their Bow abide in Strength, and the Arms of their Hands to be ſtrong:</hi> — In that Hand out of which none can pluck them.— That Hand that wieldeth and moderateth all Things, and will over-rule all to their Safety and Salvation. — In that right Hand which doeth great Things by them, as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in it: getteth the Victory over Chriſt's Enemies, and maketh <hi>his People willing in the Day of his Power.— The Hand of the Lord,</hi> which when it was with the primitive Preachers of the Goſpel, a <hi>great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber believed, and turned unto the Lord.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 11.21.</note> —</p>
            <p>—Thus much is ſuggeſted to our Thoughts, by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s having the Stars in his right Hand.—</p>
            <p>And now, this Part of <hi>John</hi>'s Viſion being made ſo plain, that he <hi>may run, that reads it,</hi> it may be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if we <hi>apply</hi> it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To our Inſtruction in the Work of the Miniſtry; the whole Duty of thoſe who are employ'd in it.</p>
            <p>As Stars, they are to ſhine in their Doctrine, to the enlightning of the Minds, and directing the Ways of Men. In order to which, they need themſelves be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiated with the Light of ſpiritual and divine Knowledge; for how ſhall they impart this to others if they have not received it themſelves? An ignorant Teacher is as great a <hi>Soleciſm,</hi> and as uſeleſs a Thing in the Church, as a dark
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006848_0015_102A80D14EF7C598"/>Star wou'd be in the Sky. Miniſters ought to have a good Degree of Knowledge above the common Sort, who are to be taught by them. Mal. 2.7. <hi>The Prieſts Lips ſhould keep Knowledge.</hi> — He ſhould be a kind of Repoſitory or Treaſury of it, and have wherewith to ſupply the Wants of others. — And <hi>they ſhould ſeek the Law at his Mouth:</hi> have recourſe to him for Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their Duty. Our divine Teacher hath excellently expounded that Text, in Mat. 13.52. <hi>Every Scribe that is inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> — i. e. who is prepared to preach the Goſpel — <hi>is like a Man that is an Houſholder, which bringeth forth out of his Treaſure Things new and old.</hi> He muſt have a good Store of Learning, human and divine, ancient and modern, laid in by preparatory Study, who would be as a Houſholder that treaſureth up all Sorts of Proviſions for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his Family, and the Entertainment of his Gueſts: Miniſters Preaching ſhould be illuminating, and give Light to them that are in Darkneſs. 'Tis <hi>vain,</hi> if it be obſcure and unintelligible, as to the Matter and Manner of it. If they be themſelves clouded with Ignorance, and are unable and unapt to teach, they ſhould not have the Place, for they cannot perform the Office of Stars. In vain do they move the Paſſions, and heat the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, without informing their Judgments. Their Doctrine ſhould reſemble the Light in Purity, as well as Perſpicuity; be free from all heterogeneous Mixture,— the Truth they preach be like the God of it, who is <hi>Light, and in whom is no Darkneſs at all.</hi> To this end they are obliged to take heed to their Doctrine, that there be nothing in it but what is agreable to the Nature and Reaſon of Things, and the Oracles of God, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there ſhould happen to be contrary to human Schemes, and commonly received Opinions. They may not teach for Doctrine the <hi>Commandments</hi> of Men, who are called <hi>Maſters;</hi> nor ſpeak as pleaſing thoſe who are apt to be offended at the Light, which diſcovers them
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006848_0016_102A80D3C03033D8"/>to be wrong in their Sentiments and Actions. Iſa. 8.20. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony; if they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> And 'tis pity any Man, at his Entrance into the Miniſtry, ſhould, in his <hi>Ordination-Vows,</hi> get a Snare to his Soul, by ſubſcribing, or any ways engaging to preach according to another <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> Creed or Confeſſion, which is meerly of human Preſcription and Impoſition.</p>
            <p>As Stars, Miniſters ſhou'd with the ſweet Influence of their Authority and Example, incite and attract People to their Duty. The Authority given them is for <hi>Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and not for <hi>Deſtruction:</hi> and the Exerciſe of it ſhould reſemble the <hi>Dominion</hi> of propitious Stars, which is not by way of violent Impreſſion, but of gentle and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Influence. They are not allowed to <hi>lord it over God's Heritage,</hi> but to rule with Equity and Clemency, in meek and gentle Ways, directly influential on the Mind and Conſcience (Ways of rational Conviction, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, Exhortation, Admonition, Reproof,) uſing only the <hi>Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</hi> in <hi>revenging all Diſobedience,</hi> and cutting off a Member from the <hi>Body of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Light of their <hi>good Works</hi> muſt ſhine before Men, to render that of their Doctrine incentive, as well as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective, of all chriſtian good Practice; and to ſupport their Authority, and procure them the <hi>double Honour,</hi> of which the <hi>Elders</hi> that rule well are to be counted worthy. That they may light others to Heaven, they need go before them in the Way to it. If the Guides go aſtray, they cauſe the People to err. If their Lives be ſpotted with any ſcandalous Sin, or Immorality, <hi>the Light that is in them is Darkneſs, and how great is that Darkneſs?</hi> "A Prieſt (ſaith one) that is not cloathed with Righteouſneſs, tho' otherwiſe richly adorned with all the Ornaments of human and divine Literature, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006848_0017_102A80D6427F7EF0"/>this gilded over with the Rays of Seraphic Prudence and Sagacity, is yet but a naked and deſpicable Creature, of no Authority, no Intereſt, no Uſe, or Service in the Church of God."</p>
            <p>As Stars, Miniſters are to proceed in their Work or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, ſteadily, conſtantly, till they have finiſhed their Courſe; never with-holding their Light and Influence from any, as the Stars do not their's, even from the Dogs that bark at them, and Men that curſe them— Never going out of their Line, and croſſing others Spheres, obſtructing others Uſefulneſs, and diſturbing the Harmony of the Church's Peace. <hi>Wandering Stars</hi> have been look'd upon as ominous Appearances, and to portend ill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. People ſhould hence learn, how to value and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Bleſſing of a Goſpel-Miniſtry — to eſteem it ſuch a Bleſſing to them, as the Stars are to the World; and make uſe of it for their ſpiritual Illumination, and ſure Direction, in their Paſſage to Heaven. What a Relief doth it afford us againſt the Darkneſs which hath covered the Earth, and the groſs Darkneſs upon moſt People! If the Light of natural Reaſon be in itſelf ſufficient to guide Men in the Way of their Duty to a State of future Happineſs, yet it is ſo univerſally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured by the Prevalence of moral Corruption, that thoſe Places may well be called <hi>Regions of Darkneſs,</hi> where the Light of the glorious Goſpel doth not ſhine. What a ſad Condition were the Mariners and Paſſengers with <hi>Paul</hi> in, when <hi>neither Sun nor Stars in many Days appeared, and no ſmall Tempeſt lay on them, all hope that they ſhould be ſaved was taken away</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 27.20.</note>. In a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if not as deſperate a Caſe are they, who are without the Light of the Goſpel, which the ſpiritual
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006848_0018_102A80D882D49C00"/>Stars give in the troubled Sea of this World, where the Storms of Paſſion and Winds of Temptation threaten the eternal Shipwreck of Souls. Let them be pitied, and prayed for by us, that the Light may ſhine unto them, that <hi>GOD's Way and ſaving Health be known among all Nations.</hi> And how thankful ſhould they be who are viſited with the Day-ſpring from on high, according to the tender Mercy and diſtinguiſhing Grace of God? <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.15, 16. "The Land of <hi>Zebulon,</hi> and the Land of <hi>Nepthalim,</hi> by the Way of the Sea, beyond <hi>Jordan, Galilee</hi> of the Gentiles: The People which ſat in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaw great Light: And to them which ſat in the Region and Shadow of Death, Light is ſprung up." "We have more Reaſon to bleſs God for the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Knowledge of the Way of Salvation thereby, than for the Luminaries of Heaven: If theſe were this Hour put out, and the Heavens paſſed away as a Scroll, this would not be an equal Loſs to any Child of God, as for him to have miſſed of the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel: That were only preſent Death to the Body, this eternal Death to the Soul." God's Covenant with Believers, is more than all the Ordinances of Heaven: Theſe are but a Shadow of the Stability of that.— But then, People muſt take heed that they deprive not themſelves of the Benefit of the Stars, which ſhed forth ſo comfortable Light and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And this they do, when they are blinded with Prejudice, and beſotted with ſtupid Ignorance, and that is verefied in them which we read in the Goſpel, <hi>The Light ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehended it not. — This is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World, and Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil, hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> Prepoſſeſſions, Pride, Worldlineſs, and the like, bar the Entrance of Light into Men's Underſtandings, and obſtruct the Influence of it

The moſt glittering Star is but a faint Reſemblance of him. The Stars of the greateſt Magnitude, how little are they in Compariſon of him? and how dim is their Light, if it be not loſt, in his? His right Hand ſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Heavens, and hath in it all the Stars thereof. He made, and he ruleth them: 'Tis with the Rays of his Light they ſhine, and by his Power that they are of ſuch benign Influence. All the Benefit received from <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Miniſters, is by vertue of his Grace in them, and with them. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. <hi>They are the Meſſengers of the Churches, and the Glory of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let Miniſters here ſee, and be very ſenſible of, their Dependence on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Are they called Stars; yea, Angels? Doth not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> judge theſe Names too great and honourable for Duſt and Aſhes, —for Men that dwell in Houſes of Clay, whoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is in the Duſt: Yet let them not be exalted above Meaſure. How heavenly and angelical ſoever they may be in their ſparkling Light, kindly Influences, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Miniſtrations; yet it is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s right Hand that hath raiſed, and doth uphold them. Did it not ſo, how ſoon would they fall from Heaven, as <hi>Lucifer,</hi> Son of the Morning? And how great and dreadful their Fall from the myſtical Heaven into a real Hell; and the loweſt and darkeſt Pit of it! Did not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s unerring Hand guide them, they would prove <hi>Wandering Stars</hi> to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006848_0021_102A80E0A16AFA38"/>whom is reſerved the Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever. It is only <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s right Hand that is able to keep the beſt of them from falling into thoſe Errors and Sins, which would very much darken them, and deſtroy their Uſefulneſs in the World. Rev. 12. 3, 4. <hi>There appeared another Wonder in Heaven, and behold a great red Dragon, having ſeven Heads, and ten Horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his Heads. And his Tail drew a third Part of the Stars of Heaven, and did caſt them to the Earth.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi>'s Enmity againſt the Church makes him eſpecially and moſt induſtriouſly to ſeek the Down-fall of it's Paſtors, to caſt them from the <hi>Orbs</hi> in which they are ſet, and do ſhine, and cover them with Obſcurity in the Earth; to cauſe them to fall from their high Station, and heavenly Profeſſion, into the Dirt of Earthly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and an abject carnal Courſe of Life, which may render them vile and uſeleſs. And many are the baſe Arts and Inſtruments he uſeth to this Purpoſe: And he always would be ſucceſsful therein, did not the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> hold the Stars in his right Hand. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 7<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. Hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Stars (who are the Angels of the Churches) in his right Hand? then ought People to hold them in Reputation. They are not to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, as the literal Stars have been by ignorant and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous People; nor their Perſons to be had in Admiration; yet are they to be highly eſteemed in Love, for their Works ſake; ſince the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> puts ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon, manifeſts ſuch Reſpect, and affords ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them, as to hold them in his right Hand. They are the Church's Crown. Rev. 12. 1. <hi>There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a great Wonder in Heaven, a Woman clothed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</hi> The twelve <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006848_0022_102A80E3E8F09358"/>with their Succeſſors, are as ſo many Jewels in the Crown of the Chriſtian Church, here repreſented in the midſt of a Glory far ſurpaſſing the Dreſs of any of the Heathen Virtues, or Deities,—a Glory made by the Beams of the Sun, and upon the Moon, as above the low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſublunary World, ſhining round <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> (as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> expounds it) by the Faith of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Sun of Righteouſneſs, treading under-foot the Rudiments of the World, whether <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Shadows, or <hi>Gentile</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and glorious with the Enſigns of the apoſtolical Offspring. The Contempt of the Clergy then is a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Church's Crown, and ſpoiling a principal Ornament on her Head. And 'tis pity but that her Children did more honour her. If Miniſters are of a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and groveling Spirit, ignorant and vicious, they are very deſpicable Creatures indeed, but if they behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of their eminent Place, and act up to their illuſtrious Character, it is a diſcredit and hurt to Religion, to depreſs them into low Life, and cover them with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. Let no Man deſpiſe thoſe whom the King of Kings delighteth to honour.—Such a Caution will be ill taken by none, but thoſe who need it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Stars in his right Hand? Then from him the Benefit of their Light and Influence muſt be ſought; and to him the Praiſe of it return'd. He is the true Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World. The Stars in his Hand ſhine with a vicarious Light; with borrowed Rays from him, which he can withold from them, as he pleaſes; and how clearly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they reflect the ſame upon others, yet none will be ſavingly illuminated thereby, unleſs he open their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and ſhine in their Hearts, giving them the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt. The ableſt Miniſters of the <hi>New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are only Inſtruments in his Hand of doing this for his People. And if they look not to his right Hand for
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006848_0023_102A80E580068BC8"/>the Accompliſhment of this glorious Work in them, juſtly may he <hi>ſeal up the Stars</hi> which are therein, and <hi>bind</hi> their ſweet and ſalutary Influences. When he uſeth them for the effectual enlightning and guiding Souls in the Way to Heaven, not unto them, but to him, is the Praiſe due. The Succeſs of the preached Goſpel is not to be aſcribed to Men, how learned, pious and faithful ſoever, but to the <hi>ſaving Strength</hi> of Chriſt's right Hand.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Are the Stars in Chriſt's right Hand? Then let them ſhine to his Glory:—Not to be themſelves gazed at by the ſimple Multitude,—(Act. 3. 12. <hi>Why look ye ſo earneſtly on us?</hi>)—But to direct all to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that they may believe in, worſhip and ſerve him: As the Star which was a Guide to the <hi>wiſe Men of the Eaſt,</hi> to come and pay their due Homage to him newly incarnate. <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 'Tis conjectur'd, that the Prophecy of <hi>Balaam,</hi> one of the Children of the Eaſt, concerning a <hi>Star</hi> that ſhould riſe out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> was kept upon Record among the oriental <hi>Archives,</hi> and gave Occaſion to the <hi>Magi,</hi> upon the Diſcovery of an unuſual Star over the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> to go and make Enquiry after him that was <hi>born King of the Jews.</hi> That Star gave Notice to the neighbouring Nations of the Birth of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and by the Light of it thoſe <hi>Sages</hi> found him. Happy is it when Miniſters are like that Star, which was a Guide to thoſe Travellers, going before them, till it came and pointed them to the very Place where the Saviour CHRIST was. —If the Stars in the Firmament of the Church do glitter and ſparkle, only to draw Obſervance to themſelves; to gain the poor Advantage of Admirers and Followers of themſelves, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not hold them in his right Hand; he will caſt them out of his Care and Protection; yea, will put them under his <hi>Feet of Braſs,</hi> and ſtamp them down to the Bottom of Hell.—But if they ſhine to the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeek not their own, but the Things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and faithfully guide Souls to him and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006848_0024_102A80E82F69EC98"/>Heaven, they ſhall always be in his right Hand,—eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, and honoured, and ſaved of him. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>

            <p>Having now open'd and apply'd the Viſion of the Stars in the right Hand of Him whom <hi>John</hi> ſaw amidſt the Golden Candleſticks: What ſhall I ſay further to aſſiſt and encourage a <hi>beloved Brother,</hi> in the ſolemn Dedication he is this Day making of himſelf to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Sanctuary?</p>
            <p>Theſe Things (<hi>Dear Sir</hi>) had undoubtedly been ſet before you in a ſtronger Light, if your Choice of One to be your <hi>Monitor</hi> on this Occaſion had been guided more by Judgment, than immerited Affection. But, as they are propos'd, and the Viſion brings 'em in View, it fills your whole Soul with Admiration at the Grace of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſee the Dignity of the Office in his Church, the Eminence of the Place, to which he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing You:—That of an Earthen Veſſel, he ſhould make a Lamp of Heaven!—Should take a Piece of Clay, ſuch as Man is formed out of, and convert it into a lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Star!

            <p>The Repreſentation made to your Mind of the Work of the Miniſtry, in it's various Branches, peculiar Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and awful Conſequences, excites your anxious Concern, and makes you enter upon it with Fear and Trembling, leſt you ſhould fail of imparting that Light and Influence, and proceeding ſo regularly and conſtantly in the Sphere of your Duty, as may be, in ſome good Meaſure, anſwerable to the important Character of a coeleſtial Luminary. You can't without Horror think of one Soul's being finally loſt in Error and Sin, thro' your Want of Knowledge or Faithfulneſs, in ſhewing unto Men the Way of Salvation: Nor do you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Caſe, as to yourſelf, will be much leſs ſad and dreadful, if, after your inſtructive Preaching hath lighted others into the Kingdom of Heaven, you ſhould be caſt into outer Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>But it relieves your affrighted Spirit, to behold the Stars in the right Hand of Chriſt; and to hope in his Goodneſs, which he expreſſed to his beloved Servant <hi>John,</hi> ſtruck by his majeſtic Appearance with great Awe, and fallen at his Feet as dead:—<hi>He laid his right Hand upon</hi> him, ſaying, <hi>Fear not; I am the firſt and the laſt: I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the Keys of Hell and of Death.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Context, v. 17, 18.</note> So may he put Strength into you, and encourage you with the Aſſurance of his redeeming you by his Death; and of his living to protect, and guide, and ſave you with his right Hand. We truſt (tho' you muſt ſtrictly examine whether it be ſo) that <hi>the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth</hi> you to be a Miniſter of his Goſpel. There is (as the Times are) no Inducement from this World thereto; and tho' the Reward of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006848_0026_102A80EDCD852A98"/>next, for him that is faithful, be a weighty Motive, yet the great Difficulty and Hazard of attaining it, would preponderate in every thoughtful Mind, that is not touched with the Love of CHRIST. As this inclines you to undertake the ſacred and tremendous Office, ſo let it be the animating Principle of all that you do in the Execution of it. Then may you be ſure of the conſtant Aid of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s right Hand.—Little (<hi>Sir</hi>) can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by you from the <hi>Right Hand of our Fellowſhip,</hi> which we are ready with all our Hearts to give unto you:—Look to, and always depend on, the right Hand of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Strength, which is ſufficient to uphold, to direct, to defend, to aſſiſt and ſucceed you. <hi>Be ſtrong, my Son, in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> "The Lord ſend thee Help from his Sanctuary, and ſtrengthen thee out of <hi>Zion.</hi>—The Lord fulfil all thy Petition.— He will hear thee from his holy Heaven with the ſaving Strength of his right Hand."</p>

"One Star differeth from another Star in Glory": That, with the comfortable and enlivening Rays of which ye were favour'd for the Space of Forty-ſix Years, was of diſtinguiſh'd Luſtre; and it's Influences, how ſweet and extenſive? The neighbouring Churches, yea, the Land, rejoyced with You in the Light thereof. There never was in this Country, if in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> World, a Miniſter ſo frequently ſought to as your late deceaſed Paſtor, when the Churches wanted Light and Peace: And his coming to their Help, in the way of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Counſel,</hi> wherein he, for the moſt part, <hi>moderated,</hi> might ſeem as the welcome Approach of <hi>Mazaroth in his Seaſon,</hi> or the kindly Aſpect of a <hi>benevolent Planet</hi> with his <hi>Satellites.</hi> To be ſure, the calm and pleaſant Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Summer-fruitfulneſs, which this Church has enjoy'd, were by Means of his wiſe, ſteady, and gentle Miniſtrations: Ye are Witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably he behaved himſelf among you: As ye know how he exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a Father doth his Children? — But, alas! that burning and ſhining Light, little dimmed or diminiſhed by Age, was ſuddenly extinguiſh'd from your Eyes. — And O, the mournful Darkneſs which then over-ſpread this Place! — But lo; He that is in the midſt of the Churches, hath another <hi>Star</hi> in his right Hand, which he this Day giveth you: And he can make it to equal, yea, exceed the former in Brightneſs, and benign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences. Receive with all Thankfulneſs ſuch a Gift from the Father of Lights, coming to you thro' the Hand of a bleſſed Mediator; and be exhorted to make an advantageous Uſe of it. — I can, from intimate Acquaintance, bear this young Man witneſs, (and I do it before this great <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> to provoke unto Emulation the <hi>Candidates</hi> for the Evangelical Miniſtry) that he hath taken laudable Pains to be thoroughly furniſhed unto the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006848_0028_102A80F92EA8D6E8"/>good, but arduous, Work he deſigned for; and by the Bleſſing of God on his preparatory Studies, hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired thoſe deſireable Qualifications, which have juſtly recommended him to your well-advis'd Choice of him for a Paſtor, to feed you with Knowledge and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And I may, with little <hi>Variation,</hi> ſay to you of him, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the <hi>Phillppians</hi> concerning his Son <hi>Timothy,</hi> I know <hi>no Man like-minded, who will naturally care for your State.</hi> — "See that he be with you without Fear, for he worketh the Work of God." Let not his Light be obſcured by Poverty, or Reproach, that he ſhall ſuffer from you; nor his Influence obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Hardneſs of your Hearts; nor his Progreſs in the Courſe of his Miniſtry hindred by unreaſonable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. Let not your Minds be ſo blinded by the God of this World, or with the Miſt of Prejudices, or the Duſt of perverſe Diſputings, as that the Darkneſs of 'em ſhould be impenetrable by the Rays of Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Light. Open your Eyes to the Light, and yield to the Evidence of Truth, and receive the Impreſſion of it; and walk in the Light. The brighteſt Star is not ordained in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of the Church meerly for People to gaze upon, to obſerve it's Motions, and admire it's Glitterings; much leſs to boaſt of it's out-ſhining others, but to travel by, as the <hi>wiſe Men</hi> did by that which they ſaw, in the Way to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Heaven. In vain will your Minds be irradiated with the cleareſt Knowledge, by that which ſhall ſhine here, unleſs your Feet be guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Way of Peace, of Righteouſneſs, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Let the Sight of him, going before you as a Guide to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Glory, always affect you, as did that of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Star the wiſe Men, who followed it from <hi>Arabia</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> Mat. 2. 9, 10. <hi>Lo, the Star which they ſaw in the Eaſt, went before them, till it came and ſtood over where the young Child was.—When they ſaw the Star, they rejoyced with exceeding great Joy.</hi> — So may He be your Light and Joy, and ye his Crown of Rejoycing.—O the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Congratulations with which he and you ſhall meet another Day, at the right Hand of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who will give to both Places <hi>among them that ſtand by,</hi> as Witneſſes of this joyous Solemnity,—the <hi>Angels of Light,</hi> — thoſe <hi>Morning-Stars,</hi> which did, when the Foundations of the Earth were laid, and ſhall much more at the Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Things, ſing together; and ſhout for Joy.</p>
