            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOOD civil government is one of the greateſt temporal bleſſings which any people are favored with. Without this we cannot be ſafe and ſecure in the poſſeſſion of any worldly good. Our vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and happineſs, our lives and property would be expoſed to innumerable continued dangers from the unreſtrained luſts and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mankind. One would lie at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of another: and he who found himſelf poſſeſſed of the greateſt ſtrength and power, would ſacrifice all that is dear to others, to his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013769_0004_0F91ACA74D853E20"/>
own will and pleaſure. Where there is no law or government, every one will "do that which is right in his own eyes," as <hi>they</hi> did when there was no king in Iſrael. Government is as an "hedge about our perſons, and about all that we have on every ſide," againſt the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages and depredations of lawleſs men, men who have nothing to govern them, but their own wills, paſſions and appetites. Says St. Paul, <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. 1.8, 9, 10.</note> "We know that the law is good, if a man uſe it lawfully; knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for man-ſlayers, for whoremongers, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, for men-ſtealers, for liars, for perjured perſons, and if there be any other thing that is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſound doctrine."</p>
            <p>THE ſin and fall of man gave occaſion for civil government in ſocieties, as a neceſſary curb and reſtraint to the corrupt luſts and vile affections of human kind. Had man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſinned he would not have been under the influence of unruly diſorderly luſts and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he would not have been ſo diſpoſed to tranſgreſs the eternal and unalterable rules of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013769_0005_0F91ACA8452E2FE8"/>
equity and truth; but would have "lived ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly, and godly in the world."</p>
            <p>IT was evidently in compaſſion to a fallen degenerate world that God inſtituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained civil government, and that he was himſelf, in a ſpecial and peculiar ſenſe, the ſupreme magiſtrate in Iſrael, appointing ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate officers and judges, more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to manage the affairs of their ſtate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his direction and guidance.</p>
            <p>THE divine Being has, all along, abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted his approbation of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was <hi>indeed</hi> angry with his people of old, for rejecting him, who was King of kings, and Lord of lords, from being their king, and aſking <hi>him</hi> to give them a king like unto the heathen nations round about. This was a ſin in them: and the very thing they deſired, became a ſnare and a ſcourge unto them. It had been well for them, and all ſucceeding nations, had their original form of government been ſtrictly adhered to, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted, and well improved. They ſought a change, and God granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Since when, <hi>he</hi> has been pleaſed, in his holy word, very particularly, to point out the qualifications of "princes" and rulers, and the duty of the people, to ſubmit to their
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013769_0006_0F91ACA8688A3068"/>
authority and laws, withal intimating that <hi>good</hi> rulers are a bleſſing, great benefactors to mankind. "He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God; and he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain," <note n="¶" place="bottom">2 Sam. 23.3.4.</note> ſays God.</p>
            <p>NO particular form of government has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring wiſdom pointed out, preſcribed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected unto. But mankind, in their various diſperſions through the earth, and different nations, are left wholly to their liberty to agree upon their own plan and conſtitution, their particular model of government, and to depute whom, and as few, or as many, as they ſhall think fit, to rule and govern them, being to obey and ſubmit to them, whom <hi>they</hi> have thus clothed with authority, "not only for wrath, but for conſcience ſake." The ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a divine hereditary right in ſome, to govern the reſt, is glaringly abſurd and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. God's ſetting aſide Saul and his family, and bringing David, the ſon of Jeſſe, to be the king of Iſrael, together with the parable of Jotham, recorded in the book of God, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Judg. 9.7—15.</note> being well weighed and attentively conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013769_0007_0F91ACA950F4ED58"/>
prove that ſuch right cannot be founded on the Bible. And where can we go to find and prove this doctrine of the divine heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry right of particular perſons and families to rule and govern others, if not to the revelation from heaven. A people may, if they pleaſe, make the kingdom hereditary, in a particular family, under certain limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſtrictions; (as is the caſe in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land); and whoever claims a right to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh throne, contrary to ſuch eſtabliſhed rules, is a daring uſurper, and impudent pretender; and this has been the character of ſome of the inglorious and tyrannical Stewart family, ever ſince the reign of James the ſecond. The people of England after various ſtruggles and conteſts, and having tried many very different forms of government, at length happily unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe three leading kinds, monarchy, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracy and democracy, which compoſed that excellent civil conſtitution, which has been the glory of Britons, and the envy of foreigners. Says one, "All power has its foundation in compact and mutual conſent, or elſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from fraud or violence. Where the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter takes place, the dominion which men claim is no better than uſurpation; and they who by theſe methods raiſe themſelves above their brethren, are ſo far from having a right to govern, that they ought to be puniſhed as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013769_0008_0F91ACAB433B2DD0"/>
public diſturbers and the enemies of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—When government is founded in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſent, it is the undoubted right of the community to ſay who ſhall govern them; and to make what limitations or conditions they think proper.—But whatever form of civil government men have choſe, there are certain conſtitutions which are the baſis and foundation of the ſtate, and which are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory on thoſe who govern, as well as on thoſe who are governed. Theſe conſtitutions are a ſort of fundamental laws, which cannot be violated without the greateſt danger to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. When either part attempts to invade the right of the other, it uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces convulſions, which ſooner or later over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the ſtate." The king of England, at his coronation, is ſworn to defend the rights of the people, and to govern according to the eſtabliſhed conſtitution, the fundamental laws and ſtatutes of the realm. The Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in its primitive purity, is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form of civil government, becauſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives and ſecures the greateſt <hi>good</hi> to the whole nation, which is the end of all civil government. Finite beings can conceive of no other end, the divine Being could have in view, in the ordination and appointment of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſetting ſome over their <hi>brethren,</hi> but the <hi>good</hi> of the people. Reaſon ſuggeſts
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013769_0009_0F91ACABC49B9C78"/>
no other, nor does revelation ſpeak of any but <hi>this.</hi> The ſcripture aſſures us that magiſtrates are appointed of God to be his miniſters for <hi>good</hi> to the public. He did not appoint ſuch an order of men, for the purpoſes of enſlaving the reſt, and involving the world in miſery and wretchedneſs, nor ſurely to enrich and aggrandize themſelves and families, at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expence, and great damage of the public, as if God had a partiality for <hi>them.</hi> He did indeed intend, that princes and rulers, continually attending on this very thing, <hi>the public good,</hi> and ſeeking the welfare of the ſtate, and the happineſs of the people, ſhould be honorably maintained, and diſtinguiſhingly ſupported, as but the juſt recompence of their faithful and important ſervices for them. It is an apoſtolic injunction upon the people to ſupport their rulers. "For, for this cauſe pay you tribute alſo; for they are God's miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing. Render therefore to all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cuſtom, to whom cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, fear, to whom fear, honor, to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor." Where government ſubſiſts, it muſt of neceſſity be ſupported and maintained. This will create burdens for the people, but bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens which they will chearfully bear, and go through, while they feel the <hi>benefit</hi> of their rulers mild, reaſonable, righteous,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013769_0010_0F91ACAC78D6A8C0"/>
juſt and impartial adminiſtration. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are bound in juſtice and equity to ſupport them, who employ their time and talents in the public ſervice. While ſerving the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>they</hi> ought to be maintained in eaſe and honor, according to their rank and ſtation, and the degrees of ſervice, by them, done to the community. They ſhould have their minds freed from all anxiety and diſtreſſing concern, as to their own and their families ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the world. That rulers ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their own eſtates and fortunes in the ſervice of the people, is not juſt or reaſonable. Men who ſerve others ought to be rewarded in proportion to the time they ſpend, and the <hi>benefit</hi> thence reſulting to <hi>them</hi> for whom they labor. "The laborer is worthy of his hire." And I ſee not why rulers, and others, who are wholly devoted to public buſineſs, and ſpend all their time, (if need be) and talents therein, ought not to be more than barely ſupported, and maintained in character; why they ought not to be enabled, in that way, to lay up for their families and children, in ſome proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it might be ſuppoſed they probably would, by prudence, honeſty and diligence in any other lawful calling. Parſimony in a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple towards "princes," and rulers, or the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, is a great ſin, and has a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to defeat the deſigns of heaven, in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013769_0011_0F91ACAD2D73FC80"/>
their appointment to office. But with regard to the ſupport due to civil government from the governed, there is a meaſure, beyond which, taxes impoſed on them, are but extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oppreſſion. "There is nothing that affects men more, than when you touch their intereſt; people in general find it hard to procure the conveniencies of life; nothing will ſooner alienate their minds from govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than when rulers needleſly deprive them of that which they have dearly earned, and wantonly diſſipate the public treaſures. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ought ever to proceed in this part of their duty with caution and prudence, that people may ſee the taxes they impoſe are not to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their pride, their avarice, or any other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; not to carry on any private deſign, "but that they are neceſſary for the ſupport of government and the exigencies of the ſtate." Rulers ſhould be men hating covetouſneſs, as well as fearing God, otherwiſe they will ſacrifice the rights and property of their ſubjects, and ſometimes their lives, to gratify their pride, ambition and avarice. Naboth loſt his life, through the covetouſneſs of Ahab, who ſought his vineyard. When magiſtrates neither fear God, nor regard man, inſtead of aiming at the public <hi>good</hi> (which is their main buſineſs) they will ſtudy to advance their own private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and that of their houſhold, and do any
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013769_0012_0F91ACADD1012E10"/>
thing to keep in office. Siniſter views govern and predominate; ſuch men are not to be truſted. Power in their hands is dangerous; for they will ſacrifice conſcience and ſell their country to gratify and pleaſure themſelves; or they will do this to pleaſe thoſe above them, on whom they depend. Such men are eaſily bought. How far this has been verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late, in this land, I leave all to determine for themſelves. Rulers ſeem to be miſtaken, when they act with a view only to ſupport and preſerve their own greatneſs and grandeur. "That the civil ruler and chriſtian miniſter ſhould engroſs the wealth of the world to themſelves, as they have done in many ages and countries, and live in pride and luxury, on ſpoils violently extorted or ſlily drained from the people, is altogether foreign to the deſign of God in ſetting them up." That they ought to be ſupported in eaſe and honor, we may collect from the ſacred oracles.</p>
            <p>AS good rulers, God's miniſters for good to the people, are entitled to ſufficient and honorable maintenance, ſo are they, to every mark of honor, eſteem and reſpect from their ſubjects. "Honor the king," ſays St. Peter. And as there are no lawful powers, but who are ordained of God; ſo St. Paul directs us to render to <hi>ſuch</hi> their dues; "fear to whom
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013769_0013_0F91ACAE76B7DBB8"/>
fear, honor to whom honor," is due. Rulers and princes are entitled to the moſt reſpectful treatment from the people over whom they are placed. We may not "ſpeak evil of dignities," nor "of the rulers of the people." To treat "princes" and rulers with contempt, indignity, and diſreſpect, is ſlighting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning an ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>BUT not only are <hi>good</hi> "princes," and rulers to be ſupported and honored in their ſtations, but ſubmitted to and obeyed. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will direct, and intereſt lead, all chearfully to ſubmit to the laws and government of <hi>ſuch</hi> magiſtrates; and religion moſt ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces the ſame duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. Paul, ſays, "Let every ſoul be ſubject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: The powers that be, are ordained of God, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God: And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake." And St. Peter exhorts. "Submit yourſelves to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for the Lord's ſake: Whether it be to the king as ſupreme; or unto go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, as unto them, that are ſent by him." The civil ruler is the miniſter of God for <hi>good</hi> to the people. While rulers purſue the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013769_0014_0F91ACB072F6AD38"/>
end of their appointment to office, ſeeking the public good, they are to be obeyed and ſubmitted unto. Rulers are men of like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with ourſelves; as liable to an undue bias and influence, and ſo to errors and miſtakes in their conduct, as their ſubjects. It becomes ſubjects to point out the miſtakes which rulers run into, at any time, in their adminiſtration; and when theſe are made to appear, <hi>they</hi> will, if they have the good of ſociety at heart, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately rectify them. We may not refuſe ſubmiſſion to higher powers, becauſe of leſſer errors in government. Allowance ought to be made for rulers as well as others. It is the property of the divine Being only to be inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing wrong. Every wrong ſtep in rulers, may not proceed from a ſettled diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to abuſe their power and injure their ſubjects. But when they make uſe of their power and authority in a manner ſubverſive of the end of their deſignation to office; when they encroach on the natural and conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rights of the people; when they trample on thoſe laws, which were made, at once to limit their power, and defend their ſubjects; in ſuch caſes the people are bound not to obey them, but reſiſt them as public robbers and the deſtroyers of mankind and of human hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Says the great Mr. Lock in his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013769_0015_0F91ACB0ACB22B50"/>
upon government. "Whereſoever law ends, tyranny begins, if the law be tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another's harm. And whoever in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, exceeds the power given him by law, and makes uſe of the force he hath under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to compaſs that upon the ſubject which the law allows not, ceaſes in that to be a magiſtrate; and acting without authority, may be oppoſed as any other man, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the right of another." And in theſe caſes the people muſt be judge of the good or ill conduct of their rulers; to the people they are accountable. It is the higheſt pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to affirm otherwiſe. "The argument whereby the Apoſte Paul enforces his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of ſubmiſſion to rulers, and diſſwades from reſiſtance, is, that theſe civil powers are ordained of God, and ordained by him, miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially to convey bleſſings from him to the people. So long therefore, and ſo far as <hi>theſe</hi> civil powers act agreably to the deſign of their ordination, and do <hi>good</hi> in their ſtations, the people are obliged to ſubjection, and reſiſtance will be blameable; but if theſe powers forſake their proper ſphere, thwart God's deſign in ordaining them, diſſerve the people, and take meaſures which tend to ruin them, the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's ground of the people's ſubjection ceaſes; and, indeed, ſubmiſſion becomes a fault, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013769_0016_0F91ACB1CB842E60"/>
reſiſtance a virtue. If the people ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey well conducting rulers out of regard to the public good, it muſt be as much their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtill governed by a regard to the public good, to oppoſe them, when purſuing deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive methods. To ſuppoſe it belongs to the Apoſtle's meaning, that it is a damnable ſin to reſiſt civil powers, <hi>becauſe ordained of God,</hi> though they act entirely out of character, and thwart every kind purpoſe God had in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them, is in the claſs of moſt palpable grating abſurdities. A pretence to ground ſuch ideas, as thoſe of indefeaſible right, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, and non-reſiſtance, on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is criminal—an high abuſive ſcandal to the Chriſtian religion, and its divinely inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Promulgator. If God had given up man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to the will of oppreſſors, not permitting the people, on pain of damnation, to attempt their own relief, it would not, indeed, have exceeded the demerit of a ſinful world; but would have been diſagreable to the general a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy of kind Providence." As rulers, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>omnipotent</hi> they may pretend to be, are not raiſed above a poſſibility of erring and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the exerciſe of their power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo it is not abſurd to ſuppoſe they may, in ſome caſes enjoin and require things of their ſubjects contrary to the laws of nature, which are the laws of God, and contrary alſo to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013769_0017_0F91ACB26FDEE9D0"/>
the Chriſtian religion; in which caſe our duty is plain, "We muſt obey God rather than men." And, "ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage." If any come in privily to ſpy out our liberty, which we derive from the Author of nature and the Author of our moſt holy faith, we may not give place to them, by ſubjection, no not for an <hi>hour</hi>; that the rights of nature and of conſcience, and the truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, may continue with us. But not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in this way.</p>
            <p>HIS preſent majeſty, king George the third, has in my opinion, an undoubted right to the Britiſh throne; but his right thereto is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if not wholly, yet principally, on the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's right to reſiſt, and ſet aſide evil and wicked rulers, rulers who trample on the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal laws of the ſtate, and invade their ſubjects rights and liberties. Had not the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and removed that unhappy and miſguid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed king, Charles the firſt, the nation would probably, have been ruined. King James the ſecond, brother of Charles the ſecond, and ſon of Charles the firſt, ſo enraged the people, by his infatuated meaſures, as that he was forced to abdicate the throne, and flee his kingdom. Then William Henry and Mary,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013769_0018_0F91ACB460B784D0"/>
prince and princeſs of Orange, were proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed king and queen of England. This <hi>event,</hi> called the revolution, took place in 1688. William and Mary dying without iſſue, the princeſs Anna of Denmark, ſecond daughter of king James the ſecond, was proclaimed queen. She died leaving no children, whereupon George Lewiſs, elector of Hanover, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown of Great-Britian. He was grandſon of the princeſs Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of James the firſt, king of England. He was ſucceeded, in the throne of theſe king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, by his ſon George the ſecond, of illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious memory, who was grandfather to George the third, the preſent rightful ſovereign on the Britiſh throne. Hiſtory ſhows us that the greater part of the kings of England, have come to the throne, not ſo much by right of inheritance, as by the <hi>election</hi> of the people, and the reſiſtance they have made to them who were heirs apparent to the crown, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually on the throne. <note n="¶" place="bottom">

            <p>WHAT has been ſaid above reſpecting go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and the great bleſſing it is to ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may ſerve to introduce what ſhall follow, agreable to the purport of the text.</p>
            <p>POWER is too intoxicating, and liable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe. As great a bleſſing as government is,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013769_0020_0F91ACB5513A00F0"/>
like all other bleſſings, it may become a ſcourge, a curſe, and ſevere puniſhment to a people. "For the tranſgreſſion of a land, many are the princes thereof," ſays Solomon. Intimating that to have many princes in a kingdom is a juſt judgement of God upon a ſinful nation. Theſe words may be variouſly interpreted. "For the tranſgreſſion of a land, and a general defection from God, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to idolatry, prophaneneſs and immorality, many are the princes thereof; many at the ſame time pretending to the ſovereignty, and contending for it, by which the people are crumbled into parties and factions, biting and devouring one another. Or many princes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively in a little time, one cutting off another, or ſoon cut off by the hand of God, or of a foreign enemy." But this word "prince," need not be underſtood in ſo limited a ſenſe, as intending the king, or firſt magiſtrate. It may moſt properly be underſtood here, as meaning the nobles, counſellors, and officers in a kingdom and land; any ruler and officer among people; any who are ſet over them to rule, order and govern them. And our text ſpeaks of it, as a puniſhment upon a people and land to have a <hi>multitude</hi> of princes, or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and officers. For the entertaining juſt conceptions of this point, let it be obſerved:
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013769_0021_0F91ACB5F06338E8"/>
That as government was ordained of God for the "<hi>good</hi>" of the people, and not for their deſtruction; ſo to effect this moſt valuable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended end, it is neceſſary, that in every ſtate there be as many "princes," and rulers, of one ſort and of another, higher and lower as ſhall be ſufficient to all the purpoſes of good government; both for the making and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting laws, conducive to the general felicity, and that the benefits and advantages thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, may be ſeen and felt, in the remoteſt parts of the empire. In proportion to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of a kingdom, muſt be its number of "princes," its legiſlative and executive offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. It is not poſſible for one, or a few, to carry on the great end of government, in a large and widely extended empire. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and officers muſt be ſent forth into all parts to make and execute good and wholeſome laws <hi>for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the encouragement and ſecurity of them who do well.</hi> This will create proportionable burdens for the people: Becauſe all ſerving the public, ought by them to be well ſupported. But mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of lucrative offices in a kingdom or ſtate, beyond what is really neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, the <hi>only</hi> and great end of government, the general good of the community, as it muſt produce great and warm ſtruggles for higher and more profitable poſts among <hi>them,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013769_0022_0F91ACB6D3C81E10"/>
unavoidably increaſe the burdens of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo it may truly be reckoned a ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and heavy judgment upon a land. Innumerable, almoſt, are the evil conſequences which take place in the ſtate, from a needleſs addition of "princes," rulers and officers in it, which prove the thing to be a ſore ſcourge and curſe to the land. Bribery and corruption will prevail, and an increaſe of <hi>taxes</hi> and <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> on the neceſſaries of life, on lands, food and cloathing, whereby the people are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſtraits and poverty, while theſe <hi>Supernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries</hi> live in idleneſs, affluence and luxury, on the labors of the honeſt and induſtrious. How noxious to ſociety is this! Whether Great-Britian and theſe colonies, being a part of the empire, are in that ſituation of having <hi>many</hi> more "princes," rulers and officers therein, than are abſolutely neceſſary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the affairs of government, <hi>ſome</hi> will doubtleſs venture to deny. But, ſo great is the number of "princes," that is, placemen and penſioners in our nation and land, as that the ſtipends they receive muſt, and will keep the nation in debt. An immenſe ſum is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually paid in penſions, to perſons who are <hi>out</hi> of public buſineſs, and <hi>ſome</hi> to perſons in office, over and above their fixed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This, together with the <hi>neceſſary</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013769_0023_0F91ACB7675BDDE0"/>
and charges of the ſtate, have created ſuch a debt in England, as that after all the means and methods uſed to increaſe the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal <hi>revenue,</hi> it can do little more than pay the intereſt of the debt, and the <hi>annual</hi> exigencies of government. <note n="‡" place="bottom">The intereſt of our <hi>national</hi> debt amounts to near upon five millions a year. Ten millions of pounds ſterling is our preſent annual <hi>national</hi> income, and likewiſe our preſent annual <hi>national</hi> expence; includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what may at times be paid towards the diſcharge of the debt and the coſt of collecting.</note> That perſons in high office, and miniſters of God for <hi>good to the public,</hi> ſhould be rewarded for their ſervices, is but juſt; and that they be maintained in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and dignity, proportioned to their rank, and the importance and uſefulneſs of their offices to the people, is very reaſonable. But why one who was well rewarded while in office and buſineſs, muſt retire therefrom, with a penſion of ſeveral thouſands of pounds, only to make room for another perſon, we, in this remote corner of the world, ſee not. All this burden comes upon the laboring poor, and by this means they are ſo ſtraitned, as ſcarce to be able to procure for themſelves and families, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of life. The generality of the common people in England and Ireland, fare much poorer, than the meaneſt ſervant, and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013769_0024_0F91ACB95AED2870"/>
ſlave in this land. That men who have performed ſome ſignal exploit, and done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereby ſpecial benefit accrues to the ſtate ſhould be diſtinguiſhingly rewarded, is but reaſonable and juſt. All the wit and craft of men has been exerciſed, and their invention wracked to find out offices, poſts and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments for them who have been ſeeking places, that there might be, at leaſt, a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pretence for their receiving large ſalaries from the people. It is almoſt impoſſible, to reckon up the different "princes," rulers and officers, in the nation, or to compute their ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; the ſum thereof is, almoſt, beyond ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. New and unheard of officers and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have been made of late years, that ſo all may be provided with places and incomes.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, a large ſtanding army, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps of near an hundred thouſand men in all parts of the Britiſh dominions, is kept up, at an amazing expence to the ſtate. Some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der half pay, others under full pay; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er officers have very great wages, while the ſoldiers have ſcanty allowance. This <hi>army</hi> is kept up to aid the civil power, it is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but were the requirements of civil rulers juſt and reaſonable, there would be no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of having recourſe to the powers of the military, to enforce obedience. When mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013769_0025_0F91ACB9AA1B53D0"/>
are to be carried, and can be carried, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by force of the ſoldiery, and the terror of arms, it is proof abundant that <hi>they</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unconſtitutional. For however there may be perſons of a factious, licentious turn, yet the body of a people are diſpoſed to obedience and ſubmiſſion from a principle of ſelf-intereſt, if nothing elſe. They are diſpoſed to "lead quiet and peaceable lives." When there ariſes <hi>general</hi> uneaſineſs and complaint among a people, it is a certain ſign things do not go well in the ſtate, and that the meaſures purſuing are not juſt, right and equal. A ſtanding army kept up, as they always are, in idleneſs, in time of peace, are the bane of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, virtue and ſocial felicity, and the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the moſt exuberant growth of all kinds of wickedneſs and debauchery. This is a plan to fright people into a compliance with favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite meaſures, which the abettors are ſenſible mankind will not readily conſent unto. And may it not be, becauſe they are not juſt? This is a meaſure unneceſſarily burdenſome. For "a conſtitution which cannot ſupport its own weight muſt fall;—it muſt be ſuppoſed eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially defective in its form or adminiſtration Military aid has ever been deemed dangerous to a free civil ſtate; and often has been uſed as an effectual engine to ſubvert it." A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013769_0026_0F91ACBC31798AE8"/>
ought not to be forced or frighted out of their rights, liberties and property. When ſtanding armies are improved, it may well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the jealouſy of the people, and rouſe their attention to their deareſt worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. When rulers and princes act in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as miniſters of God for <hi>good</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and purſue the things which tend to the welfare and intereſt of the ſtate, inſtead of their own, the people will eaſily perceive it. "Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally capable of knowing when they are well uſed. Public happineſs is eaſily felt. Men cannot but perceive when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their rights, and privileges; when they ſet at quiet under their own vines and fig-trees, and there is none to make them afraid; when the laws of the land have their courſe, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is impartially adminiſtered; when no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable burdens are laid upon them; when their rulers are ready to hear their complaints, and to redreſs their wrongs; when they treat them with condeſcenſion, tenderneſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; when they ſympathize with them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their difficulties, and, like their great Maſter, are afflicted in all their afflictions. Such a temper and conduct in rulers are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived, without any extraordinary pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration." <note n="¶" place="bottom">Dr. Eliot's election ſermon.</note>

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:013769_0027_0F91ACBD4AEBEDD0"/>BUT to proceed, We, in this land, have ſeen and felt and ſtill ſee and feel, the evils of a ſtanding army poſted among us in time of peace; ſent hither to force or fright this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to comply with acts of the Britiſh Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which are generally looked upon as unconſtitutional and grievous; and they will probably be improved to force this people, if poſſible, to relinquiſh their chartered rights and liberties, which we hold by the plighted faith of former princes, and the crown.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, new courts of admiralty have been, within theſe few years, erected, judges appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extenſive juriſdiction and "great power," with large ſalaries annexed to their offices, without being obliged to reſide in their reſpective diſtricts, or perform any part of the ſervice; but do all by their deputies, who alſo have good ſtipends. Perſons are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be carried, a great diſtance, for trial in theſe courts, and <hi>there</hi> the party complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in a ſenſe both judge and jury. Theſe, together with a new Board of Commiſſioners, and other officers, unknown to our fathers, compoſe that band of "princes," by whom this land is puniſhed for its tranſgreſſion. Nothing need be ſaid here more than to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe things, unleſs it be to add, that the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013769_0028_0F91ACBD6F0648C8"/>
Board of Commiſſioners, and other officers are maintained in pride, idleneſs and luxury, at a vaſt and needleſs expence of public treaſure. For, admitting it to be reaſonable that a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue</hi> be raiſed in America, it might be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected without maintaining ſuch a multitude of officers, in the collection, as are employed, and which eats up moſt, if not the whole, of the profit. But enough has been ſaid to ſhow when government, inſtead of being a bleſſing, becomes a ſcourge, and a puniſhment to a people. It is ſo when its rulers or princes are many, and numerous, whereby unneceſſary burdens are brought upon the people.</p>
            <p>I GO on to ſay very briefly, That "by a man of underſtanding and knowledge the ſtate thereof ſhall be prolonged." Religion and knowledge will prevent or redreſs the grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to which a land may be ſubjected, by a mulititude of "princes" and rulers. A privy counſellor, or miniſter of ſtate, or the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal rulers in a kingdom, if they are men of real religion and enlarged knowledge will uſe their influence and power to reſtrain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, "the tranſgreſſion of a land," and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the beſt methods for healing the wounds thereof, that ſo the good eſtate thereof may be prolonged. It is ſcarce poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013769_0029_0F91ACBE2A415E18"/>
what eminent ſervice one wiſe man may do for a nation in a difficult, critical and troubleſome juncture. The wiſe man tells us in this chapter, where we find the text, that, "the prince who wanteth underſtanding is alſo a great oppreſſor: But he that hateth cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs ſhall prolong his days." The love of money, and the want of due conſideration, are the cauſes of the mal-adminiſtration of "prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces" and rulers. A ruler who it covetous will neither do juſtly, nor love mercy, but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under him ſhall be bought and ſold. But rulers who are ture fearers of God, and haters of covetouſneſs, ſhall prolong their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and peace; they ſhall be happy in the affections of their people, and the bleſſings of their God. Rulers who are wiſe and good, will never oppreſs and enſlave their ſubjects, if they would conſult their own intereſt, eaſe and ſafety. Tyrants and oppreſſors who ſacrifice every thing to their covetouſneſs, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an abſolute, arbitrary power, generally ſuffer for their madneſs and folly, when an oppreſſed and enſlaved people are rouzed. Such rulers often fall a ſacrifice to the rage of mankind. When they who rule over men, are perſons of underſtanding and knowledge, not only men diſcerning in the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, knowing what Iſrael ought to do, but
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013769_0030_0F91ACC020B3C7C8"/>
men of real goodneſs and religion, are "juſt, ruling in the fear of God," the ſtate of that people will be proſperous, flouriſhing, and happy: Such rulers will be a God-like bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Says God by the mouth of his ſervant king David, "they ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even as a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rain." The character and extenſive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence of the faithful ruler, are here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, who with a God-like ardor employs his authority and influence to advance the common intereſt; The righteous Lord, whoſe countenance beholdeth the upright, will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and ſucceed rulers of this character: And it is an evidence of his favor to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when ſuch are apponited to rule over them. The natural effect of this, is quietneſs and peace, as ſhowers upon the tender graſs and clear ſhining after rain. In this caſe a loyal people muſt be happy, and fully ſenſible that they are ſo—while they find their perſons in ſafety—their liberties preſerved—their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty defended—and their confidence in their rulers entire. The neceſſary expences of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will be borne with pleaſure; while juſtice holds the balance, and righteouſneſs flows down their ſtreets. Such civil ſtate, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the natural courſe of things, muſt flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh in peace at home, and be reſpectable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad—private virtues will be encouraged, and vice driven into darkneſs—induſtry in the moſt effectual manner promoted—arts and ſciences patronized—the true fear of God cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and his worſhip maintained. Happy muſt the people be that is in ſuch a caſe—ye happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev Mr. Cock's election ſermon.</note> "By a man of underſtanding and knowledge, the ſtate thereof ſhall be prolonged."

            <p>IN the morning I expatiated upon the great bleſſing of <hi>good</hi> civil government, and conſidered the grand end and deſign of the inſtitution—Then obſerved that, as great a bleſſing as civil government was, it might be ſo conducted as to become a curſe, a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and puniſhment to a land: And it is ſo, when the "princes," or rulers "thereof are many," many more than are neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and effect the great end of government, the good of the community, and when by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplied in a land, the burdens of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013769_0034_0F91ACC2AAAC4160"/>
people muſt be greatly, needleſsly and very unprofitably increaſed, and <hi>they</hi> impoveriſhed and enſlaved: While men, or rulers of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge, rulers of religion and piety as well as great diſcernment, by their wiſe, prudent and righteous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will prolong the ſtate, the tranquility, and happineſs of the land.</p>
            <p>BUT as the preſent ſtate of the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire indicates that civil government is made a ſcourge and puniſhment unto the people, ſo our part, my hearers, and the proper buſineſs of this day, is to enquire and conſider what are the moral cauſes of this puniſhment, to humble ourſelves before God, and while his judgments are abroad in the earth, learn righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>THE preſent <hi>multitude</hi> of "princes," or rulers in the land, and their enormous, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic ſtrides after diſpotic government and arbitrary power, our text teaches us to conſider as a juſt judgment of heaven, and a righteous puniſhment upon "the land" (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by God) for the many provoking ſins, and daring "tranſgreſſions" of the people. "Our adverſity is to be conſidered, as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of <hi>providential</hi> agency or permiſſion—as a righteous parental chaſtiſement of heaven,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013769_0035_0F91ACC375447598"/>
for our many provacations; and a loud call for univerſal repentance and reformation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the goſpel or Chriſt." While therefore, the language of this day's ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeems to be this, that with all humility we confeſs our ſins to God, and "come boldly to the throne of grace that we may find mercy to pardon," and with fulleſt confidence are committing our cauſe to the God of infinite wiſdom, putting up fervent prayers to that Being, who is able to ſave; we ſhould, at the ſame time, conſider our indiſpenſable obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the neceſſity of "adding to" our prayers and ſupplications, true and unfeigned repentance, as ever we would hope to obtain audience of Him, "who loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth iniquity." The pſalmiſt tells us, that, "if we regard iniquity in our hearts, the Lord will not hear us." The voice of Providence, at ſuch a time of trouble, and day of darkneſs, ſpeaketh on this wiſe, to every meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts "cry aloud, and <hi>ſpare</hi> not, lift up thy voice like a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and ſhew my people their tranſgreſſion, and their ſins." <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah 58.1.</note> This people ſhould be taught what is amiſs among them, be "ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>evil</hi> works, and their tranſgreſſions which they have exceeded." <note n="†" place="bottom">Job 36.9.</note> And be earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013769_0036_0F91ACC4273E7A70"/>
preſſed and urged to repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, as the only way to obtain deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from our preſent diſtreſs, and to cauſe the divine Being to avert thoſe impending evils and puniſhments, which will, otherwiſe, fall on us, until God "ſhall make an utter end of us."</p>
            <p>OUR anceſtors, who firſt came into this country, and their immediate poſterity, were a pious, a holy and a praying people, and God had a favor for them. But we, who have thus remotely deſcended from them have riſen up in their ſtead, "a ſeed of evil doers, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that are corrupters, we have forſaken the Lord, we have provoked the holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael unto anger, we are gone away backward." "Iniquity greatly abounds, and the love of many waxes cold." Multitudes are "ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and religion, in their minds by wicked works." Have we not forfeited all our bleſſings into the hands of God? And are not rulers made the inſtruments, in his hands of depriving us of ſome of them, and thus puniſhing us? And are not moſt of the <hi>evils</hi> we now ſuffer, the natural and neceſſary, as well as moral, effects of our vices? And is there any reaſon to hope that we ſhall be a happy people, while pride and extravagance, luxury and intemperance are ſo prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013769_0037_0F91ACC5A870DFF0"/>
us? But further, to uſe the words of another, which are <hi>peculiarly</hi> emphatical, and expreſſive. "Though greatly diſtant, we are ſorrowfully infected with the irreligion and vices, which are predominant in England; and which reign there to ſuch a degree as that we can ſcarcely forbear applying ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as that in the Revelation, "come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues: For her ſins have reached unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and God hath remembered her iniquities." A <hi>worldly</hi> ſpirit, is diſcovering itſelf, in numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous immoral effects of avarice, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of perferring private temporal intereſts before the good of the country, and as to ſome in an eaſy declenſion from the diſſenting cauſe, and coincidence with a certain more <hi>worldly,</hi> and leſs reformed eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment; the immoral practice of gameing with lucrative purpoſes, chiefly among perſons in that which they call <hi>high</hi> life; a great neglect of public religious ordinances, in almoſt all parts of the land; amazing profanity, eſpecially in maritime places; widely prevailing and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors, together with a variety of high-ſtrained modes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance and luxury, more eſpecially in our larger and more wealthy trading towns.—
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013769_0038_0F91ACC6642455A8"/>
Things which appear at ſuch a day as <hi>this</hi> "exceeding ſinful," abſurd and aggravated, are in the number of thoſe ſins wherewith our times are marked; while ſome perſons run off into the wildeſt exceſſes of ſentiment, ſome "concerning faith have made ſhipwreck," and others are tinctured with the ſpirit of ſcepticiſm. And ſuch irreligion and vice, whereby we offend our God, and "the God of our fathers," and merit our miſery at his hands, are, in a great meaſure, borrowed (with unaccountable fond embraces) of the very peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from whom our ſufferings proceed.—The reflection is ſufficiently painful and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without proceeding to obſerve that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may poſſibly be found, degenerate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to ſpread vice and wickedneſs among us, from a principle of <hi>Balaamitiſh</hi> policy, or to render as an eaſier prey, by means of the venality, careleſſneſs and timidity which are the natural effects of luxury."</p>
            <p>"BUT whatever may be juſtly ſaid of their origination, certain it is, that by numerous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt God, we merit a much deeper plunge of adverſity, than we are now involved in; and we are called upon, by the monitory language of divine Providence, to "conſider our ways, and turn our feet unto his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and ſo to give glory to the Lord our
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013769_0039_0F91ACCBDD166170"/>
God, before our feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains; and while we look for light, he turn it into the ſhadow of death, and make it CROSS darkneſs." <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Turner's election ſermon.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BUT not to enlarge in this way. I will proceed to ſhow, agreable to what has already been hinted—That many of the evils and troubles we now ſuffer, are the moral, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the natural and neceſſary effects of our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and ſins; ſo that we may read our ſins, in the way and manner of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>WITH regard to the duty laid upon India teas, I cannot help thinking, (though ſome poſſibly may call this ſuperſtition) that it is a juſt judgment, and righteous puniſhment upon this people, for their vile abuſe, and proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that article of foreign trade, and I may add, <hi>needleſs</hi> luxury. To me it appears, that by means of this article of tea, the people of this land, have run into exceſſes of wickedneſs, great beyond all account. Many have fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly laid out their money for <hi>this,</hi> who could ſcarce procure the <hi>neceſſaries</hi> of life, and for no other reaſon, but becauſe it was faſhionable. And all orders, ranks and ages of people have been ſo devoted to it, as that they, many of
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013769_0040_0F91ACCCF24EB920"/>
them at leaſt, "have worſhipped and ſerved this creature, more than the Creator, who is bleſſed forever." Is it poſſible to tell how much time has been fooliſhly ſpent, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not altogether, among them, who are above the common level of mankind? Much time has been loſt, which might have been more profitably ſpent at home in their own proper buſineſs. Is it poſſible to ſay how much actual wickedneſs has been committed by people, (when viſiting one another for the ſake of tea, chiefly) in idle, vain and ſinful converſation, in freely handling the characters of others, ſlandering and defaming of them; together with a pretence among many at ſuch times, to a power of revealing ſecrets, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling future events, which, in whatever light we view it, muſt be evil. For a knowledge of any future events comes not from God in that way. If any perſons have this power it muſt be derived from ſome evil ſpirit. If none have this power of foretelling future events; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, may at leaſt be reckoned among that "fooliſh talking and jeſting which" the apoſtle ſays, "are not convenient," and which by no means "become women, profeſſing godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Beſides, there are many other evils at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending this faſhion and cuſtom of viſiting, for the ſake of drinking tea. It is no ſin for
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013769_0041_0F91ACCD288C8228"/>
perſons, who are able, to uſe the produce of other countries either for food or cloathing: It is the exceſs in the uſe hereof, with other evils accompanying the ſame which is faulty; and whether this article has not pretty univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally been uſed to a great degree of faulty and ſinful exceſs, is a queſtion, I readily ſubmit, for deciſion, to the ſober and thinking part of mankind. While I ſhall ſcarce mention the damage done to this country, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled uſe and conſumption of India-teas, in the vaſt ſums of money annually ſent hence to purchaſe it. Were the people in this land to uſe it as freely as heretofore they have done, the <hi>revenue</hi> ariſing from the duty laid on that ſingle article, ſmall as it is, no doubt, would annually amount to ſeveral hundred thouſand pounds. It is to be hoped, that for the good of their country, the people will totally lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the uſe of that needleſs, not to ſay hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commodity; for the duty hence ariſing, is chiefly, if not wholly ſpent, to ſupport in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſomething worſe, a ſet of men, many of whom, are not only needleſs, but noxious to ſociety.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed, May not the late act of the Britiſh court for blocking up the harbour of Boſton, be viewed in the light of a juſt frown of heaven upon the town and country,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013769_0042_0F91ACCDF9643320"/>
for their exceſs in trade, and amazing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance in the conſumption of foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. Though a free trade to foreign countries, well managed, may be a great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, yet it may be <hi>abuſed,</hi> and prove a real damage to the land. Many things abſolutely ſurperflous are imported; things which tend on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feed our pride and vanity. Many things are imported, which might be manufactured among ourſelves, vaſtly to our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. It is greatly to the intereſt of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to encourage all kinds of manufactures. But we have too generally contracted a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte to what is home-made, and think we muſt go abroad for food and cloathing. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has been overſtocked with foreign goods, whereby the land is drained of it's money. Beſides, multitudes in all parts are running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to trade, which is a real damage to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity: were they employed in handling the plow, (a work many of them are much fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for) and turning the wilderneſs into a fruitful field, they would do more eminent ſervice to their country, and, no doubt, to themſelves. However, I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this act of parliament, is a righteous and juſt act, as ſome do. It is an amazing ſtretch of power, replete with cruelty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; not to be paralleled in the records

of any court, even the Ottoman, and ſtands unexampled in all hiſtory. "All who have ſeen <hi>or heard of</hi> it, ſay, there was no ſuch deed done nor ſeen, from the day that the children of Iſrael came up out of the land of Egypt, unto this day: Conſider of it, take advice, and ſpeak your minds." <note n="§" place="bottom">Judges 19.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AGREABLE to the above reſolution, two acts have already paſſed the houſe of commons, and the houſe of lords, fundamentally ſubverſive of our chartered rights, and civil conſtitution, whereby many of our municipal inſtitutions and laws, which many years ago received the royal ſanction, and which we have long been in the enjoyment of, are repealed, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

here rendered deſpotic and arbitrary. Whether theſe bills have received the king's conſent or not, is not yet certain. We have reaſon to hope in the mildneſs, tenderneſs and affection of our ſovereign; but in aſſenting or not aſſenting to acts of the Britiſh court he, no doubt, conſults his privy council. If theſe bills paſs into laws, whether this people will ſubmit thereto, or not, is a queſtion which cannot be determined: But if they ſubmit, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty <hi>here</hi> will be at an end, we hold our rights, property and lives by the moſt precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tenure. "The governor and council, hereby inſtituted with powers, with which the Britiſh conſtitution has not truſted his majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and his privy-council, have the means of returning ſuch a jury in each particular cauſe, as may beſt ſuit with the gratification of their paſſions and intereſts. The lives, liberties and properties of the ſubject are put into their hands without controul; and the invaluable right of trial by jury, is turned into a ſnare for the people, who have hitherto looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as their main ſecurity againſt the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs of power.

in the houſe of lords, he would there publicly declare, that there was a greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs in the charter of New-England, than in thoſe of the corporations in England; for thoſe were only acts of grace, whereas the charter of New-England was a contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the king and the firſt patentees; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had promiſed to enlarge the king's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions on their own charges, provided that they and their poſterity might enjoy ſuch and ſuch privileges: And now they had perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their part, for the king to deprive their poſterity of the privileges granted to them, would carry a face of injuſtice in it."

As ſtrong if not ſtronger pleas have been made by our friends in both houſes of parliament, and by the people in this country in favor of the ſecond charter, and againſt thoſe bills, which have paſſed the two houſes; but all to no purpoſe:—if his majeſty has given, or does ſpeedily give his aſſent to thoſe bills, we ſhall be deprived of the greateſt liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges granted to us, in our charter, and this province will by means of ſuch an alteration and change in their form of government, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be thrown into a ſtate of anarchy and confuſion, for ſome time.</p>
            <p>THIS province has always had its enemies, men who have looked upon its privileges, as a prey richly worth their ſeizing. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have generally been men born and bro't up among ourſelves, who have been under every tie to guard, ſupport and defend the rights of their native country. With reſpect to the meaſures which have been lately adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Britiſh court, in regard to America and this province in particular, they have been contrived, promoted, and greatly urged, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by natives of this land, Some of them are gone to the bar of God, in whoſe hands we are willing to leave them. All who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013769_0049_0F91ACD3E86D74F0"/>
theſe meaſures we ſhall mark, and "the abhorrence and execrations of mankind will conſign them to an infamous immortality." <note n="‡" place="bottom">That <hi>ſome</hi> men, men of particular occupations and employments ſhould formally return thanks to any <hi>one</hi> for his good ſervices, who has labored to deprive us of our charter-rights, and to ſubvert our civil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, may be accounted for. Such may hope for ſome trifling promotion, and to build themſelves up upon the ruins of their country. That the miniſters of the church of England ſhould do ſo, is not ſo eaſily accounted for, unleſs it proceeds from the favorable notice <hi>ſuch</hi> may have taken of that church, and a hope that, if our civil government is changed, their eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical conſtitution may be eſtabliſhed here. But that miniſters of the congregational eſtabliſhment ſhould do thus, is altogether: unaccountable <hi>at preſent.</hi>
               </note> Is it not almoſt unaccountable that any chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this land ſhould prove ſuch monſters and prodigies of wickedneſs, ſuch unnatural parricides and aſſaſſins as to ſtab the vitals of their own country? But what will not luſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and dominion, or love of money, do? It "is the root of all evil, which while ſome coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows."</p>
            <p>BUT in times of public calamity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, we may be too apt to overlook the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> cauſe of the evils we ſuffer. We indeed
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013769_0050_0F91ACD4A99241F8"/>
cannot help taking ſome <hi>notice</hi> of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our griefs and ſorrows. It is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there is the permiſſion, and, perhaps, agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of heaven in theſe evils, for "ſhall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?" Yet they who have been the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary inſtruments, in bringing theſe troubles upon the province, are not the leſs guilty; "thou couldſt have no power againſt me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given thee from above," ſaid our Saviour to Pilate; yet this did not prove him innocent, "in condemning that juſt One." Divine Providence in ſuch events is not to be impeached. The moral evils which take place in the world, are not to be charged on God. Nothing can juſtify, or excuſe the contrivers and promoters of preſent meaſures: "Their guilt is of a ſcarlet color, and a crimſon die." But be their crime what it will, it becomes us to enquire <hi>what we have done</hi> to provoke God thus to viſit us in his anger, and to chaſten us <hi>thus</hi> in his hot diſpleaſure. It becomes us to reflect with deepeſt contrition and penitence of heart, on our paſt conduct, whereby we have offended the majeſty of heaven, and merited ſevereſt puniſhment. "For the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the land" theſe things are ordered, or permitted as a righteous chaſtiſement, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned "for our profit," to bring us to true
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013769_0051_0F91ACD56B27BAC0"/>
repentance and reformation. When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the way and manner of our puniſhment, I am ready to think, how much ſoever I may differ from ſome people, that we have greatly abuſed thoſe very liberties and privileges, which, if theſe acts take place, we ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of; that we have abuſed good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. May we not read our ſins, in the face of our puniſhment? I would here aſk, have not ſome people, under the notion of zeal for liberty, run into the moſt exceſſive licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and been guilty, in one place and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, of the moſt lawleſs, unjuſt, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical proceedings, ſuch as pulling down and deſtroying houſes, abuſing perſons, endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens lives, deſtroying their property, breaking windows, delivering priſoners out of the hands of juſtice, <note n="¶" place="bottom">If there be any law of this province, allowing creditors to keep debtors in jail, as long as they pleaſe, even after it appears that they have nothing wherewith to pay, it is with all deference and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty ſubmitted to our legiſlature, whether ſuch a law does not contradict the laws of nature and of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, and if it does, whether it ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed!</note> and putting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into great fears; all contrary to the good and wholeſome laws of this province? Theſe things, many of them at leaſt, are indeed but the natural conſequences of a ſtretch of power
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013769_0052_0F91ACD698171958"/>
in rulers and "princes," they are the common fruit of grievous, oppreſſive and unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal acts of government. There was nothing of this kind among us, until the ever memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ſtamp-act</hi> took place. Solomon has long ſince, obſerved, that "oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad." But ſuch lawleſs meaſures are not to be juſtified; they ought not to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, or tolerated by any, nor have they been, by many. They do not always anſwer a valuable purpoſe, but evil generally comes thereof; they excite a ſpirit of revenge in the ſufferers, and revenge has been purſued unto the utmoſt, the bitter and ſevere fruits where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are now reaping. In theſe times, when the general cry has been for liberty, have not ſome perſons in the land, of a querulous, fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and licentious turn, ſlid into the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous extreme of deſpiſing all government, and endeavoured to put down all rule, order, government and authority, both in church and ſtate? Has not reaſonable, juſt and mild government, in ſome parts of the land, been trampled on and ſpurned at, and <hi>good</hi> rulers reviled, ſlighted and ſet at nought? Liberty, my brethren, is a precious and ineſtimable jewel, and ought to be uſed with utmoſt cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and delicacy. It may be as much abuſed as government and power, leading into mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures equally tyrannical and oppreſſive. The
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013769_0053_0F91ACD9826A9760"/>
people who reſiſt and counteract well conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted civil adminiſtration, and trample upon the good and wholſome laws of the land, ſhould conſider that they "reſiſt an ordinance of God, and they who reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation." It is not improbable, that ſome perſons in the land <hi>appear</hi> rather favorers of the preſent oppreſſive meaſure of government, becauſe they have ſeen too much of a factious, licentious and tumultuous ſpirit among ſome people.</p>
            <p>BUT to proceed: In the act for regulating the civil government of this province, it is propoſed that towns ſhould be deprived of the liberty, which the laws of this province have given them, of meeting when they pleaſe, and acting upon whatever to them, may ſeem meet and good. And here it may be aſked, Have not ſome towns in the land ſinned great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and highly provoked God, by an abuſe of the liberty and power by law given to them? Has no town done things monſtrouſly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and oppreſſive? And have not the "cries of the injured, entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth?" It is poſſible that, under color of law, and that plea that all muſt be bound in <hi>all caſes</hi> by the vote of the majority, even things moſt unjuſt and unrighteous, may be tranſacted. It is very difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013769_0054_0F91ACD9A3B66CF0"/>
to frame laws in ſuch a manner, as to prevent every ſpecies of injuſtice and iniquity. Are not towns therefore, which have been guilty of a perverſion of their liberty, in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as a proper puniſhment, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged thereof. Though, I grant, it looks moſt unreaſonable and unjuſt, that innocent places ſhould ſuffer with the guilty.</p>
            <p>FURTHER: The manner of returning jury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is by the above act to be altered, and the privilege granted, by our laws, to towns to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn them, is to be wreſted from them. And have not ſome towns ſinned greatly in the ſight of God, by trifling, in the moſt daring manner with this invaluable privilege, which has been looked upon as our main ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the licentiouſneſs of power. Have not ſome places returned ſuch perſons, to ſerve as grand jurymen, and jurymen on trials, in moſt intereſting and important cauſes, as neither fear God, nor regard man? Perſons, who not only have no religion, but are enemies to all religion and goodneſs; men who can deiſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproach the excellent, well atteſted religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, and blaſpheme its divine Author? Men "who fear not an oath? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have no regard to religion, to divine revelation, will never think themſelves bound to regard an oath; they can, and often do,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013769_0055_0F91ACDA2A6F9238"/>
trifle with it. Have there been no inſtances wherein perſons of this caſt, have been really picked, to ſerve a turn? Are our lives, our intereſt, our property more ſafe in the hands of ſuch perſons, than they would be in the hands of a jury returned by the ſheriff? The remedy provided againſt this evil by the act of the Britiſh court, is as bad as the diſeaſe; for although it may prevent ſome evils, it will create more. Some other, better and more effectual remedy, might be provided by our own legiſlature, and really ought to be; for this is a "crying iniquity in our <hi>high places.</hi>"</p>
            <p>FURTHER, By the above mentioned act, the liberty of our chooſing our own counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors is to be taken from us, and put into the hands of the crown: This, if it takes place, muſt ere long, have a vaſt influence on our liberty, laws and religion. And we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that ſome alteration will ſoon be made in the form of chooſing our own repreſentatives. When theſe deareſt liberties are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, does it not become this people, ſeriouſly to aſk whether they have not, by an abuſe hereof, offended the moſt high God? We have all along had great and good men in the two houſes of aſſembly; men of great abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fearing God and hating covetouſneſs. But have they all been of this character? Have
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013769_0056_0F91ACDC1BF5B700"/>
none been elected to a ſeat in either houſe, who have been enemies to religion, peace, order and good government? We are in a moſt pitiful ſituation, if there are not men ſufficient for all the places of government, who are well qualified therefor; men not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friendly to the rights and liberties of this people, but men diſcerning in the times and ſeaſons, and knowing what <hi>they</hi> ought to do; men of religion and piety, as well as ſound judgment and enlarged knowledge. Electors ought to have a regard to the religious and moral characters of the men, whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to rule over the people, as well as to other neceſſary qualifications. The directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven in this caſe is plain; "Thou ſhalt provide out of all the people, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and place ſuch over them." <note n="*" place="bottom">Exodus 18.21.</note> Men of another character, men who will trifle with, and ſacrifice, their own moſt important inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, will alſo ſacrifice the intereſts of others, to ſerve their own ſiniſter views and purpoſes. Has that due regard been paid to the moral and religious character of men, who have been appointed to places of civil power and truſt, men whoſe buſineſs it is, to ſee that the laws of the land are well executed, which ought to be in all caſes? But not to enlarge,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013769_0057_0F91ACDC40E60AA0"/>
have we not too much reaſon, from the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment which is threatned, to think that we have wantonly trifled with, and ſhamefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed theſe our ineſtimable liberties and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that our ſins, in theſe reſpects have been very great, and moſt provoking to God? But our ſins, as a people, for which we now ſuffer ſevere judgments, (and ſeverer we are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with) cannot be reckoned up in order. Suffice it to ſay, that ſo many and ſo great are our iniquities and tranſgreſſions, that we have reaſon to fear, deſtruction from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will come upon us to the uttermoſt. Nothing without timely repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, ſo ſtriving to recommend ourſelves to the divine Being, can ſave us. Says God, "At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them." <note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah 18.7, 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER faulty and guilty the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and agents in our calamities are, yet conſidering our impieties and ſins, they are but a juſt and righteous puniſhment as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the hands of God, which may be averted by deep humiliation and hearty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition for our offences; offering, at the ſame
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013769_0058_0F91ACDCE4BDB360"/>
time, as we profeſs to do this day, ardent prayers to Him, who is able to ſave, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our righteous cauſe to him, who ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly appeared for our fore-fathers in their day, and even for us in <hi>our</hi> day. "His arm is not ſhortened that it cannot ſave; his ear is not heavy that it cannot hear." "They who make mention of the Lord, ſhould not keep ſilence, and give him no reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and make this land a praiſe in the earth." "For Zion, or <hi>the churches ſake</hi> they ſhould not hold their peace, and for Jeruſalem's ſake ſhould they not reſt, until the righteouſneſs thereof go forth as brightneſs, and the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof as a lamp that burneth." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah 62.1, 6, 7.</note> Is it not altogether unaccountable that any perſons who acknowledge a Providence ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, governing and ordering in all events, ſhould be found backward to the duties of ſuch a day of faſting and prayer? For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may differ in ſentiments as to what are our calamities, this is certain, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant occaſion for deep humiliation on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſins, and the divine judgments brought on the land therefor, whatever we may think our ſins and thoſe judgments be.</p>
            <p>THIS country ſeems to be in a moſt alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and critical ſituation. So dark a day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013769_0059_0F91ACDED9522D80"/>
North-America never ſaw. There is ſcarce one gleam of light breaks through the darkneſs, to comfort our hearts withal. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we might hope that, <hi>that</hi> God who ſo wonderfully owned and ſmiled upon <hi>the</hi> cauſe for which our fore-fathers came into this, <hi>then</hi> howling wilderneſs would ſtill own and ſmile upon it; but our iniquities teſtify againſt us, and we muſt be ſenſible that for our abuſe of the bleſſings of religious liberty, and the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, we have forfeited them into the hands of God. Our religious liberties are always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered when the civil are invaded; and from preſent appearances we have all reaſon to fear they will fall together, and that it will not be long before <hi>that</hi> eccleſiaſtical hierarchy will be eſtabliſhed here (and poſſibly that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual tyranny be exerciſed) from which our fore-fathers fled. It ſeems ſtrange, that a deep concern of mind reſpecting this matter, ſhould not be awakened in every friend to the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſt.</p>
            <p>WHAT are the leading ſprings and motives of the preſent meaſures of adminiſtration it is hard to ſay. We have reaſon to fear, at leaſt, that a deſign is forming to dethrone his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent majeſty, king George the third, our right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign, and to introduce the Pretender, and with him the popiſh religion. Popery is,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013769_0060_0F91ACDFCD159430"/>
no doubt, gaining ground in England. A high dignitary of the church of England, as we ſuppoſe, has declared, but a few years ſince, that "popiſh biſhops reſide <hi>here," (that is in London, or in England ſomewhere)</hi> "and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to exerciſe every part of their function, without offence, and without obſervation." <note n="†" place="bottom">See the anſwer to Dr. Mayhew's obſervations, printed in London.</note> "The papiſts, only in London, were by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation an hundred thouſand, in the year 1745, ſince which their numbers are vaſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed there, and in other parts of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the people being, as it is ſaid, pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by popiſh biſhops, prieſts, jeſuits, &amp;c. by hundreds and thouſands, if not ten thouſands, yearly." <note n="‡" place="bottom">See Dr. Mayhew's ſecond defence of his obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, p. 71.</note> The good laws of England, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from hence, are dormant and unexecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, againſt papiſts; nor would it be any reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſay, that, poſſibly, ſome of this perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be advanced to places of high power and truſt in our nation. Certain it is, that his majeſty's council in Grenada, an American iſland, is compoſed partly, if not wholly of Roman catholicks. There is a popiſh biſhop at Canada. This, it is ſaid, was ſtipulated, in the laſt treaty of peace between England
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013769_0061_0F91ACDFED39B2A0"/>
and France. There is a popiſh prieſt at No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia, who is ſupported by England, as I have been informed. Theſe things, ſo tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and countenanced, may well lead us to fear that ſome ſecret deſigns are planning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the crown, and proteſtant religion in England, the abettors whereof may, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably, ere long boldly ſhow their faces, and openly own their cauſe. However that be, theſe things forebode no good to the civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or eccleſiaſtical, of Great-Britain. The principles and tenets of papiſts are ſuch, as that it is not ſafe for any proteſtant govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to tolerate them. The diſſenting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in America will doubtleſs ſuffer, if popery ſhould ever overſpread England. We in this land have abundant reaſon to fear and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed; and eſpecially when we conſider how barren and unfruitful we have been while planted in the Lord's vineyard, and favored with divine manurings and cultivations; and have, like Capernaum, been exalted, unto heaven, in point of ſpiritual privileges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages;—we have reaſon to fear leſt the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel kingdom ſhould be taken from us, and given unto a people, that will bring forth the fruits thereof. But God is merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and long ſuffering to us ward, not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we ſhould periſh, but deſirous that we come unto repentance, and be ſaved. The
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013769_0062_0F91ACE0BAD99128"/>
monitory language of divine Providence at the preſent day, ſeems to be like that admonition, long ago ſent to the church of Epheſus. "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works; or elſe I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place, except thou repent." <note n="‖" place="bottom">Revelation 2.5.</note> O that, when ſuch are the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heaven we feel and fear, this people would learn righteouſneſs. "Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs exalteth a nation." Says one, whoſe words may very fitly be uſed here.—"Could we ſee people in general, humbling themſelves under the mighty hand of God, in the evils that are come upon us—could we ſee a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſpoſition in them, to break off from their ſins by righteouſneſs, and from their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by turning to the Lord—could we ſee practical piety and religion prevailing among all ranks of men—how much would the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect brighten up? God would appear for us, "who is the hope of his people and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour thereof in the day of trouble." And "if God be for us, who can be againſt us?" He can work deliverance for us in a thouſand ways to us unknown. Then our peace ſhall be as a river, when our righteouſneſs is as the waves of the ſea. Mutual harmony and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall be reſtored between Great-Britain
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013769_0063_0F91ACE185CDF640"/>
and her colonies, and between all orders of men in them. The burdens under which we groan ſhall be removed. We ſhall no longer be ſo unhappy, as to be ſuſpected of wanting loyalty to our king, or of having the leaſt diſpoſition to refuſe a conſtitutional ſubjection to our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent country. The great evils which we now ſuffer, in conſequence of ſuch groundleſs ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, ſhall be removed. We ſhall ſit quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under our vines and fig-trees, enjoying the fruit of our fathers unremitting labors, and of our own, and have none to make us afraid. We ſhall behold our ſettlements extending themſelves into the yet uncultivated lands. "The wilderneſs ſhall become a fruitful field, and the deſart ſhall bloſſom as the roſe." Our navigation ſhall be freed from its preſent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments; and trade recover a flouriſhing ſtate. Our rights and privileges ſhall be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed on a firmer baſis than ever. Every revolving year ſhall add ſomething to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and happineſs of America. And thoſe that behold it ſhall ſee occaſion to ſay, "Happy art thou O people!

            <p>THE preſent alarming ſituation of this whole land engages our attention, and demands the united exertions of this people, in the methods juſtifiable in the ſight of God, for our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It would be unpardonable in us tame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit to ſlavery and chains. Freedom is the gift of God; he has given us right and means to aſſert it. We may reaſonably aſk and expect his gracious aſſiſtance, in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and righteous employment of thoſe means. It would be moſt ſtupid and highly cirminal in us to look for deliverance, while we ſat ſtill only aſking divine help. This would be to expect miracles. Unanimity in all orders and ranks of people, is neceſſary at the preſent alarming criſis, to give weight, force and ſtrength to all attempts to ſave this ſinking land. They who endeavor artfully to divide, are attempting to deſtroy us, and muſt anſwer for all the ill conſequences. "That the people ſhould be divided, and ſome of them diſengaged from ſuch a <hi>cauſe</hi> as that of their country's freedom, by ſmall private piques and prejudicing contentions; or influenced by

little hopes and fears about <hi>worldly</hi> promotions and intereſts, ſhould treat it in a nugatory manner, is entirely aſtoniſhing! But our ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize abates, when we conſider, how capable human nature is of trifling in the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate concerns of religion—in reference to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life, and everlaſting miſery." Thoſe inhuman and barbarous miſcreants who have been plotting their country's ruin; thoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did wretches, who, perferring their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt, to the ſalvation of their country, can "rejoice at" <hi>her</hi> "calamites, will not go unpuniſhed" by heaven, and juſtly merit the abhorrence, deteſtation and total <hi>neglect</hi> of this ſuffering people.</p>
            <p>LAWFUL and juſtifiable means of redreſs are within our power. "Other nations have contended in blood for their liberty, and have judged the jewel worth the price that was paid for it. Theſe colonies are not reduced to the dreadful neceſſity. So dependant is Greät-Britain on us for ſupplies, that heaven ſeems to have placed in our hands means of an effectual, yet peaceable, reſiſtance, if we have ſenſe and integrity to make a proper uſe of them. A general agreement between theſe colonies, of non-importation and non-expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>an engagement among this people, not to conſume India-teas, or Britiſh manufactures,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:013769_0066_0F91ACE4D91CF868"/>
faithfully obſerved, would certainly, under Providence, be attended with ſucceſs." But in all attempts of this kind, we ſhould careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavor, not to diſtreſs any fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, unleſs our own ſelf-defence and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our country, make it neceſſary. This is a meaſure towards obtaining relief which violates no law of God or man. No law obliges us to go to another country for food or cloathing, or any thing beſides, if we can do without. If the preſent acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment take place here (and ſubſequent ones we may continually look for) we muſt be driven, of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> to live more within ourſelves; we ſhall not have the means of procuring Britiſh goods, and in that caſe England muſt ſink; ruin and bankrupcy to all the trading part of the nation, will be the conſequence. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſource of national wealth to Great-Britain, is her trade to theſe colonies. We maintain a far greater number of people, in England, than we do here. Theſe colonies, are to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as the pillars were to the houſe which Sampſon brake, whereby <hi>the houſe fell on the Lords and all the people.</hi> If we fall the whole Britiſh empire will fall with us; and poſſibly that may fall while we ſtand. Nothing will ſave the nation from ruin, if America does not. Ireland, groaning under Egyptian-like bondage, is ſtretching forth her hands, and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013769_0067_0F91ACE557CC21F0"/>
calling to us for help and relief. What will be the iſſue of the preſent commotions throughout the whole Britiſh empire, it is not eaſy to foretel. It was long ago pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, by the great Monteſquieu, that "As all human things have an end, the ſtate we are ſpeaking of (England) will loſe its liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will periſh. Have not Rome, Sparta, and Carthage periſhed? It will periſh, when the legiſlative power ſhall be more corrupt than the executive." We may fear that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is near its accompliſhment.</p>
            <p>BE that as it may. While we are ſuffering the loſs of many valuable bleſſings, we ſhould not forget that, of the unmerited mercy of God, we ſtill are in the poſſeſſion of a rich va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ineſtimable favors. Let us endeavor to make all ſuitable returns of love, gratitude and obedience, to that Being, "from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift," herefor; while, at the ſame time, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly looking to God, by prayer, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of his judgments, under which the land groaneth, for the averting thoſe evils which may be impending, and for the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every bleſſing, "that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us, with the favor he beareth unto his people, and viſit us with his ſalvation, that we may ſee the good of his choſen, that we may
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013769_0068_0F91ACE5FB24A3E8"/>
rejoice in the gladneſs of his nation, and that we may glory with his inheritance." <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm 106.4, 5.</note> Let us carefully follow the direction of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. "Fret not thyſelf becauſe of evil doers, neither be thou envious againſt the workers of iniquity: For they ſhall ſoon be cut down like the graſs, and wither as the green herb. Truſt in the Lord <hi>and do good</hi>; ſo ſhalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou ſhalt be fed. Delight thyſelf alſo in the Lord; and he ſhall give thee the deſires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the Lord: Truſt alſo in Him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs. And he ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſs as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day. Reſt in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him: Fret not thyſelf becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way, becauſe of the man who bringeth wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed devices to paſs. Ceaſe from anger, and forſake wrath: Fret not thyſelf in any wiſe to do evil. For evil doers ſhall be cut off: But thoſe that wait upon the Lord they ſhall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not be: Yea, thou ſhalt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently conſider his place, and it ſhall not be. But the meek ſhall inherit the earth; and ſhall delight themſelves in the abundance of peace." <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm 37.1—11.</note>

               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:013769_0069_0F91ACE6C2B0E760"/>TO conclude. While ſtruggling for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from arbitrary human power, and for civil liberty, let us remember that we are in voluntary ſlavery under the uſurped dominion of luſt over reaſon, and let us exert ourſelves for deliverance from the bondage of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that we may be vindicated "into the glorious liberty of the children of God." We muſt not expect refined happineſs in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>evil</hi> world. Infinite wiſdom ſees meet to exerciſe us with various trials in this ſtate, that we may be diſengaged from a too fond pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of worldly felicity, and be excited to ſeek thoſe things which are above. There is a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter country before us, even an heavenly; be this the main object of our deſires, purſuit and endeavors. Let us manifeſt, by all our life and converſation, that we are ſeeking a city which is to come, which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God. In a little time death will tranſlate us to another world, and "ſeeing we look for <hi>this,</hi> let us be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent that we may be found of our Judge in peace, without ſpot, and blameleſs;" and then we ſhall be forever happy in that ſtate where "the wicked ceaſe from troubling, and we ſhall no more hear the voice of the oppreſſor." There an eternal circle of uninterrupted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, large as our wiſhes, awaits us, to which we ſhall, at length, be admitted, of the mercy of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord. AMEN!</p>
