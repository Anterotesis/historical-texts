            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>It is therefore neceſſary that more awful intimations ſhould occaſionally be given; that events ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, which may irreſiſtably arreſt attention, and teach mankind that they are but mortal. When a perſon illuſtrious for his actions, and beloved for his virtues, departs this life, the eyes of mankind are opened; thoſe reflections, which they once avoided as unpleaſant, ruſh involuntarily into the mind, and convince them of the precarious nature of their enjoyments. The leaves of the foreſt may fall unnoticed; but when the majeſtic oak is torn up by the tempeſt, and laid proſtrate on the earth, it cannot fail to attract the obſervation of the paſſing traveller. The ſolitary cottage is gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by time, and ſinks imperceptibly into decay; but when <hi>the cloud capt towers and gorgeous palaces</hi> are overturned, we pauſe to contemplate the mighty ruin, and heave a ſigh for the inſtability of human grandeur.</p>

            <p>It is not my intention to trace, at preſent, the ſteps by which this great man roſe to the ſummit of glory, nor to relate thoſe exertions by which he conducted his country through a long and perilous war, and erected the temple of Liberty in this weſtern world.—When a life is marked by ſuch a train of ſplendid actions; when a character is diſtinguiſhed by ſuch an aſſemblage of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the mind is at a loſs where to begin the ſtriking enumeration.

            <p>Veterans of America! ye who have fought in the ſacred cauſe of freedom, and conquered under the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of WASHINGTON, what are your feelings on the preſent occaſion? You have ſeen your Hero victorious in the conflict of armies; you have ſeen him directing the war where to pour its fury; you have ſeen him preſiding in our councils, and forming plans for the proſperity of a riſing empire; but never again ſhall you behold him engaged in theſe glorious and uſeful occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations. He who led you to victory and triumph, hath fallen himſelf beneath the arm of the exterminating angel. Neither the roar of battle, nor even the voice of his country—that voice which he always heard with veneration, and obeyed with alacrity, ſhall again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb his repoſe. He who taught you how to conquer, has now taught you a more awful and important leſſon; he hath taught you how to die. Your Chief was not wanting to himſelf in the trying hour of diſſolution. He was unlike thoſe men, who can brave death in the tumult of battle, but ſhrink from his ſilent and gradual approaches. To the very laſt moment he <hi>poſſeſſed his ſoul in peace,</hi> and preſerved that firmneſs and intrepidity which had diſtinguiſhed him through the whole courſe of his life. For him death had no terrors, and the grave was only a quiet aſylum.</p>

            <p>Young men of America! To you I now addreſs my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. At your time of life, the boſom naturally glows with the love of virtue, and the admiration of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and pants to emulate the actions of illuſtrious men. It is therefore proper, that the moſt glorious examples ſhould be placed before your eyes; and is it poſſible that a model more perfect and unexceptionable than that of WASHINGTON, ſhould be ſelected for your imitation? You have heard every tongue reſound his praiſes: you have ſeen the aged ſoldier forget his infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and kindle with the enthuſiaſm of <hi>other years,</hi> while he related his campaigns, and deſcribed the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And though ſome, affecting greater ſagacity than their neighbours, have pretended to diſcover flaws in his conduct as a ſtateſman, yet even theſe perſons now lament his death with unfeigned ſorrow; they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his various <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd uncommon merits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their apprehenſions that his loſs will never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired.</p>
            <p>You ſee then, that virtue, though it may be over ſhadowed by a tranſient cloud, will at laſt break forth upon the world in full brilliancy. You ſee that true merit and real excellence will be reſpected, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal invective has loſt its ſting, and the inſinuations of ſlander are no longer remembered. With ſuch proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects before your eyes; with ſuch a model for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; with ſuch hopes to ſtimulate your exertions, you will be altogether inexcuſable, if you waſte your time and miſapply your talents. Remember that now is the reaſon for making theſe acquiſitions, which may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after render you honorable and uſeful to your country, and raiſe you to an equality with WASHINGTON, EPAMINONDAS, and the worthies of the world. If you are actuated with a generous deſire of reaching ſuch diſtinguiſhed excellence, you muſt never loſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Do not deceive yourſelves on a ſubject of ſuch vaſt importance as the regulation of your conduct. This affects your preſent and future happineſs; it will either exalt you to glory, or ſink you into contempt and ignominy.</p>
            <p>There are two traits in the character of WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, which I muſt earneſtly recommend to your imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as it is to be feared that they are growing rather unfaſhionable—I mean Modeſty and Diffidence.

and vicious; but never will it procure you the eſteem of the virtuous and diſcerning. It was not by acting thus, that WASHINGTON laid the foundation of that glory which will laſt for ages. Nor is it by acting thus, that you will be enabled to riſe to diſtinction; to ſave your country in the hour of danger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the united plaudits and acclamations of your Fellow-Citizens.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to ſay that all of you will have it in your power to rival the glory of WASHINGTON. On the contrary, I am convinced that the great quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he diſplayed, are beſtowed only on a choſen few. But even if you poſſeſſed all his powers, it would require an extraordinary concurrence of circumſtances to call them forth into action, and exhibit them in their true colours to the world. All of you cannot expect to be placed in ſuch a ſituation; for Providence does not make uſe of every man as an inſtrument for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its great deſigns, for delivering a country, and giving happineſs and liberty to future generations.— Human ſociety, you know, cannot exiſt without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. There muſt be <hi>hands</hi> to execute, as well as <hi>heads</hi> to contrive.—Still, however, if you endeavour to do your duty in that ſtate of life wherein you are placed, you may contribute greatly to the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſs. Your life will be reſpectable, your death will be lamented, and your <hi>memory will be bleſſed.</hi> In one reſpect, at leaſt, you will equal WASHINGTON himſelf. You will enjoy no leſs than he did, the ſmiles of an approving conſcience; and this, doubtleſs, was a reward more grateful to his exalted ſoul, than all the honours which this world could have beſtowed.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that the greateſt tribute you can pay to the memory of our departed Hero, is to imitate his virtues. Statues and monuments are, at beſt, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious tokens of the public affection. They may be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bad as well as to the good; to the tyrant, no

leſs than to the Father of his Country. But when th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> living endeavor to perpetuate the memory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed by copying their virtues, we may then infer, without a poſſibility of being miſtaken, that they act from the moſt cordial eſteem and approbation.—If then the name of WASHINGTON was ever grateful to your ears—if his actions ever inſpired your young minds with love and veneration, endeavor to reſemble him. Be firm and united in maintaining the Liberty and Conſtitution of your country. Diſplay a generous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the ſupport of that religion, which is the only ſure anchor that holds man to his duty. Act thus, and I will venture to predict, that <hi>you will in no wiſe loſe your reward.</hi> The lips of the hoary head will bleſs the band of riſing patriots. The late Father of his Country (if aught of mortality can reach him now) will experience an augmentation of happineſs in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of bliſs. America, inſtead of <hi>one,</hi> will have <hi>many</hi> WASHINGTONS, and her enemies will ſtill tremble.— Altho' <hi>the mighty has fallen,</hi> yet they will know that the holy flame of freedom has not expired; that <hi>the weapons of war have not periſhed</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>To thoſe among you, my Countrymen, who direct the Councils of America, I muſt not omit this favorable opportunity of addreſſing a few words. I mean not to read political lectures from the pulpit, nor to arraign the ſentiments and conduct of any. It would be the height of preſumption, for a perſon of my age and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience, to offer directions to the Senators and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of a free, powerful, and enlightened na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But in addreſſing you on the preſent occaſion, I fear not the imputation of arrogance and temerity, ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered as I am under the reſpectable authority of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON. I only deliver the ſentiments of him who has long been, and will long continue to be, the object of your affections. I exhort you to the accompliſhment of a plan, which was contemplated with much pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>No man (ſaid an ancient ſage) ought to be called happy before his death.
