            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following little Eſſays, were drawn up many years ago, partly as helps to moral and divine conference, in a religious ſociety, and partly as the reſult of ſuch conferences. They are generally the reſult of free, and pretty enlarged and comprehenſive meditations on the ſubjects they treat of, and conſiſt of ſuch thoughts as occurred firſt and moſt obviouſly to the open mind, in its free and unfettered diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions on ſaid ſubjects;—and they were meant meerly as hints to ſtart the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and to keep it alive, and to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in hand, that it might not deviate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wild and impertinent digreſſions.</p>
            <p>THIS will account for the Nature and Form of the Eſſays, which are very ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and uncommon. They conſiſt of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of looſe, general, and often, unconnect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aphoriſms, or general Maxims, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly cloſed by ſome practical corollaries or inferences of the greateſt moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014137_0003_0F97D456095F0C40"/>
THE primitive deſign of them, was to convey the moſt ample, general inſtruction to the mind on every ſubject treated of; yet ſo, as that inſtruction might exhauſt the ſubject in Miniature, as it were, or, in the narroweſt compaſs conſiſtent with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, —and that the method of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubjects, ſhould be calculated, as much as poſſible, for affecting the heart by proper motives, and ſtirring up men to the diligent practice of the virtues and duties explained. And I hope the judicious and intelligent Chriſtian reader will find, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an attentive peruſal of the Eſſays themſelves, that they are not ill adapted to this purpoſe; excepting, perhaps, a few, which are more ſuperficial than the reſt.</p>
            <p>IT had been eaſy to have filled up theſe Skeletons of Doctrine, and lengthened them out to the ordinary ſize of pulpit diſcourſes. In this form they would have had, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, many advantages which they are now neceſſarily deprived of: In this form, they would have admitted of Connexion, Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, Illuſtration, Perſuaſion, Pathos,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:014137_0004_0F97D45674DD14C0"/>and all the Graces and Beauties of fine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; whereas, their preſent form neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily precludes theſe advantages.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, in ſuch a form, they would have been very volumnious and expenſive: Few would have purchaſed them, and perhaps, fewer read them. The preſent volatile, irreligious taſte, nauſeates e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing prolix in divinity. Five or ſix pages of a religious book is as much as we can, in conſcience expect, that a modern fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman or Lady ſhould read at one ſitting. The taſte of the times is, therefore, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſulted in the ſhortneſs of theſe Eſſay</p>
            <p>A PERSON of this ſqueamiſh diſpoſition, may here read, in eight or ten minutes, ſome of the moſt important things which can be ſaid on each of theſe ſubjects, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off abruptly, in the midſt of the ſenſe, and loſing the whole chain of connexion.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, if the Eſſays are tolerably exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted on this plan, the doctrinal aphoriſms contained in them, ſhould be ſo plain and ſelf-evident, as to ſupercede the neceſſity of arguments and illuſtrations; the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:014137_0005_0F97D459EFB9D988"/>corollaries ſhould flow ſpontaneouſly and conſequentially from theſe aphoriſms, and the whole ſhould be demonſtratively built upon the ſcriptures referred to in the margin.</p>
            <p>AFTER having humbly recommended theſe imperfect Eſſays to the public candour and indulgence, and implored the bleſſing of GOD upon them, for the general good; if I might preſume to offer my advice to my fellow-creatures concerning the beſt way of uſing them,—it would be as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: That they would read them, in their private and devout retirements, as Hints for Meditation on theſe important ſubjects, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their minds open, without prejudice, to the influence of divine truth, and earneſtly imploring the Father of lights to write theſe truths and virtues with ſun-beams upon their underſtandings; convey them warm to their hearts, and make them powerfully opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and influential on all the active powers and faculties of their nature.</p>
            <p>I HAVE added the Sermons as ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to thoſe who may diſreliſh the dryneſs of many of the Eſſay</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>of</hi> CONVERSION, <hi>or</hi> REGENERATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. RELIGION being a <hi>character,</hi> muſt have a <hi>principle;</hi> and this principle muſt ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly govern and predominate in the life. We do not call a man <hi>generous</hi> and <hi>friendly,</hi> unleſs generoſity and friendſhip prevail in him above churliſhneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendlineſs, and are fixed principles in his nature.—So it would be equally abſurd to call a man <hi>religious,</hi> only becauſe of the performance of a few outward religious duties, while the main of his temper and character is irreligious and immoral. <hi>He</hi> only deſerves the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of being <hi>religious,</hi> who is ſuch uniformly and predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minantly, and in whom morality and religion is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing and diſcriminating character!</p>
               <p n="2">2. TRUE religion, where it is, muſt govern the man; and nothing can do this but an <hi>inward principle.</hi> Grace, which is this principle, muſt oppoſe corruption, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally prevail over it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE word of GOD, and indeed the nature and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of things, place religion primarily and radically in the <hi>heart,</hi> and repreſent it as flowing thence into the life and converſation. The heart, as it is the ſource and fountain of all external corruption, ſo it muſt be of all true religion. The tree muſt firſt be made good before
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014137_0009_0F97D45C7671D208"/>its fruit can be good. A bitter or polluted fountain, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſend forth pure or ſweet water. Men gather not grapes of thorns, nor figs of thiſtles. Good principles are neceſſarily prerequiſite to <hi>morally</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Accordingly, the whole ſtreſs is laid, in ſcripture, upon <hi>heart-religion;</hi> or that which is ſeated and radicated in the heart, and proceeds from pure and right principles and motives there<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxiii. 26. Ezek. xxxvi. 26.—xviii. 31. Joel ii. 12, 13. Pſal. li. and cxxxix. 1 Sam. xvi. 7. 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. Deut. xiii. 3.</note>.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it has been the general opinion of mankind, as well as the voice of ſcripture, that men are born into this world in a <hi>depraved, corrupt</hi> and <hi>irreligious</hi> ſtate, with ſtrong propenſities to vice, and a diſinclination to that which appears to be virtuous and good, by the very law of their nature, written on their conſcience, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to them by their moral inſtinctive feelings; ſo it has been generally thought the peculiar work of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the GOD and <hi>Father</hi> of men, to help them, by his grace and Spirit, to riſe out of this ſtate of depravity and corruption, and to return to his obedience, favour and enjoyment, in the ſteep and narrow path of virtue and piety. This has ever been thought a care and work wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of GOD the Father of ſpirits, towards his human off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; and even a heathen could ſay, <hi>Nullus vir magnus unquam fuit, ſine Divino afflatu.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. OUR Lord ſtrongly expreſſes both the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this change in ſinners, by telling them, <hi>That unleſs they are born again of water, and of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>are converted,</hi> they not only <hi>ſhall not,</hi> but even <hi>cannot, enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven</hi>

               <p n="7">7. GRANTING theſe expreſſions of <hi>a new birth by the Spirit,</hi> and a becoming <hi>new-creatures,</hi> and the like, to be <hi>figurative</hi> and <hi>metaphorical;</hi> yet if theſe metaphors have any ſignificancy and propriety at all, they muſt imply the following truths; namely, (1.) That the change of a ſinner by converſion or regeneration, muſt be <hi>exceeding great,</hi> bearing ſome analogy to the difference between the circumſtances of a child before and after its birth;—or between a being in a ſtate of non-entity, and after the commencement of its exiſtence, in ſome eſſential reſpects at leaſt.—(2.) That it is not a <hi>partial,</hi> but an <hi>univerſal</hi> change; a change of the whole bent of the heart and drift and direction of the affections.—(3.) That it is not a meer <hi>outward, imperfect</hi> change, but one that is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, eſſential</hi> and <hi>complete.</hi>—(4.) That it is a change not produced by the ſinner's own natural powers and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but <hi>wholly ſupernatural,</hi> the product of a <hi>divine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,</hi> effected and produced by the Spirit of God: And (5.) That it is a change abſolutely neceſſary in every ſon and daughter of Adam, in order to their entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8. EITHER theſe inferences are plainly and clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from theſe metaphors; or, otherwiſe, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors muſt not only be ſuppoſed highly <hi>improper,</hi> but even <hi>pernicious;</hi> tending to miſlead the judgments of men, and obſcuring a doctrine of great importance to men's ſalvation, otherwiſe plain and obvious in itſelf,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014137_0011_0F97D45DF68978B8"/>which would be a high imputation on the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, and an unanſwerable objection againſt the revelation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. SELF-LOVE, a <hi>deſire of reputation</hi> and <hi>fame,</hi> and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>ſlaviſh fear,</hi> often produce a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious character, which is merely outward and greatly imperfect.</p>
               <p n="10">10. ALTHOUGH that ſeed of grace, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the ſpiritual life, is infuſed <hi>at once</hi> into the whole nature, in the act of regeneration, and gives it a holy taſte, bent, turn, tendency and direction; yet the fruits of it ſhew themſelves but <hi>gradually</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſively,</hi> in the progreſſive work of ſanctification, as occaſions, trials and opportunities elicit and draw them forth into act and view.</p>
               <p n="11">11. IF regeneration, agreeable to the import of the metaphor, be an <hi>inſtantaneous</hi> act or operation of the holy Spirit upon the ſoul, producing a radical, eſſential change in its temper, giving it a new principle of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, a general divine bent and tendency:—And if ſanctification and mortification are only effects of this new and divine principle of life, carrying on a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conflict and warfare againſt the corruptions of nature, and a gradually ſtrengthening and confirming the habits of virtue and holineſs;—then may we very eaſily and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally account for an <hi>imperfect Chriſtian</hi> going directly to heaven, at death, without the neceſſity of any <hi>interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate purgatorial</hi> ſufferings to fit him for that world of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect purity. The ſoul, from the moment of its regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, was holy, and was defiled only in conſequence of its union with a corrupt bodily nature, with which it was carrying on a continual warfare. In the moment of death, it was releaſed from this corrupt bodily nature, and ſprung, immaculate, to its kindred ſpirits, and its native heaven. The grave is a furnace which will <hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Subject continued. <hi>The corrupt, grulty, loſt and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs State of Man before Converſion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THE ſcripture evidence of the wretched ſtate of man <hi>by nature,</hi> is very extenſive. Among a vaſt multitude of ſcriptures, the following may be conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Pſal. li. 5. Eph. ii. 1, 3. Job xiv. 4. Pſal. xiv. 1—3. Jer. xvii. 9. Iſa. lxiv. 6. Rom. vii. 14, to the end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. CHRIST is ſaid to have come as a phyſician to the <hi>ſick,</hi> and to ſeek that which was <hi>loſt.</hi> The prodigal is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>loſt,</hi> and his converſion is termed a <hi>coming to himſelf,</hi> a <hi>being found,</hi> and a <hi>coming again to life.</hi> Converſion is termed a <hi>new birth,</hi> a <hi>new creation;</hi> and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, before converſion, are ſaid to be <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> The unconverted man is ſaid, <hi>not to receive the things of the Spirit of</hi> GOD; <hi>they are fooliſhneſs to him,</hi> neither <hi>can he know them.</hi> Converſion is repreſented as a work of great power; ſuch as GOD exerted in Chriſt when he raiſed him up from the dead.</p>
               <p n="3">3. FROM all theſe ſcripture repreſentations we may infer the exceeding <hi>helpleſſneſs</hi> of ſinners, in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſtate. A dead perſon hath no power to riſe. We cannot come to Chriſt unleſs the Father draw us. We cannot think a good thought. All our ſufficiency is of GOD, who muſt work in us both to will and to do; and without Chriſt we can do nothing. We cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014137_0013_0F97D45F773F2C58"/>without the Spirit: But the Spirit is the Father's free gift in Chriſt. He muſt open our eyes before we can <hi>ſee,</hi> and create us anew in Chriſt Jeſus before we can <hi>ſpiritually live</hi> and <hi>act.</hi> Faith is the firſt grace acted by a converted Chriſtian; and yet this faith we cannot act of ourſelves, <hi>it is the gift of</hi> GOD. We are naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and diſinclined to good before our converſion, and <hi>here</hi> lies our helpleſſneſs, until God by his quickening Spirit gives life to our ſouls, and enables us to will and to do, and creates us anew in Chriſt Jeſus to good works.</p>
               <p n="4">4. FROM <hi>reaſon, obſervation</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> we have the following evidences of this truth: (1.) We know good and evil by our natural conſcience; yet we find in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a ſtrong diſinclination to the good which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and a prevailing inclination to the evil which we diſapprove.—(2.) We know that we are very unlike GOD, and that we do not cordially love and chuſe him and his laws: But GOD could not form creatures with ſuch a temper: This therefore proves, that we are now degenerated from our firſt ſtate, and become corrupt creatures.—(3.) If children come into the world ſuch as we may ſuppoſe that God firſt created man, <hi>i. e. holy,</hi> and with a <hi>propenſity to good,</hi> or even in a ſtate of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to good and evil; ſome would ſurely be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from the womb upwards; ſome would ſurely follow the good principle of their nature, eſpecially as <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> lie on that ſide; but univerſal obſervation and experience prove the contrary, as well as the word of GOD<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. liii. 1,—3. Rom iii. 10, &amp;c.</note>.—(4.) If men were not born corrupt and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, a virtuous and religious education would bring all who are bleſſed with it over to the ſide of virtue, in ſpite of evil example: But do we not plainly ſee that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are backward to imitate good examples, and prone to follow bad ones? They greedily ſuck in evil advice and the knowledge of wicked things; but it requires
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014137_0014_0F97D4603433B948"/>much labour to bring them to learn good; they alſo quickly forget it, and we plainly ſee that their heart is ſtill corrupt and ſtrongly inclined to vice, in ſpite of all the antidotes we can inſtil into their minds againſt it.— (5.) If we attentively examine our own hearts, lives and experiences but for <hi>one day,</hi> we ſhall have an overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conviction of our dreadful corruption. How readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do we forget GOD? How averſe are our minds to the contemplation of him and his perfections? How little do we think of the love of Chriſt? We read or hear with unconcern, the amazing ſtory of his love, and feel little or no gratitude for it. Our memories, our thoughts, our meditations, the general bent and tenour of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſions, even our religious duties, and our very beſt works, may convince us of the wretchedneſs of our ſtate by nature.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="1">1. THOUGH GOD hath reſerved in his own hands the great work of Converſion, as his <hi>own proper work,</hi> and we cannot therefore convert ourſelves; yet we ought not to ſay that we can do nothing. GOD hath given to unconverted ſinners a great deal of important work to do, and put it in their power to do it;—hath obliged them by commands, perſuaded them by exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, awed them by threatenings, engaged them by motives, encouraged them by promiſes, and given them reaſon to expect that he will meet with them and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them in the performance of this work. He hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo laid their help on one who is mighty to ſave.</p>
               <p n="2">2. ALTHOUGH unconverted ſinners are <hi>ſpiritually dead,</hi> yet they are not <hi>naturally ſo.</hi> They have an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a will and a memory: They may know ſomething of their guilt and danger: They may underſtand ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt and his ſaving deſign: They may read and hear, think and meditate on GOD'S word; frequent his houſe, and attend his ordinances. But if ſinners will not do theſe things, they will not do what they <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>are able</hi> to do, and therefore are inexcuſable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A DISPENSATION of GOD'S Spirit attends his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and he hath promiſed to give his Spirit to them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014137_0016_0F97D461B68C9598"/>that aſk him; to <hi>all</hi> that aſk him, without limitation or reſerve. He hath even made it the duty of ſinners to aſk this Spirit, and to attend diligently on divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which are the walks of the Spirit. Now, if ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners know that they cannot be converted without this Spirit, and that they cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven, unleſs they are converted; and if, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they know this, they do not diligently aſk it of GOD, nor attend on thoſe inſtrumental duties and means of grace, in the uſe of which this Spirit is diſpenſed, then they are wholly to blame for continuing uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. GOD is following ſinners with the common influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and operations of his Spirit; ſtriving with them, and ſeeking admittance into their hearts.

The ſcriptures expreſsly preclude them<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xviii. 3. Luck xiii. 5.

               <p n="2">2. THEY ſhould labour to obtain a deep ſenſe of the danger and miſery of an unconverted ſtate: of the evil and guilt of ſin, and of the torments to which it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably expoſe the unconverted ſinner, who dies in his iniquities.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THEY ſhould frequently conſider the ſhortneſs and uncertainty of the <hi>preſent life,</hi> which is their <hi>only working day,</hi> their only <hi>period of trial</hi> and preparation for eternity, and that death will ſhortly put an end to all their <hi>hope, help</hi> and <hi>endeavours;</hi> and therefore, as they value ſalvation, they ſhould not delay converſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEY ſhould labour for a deep, convictive ſenſe of their own inability to convert themſelves, and that they muſt periſh for ever unleſs GOD help them, and that ſpeedily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THEY ſhould endeavour after a thorough and firm perſuaſion, that there is <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>help</hi> for them in GOD, and that they <hi>may,</hi> and aſſuredly <hi>will,</hi> obtain the grace of converſion, if they take the right method, and labour diligently in ſeeking it. They ſhould ſet it before them
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014137_0018_0F97D4633606DB38"/>in firm purpoſe and reſolution, as a ſettled and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed point, that by the help of GOD, they <hi>will</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and that they will never give over ſeeking the bleſſing, in all the appointed means of grace, until they find it; ſaying with <hi>Jacob,</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. THEY ſhould <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>reſolutely</hi> ſet about deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of know ſin, and every tempting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion and amuſement, and attempt the performance of every known duty, as well as they are able, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; uncertain how quickly death may cut them off in their ſins, and fruſtrate all purpoſes of future amendment.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ALL this ſhould be attempted <hi>in the ſtrength of</hi> GOD, through Chriſt, aſſuredly depending <hi>on,</hi> and confiding <hi>in</hi> his help in the way of duty, and perpetually keeping up a deep ſenſe of their own impotence; that all their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of GOD, and that, of themſelves, they can do nothing; but all things, Chriſt ſtrengthening them.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THEY ſhould <hi>inſtantly</hi> and <hi>forthwith</hi> make choice of GOD for their portion and bleſſedneſs, and attempt to enter into ſolemn covenant with him through Chriſt. They ſhould bring themſelves back to him as returning prodigals; give <hi>themſelves, their intereſt,</hi> and all their <hi>powers</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> up to him, as his long-abuſed proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſubmit to him in all things.</p>
               <p n="9">9. THEY ſhould attempt <hi>daily</hi> and <hi>perpetually</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt, by faith, in all his ſaving offices, giving up their polluted, diſeaſed ſouls into his hands as their compaſſionate Phyſician and Redeemer; aſſuredly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that he will in no wiſe caſt them out or reject them, and firmly truſting both his power and his grace.</p>
               <p n="10">10. IF, in the courſe of theſe endeavours, the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart riſes up againſt theſe duties, and the <hi>world</hi> and the <hi>devil</hi> tempt the ſinner to ſlight them as <hi>needleſs,</hi> or to neglect them as <hi>impoſſible,</hi> or <hi>too ſevere,</hi> (which will doubtleſs be often the caſe) it would be the wiſeſt courſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014137_0019_0F97D463F50BAE70"/>for the perſon, thus tempted, to flee inſtantly to GOD, by prayer, for ſuccour, and to get the temptation remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One earneſt look unto GOD, upon ſuch occaſions, has been found by experience, to bring more ſtrength into the ſoul, and to be more efficacious againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, than all the human reaſoning and reſolutions in the world. However, it is the duty of the ſinner to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the temptation <hi>by all means,</hi> and <hi>with all his might;</hi> and it would be wiſe, beforehand, to be always expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch trials, and to be pre-engaging the almighty aid againſt the hour of temptation.</p>
               <p n="11">11.

               <p n="1">1. WHATEVER characters the ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent as under an impoſſibility of entering into the kingdom of heaven, are certainly to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014137_0020_0F97D464B4E64838"/>among the unconverted. Such are <hi>all unbelievers</hi> and <hi>in penitent ſinners;</hi>—all habitual fornicators, adulterers, unclean, thieves, covetous, drunkards, revilers, extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, idolaters, envious, malicious perſons, ſtrife-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſowers of ſedition, and the like<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi. 9, 10. Cal. v. 19—21. Eph. v. 5, &amp;c. Rev. xxi. 8. Mark xvi. 10.</note>. Yet it ſhould be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="2">2. THAT in order to pronounce men unconverted, we muſt ſuppoſe them under the dominion of theſe ſins, and to be living cuſtomarily and habitually in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them: Which will appear from their committing them <hi>freely,</hi> and with <hi>delight; frequently; pleading for them; palliating</hi> and <hi>extenuating</hi> them, and hating to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and reproved on account of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. MEN who continue wilfully ignorant of their chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty, and careleſs about it (which may be known by their undervaluing, deſpiſing and neglecting the means of knowledge and of grace) are certainly in an unconverted ſtate. All church-neglecters come under this predicament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. MEN who are careleſs of their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> and give themſelves little trouble about their <hi>hidden ſins</hi> and <hi>heart-plagues,</hi> notwithſtanding they may be pretty careful and conſcientious in the outward part of moral and religious duties, are certainly unconverted: For, where there is true grace, it turns the eye inward to the heart, and the true convert is moſt watchful againſt hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den corruptions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THOSE who neglect the duties of <hi>ſecret prayer, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and <hi>ſelf-examination,</hi> although they may be ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly punctual in attending the public ordinances of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are certainly unconverted: For, ſecret duties, more eſpecially <hi>ſecret prayer,</hi> is the <hi>firſt,</hi> the <hi>continued,</hi> and the <hi>laſt</hi> duty of the converted ſoul.</p>
               <p n="6">6. WANT <hi>of reliſh</hi> for <hi>holy actions,</hi> and <hi>religious duties;</hi> a <hi>diſtaſte</hi> to them; a deſire that they were not neceſſary,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014137_0021_0F97D46739A08C58"/>and a being pleaſed with any excuſe to get rid of them, are very ſure ſigns of an unconverted ſtate; more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when this diſreliſh for holineſs is accompanied with an inordinate deſire of, and hankering after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyments and ſenſual pleaſures.</p>
               <p n="7">7. MEN, who upon impartial examination, find that they are no better than they were many years ago, but rather more vicious and depraved, have all the reaſon in the world to paſs an unfavourable judgment on their ſtate: For grace is of a growing nature, and where it is, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries forward the ſoul progreſſively to higher attainments in virtue and holineſs.</p>
               <p n="8">8. MEN who have freely indulged vice in their youth, and can remember no time ſince when they were greatly humbled before GOD for their youthful luſts; greatly exerciſed about deliverance from their guilt and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and made to abandon them with indignation; and who are not very ſenſible of ſome remarkable change for the better, both in their hearts and lives, may certainly conclude that they are yet in <hi>the gall of bitterneſs.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. THE unconverted are enemies to GOD by wicked works; full of natural antipathy and enmity againſt his being, nature, will and laws. The principle which prevails in their hearts, would naturally lead them to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014137_0023_0F97D468753FED70"/>dethrone and deſtroy the bleſſed GOD, if they had the power,—And being ſuch, GOD is a conſuming fire to them: His nature and all his laws are againſt them, and ſo are alſo all his perfections, except his mercy, which indeed waits a while to be gracious; but, being abuſed and ſlighted, will in the end aggravate their guilt and miſery.</p>
               <p n="5">5. SUCH continue under the guilt of all the ſins they ever have committed.

Every night they lie down, there is even ſomething more than a poſſibility, that before the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's light, they may lift up their eyes, being in torments.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THEY have no covenant right or title to any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they enjoy. Every bleſſing they enjoy has the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>curſe</hi> to them, in the manner in which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and uſe it.

               <p n="8">8. IF they were perfectly known, their caſe would be pitied, and their nature hated, by every good perſon on earth. And the angels and other holy ſpirits, ſo far as they know them, do thus regard them.</p>
               <p n="9">9. IF ſuch did thoroughly know their own wretched and perilous condition, they could not poſſibly enjoy one moment's peace, tranquility or happineſs in this life.

               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.)

(2.) THE <hi>bare profeſſion,</hi> even of a <hi>true religion,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpecious, is not converſion: Elſe all the profeſſors of a true religion would be <hi>true converts;</hi> which we know is far from being the caſe in fact. Much leſs,</p>

               <p n="4">(4.) STRONG convictions of ſin, and great fear of GOD'S wrath, cannot, of themſelves, prove a ſinner to be truly converted.

A MAN'S really renouncing and abandoning ſome ſin or ſins, to which he has been addicted, cannot prove him a true convert, while he continues in the love and practice of other ſins. <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly, and did many things in obedience to his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which were not much againſt his natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but would by no means part with his beloved luſt, his darling <hi>Herodias</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark vi. 20, 23.</note>. Men do many things of this kind from meer prudential motives, and becauſe theſe ſins are deſtructive of their health, intereſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation:

               <p n="7">(7.) A MAN'S ſhewing remarkable zeal in religion, is no certain proof that he is a true convert, or a real Chriſtian. Zeal is either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> according to the <hi>objects</hi> about which it is employed, the <hi>motives</hi> from which it originates, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> with which it is exerciſed. If zeal be <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> it can hardly exceed in the meaſure of it; for it is always good to be zealouſly affected in a good thing<note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 18.</note>: But a <hi>blind, ignorant</hi> and <hi>miſguided</hi> zeal, is the moſt furious, miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive of all the paſſions. The apoſtles knew not what manner of ſpirit they were of, when in a paroxiſm of their frantic zeal, they called for fire from heaven to deſtroy the <hi>Samaritans</hi>

               <p n="2">2.

<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014137_0027_0F97D46B7541DD88"/>feel itſelf expoſed to eternal miſery; that it is <hi>helpleſs</hi> and <hi>lying at undeſerved mercy,</hi> and that it <hi>muſt periſh,</hi> if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not <hi>this mercy.</hi>—(2.) By ſuch a ſenſe of the evil of ſin, as cauſes the ſoul to abhor it, and to wiſh above all things to be freed from its dominion and pollution.— (3.) By ſuch a ſenſe of the depravity and badneſs of the ſinner's heart, as makes him ſee the neceſſity of its being changed by divine grace, and makes him wiſh, above all things to be truly regenerated.—(4.) By ſuch a ſenſe of the ſinner's inability to change his own heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as makes him feel that it never can be done, unleſs GOD is pleaſed to take the work wholly into his own hands.—(5.) By ſuch a ſenſe of the ſinner's <hi>need of Chriſt,</hi> as makes him ſee his help in him alone, ſo as earneſtly to deſire to embrace him; to be united to him, and found in him:—And <hi>finally,</hi> by ſuch a ſight and ſenſe of the power and grace of Chriſt, his all-ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ſave unto the uttermoſt, and his fulneſs and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to all the ſinner's wants and deſires, as engages the ſinner, as a <hi>loſt, ſin-ſick, periſhing</hi> creature, to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf chearfully into the hands of this glorious, compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Redeemer, with a full and unſhaken confidence, that he will work the great ſalvation <hi>in him</hi> and <hi>for him,</hi> and give him a complete victory over every enemy.</p>

               <p n="2">2. THE converted ſoul knows and ſees GOD in quite a different manner from what was uſual.

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, it could obſerve his wondrous works and adorable providences, without conſidering GOD in them: But now the whole world ſeems full of GOD; GOD appears more or leſs to the ſoul in every work, in every provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in every mercy, and in every affliction: and the ſoul ſees and approves his <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>beauty,</hi> his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſdom,</hi> his <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> in all; is charmed with theſe manifeſtations of him, and follows hard after him as its <hi>only</hi> and <hi>all-ſufficient portion.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. JUSTIFICATION no where in ſcripture ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a ſinner's being <hi>made righteous;</hi> but it every where ſignifies his being <hi>eſteemed, manifeſted,</hi> or <hi>pronounced</hi> righteous.</p>

3. JUSTIFICATION is a forenſic or law-term, oppoſed to <hi>condemnation.</hi> Now condemnation never ſignifies the <hi>making of men guilty,</hi> but only <hi>pronouncing them ſo;</hi> in like manner, juſtification never ſignifies making men holy, but only declaring them to be ſuch in the eye of the law.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE are ſaid to be juſtified by the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs: Now, to <hi>impute,</hi> is to eſteem any character or quality to belong to a perſon as his.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A THING may be imputed to a perſon, which was always his own: So <hi>ſin</hi> is imputed to a ſinner, when he is treated as an offender; in like manner, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> is juſtly imputed to a perſon, who has always obeyed the law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. A THING, <hi>quality</hi> or <hi>character</hi> may alſo be imputed to a perſon, which was not <hi>always</hi> or <hi>originally</hi> his own, but is only eſteemed to belong to him, in the eye of the law: Thus, a debt is imputed to the <hi>ſurety,</hi> and his payment of it is imputed to the <hi>debtor,</hi> and reckoned <hi>his act</hi> and <hi>deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. THIS ſeems to be the proper notion of <hi>imputation</hi> in the preſent doctrine. Chriſt as our ſurety, has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to <hi>pay our debts,</hi> i. e. <hi>to atone for our ſins.</hi> Our ſins are, therefore, imputed to him, and accordingly he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for them, as though they had been his own: And his righteouſneſs is freely and graciouſly imputed to us, if we are indeed believers, ſo that we may plead it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD as <hi>our juſtifying righteouſneſs:</hi> And <hi>therefore</hi> it is that GOD juſtifies and acquits us as righteous, even for the ſake of his dear Son's righteouſneſs, which we accept and plead by faith.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As <hi>ſinners</hi> we may be ſaid to owe a <hi>double</hi> or <hi>twofold debt</hi> to GOD, which muſt be paid before we can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. We owe him <hi>perfect obedience</hi> to the law, through the whole of our lives; and <hi>this</hi> would indeed juſtify us, if we were innocent creatures, and did perfectly fulfil
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014137_0037_0F97D4746F072B58"/>this condition of the firſt covenant: But being now <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> we owe the debt of <hi>eternal puniſhment,</hi> and the debt of <hi>perfect obedience</hi> alſo, (our obligations to which, as the creatures and ſubjects of GOD, can never be cancelled:) Now, we are equally unable to pay <hi>either</hi> of theſe debts. As the puniſhment which we owe is <hi>eternal,</hi> we muſt be <hi>ever</hi> paying it, and never ſhall have paid off the ſcore. No moment ſhall arrive in the courſe of eternal durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when we ſhall be able to ſay, <hi>This debt is paid.</hi> And as to the <hi>other debt</hi> of <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> the payment of it becomes impoſſible to thoſe who have <hi>once ſinned;</hi> ſeeing that obedience can never be <hi>perfect,</hi> in which there is <hi>one failure</hi> or <hi>defect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. SINNERS being therefore <hi>thus incapable</hi> and <hi>inſolvent,</hi> Chriſt <hi>undertook for them</hi> as their <hi>ſurety;—firſt, by ſuffering,</hi> to pay the debt of puniſhment due for their ſins; and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> by his <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>ſinleſs obedience</hi> to the law of GOD, from his birth to his death, he hath wrought out for them a complete righteouſneſs, anſwering every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the law; and thus he is become THE LORD THEIR RIGHTEOUSNESS<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               <p n="10">10. THE righteouſneſs which is imputed to believers for their juſtification, is not the <hi>perſonal</hi> righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as <hi>man;</hi> nor his <hi>eſſential</hi> righteouſneſs, as GOD; but his <hi>ſuretiſhip</hi> righteouſneſs, as GOD-<hi>man Mediator;</hi> and is the whole of his <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>ſufferings,</hi> from his birth to his death, which he performed in the room and ſtead of believers.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The Doctrine of Juſtification, through the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, continued.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1. IN the doctrine of juſtification, by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, we are not to apprehend GOD as miſtaking our real characters, and eſteeming us perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous, when indeed we are not: On the contrary, he conſiders us as being juſt what we are, <hi>poor, ſinful men,</hi> who have fulfilled the demands of his law, only by the obedience of our ſurety.</p>
               <p n="2">2. NOR ought we to eſteem ourſelves the <hi>more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> or <hi>worthy,</hi> on account of our being thus juſtified, but as unworthy and hell-deſerving as ever: Conſequently, this doctrine is ſo far from miniſtring to ſpiritual pride, that, when rightly underſtood, it muſt tend greatly to humble the juſtified believer; ſeeing thoſe who are <hi>thus juſtified,</hi> are ſtill <hi>ungodly</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 5.</note>.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to none but <hi>true believers; i. e.</hi> ſuch as have truly received Chriſt, and are united to him by faith: For, in thus receiving him, we receive his <hi>perſon, offices</hi> and <hi>benefits,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> which is one of thoſe benefits, <hi>freely</hi> offered in the goſpel to all who will accept it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS righteouſneſs is not imputed to a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has faith, nor is the imputation of it delayed till the fruits of faith appear; but the moment a ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, it is imputed to him, and he is juſtified<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 24, 25.</note>.</p>
               <p n="5">5. BUT that this doctrine may appear in a ſtill more <hi>clear, convictive</hi> and <hi>unexceptionable</hi> point of light: (1.) It
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014137_0039_0F97D47580C65D40"/>is evident, that man is naturally and neceſſarily under law to GOD; and this is equally true of all created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. (2.) Some kind of righteouſneſs is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to man's juſtification. (3.) That righteouſneſs which juſtifies man, muſt be ſuch as anſwers to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that law under which man is. (4.) The law was at firſt given to man for <hi>two diſtinct</hi> ends; <hi>firſt,</hi> To ſignify GOD'S will, enjoined by his authority for the rule of man's duty; and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> As a covenant between GOD and man, according to which, man was to expect life or death eternal, as he <hi>ſhould</hi> or <hi>ſhould not</hi> fulfil the terms of it. Now, this law, in the <hi>laſt</hi> ſenſe of it, is abrogated by the bringing in of a <hi>better covenant;</hi> but in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſe, the law, as a <hi>rule of duty, obliging to obedience,</hi> is of perpetual obligation. In <hi>this ſenſe,</hi> Chriſt came to <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the law,</hi> and has incorporated it into his goſpel, in its utmoſt purity, as the <hi>law of his kingdom,</hi> and the <hi>rule of his ſubjects.</hi> It is therefore a righteouſneſs anſwerable to the demands of <hi>this law,</hi> which alone can juſtify us. But,</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) WE can have no ſuch righteouſneſs of our own; nor can any creature provide ſuch a righteouſneſs for us: And it is expreſsly declared by the Apoſtle, <q>That by the deeds of the law, no fleſh living ſhall be juſtified<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 3.—iii. 20, 28. Gal. ii. 16.—iii. 21.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">(6.) THE law, an obedience to which the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes from having any ſhare in our juſtification, is not merely the <hi>ceremonial law,</hi> as ſome have imagined, but the <hi>moral law</hi> alſo:—That law, by which is the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 20.—vii. 7.</note>:—That law which was <hi>ordained to life</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 10.—x. 5.</note>:— That law, by the breach of which the whole world was condemned, and from the curſe of which Chriſt came to deliver us<note n="‖" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 19.

                  <note n="**" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 31.</note>; all
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:014137_0040_0F97D42074A35F50"/>which deſcriptions, are applicable <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>moral law. Abraham</hi> is declared to have been juſtified <hi>by faith alone,</hi> without works done in obedience to <hi>any law</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iv. 2, 3.</note>; and the Apoſtle expreſsly excludes <hi>works of every kind</hi> from our juſtification<note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 8, 9. Rom. ii. 6.</note>.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) No ſuch NEW LAW <hi>of goſpel ſincerity</hi> (taking in <hi>faith, repentance</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> though <hi>imperfect,</hi> obedience, as the ground of our juſtification under the <hi>new covenant,</hi> inſtead of perfect obedience under <hi>the old</hi>) has ever been given by GOD as the term of our pardon and acceptance: For, if we were juſtified before GOD by ſuch a <hi>patchwork, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> righteouſneſs as this, two abſurdities would follow: —<hi>Firſt,</hi> GOD muſt be ſuppoſed to abate in the demands of his law, in favour of our corruptions; and, if GOD could abate <hi>any thing</hi> of the perfection of his law, he might abate <hi>more;</hi> yea, he might cancel its obligations altogether. In that caſe, Chriſt lived and died in vain, who lived and died to <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> the law; and mankind might have been redeemed and ſaved without his <hi>atonement</hi> and <hi>mediation!—Secondly,</hi> We are then ſtill under a <hi>covenant of works,</hi> and <hi>live</hi> by <hi>doing:</hi> For, let the work be <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>imperfect,</hi> it will ſtill be a <hi>covenant of works,</hi> ſo long as <hi>works</hi> are the <hi>condition of it!</hi>—Both of which are expreſsly contrary to the doctrine of the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) WE cannot poſſibly be juſtified by the <hi>works,</hi> or <hi>merit,</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of any <hi>mere creature,</hi> however holy or dignified; none being able to pay more than that righteouſneſs which he himſelf owes, as a creature, to the law of GOD: For creatures are obliged to employ all their powers, talents and faculties in the ſervice of their Creator; and when they have done all that they are commanded, and all that they can, they have done on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their duty; and therefore can, properly ſpeaking, merit nothing for other creatures<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xvii. 9, 10.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:014137_0045_0F97D478F58A2D40"/>
3. THE firmeſt foundation of human faith, is, when a number of men, of good character and competent judges of the matter which they teſtify, perfectly agree in their teſtimony;—when they lay down their lives in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, without any view of intereſt in propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a falſehood;—and when numbers, who are declared enemies to their teſtimony, yet confeſs the principal matters of it. On this foundation ſtands our belief of the truth of Chriſtianity, ſo far as it is a <hi>matter of fact,</hi> which recommends itſelf to our underſtandings by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. DIVINE faith reſts on the teſtimony of that GOD, who can neither <hi>be deceived himſelf</hi> nor <hi>deceive us;</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>infallibly true.</hi> Wherefore, whenever we come to be aſſured that GOD hath <hi>revealed</hi> or <hi>declared</hi> any thing or doctrine, we are as certain of its truth, as that GOD liveth; however <hi>myſterious</hi> or <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> the doctrine or matter revealed may appear to our <hi>limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, finite underſtandings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. HUMAN teſtimony is, in its own nature, <hi>fallible,</hi> becauſe it is the teſtimony of a creature, <hi>whoſe perfections are limited,</hi> and who may poſſibly be <hi>miſtaken, deceived, lie</hi> or <hi>repent:</hi> Yet human teſtimony may, in ſome caſes, be ſo circumſtanced, as to give the <hi>higheſt degree</hi> of <hi>moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. IF it be true, that we ought to <hi>have reaſon</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what we do believe; or, that we ought to believe <hi>only upon ſufficient evidence,</hi> it will follow, that every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever of Chriſtianity ſhould endeavour to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the evidences of the truth of Chriſtianity, both <hi>external</hi> and <hi>internal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. THIS <hi>general faith</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi> of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures, includes in it a <hi>particular faith</hi> of every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular

            <p n="9">9.

            <p n="10">10.

            <p n="11">11. THE neceſſity of the <hi>conſent of the will;</hi>—the act of <hi>truſt</hi> or <hi>reliance,</hi> as it is called, or the <hi>application of the promiſe,</hi> is, by no means denied: But this I would rather conſider as the <hi>fruit of faith,</hi> than as <hi>faith itſelf.</hi>

            <p n="13">13. TRUE and <hi>ſaving</hi> faith begins in the belief of GOD, his <hi>providence</hi> and his <hi>word,</hi> and terminates and fixes on <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his righteouſneſs,</hi> as the <hi>great, ſaving object</hi> therein exhibited.</p>

2. IN all covenants between men, there is a <hi>parity</hi> or ſome kind of <hi>equality</hi> between the parties contracting; and by reaſon of that natural liberty, which is the inviolable, unalienable privilege of every human creature, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his fellow-men, the <hi>contract, ſtipulation,</hi> or <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to be <hi>free</hi> and with <hi>full conſent,</hi> and the terms and conditions of the covenant, ſuch as both parties ſhall mutually conſent to. So that the moſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified or powerful mortal, can have no right to force any conditions upon his fellow-men, or bind them to any duties, which they do not freely and voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to; only upon this proviſo, that they have by ſome crime, <hi>forfeited their natural liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is the moſt aſtoniſhing act of condeſcenſion, that ever GOD vouchſafed, to enter into covenant with man, as <hi>his creature,</hi> and much more, as his <hi>ſinful, obnoxious creature.</hi> As his <hi>creature</hi> and <hi>natural ſubject,</hi> it was ſufficient that GOD gave to man <hi>a law,</hi> with <hi>a penalty:</hi> As a <hi>ſinful creature,</hi> and <hi>rebellious ſubject,</hi> man had no right to expect any thing elſe but puniſhment, without any covenant-privileges or mercies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. GOD, when he created man a moral agent, did, in the ſtate of his innocence, enter into a covenant with him, the equitable terms of which were, <q>
                     <hi>Do,</hi> and <hi>live;</hi>— <hi>tranſgreſs,</hi> and <hi>die.</hi>
                  </q> Man had power to keep this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of life; but if he tranſgreſſed it, there was no proviſion made in the covenant of <hi>pardon</hi> for tranſgreſſors, or of <hi>new ſtrength to obey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. WHEN man had broke the firſt covenant, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all title, not only to GOD'S <hi>covenant goodneſs,</hi> but even to mercy,—(wonderful <hi>grace!</hi>) GOD was pleaſed to enter again into covenant with man. And this laſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is well termed a <hi>covenant of grace;</hi> becauſe it is founded on the <hi>free, undeſerved</hi> grace of GOD, and the merits of the Redeemer;—and becauſe GOD'S grace and Spirit are ſtipulated in it, to enable man to riſe from his fallen
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014137_0049_0F97D47BF414E6A8"/>ſtate, and to give him ſtrength to fulfil the conditions of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. GOD being not only the <hi>Maker</hi> and rightful Lord of man, and infinitely <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> but fallen man having alſo forfeited his life,—GOD, I ſay, has a right to propoſe the covenant to man, and to fix the terms and conditions of it; and it is infinitely right that man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into covenant with his Maker and Redeemer, ſhould be willing to ſign a <hi>charte blanche.</hi> Yet does not GOD force the will of man to conſent to his gracious cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but only propoſes it to him; ſhews him the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and advantage of his complying with it, and <hi>gently moves</hi> him to his duty and intereſt, by the motives of his goſpel and attractions of his holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. GOD'S freely tendering this covenant to ſinners of mankind, is a ſufficient warrant and encouragement for our taking hold of it, and entering into covenant with him; which, without this warrant, would ſeem dreadful preſumption in ſuch <hi>creatures</hi> as we are.</p>
               <p n="8">8. GOD'S part of the covenant is all a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>gracious promiſe</hi> of ſomething which we <hi>do not,</hi> and <hi>cannot</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>deſerve</hi> or <hi>merit</hi> by any thing we can do;—and our part of it is <hi>all duty,</hi> which we were bound to perform antecedently to any covenant promiſe:—And even our <hi>ability</hi> to do this duty, and perform theſe conditions, on which we are entitled to covenant bleſſings, is promiſed and offered in the covenant itſelf. <q>I will be their GOD, and they ſhall be my people.—I will give grace and glory, and no good thing will I withhold from them that walk uprightly.—I will take away the hard and ſtony heart, and will give them an heart of fleſh.—I will write my law on their heart, and put my fear in their inward part—and I will be their GOD, and they ſhall be my people.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. THERE is ſomething very ſingular in all theſe forms of GOD'S covenant, '<hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall.</hi>' In
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014137_0050_0F97D47CB423DEB0"/>all covenants between men, the parties fulfil their own conditions, independently on each other. But GOD not only <hi>propoſes the covenant,</hi> but alſo <hi>gives ſtrength</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> to fulfil the conditions on their part;—puts his Spirit into their hearts; writes his law in their inward part,— and often makes them a <hi>willing people in the day of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> The very covenant itſelf <hi>offers</hi> and <hi>conveys grace</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to fulfil it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. ALTHOUGH we are not properly at liberty whether we ſhall chuſe GOD as our covenant GOD, or enter into covenant with him, or not;—but are obliged both by <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> to do it, and to do it without heſitation or delay; yet our chuſing him, and entering into covenant with him, muſt be a matter of <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>deliberate choice.</hi> 
                  <q>Chuſe ye this day whom ye will ſerve. I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of GOD, that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable to GOD, which is your reaſonable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</q> —GOD will have <hi>our heart;</hi> the approbation of our reaſon and the free and chearful conſent of our mind in this matter,—that it may not be a <hi>conſtrained,</hi> but a <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> ſervice. If he conſtrains any to be thus happy, it is by the conſtraints of his <hi>grace;</hi> making them a <hi>willing people</hi> in the day of his power.</p>
               <p n="11">11. AS ſinners, in a natural ſtate, have neither a reliſh for the promiſes of GOD'S covenant, nor a heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to perform the conditions of it; hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that none but gracious perſons <hi>can</hi> or <hi>will</hi> enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to covenant with GOD; and that all who make a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of doing it, without being previouſly diſpoſed and inclined by GOD'S holy Spirit, are only <hi>hypocrites</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deceivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. WHAT GOD, on his part, offers in this covenant, is <hi>himſelf,</hi> principally and comprehenſively: <q>I will be their GOD.</q> And this includes <hi>all bleſſedneſs</hi> which any creature is capable of enjoying. When GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014137_0051_0F97D47D74175F78"/>to be a GOD to us, he promiſes to be a GOD <hi>all-ſufficient</hi> to us, to be <hi>ours,</hi> in <hi>all his fulneſs,</hi> according to our meaſure and capacity: For, if having this GOD, we are <hi>ſtraitened,</hi> it is not <hi>in him,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſays) but <hi>in ourſelves</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi. 12.</note>; in the <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of our own capacities, not in his <hi>infinite fulneſs.</hi> He undertakes to <hi>be to-us,</hi> and to <hi>do for us,</hi> all that it belongs to him, as an infinitely <hi>wiſe, holy</hi> and <hi>good</hi> GOD, to <hi>be</hi> and to <hi>do,</hi> to his covenant people.</p>
               <p n="13">13. WE may ſee then that <hi>all good</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> is vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſum'd up in this covenant offer and promiſe; <q>I will be your GOD.</q> Accordingly, in other places of ſcripture, GOD, in condeſcenſion to human weakneſs, is more particular and explicit, in this covenant tender:— <q>I will give grace and glory, and no good thing will I with-hold from my covenant people. All are yours. All things ſhall work together for good to them that are in covenant with GOD.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. AS GOD propoſes <hi>himſelf</hi> in all his fulneſs in this covenant, according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>capacities</hi> of his creatures; ſo when he makes his demand from us, of what we, on our part, are to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> in entering into covenant with him, he demands <hi>ourſelves</hi> and <hi>our all, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi> and <hi>without reſerve;</hi> that we ſurrender <hi>ourſelves</hi> and <hi>ours;</hi> whatever we <hi>have, are,</hi> or <hi>can do,</hi> wholly up to his pleaſure and diſpoſal; to do <hi>with us, for us, in us,</hi> and <hi>by us,</hi> juſt what ſeemeth good unto him.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. MEN may be ſaid to enter into covenant with GOD either <hi>indirectly</hi> or <hi>directly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. THE very ſuſtaining of a profeſſion of religion, or appearing not to deny, but rather to avow, that we are the people of GOD, carries in it an implicit acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>covenant tranſaction.</hi> The bulk of whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian nations appear to be thus in covenant with GOD.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN every prayer to GOD, and acknowledgment of his authority over us, and right to diſpoſe of us, there is the <hi>matter of a covenant</hi> with him; and though we may not intend, or directly avow any ſuch thing, yet we do <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>implicitly</hi> give ourſelves to GOD in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and bring ourſelves under the penalty of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, if we do violate or break it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THE moſt ſolemn acts of directly and explicitly entering into covenant with GOD, are—a private ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render and ſelf-dedication of ourſelves to GOD:—The giving up of our children to GOD in baptiſm—and the renewing our baptiſmal covenant at the Lord's table.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A PRIVATE and ſolemn ſurrender and dedication of ourſelves to GOD, through the Redeemer, is one of the earlieſt duties we ſhould perform in religion, after we have come to underſtand the nature of our baptiſmal vows, and the obligations we are under to GOD. Forms of this kind may be met with in many devotional books.</p>

                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:014137_0053_0F97D47EF5214D98"/>
6. THIS kind of covenanting ſhould be performed in a very ſolemn and deliberate manner.</p>
               <p n="7">7. SOMETHING of the ſame nature ought to be done by every communicant, both in his preparation for the Lord's ſupper, and at the ordinance itſelf; wherein an expreſs recognition ſhould be made, of all the principal and eſſential parts of our covenant with God, through the Redeemer.</p>
               <p n="8">8. THE giving up of our children to GOD in baptiſm, is an occaſion upon which we are called to an expreſs cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſurrender of ourſelves, and all that is ours to GOD: We do, at that time, expreſsly acknowledge GOD to be <hi>our</hi> GOD, and offer him our children, in virtue of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which is ſuppoſed to ſubſiſt between GOD and us: And the vows we make for our children, ſuppoſe our own vows of the ſame kind.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Is it not ſurpriſing, that the ſame covenant which we renew with ſo much ſolemnity at the Lord's ſupper, is generally ſo ſuperficially renewed at the baptiſm of the children of moſt Chriſtians?</p>
               <p n="10">10. IF a ſolemn preparation is neceſſary in order to the right renewing of our covenant with GOD at the goſpel ſupper; is it leſs ſo before we give up our children to GOD in baptiſm? Is not <hi>equal ſolemnity, ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>devotion</hi> neceſſary on both occaſions?</p>

            <p>AS our great buſineſs in this ordinance is to call into lively and grateful remembrance, the painful and ignominious death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014137_0054_0F97D47FB4A94ED8"/>keep up this remembrance of it in the church and world: —As we are led to remember it not only as a <hi>confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of his doctrines,</hi> but alſo as <hi>a ſacrifice of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for the ſins of the world, and for our ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as the higheſt and deareſt pledge of his and his Father's love to us, and the ſweeteſt and ſureſt ground of our hope, as believing ſinners:—And as our principal buſineſs at this ſacrament, (this feaſt upon a ſacrifice) is ſolemnly to <hi>enter into,</hi> and <hi>renew our covenant with</hi> GOD, over theſe dear memorials of his Son's death—over theſe ſigns and ſeals of the blood of the everlaſting covenant: —In which ſolemn tranſaction we do profeſs to take and avouch GOD, to be our GOD—and to become his people, according to the terms of the covenant. I have thought it might be exceeding proper and uſeful upon theſe occaſions, to rehearſe and repeat at large the form of a ſolemn covenant tranſaction, as it ought to be made, in ſubſtance, by every communicant, <hi>at</hi> or <hi>before</hi> this ſacrament.</p>
            <p>I SHALL therefore put this form of covenanting with GOD, in the <hi>firſt</hi> perſon of the <hi>ſingular</hi> number—that every one of us may, upon this occaſion, uſe it <hi>for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and make it <hi>his own.</hi>

            <p>LET me therefore beſeech each of my fellow-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants, as in the immediate preſence of the GOD of heaven, and over the memorials of his Son's ſacrifice— and as, on this ſolemn occaſion, about to enter into and renew covenant with GOD, to let their hearts and thoughts go along with this form of a ſolemn covenant tranſaction, and cordially and deliberately to make it <hi>their own covenant;</hi>—each ſaying in his heart with me, and ſaying it <hi>ſincerely</hi> and <hi>feelingly.</hi>

            <head>ESSAY VI. <hi>The</hi> NATURE, DESIGN, <hi>and</hi> USE <hi>of the</hi> LORD'S SUPPER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. SACRAMENTS are ſolemn ordinances inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt, <hi>repreſenting, ſealing</hi> and <hi>applying</hi> Chriſt, and his purchaſed benefits to the ſouls of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE are <hi>two</hi> ſuch in the New Teſtament, <hi>viz. baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's ſupper,</hi> anſwering to <hi>circumciſion</hi> and the <hi>paſcal lamb</hi> in the Old Teſtament diſpenſation of the covenant of grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THESE ſacraments are inſtitutions of a poſitive, and not of a moral nature; deriving all their worth from the authority which enjoins them, and as binding upon us as any moral duties whatever.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THESE goſpel ſacraments are not burthenſome, expenſive and laborious; but cheap and eaſy, and yet of uſeful ſignificancy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. BAPTISM fitly repreſents our need of being <hi>waſhed by the blood,</hi> and <hi>ſanctified by the Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, which are both emblematically ſet forth by the cleanſing, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature of the element of water made uſe of in that ordinance; and it is to be <hi>but once</hi> adminiſtred as an <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ordinance,</hi> on our firſt entering into the church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. AS, in baptiſm, we take upon us the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and ſubmit to the whole religion of Chriſt, we do virtually oblige ourſelves in this ordinance, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Lord's ſupper.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE Lord's ſupper obliges us to the ſame duties as baptiſm, and no more, nor any other: Both are <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>ſeals</hi> of <hi>the ſame covenant.</hi> The ſpecific difference ſeems to lie here: Baptiſm is but <hi>once</hi> adminiſtred as an
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014137_0066_0F97D489823DE210"/>initiatory ordinance;—the Lord's ſupper often, as a ſtrengthening and nouriſhing ordinance: Baptiſm has a more ſpecial reference to the <hi>religion of Chriſt:</hi>—The Lord's ſupper, to CHRIST, the author and founder of it. How falſely then do many baptized Chriſtians imagine themſelves under <hi>fewer obligations</hi> to holineſs, than <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <q>THE Lord's ſupper is a ſacrament, wherein, by giving and receiving bread and wine, according to Chriſt's appointment, his death is ſhewed forth; and the worthy receivers are (not after a corporal and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner, but by faith) made partakers of his body and blood, with all his benefits, to their ſpiritual nouriſhment and growth in grace<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Aſſembly's ſhorter Catechiſm.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. THIS ſacrament is enjoined on all Chriſtians, as a pledge of their duty, obedience and allegiance to Chriſt, the glorious captain of ſalvation; and to keep up in their hearts a grateful remembrance of his dying love.</p>
            <p n="10">10. IT was inſtituted by Chriſt, juſt before his death, after he had eat his laſt paſſover; is enjoined upon his followers by his dying command, and is to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them to the end of the world.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THE <hi>ſpecific nature</hi> and <hi>proper notion</hi> of this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is, <q>A memorial of Chriſt's ſacrifice; or a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the freſh remembrance of his death in the church, together with the cauſe, deſign and benefits of it; all which benefits are ſealed and applied to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in receiving it:</q> 
               <hi>This do in</hi> REMEMBRANCE <hi>of me, and as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do</hi> SHEW FORTH <hi>the Lord's death,</hi> 'TILL HE COME<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi. 23,—29. Luke xxii. 19, 20.</note>.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014137_0067_0F97D48A33F37810"/>
               <hi>guilty, polluted</hi> ſtate by ſin, and of the hope we have of pardon and cleanſing through Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="13">13. IN preparing to receive, and in actually receiving the Lord's ſupper, we are led to conſider the death of Chriſt, on which it is founded, in the following impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and intereſting views—In contradiſtinction to Jews, we are led to conſider the croſs of Chriſt as <hi>his</hi> and <hi>our</hi> glory;—we are led to conſider his death as that of a <hi>martyr</hi> or <hi>witneſs,</hi> to the truth of the doctrines which he taught, and as that of our example living and dying;— and alſo as <hi>a ſacrifice,</hi> by which the ſin of man was expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated: And this ſacrament we are led to conſider, as a <hi>feaſt upon a ſacrifice;</hi> from which view of it, many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſiderations ariſe,—as, (1.) It naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of the evil and accurſed nature of ſin, which needed ſuch an expenſive ſacrifice.—(2.) Of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible love of GOD, who furniſhed ſuch a ſacrifice for the expiation of human guilt.—(3.) As thoſe who <hi>feaſted upon a ſacrifice,</hi> were ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Deity to whom the ſacrifice had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and to be in perfect friendſhip one with another; ſo thus feaſting on the ſacrifice of Chriſt, denotes our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and communion with the Father and the Son, and that we are united together in the ſtricteſt bonds of Chriſtian charity and love.—(4.) This ſacrament being a <hi>feaſt upon a ſacrifice,</hi> we ought to conſider it as a proper form of renewing covenant with GOD, and a ſign and means of our participating in the bleſſings of this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. —(5.) This ſacrament repreſents the death of Chriſt as that of a conqueror, who conquered in dying, and who, by his reſurrection, has ſecured victory for all his followers.—(6.) His death, as repreſented in this ſacrament, ſhould be conſidered as the ground of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, and of that extenſive dominion and power which he now holds in the heavenly world, for the good of his church:—And, (7.) While we here contemplate
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014137_0068_0F97D48AF4A2B370"/>his death, our thoughts ſhould ſpring upward to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified ſtate, and forward, to his ſecond, triumphant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, when we ſhall have reaſon to glory in a once crucified maſter.</p>
            <p n="14">14. THE chief <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> of this ſacrament, is to <hi>perpetuate,</hi> and, as it were, to <hi>eternize</hi> the memory of the love of GOD and of Chriſt to us; to actuate, enkindle and enflame our love and gratitude to them; to bring frequently into our remembrance the moſt powerful motives to univerſal holineſs, and to unite the hearts of Chriſtians in the firmeſt and moſt endearing bonds of love.</p>
            <p n="15">15. NONE ſeem to have a right to this ordinance, in the ſight of GOD, but the <hi>true diſciples of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. NONE have a right to it, in the ſight of men, but ſuch as appear, in a judgment of charity, to be <hi>real Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. NONE therefore ſhould be admitted to it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due, previous examination of their Chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſome evidence of their ſincerity in religion.</p>
            <p n="18">18. THOSE who have been admitted upon miſtaken notions of their ſincerity, may be again excluded, when the church receives proof of ſuch miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="19">19. NO perſon ought to approach this ordinance, without <hi>actual</hi> preparation for it: Though, if they are <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually</hi> ſerious, their actual preparation, (when unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected opportunities of communicating offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) need coſt them but little time or trouble; and, it is a childiſh and a dangerous ſuperſtition, to imagine, that any certain time, or any certain number of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are abſolutely neceſſary in order to our acceptance in this ordinance.</p>

            <p n="1">1. DIVINES ſometimes diſtinguiſh our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſacrament of the ſupper, into <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> and <hi>actual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. HABITUAL preparation ſeems to imply two things; <hi>firſt,</hi> A <hi>gracious ſtate;</hi> and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> A <hi>regular, pious, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IT ſeems evident from the very nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this ordinance, that it belongs only to <hi>true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>real Chriſtians.</hi> It is a nouriſhing ordinance; but ſuch only can be nouriſhed as have <hi>life:</hi> Beſides, the graces of faith, love, hope, &amp;c. which are properly exerciſed in this ordinance, can only be exerciſed by <hi>real, living</hi> Chriſtians. It is a ſolemn renewal of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with GOD; but how can thoſe renew a covenant, which they never entered into at all? How can ſuch as are in league with the devil and their luſts, be ſaid to enter into covenant with GOD? What ſincerity can there be in ſuch a tranſaction as this? Does it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the moſt inſolent, bare-fac'd mockery?</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT implies alſo a <hi>regular, pious, circumſpect</hi> life, ſuch as becometh the goſpel of Chriſt: That a man's life cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond in ſome meaſure with his profeſſion, and the truth and ſincerity of his religion appear viſible, in the genuine and examplary fruits of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THOSE who have <hi>this habitual preparation of ſoul</hi> for holy ordinances, need be under no ſcruple of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord's table upon the ſhorteſt warning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, having the eſſentials of religion, and a habitual
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014137_0070_0F97D48DBAAFC9D8"/>ſeriouſneſs and ſobriety of ſpirit, their ſincere endeavours to pleaſe GOD in the way of commanded duty, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be unacceptable to him, nor unavailable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It would, therefore, be ſinful in ſuch to abſtain from a ſealing ordinance, meerly becauſe they have not had much time to make a formal, actual preparation; becauſe, having already thoſe good diſpoſitions which ſuch a preparation is intended to beget, ſuch a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not abſolutely neceſſary; and not to diſpenſe with it, in ſuch circumſtances, would be ſuperſtition, not religion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. YET where time and opportunity permit, the very beſt men ſhould by no means neglect a careful, actual preparation of ſoul for attending ſo ſolemn an ordinance. For (1.) It is expreſsly commanded: <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xi. 28.</note>. (2.) The buſineſs to be tranſacted at the Lord's table is of a very ſolemn nature: It is no leſs than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into, or renewing covenant with the great GOD, over the memorials of his Son's ſacrifice:—And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever conſiders what kind of creatures we are; the nature, terms and conditions of the covenant, and how ſolemnly, and circumſpectly every part of it ſhould be tranſacted, and that this is the principal buſineſs of an actual preparation (which ſhould by no means be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected 'till we come to the Lord's table) will ſurely ſee reaſon for ſome time and care in this buſineſs, when we can command it. (3.) The very beſt men are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a proper frame of mind, for the moſt common and ordinary duties of religion: Good men find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take ſome pains with their hearts for the right performance of the duties of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>hearing the word,</hi> and ſurely proportionably more care ſhould be taken in preparing for the ſacrament of the ſupper.</p>

7. ACTUAL preparation conſiſts in a careful endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to put the heart and affections in the beſt frame and poſture poſſible for approaching GOD in this holy ordinance; and is expreſſed in ſcripture, under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral notion of ſelf-examination: <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and <hi>ſo let him eat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE things concerning which we ought principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to examine ourſelves, are our <hi>knowledge, faith, love</hi> or <hi>charity, repentance,</hi> and <hi>new obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. A KNOWLEDGE of <hi>ourſelves,</hi> our <hi>ſins, wants, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, guilt</hi> and <hi>danger;</hi>—a competent knowledge of GOD, his perfections and laws, the obligations we are under to him, and the duties we owe him;—a knowledge of the Saviour, and the way of ſalvation by the new cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; —and a competent knowledge of the ſacrament of the ſupper, the graces there to be exerciſed, and the duties there to be performed, is indiſpenſably neceſſary, in order to our rightly and worthily partaking of the Lord's ſupper; leſt, <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body, we eat and drink judgment to ourſelves</hi>

            <p n="10">10. FAITH in Chriſt, as the <hi>Son,</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> of GOD; and in his power and grace as an all-ſufficient and moſt willing Saviour, is a grace, the exerciſe of which is of abſolute neceſſity in this ordinance; and as there is no receiving or applying of Chriſt, without this grace, it is neceſſary we ſhould examine ourſelves concerning the reality of it, before we approach this ordinance, leſt we ſhould be found <hi>mockers of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As the <hi>euchariſt</hi> or <hi>ſacrament of the ſupper,</hi> is founded on the inconceivable love of GOD and Chriſt, to a loſt world, and is intended as a badge, ſign, means and cement of love and unity among Chriſtian brethren, —love to GOD and <hi>man,</hi> is a grace of abſolute neceſſity in all worthy communicants; and therefore, the truth and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:014137_0072_0F97D48EB51D1F48"/>reality of it in our hearts ſhould be carefully examined into, before we venture to approach this goſpel banquet: For, to approach this <hi>love-feaſt</hi> without <hi>ſupreme love</hi> to GOD, and <hi>cordial affections</hi> for <hi>our fellow-Chriſtians,</hi> or while the contrary temper prevails in the ſoul, would be the vileſt abuſe.</p>
            <p n="12">12. WE have already obſerved, that impenitent ſinners, or thoſe who live allowedly in the courſe or practice of any one known ſin, have no right to this ordinance; and this may ſhew the neceſſity of examining ourſelves of the truth and reality of our <hi>repentance,</hi> in order to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching this ſacrament worthily.</p>
            <p n="13">13. WE can by no means have a ſatisfying evidence of the truth of our <hi>faith, love,</hi> or <hi>repentance,</hi> unleſs we are conſcious, that our lives are bettered and reformed, and that we have been enabled, at leaſt for ſome while paſt, to pay a <hi>new obedience</hi> to the divine laws: For, the only ſatisfying proof we can have of the <hi>truth of our graces,</hi> is the <hi>fruit of holineſs</hi> which they produce in our lives and converſations; and ſo from the goodneſs of the fruit, we rationally infer the goodneſs of the tree. It is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convenient therefore, for all who deſign to approach the ſacrament, to try their ſincerity in religion by this <hi>touchſtone,;</hi> and not raſhly to believe, that they are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the ſacramental graces and qualifications, 'till they feel the energy of them warm at their hearts, and experience the fruits of them, in ſome degree of holineſs of life.</p>
            <p n="14">14. NOT only muſt worthy communicants have theſe graces <hi>in reality;</hi> but the principal deſign of <hi>actual preparation</hi> is to bring them into <hi>lively exerciſe,</hi> by prayer, meditation, ſelf-examination, reading the ſcriptures, and other proper devotional books. By frequent meditations on the heinouſneſs of ſin; the dignity, ſufferings, ſhame and death of Chriſt, who was the atoning ſacrifice for ſin; the wonderful love of GOD in providing ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:014137_0073_0F97D48F744D7B08"/>and freely delivering him up for us all; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable benefits and bleſſings procured for penitent believers by this ſacrifice:—By frequent meditations of this kind, the <hi>faith</hi> of communicants ſhould be increaſed and ſtrengthened; their <hi>love</hi> inflamed; their ſorrow for ſin, indignation againſt it, and repentance of it perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their reſolutions to holy obedience invigorated: So that when they actually approach the Lord's table, theſe graces may not move heavily and aukwardly for want of uſe, as though the chariot wheels of the ſoul were taken off; but in a briſk, lively, active and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manner, like the <hi>chariots of Aminadab;</hi> each acting in its proper ſphere, and all of them harmoniouſly and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="15">15. HENCE may be drawn a powerful argument for the <hi>frequent</hi> receiving of the Lord's ſupper: For, if the right receiving of the Lord's ſupper requires the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous exerciſe of all the nobleſt graces of the Chriſtian religion;—if it is indeed an <hi>epitome</hi> or <hi>ſummary</hi> of the whole of practical Chriſtianity;—if it be neceſſary for thoſe who would worthily receive this ordinance, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on the <hi>chief, vital</hi> doctrines of our holy religion, and to exerciſe its nobleſt graces, by the way of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for this duty.—It may hence be inferred, that the <hi>oftener</hi> we receive this ſacrament aright, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> our ſouls are employed in thoſe divine prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory exerciſes, the more rapidly muſt they grow in knowledge and in grace, and be fitted for every good word and work.</p>
            <p n="16">16. SINCE all the benefit to be reaped from holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, is only to be expected by a <hi>proper preparation</hi> for them, and a due <hi>attendance</hi> on them, it is not at all to be wondered at, that the ſouls of thoſe who receive the ſacrament, without due preparation, do decay and go backwards in religion: For, to triſle with holy things, betrays ſuch an irreverence and atheiſm of heart, as
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:014137_0074_0F97D490350BF4C0"/>muſt needs, in time provoke GOD wholly to withdraw his good Spirit from ſuch triflers, and leave them total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the power of <hi>blindneſs of mind</hi> and <hi>hardneſs of heart.</hi> Hence it often happens, in fact, that <hi>careleſs, untender</hi> and <hi>uncircumſpect</hi> profeſſors of religion, turn out, in the end, <hi>tenfold more reprobate, profligate</hi> and <hi>abandoned,</hi> than other ſinners, who have never thus profaned and abuſed the ſacraments.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. WE ſhould retire as ſoon as poſſible to examine ourſelves, of our frames and exerciſes of mind at this holy ordinance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we find that we have had lively exerciſes of the ſacramental graces, we ſhould humbly and heartily thank GOD for the aids of his Spirit, and importunately beſeech him to continue theſe gracious frames, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us from forfeiting them by freſh acts of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF we find that our frames and affections have been dull, dead, or trifling, we ought attentively to conſider from whence this may have proceeded. If we are conſcious that we have been at due pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our hearts, and that we have indulged no wilful ſin; and if we find that our dullneſs and coldneſs was matter of grief to us at the ordinance, we ought not to be over much dejected, but hope that it may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:014137_0075_0F97D490F5700DC0"/>from bodily indiſpoſition, and that we may have nevertheleſs been accepted. We ſhould alſo beſeech GOD to vouchſafe thoſe comforts now, which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from us at his table, and that he would enable us perſeveringly to ſeek them. But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF we find that this uncomfortable frame has been owing to careleſſneſs, and a want of due preparation on our part, or has proceeded from a conſciouſneſs of guilt from ſome indulged iniquity or unmortified luſt, we ſhould deeply lament ſuch a criminal circumſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD, apply earneſtly to the blood of ſprinkling for cleanſing, and implore the divine pardon and mercy through Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT becomes us immediately after this ordinance, to renew our holy reſolutions, and to call up all our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance, for the two following reaſons: (1.) <hi>Satan</hi> is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly buſy, after ſealing ordinances, in endeavouring to rob us of the comforts of religion; to undo what was done at the ordinance; and either to cajole us into <hi>ſecurity,</hi> or to drive us into <hi>deſpair;</hi> and, generally ſpeaking, the greater ſenſible comfort we have had in the ordinance, the greater danger ſhall we be in of falling into <hi>ſpiritual pride</hi> or <hi>fatal ſecurity</hi> after it. It has been alſo obſerved, that men are liable to fall into the heavieſt temptations immediately after ſacraments. <hi>Satan's</hi> moſt violent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults upon our Saviour, happened immediately after his baptiſm, the viſible deſcent of the holy Ghoſt upon him, and that ſignal honour done him, by a voice <hi>from the excellent glory</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke iii. 21, 22.—iv. 1, &amp;c.</note>; and it was on the back of his firſt ſacrament, and after the moſt confident and ſanguine reſolutions of <hi>Peter,</hi> that he was tempted to deny his Lord and Maſter, and ſo ſcandalouſly yielded to the temptation<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark xiv. 29,—71.</note>. (2.) It becomes us to renew and ſtrengthen our reſolutions, that our Chriſtian profeſſion
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:014137_0076_0F97D491B71C98C8"/>may be adorned, and that Chriſtianity may not ſuffer by our follies and indiſcretions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THESE good reſolutions ſhould be formed <hi>wholly</hi> and <hi>only</hi> in the ſtrength of Chriſt; and indeed, <hi>this itſelf</hi> ought to be one of our moſt ſolemn reſolutions, that we will <hi>live wholly by faith on the Son of</hi> GOD. This is that all-important doctrine of humility and ſelf-denial which is inculcated upon us, throughout the whole goſpel, and which is indeed the very <hi>ſpirit and genius</hi> of the goſpel it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, renouncing all ſelf-righteouſneſs and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, we are to rely wholly on the righteouſneſs and ſtrength of the Redeemer; going forth to perform all duty, and to encounter all temptation, only in his ſtrength and in the power of his might; caſting all our cares upon him who careth for us, and deſiring to be found only in him, clothed with his righteouſneſs. Had <hi>Peter's</hi> good reſolutions been formed in this manner, he could never have fallen: The arm of omnipotence would have been his ſure defence, and his head would have been ſhielded in the day of battle.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF our ſouls have been properly exerciſed at this ſacrament, our conduct and converſation will ſhine after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with a peculiar luſtre. Holy exerciſes will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſhew themſelves by their natural fruits. Our faces will ſhine like that of <hi>Moſes</hi> when he returned from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with GOD on the mount; and we ſhall give the world occaſion to <hi>take knowledge of us, that we have been with Jeſus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iv. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IT will be advantageous after ſacraments, expreſsly to mention our ſacramental engagements in all our prayers, as an expedient to keep a ſolemn ſenſe of them alive on our minds.</p>
            <p n="9">9. WHEN we are called out in the courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to encounter any trial, temptation or difficult and ſelf-denying duty (which muſt frequently be the caſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:014137_0077_0F97D49274733B18"/>with every Chriſtian) we ſhould call to remembrance, this our ſolemn covenant, ſo publicly tranſacted, and ſo lately renewed; and aſk our conſciences what conduct will beſt become us as communicants, who have bound ourſelves by ſolemn and public vows to be the Lord's, and to live wholly to his honour and glory.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THAT courſe of life by which we may beſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Chriſtian profeſſion after this ſacrament, ſeems to be the following. (1.) Our converſation ought in all things to be ſuch as becometh the goſpel of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Philip. i. 27. Eph. iv. 1. &amp;c. Col. i. 10. 1. Theſ. ii. 12.</note>. (2.) We ſhould have a conſtant eye to the example of Chriſt, and carefully ſtudy it, as laid down in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, with a particular deſign of being conformed to it<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. xvi. 24. 1 Pet. ii. 21. 1 John ii. 6.

We ſhould endeavour to ſhew the world by our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deportment, that we enjoy a ſerene, chearful and happy ſtate of mind: Yet at the ſame time we ſhould guard in a particular manner, againſt diſcovering a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>for ſenſual, ſinful indulgences,</hi> or a diſpoſition to levity, triſling and vanity. (4.) It is of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the honour of our profeſſion, that we <hi>govern our paſſions;</hi> as Chriſtian profeſſors, who indulge <hi>anger, malice, envy, covetouſneſs, revenge,</hi> or the like, are the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt blots and ſcandals of religion. (5.) If communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants would not be guilty of crucifying their Lord afreſh, let them be careful of truth in their words, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in their promiſes, honeſty in their dealings, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, ſobriety and temperance in their lives, and that on all occaſions they ſpeak honourably of religion.</p>

            <head>ESSAY IX. PRACTICAL REFLECTIONS <hi>on the</hi> INCARNATION <hi>and</hi> BIRTH <hi>of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>proper before or after the</hi> LORD'S SUPPER.</head>
            <p n="1">1. FROM the amazing change of circumſtances which our Lord underwent in his incarnation, we have an aſtoniſhing demonſtration of the riches of GOD'S love to our world, and of his mercy to loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ALSO of the unſpeakable condeſcenſion of Chriſt: And this is amazingly heightened by his perfect fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of every circumſtance of <hi>pain, ſhame</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> which ſhould accompany his incarnation, and the long ſpace of time in which he ſhould ſuffer this eclipſe of glory, and ſeries of ignominious ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FROM that abaſement, poverty and pain to which Chriſt ſtooped that he might ſave human ſinners, and to which his loving Father freely delivered him up for us all, we may and muſt infer the unſpeakable <hi>importance of a human ſoul,</hi> and of its redemption and ſalvation: Alſo, the <hi>dreadful evil of ſin</hi> and <hi>eternal miſery,</hi> its juſt wages, to deliver us from which, the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD condeſcended to be <hi>born of a woman,</hi> and to <hi>die on a croſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. FROM this wonderful ſtoop of humility and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion in the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD, and thoſe abaſing humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating circumſtances, in which he choſe to appear in our nature, we learn how little value GOD ſets on thoſe things which are ſo highly eſteemed among men; I mean worldly riches, grandeur, honour and high eſtate.—And hence we ſee worldly pride and vanity, worldly ambition and avarice, or immoderate deſire of worldly riches, in their true light, and have the beſt antidote againſt them.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:014137_0079_0F97D493F46EBEA8"/>
5. FROM the mean and obſcure birth and humble circumſtances of the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD, compared with his amiable and divine character, we are taught not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe men on account of their obſcure birth, or humble circumſtances in life, but to form our eſtimate of them, and reſpect for them, on their moral characters, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal worth, and the God-like qualities and perfections of the ſoul and inward man, which alone are eſtimable in themſelves, and in the critical diſcerning eye of GOD.</p>
            <p n="6">6. FROM the obſcure birth and humble circumſtances of the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD, the poor, needy and deſpiſed things of this world may borrow an argument of conſolation in their mean and ſtraitened circumſtances. Why ſhould a real Chriſtian be mortified by the contempt of the world, when this was preciſely his Maſter's caſe? Nay, ought it not rather to be an honour to the <hi>pious poor,</hi> that they are in the ſame circumſtances with their divine Maſter, who was deſpiſed of men, and had not where to repoſe his venerable head?</p>
            <p n="7">7. OUR Saviour's mean birth and low circumſtances, may teach us how little account we ſhould make of the things of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ſenſe</hi> in general, and how little all worldly pomp, honour and ſplendor can contribute to our true happineſs. Who ſo happy and bleſſed as the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD? Who ſo contented as he? And yet who <hi>ſo poor</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed?</hi> And this ſhould alſo teach us how we ſhould ſtand affected to worldly things—That <hi>quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>ſelf-deniedneſs</hi> of children; that holy indifference with regard to worldly things, and that <hi>meekneſs, humility</hi> and <hi>contentedneſs</hi> of mind, which is ſo diſtinguiſhing a characteriſtic of the children of GOD, and the diſciples of Chriſt.</p>

            <head>ESSAY X. ADOPTION <hi>into the</hi> FAMILY <hi>of</hi> GOD.</head>
            <p n="1">1. MEN are called the <hi>ſons of</hi> GOD in various ſenſes in ſcripture,—as inveſted with worldly honours and titles<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxii. 6.</note>,—as in external covenant with GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. iv. 22.</note>,—and as GOD'S creatures and offspring<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mal. ii. 10. Acts xvii. 28.</note>.—The angels are alſo called <hi>ſons of</hi> GOD<note n="§" place="bottom">Job. xxxviii. 7.</note>; and Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Son of</hi> GOD by way of eminence, and in a very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and peculiar ſenſe: But believing ſinners only are the <hi>ſons of</hi> GOD by <hi>regeneration</hi> and <hi>adoption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. ADOPTION is a word borrowed from the civil law, and ſignifies the chuſing of a ſtranger by thoſe who have an eſtate, and no iſſue, and giving him the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and legal relation of a ſon and heir to their eſtate, and engaging to deal by him as though he were the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of their own body.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WE are all, by nature, children of wrath, children of the devil, and ſtrangers and enemies to GOD. GOD'S adopting us, is therefore, a more generous and merciful act than human adoption, and differs from it in the following reſpects.—(1.) When men adopt, they fix their love on ſtrangers, becauſe they are deſtitute of children; but GOD need not have done this, ſeeing he ſuſtains the relation of a Father to myriads of holy and happy beings, who have never, by apoſtacy, forfeited his paternal love. (2.) Some excellence or hopefulneſs in the perſons adopted by men, is generally the motive of their adopting them; but GOD ſaw nothing in us amiable, excellent, promiſing or engaging, but every
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:014137_0081_0F97D49574316F58"/>thing juſt the reverſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xvi. 5, &amp;c.</note>. (3.) Men cannot change the temper or diſpoſition of thoſe whom they adopt; but GOD gives a temper and diſpoſition ſuitable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: They receive from him <hi>the Spirit of adoption,</hi> whereby they cry, <hi>Abba, Father</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE are adopted by GOD <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which GOD gives us, as his ſons, flow to us <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through Chriſt,</hi> as the channel of their conveyance. Chriſt, in conſequence of <hi>his Sonſhip</hi> is made <hi>heir of all things</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Eph. i. 3.</note>, and the whole inheritance of GOD'S <hi>human family,</hi> is put into the hands of their elder brother for them. Indeed, he has purchaſed the inheritance in their name and ſtead, and has the right of diſpenſing it to his human brethren; ſo that adopted ſinners are <hi>heirs of</hi> GOD, and <hi>joint heirs with Chriſt,</hi> in whom is treaſured up all fulneſs for their ſupply<note n="§" place="bottom">Luk. xxii. 29. Rom. viii. 19. John xx. 17. 1 Cor. i. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE privileges of believers, in conſequence of their adoption, are exeeding many, gracious and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their ſtate and relation is altered: From being children of the <hi>devil,</hi> they are become the children of GOD by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and have GOD'S name, and his Son's name put upon them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. lxiii. 19. Eph. iii. 10.</note>;—from being ſlaves to the <hi>devil</hi> and their luſts, they are reſtored to the glorious liberty of the <hi>ſons of</hi> GOD; they are taken into GOD'S family and houſhold, are made fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and, in conſequence of this, are entitled to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, proviſion, and communion with their Father.

They are alſo at length introduced into the immediate preſence of their heavenly Father, in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manſions, and fully ſatisfied with his love, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the capacities of their nature, perfectly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulated to his image and likeneſs; of which glorious event, the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks with aſtoniſhment and rapture<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John iii. 1,—3.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE marks of the adopted children of GOD, are in general, a <hi>reverential, ſubmiſſive, loving</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> temper of mind. If we are indeed the <hi>children of</hi> GOD, we have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. We feel that inward reverence towards GOD, and reſpect and veneration for him, which a dutiful child does to a loving and reſpectable father.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF we have the Spirit of adoption, we feel ſupreme love for our heavenly Father, and this will ſhew itſelf in the following things: (1.) We ſhall entertain worthy and delightful thoughts of GOD, as a moſt kind, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, reconciled Father in Chriſt; the thoughts of him will be very precious, and our meditations of him will be ſweet<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxix. 17.—civ. 34.</note>. (2.) We ſhall delight to draw near to GOD in prayer, with an humble boldneſs and freedom of ſoul— to hear <hi>of him</hi> and <hi>from him</hi> in his word—and earneſtly deſire communion with him in all holy ordinances of worſhip. (3.) We ſhall have a real zeal for GOD'S honour and glory in the world; rejoice to ſee <hi>our Father</hi> honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his intereſt flouriſhing, and be grieved at heart to ſee him neglected, blaſphemed and diſhonoured by

            <p n="8">8. IF we are indeed GOD'S children by adoption, and do ſupremely love him that begat, we ſhall alſo love all them that are begotten of him. We ſhall love the whole <hi>Chriſtian brotherhood,</hi> ſo far as they bear the image of their heavenly Father, by whatever names known, into whatever ſects or parties ſplit and divided.—Yea, we ſhall be linked in bonds of tendereſt affection, to the whole numerous family both in heaven and on earth, whether our <hi>human brethren</hi> by adoption and regeneration, or our <hi>angelical brethren</hi> by creation and unſinning recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and obedience.

THEREFORE the proper ſubject of repentance, is a ſinner in the preſent life: For, in hell there is no place for repentance; and in heaven, though the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will retain the greateſt hatred of ſin, yet being guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſinleſs, they can have no proper compunction or contrition for ſin, nor any uneaſy afflictive ſenſations of mind on its account. All ſin and ſorrow will be then for ever done away.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THOUGH all ſinners will ſooner or later be filled with ſorrow and diſtreſs for what they have done againſt GOD, yet many in this life are <hi>hardened paſt feeling,</hi> through the deceitfulneſs of ſin; have their neck as an iron ſinew, their brow as braſs, and live and die in this <hi>ſtupid, hardened, remorſeleſs</hi> ſtate, after having drowned the voice of conſcience, and grieved the holy Spirit of GOD, which would have ſealed them to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
            <p n="5">5. OTHERS have alſo ſome kind of ſorrow for ſin, which is never effectual; ſome kind of repentance which is never true and ſaving; but, as the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>needeth-to be repented of.</hi> We have examples of this in <hi>Cain, Pharaoh, Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites, Nebuchadnezzar, Judas,</hi> and many under our own obſervation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WE ought, therefore, carefully to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>true</hi> repentance; one that is merely <hi>legal,</hi> and one that is <hi>evangelical.</hi> Theſe are diſtinguiſhed by their <hi>names</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> languages, and by their <hi>motives</hi> and <hi>effects.</hi>

            <p n="7">7.

'Tis a progreſſive work, begun, carried on, and perfected by the holy Spirit of GOD in the human ſoul; carrying it on from light to light, from ſtrength to ſtrength, and from one degree of holineſs to another, 'till at length it appears perfect before GOD in <hi>Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. THE two principal branches of ſanctification, and which comprehend all the reſt, are <hi>mortification</hi> and <hi>vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> or, as the ſcriptures expreſs it, a <hi>dying daily to ſin, and living unto righteouſneſs</hi>

            <head>ESSAY XIII. <hi>The</hi> NATURE <hi>and</hi> BLESSED EFFECTS <hi>of an</hi> UNION <hi>with</hi> CHRIST.</head>
            <p n="1">1. UNION with a perſon or thing, ſignifies <hi>ſuch a connexion,</hi> as, in ſome ſort, conſtitutes <hi>ſameneſs</hi> or <hi>oneneſs;</hi> to be united therefore to Chriſt, implies, that the perſon ſo united, is in ſome ſenſe, <hi>one with him.</hi> Chriſt is in ſome ſenſe <hi>one with him,</hi> and he <hi>one with Chriſt.</hi> This is a great myſtery, as the Apoſtle tells us; but it is a myſtery plainly revealed and taught in the ſcriptures, and upon the right knowledge of it depends our right conceptions of vital religion, and much of the comfort of every Chriſtian.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS union is not <hi>eſſential,</hi> like that of the three perſons in the Godhead; nor perſonal, like that of the divine and human natures of Chriſt in the perſon of the Mediator;—nor <hi>thirdly, relative, civil</hi> or <hi>political,</hi> like that which ſubſiſts between a king and his ſubjects, or a maſter and his ſervants or diſciples: If this were the nature of <hi>this union,</hi> as ſome Chriſtians underſtand it, then would it be no myſtery as the Apoſtle repreſents it<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. v. 32.</note>; but the plaineſt and moſt comprehenſible thing imaginable: For the weakeſt underſtanding can eaſily underſtand how it is, that a king and his ſubjects make <hi>one body politic,</hi> or a maſter and his ſervants <hi>one body domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is a <hi>myſtical</hi> union. It is a <hi>myſtery,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>modus</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of it can admit of no clear and and full illuſtration or explanation, in the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate. It is however ſhadowed forth to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many <hi>figures</hi> or <hi>metaphors,</hi> which prove, that it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:014137_0091_0F97D4E434109530"/>cloſe and intimate union, and ſuch as transforms and aſſimulates the ſoul into the very <hi>temper, likeneſs</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, and makes it <hi>one with him,</hi> in ſome very important reſpects. It is compared to the union of a <hi>vine</hi> with its <hi>branches</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John xv. 1. &amp;c.</note>, between a <hi>huſband</hi> and his <hi>wife</hi>

               <note n="††" place="bottom">John xvii. 11.</note>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are called <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>members in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> and are powerfully diſſuaded from the ſin of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from this very conſideration. In other ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, believers are repreſented as <hi>one Spirit with Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt is <hi>in them the hope of glory,</hi> and <hi>their life</hi> is hid with Chriſt in GOD. St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not live, but <hi>Chriſt lived in him.</hi> Chriſt and believers are repreſented as having <hi>one common intereſt; one</hi> GOD <hi>and Father,</hi> and <hi>one common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> as joint heirs<note n="‡‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. vi. 17. Col. i. 27—iii. 3. Gal. ii. 20. Matth. xxv. 40. John xx. 17. Rom. viii. 17.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE are not to form any groſs conceptions of this myſtical union between Chriſt and believers, as though it implied any <hi>phyſical mixture</hi> or <hi>confuſion</hi> of the two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thus united; and yet theſe very expreſſive meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors prove, that this union muſt be ſomething exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>cloſe</hi> and <hi>intimate,</hi> ſuch as makes the ſoul truly a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the divine nature and image of Chriſt; as <hi>lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, transforms</hi> and <hi>aſſimulates</hi> it; ſuch by which the ſoul imbibes (if I may ſo ſpeak) the Spirit of Chriſt; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives ſtrength, and vigour and nouriſhment from him, as its <hi>living head,</hi> and as the <hi>branches</hi> do from the <hi>parent vine.</hi> Chriſt <hi>dwells</hi> and <hi>abides</hi> in the believer by his Spirit, and
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:014137_0092_0F97D4E4F35DE700"/>the believer <hi>grows up into him in all things, which is the head.</hi> 
               <q>As the branch cannot bear fruit of itſelf, except it abide in the vine; no more can we, except we abide in Chriſt; for without him, (or out of him, diſunited from him) we can do nothing;</q> bring forth no fruit unto righteouſneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">John xv. 4, 5.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THIS is a <hi>ſpiritual union.</hi> 
               <q>They that are joined to the Lord, are one ſpirit;</q> and this is true in two important ſenſes: (1.) They partake of the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit with their Lord and Maſter. To <hi>him</hi> indeed GOD gives not the Spirit by meaſure. In him it hath pleaſed the Father that all fullneſs of the Spirit and his graces ſhould dwell; and, through this union, believers derive from him ſuch ſupplies of this Spirit, and his graces, as they ſtand in need of. It is the very ſame Spirit which dwelleth in Chriſt, as the head, which is diſpenſed by him to the living members of his myſtical body. All theſe members, whether in heaven or on earth, drink in the ſame Spirit, from the ſame never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>failing fountain or repoſitory, and are all united together in love by the ſame Spirit. (2.) They have alſo the <hi>ſame temper</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition;</hi> the <hi>ſame mind</hi> in them which is alſo in Chriſt Jeſus. His intereſt is their intereſt; and his will is their will. They have the ſame aims, deſires, averſions, delights; the ſame love of GOD, zeal for his glory, and charity and affection for his creatures and children. And hereby they know that Chriſt abideth in them, by the Spirit which he hath given them: But thoſe who have not <hi>thus</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>temper of Chriſt,</hi> may be aſſured that they are none of his.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THIS union of the ſoul to Chriſt is formed <hi>by faith.</hi> The holy Spirit works this faith in the ſoul, and draws it to Chriſt; and faith receives Chriſt into the ſoul, and forms the bond of ſpiritual union between them; ſo that thenceforth the ſoul <hi>lives in Chriſt,</hi> by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:014137_0093_0F97D4E6DAB56318"/>and <hi>Chriſt lives in the ſoul</hi> by the quickening, ſanctifying and comforting influences of his holy Spirit. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>dwelleth in our hearts by faith. We dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iii. 17. 1 John iv. 13. 1 Cor. xii. 13.</note>.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE effects of this union are many and exceeding precious: For, (1.) The moment our ſouls are thus united to Chriſt, we are in a <hi>juſtified ſtate,</hi> in a ſtate of acceptance and reconciliation with GOD, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently can never come into condemnation<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 1.</note>. (2.) The moment of this union, is the moment of <hi>our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual regeneration:</hi> We then begin to be <hi>partakers of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature,</hi> which, by virtue of this union, we receive from Chriſt the head of divine influences. (3.) With the firſt moment of this union begins our <hi>eternal,</hi> as well as our <hi>ſpiritual life:</hi> It is our <hi>birth to glory.</hi> (4.) Our progreſs in holineſs depends entirely on this union; for ſevered from Chriſt, we can do nothing. (5.) Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and communion with GOD is entirely the fruit and effect of this union: For, we can have no fellowſhip with GOD, but <hi>in</hi> and <hi>through</hi> Chriſt. (6.) Fellowſhip and communion among Chriſtians is begun and carried on by this union: For, they are all united unto one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>to</hi> GOD <hi>through Chriſt;</hi> and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is formed by their all partaking the ſame Spirit from Chriſt the head, by which as members, they are united together into one body.</p>

            <head>ESSAY XIV. <hi>Of the</hi> FINAL PERSEVERANCE <hi>of the</hi> SAINTS.</head>
            <p n="1">1. AS every bleſſing is valuable in proportion to its <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>duration,</hi> ſo the final perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ſaints in holineſs, if it be true, muſt be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortable doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS doctrine is neceſſarily denied by all thoſe who imagine they can put themſelves into a ſtate of grace, and put themſelves out of it, at pleaſure; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by many who acknowledge the neceſſity of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and efficacious influences of the Spirit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and yet ſuppoſe this grace <hi>amiſſible</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſinner, who, by his abuſe of his natural liberty, may <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>finally fall from grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WHEN we ſpeak of a ſinner's <hi>perſevering in grace,</hi> or <hi>falling from grace,</hi> we mean <hi>true grace,</hi> or a real work of regenerating grace in the ſoul: For, we make no doubt, that many who have ſeemed to have had grace, in a judgment of charity, have fallen from that grace which they <hi>only ſeemed to have,</hi> but <hi>had not</hi> in reality. We have obſerved before, that a very ſpecious religious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is often formed on the principles of <hi>ſelf-love, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, fame, reputation</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> or the terrors of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, from a ſight and ſenſe of guilt and demerit, which, although it is exceeding <hi>hollow, defective</hi> and <hi>imperfect,</hi> yet often impoſes not only on a credulous world, but alſo upon the perſons who ſuſtain it. None but GOD certainly and infallibly knows whether perſons have true grace or not. Hypocrites often make as fair a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as real Chriſtians; and when ſuch fall into a courſe of groſs ſins, we are not raſhly to conclude that <hi>men may
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:014137_0095_0F97D4E7F3900AF0"/>fall from grace,</hi> as it is impoſſible for us to know whether ſuch were ever <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> gracious.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is no objection againſt this doctrine, that ſome truly gracious perſons have fallen into very groſs ſins; yea, into courſes of ſin, and thereby diſhonoured Chriſt, and their profeſſion of his religion. The queſtion is, Whether truly gracious perſons can ever <hi>totally</hi> and <hi>final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> loſe the principle of grace; <hi>wholly</hi> apoſtatize from GOD, and fall into reprobacy and condemnation?</p>
            <p n="5">5. SOME have imagined, that the ſaints may fall <hi>total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> from grace, but not <hi>finally;</hi> as in the inſtances of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon:</hi> But, though this would ſolve many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, yet it does not ſeem to be the ſcripture doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IF what we have ſaid of <hi>converſion</hi> be true, it ſeems by no means probable, that GOD ſhould regenerate men, and give them his Spirit, and wholly change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and put his image on their ſouls, and yet, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>they themſelves,</hi> or the <hi>devil,</hi> ſhould be allowed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and undo this glorious work, and wholly raze and blot out that image of his, which was engraven by his Spirit on their hearts!</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF GOD, by an act of aſtoniſhing grace, <hi>juſtifies us</hi> when <hi>ungodly;</hi> if he alſo takes us out of the <hi>devil's</hi> family by <hi>adoption,</hi> and gives us the ſpirit and temper of ſons, whereby we are diſpoſed and enabled to cry, <hi>Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and to render a filial and dutiful obedience: Can we ſuppoſe him ſo capricious (with reverence be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken!) as to change his own free acts; recal his gifts and favours; condemn us again and caſt us back to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the devil, from which he had but juſt taken us by a miracle of mercy; eſpecially when we are told that <hi>his gifts and calling are without repentance</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxix. 28,—34. Rom. viii. 32,—39.</note>.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IF the doctrine of our <hi>myſtical union with Chriſt,</hi> through faith and the indwelling influences of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:014137_0096_0F97D4E8B39A9628"/>be true; the perſeverance of the ſaints in holineſs, muſt follow of conſequence: For, can we ſuppoſe that the myſtical body of Chriſt can be mangled or diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered? That his members may be cut off and made members of the devil? Or that our bodies may be one day <hi>temples of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the next <hi>ſynagogues of ſatan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. Is it not ſomething very ſhocking and abſurd to reaſon, to ſuppoſe, that the ſtates of men GOD-ward ſhould be liable to hourly change; one hour juſtified perſons, the next under ſentence of condemnation; one hour holy ſaints, the next profane reprobates; one hour favourites of heaven, the next confederates with hell: The hour before death in a ſtate of ſalvation, angels ready to guard and convey them to bliſs; an hour hence, the prey of devils, and conveyed by them to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments!</p>
            <p n="10">10. WE do not ſay that the ſaints are infallible by any power of ſtanding in themſelves; or that divine grace is a thing, which, in its own nature cannot be loſt. We believe, that if believers were left to themſelves, they would fall from grace every hour. But we found this doctrine wholly on the power and promiſe of GOD; firmly believing, on the authority of his infallible word, <q>That his gifts and calling are without repentance; and that all who are begotten again to a lively hope, through the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in the heavens for them, SHALL BE KEPT BY THE POWER OF GOD, THROUGH FAITH, UNTO SALVATION, ready to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the laſt times<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 3,—6.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. FOR the clear and ſuperabundant ſcripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:014137_0097_0F97D4E973B912D8"/>of this doctrine, read with attention the ſcriptures referred to below in the margin<note n="*" place="bottom">John x. 27,—29.—vi. 39, 40.—xvii. 11. 1 John ii. 19. —iii. 9.

Job xvii. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE ſcripture inſtances or examples alledged againſt this doctrine, are either, (1.) Of <hi>hypocritical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> or <hi>mere temporary believers,</hi> falling from an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of religion, which we believe to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible and common caſe. Or, (2.) Of the <hi>caſual</hi> and <hi>temporary</hi> defections and falls of true ſaints, which we readily grant to be too frequent a caſe. Or, (3.) Of <hi>conditional threatenings</hi> made to true ſaints, as a means of, and excitement to their perſeverance. And all theſe ſcripture inſtances which are commonly objected to this doctrine, may, without ſtraining them, be reduced to one or other of theſe claſſes.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE principal objections alledged againſt this doctrine, from the nature and tendency of it, is, (1.) That it miniſters to carnal confidence and ſecurity, and tends to hinder that watchfulneſs and circumſpection, that holy fear and trembling with which it becomes ſuch guilty, imperfect creatures as we are, to work out our ſalvation: But, the very beſt of men, can have no ground of confidence, ſave in the ſtrength and promiſe of GOD. We know alſo, that if we live not holily, watchfully and circumſpectly, we have no true grace. Theſe are the only certain and infallible ſigns and marks of true grace, and where theſe are wanting, it would be the moſt irrational and abſurd preſumption, to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of perſevering in a grace which we have not. (2.) It is objected, that this doctrine renders admonitions and reproofs, vain and needleſs. But theſe are the very appointed means of our ſtanding, and to prevent our
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:014137_0098_0F97D4EA3366E7B0"/>apoſtacy and ruin. We can have no certainty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, but what ariſes from our certainty of the truth of grace, and this can be only aſcertained by a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and chearful compliance with every goſpel motive to univerſal holineſs.</p>
            <p n="14">14. FEW Chriſtians <hi>can</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to take any comfort from the application of this doctrine to themſelves. None have any right to do ſo, but ſuch as have the cleareſt and moſt ſatisfying evidences of the truth of grace in themſelves. And how few real Chriſtians, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, have actually attained to this ſatisfying evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of grace, from which they may take the comfort of the doctrine of perſeverance?</p>
            <p n="15">15. LET it therefore be our firſt and principal care, to have true grace; let it be our next to know that we have it, to make our calling and election ſure and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ourſelves; and then let us freely rejoice in the immutability of the divine love;—that his gifts and calling are without repentance; that where he has once begun a good work, he will carry it on to the day of Chriſt Jeſus, and that neither earth nor hell, ſhall be able to pluck us out of his hand, or out of his Father's hand. Amen.</p>

            <head>ESSAY XV. <hi>Of</hi> PEACE <hi>of</hi> CONSCIENCE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. CONSCIENCE is a comparing of our moral actions with their rule, and a practical judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them by this rule; the reſult of which is, that we either <hi>acquit</hi> or <hi>condemn</hi> ourſelves, according to this
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:014137_0099_0F97D4EAF50063D0"/>evidence. When we acquit ourſelves upon this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal judgment, then have we <hi>peace of conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. PEACE of conſcience is the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification:</hi> For, it is impoſſible that an unſanctified, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, graceleſs perſon, can, upon true evidence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf at the bar of his own conſcience; or, in other words, enjoy true peace of conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN order to true peace of conſcience, it is not enough that the matter of our actions be conformable to the law of GOD: We muſt alſo be conſcious that they are done from <hi>right motives</hi> and for <hi>right ends;</hi> in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the authority of GOD, with a view to his glory and the good of our fellow creatures, or for our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual benefit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is one thing to be able to acquit ourſelves of <hi>ſome particular crime</hi> falſely laid to our charge by men, which a very wicked perſon may be able to do; and quite another thing to be able to acquit ourſelves, in our <hi>general conduct,</hi> in the ſight of GOD. In order to <hi>this peace,</hi> we muſt labour to maintain the teſtimony of a good conſcience, both <hi>towards</hi> GOD and <hi>towards men;</hi> or, as the Apoſtle elſewhere expreſſes it, we muſt <hi>have lived in all good conſcience</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xxiii. 1.—xxiv. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A GOOD, <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> conſcience is one of the greateſt bleſſings upon earth; one of the richeſt and moſt invaluable privileges of the ſanctified; can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtained in the way of circumſpect holineſs, and ſhould be purſued with the utmoſt aſſiduity by every Chriſtian. Both the nature of it, and an earneſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to purſue it, are well expreſſed in theſe words of <hi>Job: My heart ſhall not reproach me, ſo long as I live</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Job xxvii. 6. Read alſo, 1 John iii. 19,—21. 1 Tim. i. 5. 1 Pet. iii. 19. 1 Tim. iii. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Two things are particularly neceſſary to peace of conſcience: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>our ſins are pardoned,</hi> through
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:014137_0100_0F97D4EBB37504F8"/>faith in the Redeemer's blood: For, where guilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, there can be no ground for peace, and where a ſenſe of guilt remains, no peace can actually take place<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 11,—14.—x. 22.</note>. <hi>Secondly,</hi> A <hi>holy life:</hi> For, <hi>there is no peace, ſaith my</hi> GOD, <hi>to the wicked</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. lvii. 21.</note>.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>raviſhing</hi> pleaſures, the <hi>ſolid joys</hi> and <hi>extatic delights</hi> of a peaceable conſcience, are beautifully expreſſed by the Apoſtle<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. i. 12.</note>; <q>For this is our rejoicing, even the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of GOD, we have had our converſation in the world.</q> And again<note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. v. 1,—4.</note>; <q>Therefore, being juſtified by faith, we have peace with GOD, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and rejoice in hope of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD. We glory in tribulations alſo; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience, hope; and hope mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not aſhamed, becauſe the love of GOD is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. THE <hi>horrors</hi> of an <hi>evil, guilty, condemning</hi> conſcience are, beyond compare, the moſt ſhocking miſeries of this life; and too certain preludes of that worm which dieth not, and that fire which is not quenched. Conſcience is a lion, which will one day or other, riſe up and tear to pieces, with reſiſtleſs fury, the impenitent ſinner. We have ſome inſtructive and alarming inſtances of theſe horrors of a guilty and awakened conſcience, in the caſes of <hi>Cain, Judas</hi> and <hi>Francis Spira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. THE dangerous and deſtructive counterfeit of <hi>peace of conſcience,</hi> is <hi>ſecurity,</hi> or a <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>ill-grounded</hi> peace of mind, in a wilful courſe of ſin. This ariſes either from
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:014137_0101_0F97D4EC7377A4D8"/>falſe and unworthy notions of GOD'S perfections, or from a long cuſtom of ſinning againſt light, whereby the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience becomes as it were <hi>ſeared</hi> and <hi>paſt feeling</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 18, 19.</note>: But a piercing light will, one day or other, diſcover this cheat to the ſinner, and fill his ſoul with an anguiſh which he ſhall neither be able to ſupport nor divert.</p>
            <p n="10">10. LET us labour to obtain an <hi>enlightened, well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> conſcience, that we may neither, on the one hand, become the dupes of ſuperſtitious fears, groundleſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics, and imaginary terrors, for actions in which there is really no guilt; nor, on the other, like Saint Paul, bring guilt upon ourſelves, by erring <hi>ignorantly through unbelief</hi>

            <head>ESSAY XVIII. <hi>The</hi> IMMORTALITY <hi>of the</hi> SOUL.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE doctrine of the ſoul's immortality is of great importance in religion: For, if the ſoul periſhed with the body, <hi>ſelf-denial, mortification,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſufferings</hi> in the cauſe of virtue, would be <hi>abſurd;</hi>— and the beſt Chriſtians would, as the Apoſtle ſuggeſts, be of all men the moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BY the ſoul's being <hi>immortal,</hi> we do not mean that it is impoſſible for him who made it to deſtroy it; or that it is, in its own nature, immortal, independently on GOD; but that it does not periſh or die with, or like the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:014137_0108_0F97D4F273BF3528"/>body, nor can be deſtroyed by any creature; but is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by GOD for an endleſs exiſtence, and fitted and qualified for this deathleſs exiſtence in its own nature.</p>
            <p n="3">3. REASON does not aſſure us, that <hi>thought</hi> and <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> are <hi>inſeparable</hi> and <hi>eſſential</hi> properties of human ſouls: For ought we know, they may be and exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out continued thought, conſciouſneſs and reflection, though the contrary opinion is highly probable, and ſeems to be countenanced by ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WE know of but two kinds of ſubſtances in the univerſe, <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>ſpirit.</hi> And theſe we conceive of as entirely different and diſtinct from one another. GOD, we are ſure, is a <hi>pure ſpirit; immaterial, without body</hi> or <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily parts:</hi> But we are not equally certain that created ſpirits, either <hi>angels</hi> or <hi>human ſouls,</hi> are ſpirits of the ſame nature with GOD, or <hi>wholly immaterial.</hi> Though their being called <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and being ſaid to be made after the image of GOD, and to be <hi>his off-ſpring,</hi> is a <hi>ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> that they are <hi>immaterial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. IF it could be certainly proved that our ſouls are wholly immaterial, as GOD is, it would be a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favour of their immortality: Becauſe, it would hence follow, that they are <hi>incapable of diſſolution;</hi> that they could not periſh with the body, and that none but GOD could deſtroy them. But we have abundant arguments to prove the <hi>ſoul's immortality,</hi> laying aſide the conſideration of its being <hi>immaterial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. THERE is much the ſame reaſon to believe the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of brutes</hi> to be <hi>immaterial,</hi> as the <hi>ſouls of men. Both</hi> are called <hi>ſpirits</hi> in the ſcripture; though it is ſaid, that the one <hi>goeth upward</hi> at death, and the other <hi>downwards.</hi> And it is as difficult to conceive how a <hi>merely material</hi> ſubſtance ſhould <hi>perceive, reaſon, remember, compare, love</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> in a <hi>beaſt,</hi> more than in a <hi>man.</hi> Yet there are not the ſame reaſons to believe the immortality of the ſpirits of beaſts, as of the ſouls of men.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:014137_0109_0F97D4F3485CB388"/>
7. THE ſtrongeſt and moſt concluſive arguments for the <hi>immortality of human ſouls,</hi> are of a <hi>moral nature,</hi> and do not ariſe from their being <hi>immaterial:</hi> For, although we know our bodies to be material, yet we have ſufficient reaſon to believe, that they ſhall be raiſed from the dead, and rendered immortal in a future ſtate. And if we have reaſon to believe this of our mortal bodies, why may we not believe the ſame of our ſouls, even ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to be material.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THERE is a great apparent reſemblance between men and brutes in many reſpects, both <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dying.</hi> They ſeem to have much the ſame natural perceptions of pleaſure and pain. All the brute creation ſeem to have ſome portion of reaſon, fore-thought, contrivance and memory. So that it is hard to conceive an eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al difference between the ſouls of men and the ſpirits of beaſts; only, that the former appear to be a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect kind of ſpirits. Yet there are many <hi>great</hi> and <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> differences between men and beaſts, which lay a foundation for believing the ſouls of men to be <hi>immortal,</hi> whereas the ſpirits of beaſts may be <hi>mortal</hi> and <hi>periſhable</hi> at their death.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE ſouls of men have plainly <hi>a capacity for virtue and religion.</hi> It is evident that they have a <hi>conſcience, a moral ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling,</hi> a <hi>divine law</hi> written upon them; that they have hopes and fears, relating to inviſible powers, and a future and inviſible ſtate. They have naturally <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>joy,</hi> when they are conſcious of having acted up to the moral law of their nature; and <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>forebodings</hi> of puniſhment, when they groſsly violate the laws of their own minds. In other words; it appears, that they are <hi>moral agents, accountable creatures,</hi> under law to GOD; and that they know they are reſponſible to him for their moral actions. But there is not the leaſt evidence or appearance of this among the brute creation. Now if GOD has implanted <hi>this law, this moral ſenſe,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:014137_0110_0F97D4F3F3C4FDA0"/>theſe hopes and fears</hi> in human ſouls, as the law of their nature; is it to be thought, that they are vain and falſe, and have no real objects?</p>
            <p n="10">10. THE ſpirits of brutes do not ſeem capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement: Whatever they <hi>know</hi> and <hi>do</hi> ſeems to be by <hi>inſtinct.</hi> The bird builds her neſt as ingeniouſly the <hi>firſt year,</hi> without any inſtruction, as ſhe does after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of <hi>ten years;</hi> and knows her food, her enemies and reſources as well. But the ſoul of man is capable of daily improvement, not only in <hi>virtue,</hi> but in the <hi>knowledge of arts and ſciences.</hi> Is it not likely then, that <hi>human ſouls</hi> are made for <hi>noble ends,</hi> and for <hi>higher enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> even for an <hi>immortal, ever improving duration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. THE generality of men of all nations, even the moſt ignorant and barbarous, have believed the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul, and this univerſal belief, muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed founded on <hi>ſome obvious principles,</hi> level to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of all, which is a ſtrong preſumption that it is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>founded in nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. MEN in general have <hi>a ſtrong deſire,</hi> and a fond hope of immortality; and the more virtuous and holy they are, the more earneſt is this hope and deſire of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality: But would a <hi>good</hi> GOD provide gratifications for all the natural deſires of the loweſt order of creatures, and leave this nobleſt appetite in man ungratified?— or would he inſpire the <hi>holieſt</hi> and <hi>beſt of men</hi> with <hi>pantings, breathings</hi> and <hi>earneſt longings,</hi> which are <hi>vain, imaginary</hi> and <hi>deluſive?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. IT ſeems not conſiſtent with the divine goodneſs to form ſo excellent a creature as man, for ſo ſhort <hi>a duration</hi> and ſuch <hi>low employments,</hi> as are to be met with in this life. Is it reaſonable to imagine, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul, by the time its noble ſaculties juſt begin to be cultivated and fitted for noble pleaſures and enjoyments, ſhould be extinguiſhed and cut off for ever?</p>

14. GOOD men deſire nothing ſo much as to enjoy GOD more perfectly than they can in their life; and the more they love GOD, the more eager and unſatisfied is this deſire in their ſouls. Nay, this deſire, is the fruit of GOD'S grace in them, and of his own planting. But if the human ſoul is not immortal, the beſt of men, can never obtain their <hi>nobleſt deſire,</hi> and the <hi>higheſt enjoyment</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of which their nature is capable.</p>
            <p n="15">15. IF the ſoul were mortal, a deſperate villain might deprive the moſt virtuous man of <hi>his being,</hi> and of all the future rewards of his virtue: But is it conſiſtent with the juſtice and goodneſs of GOD, that this ſhould be in the power of a bad man?</p>
            <p n="16">16. IF GOD is a juſt governor of his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>virtuous muſt</hi> and <hi>will</hi> be rewarded according to their works, and the <hi>wicked</hi> puniſhed according to theirs: But we are ſure this does not always happen in the preſent life; therefore, there muſt be a <hi>future ſtate</hi> of retribution, and conſequently human ſouls are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</p>
            <p n="17">17. OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt has put this doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt, having brought life and immortality to light by his goſpel. The whole of his religion; all his threatnings and promiſes, his rewards and puniſhments, go upon this ſuppuration, and all his diſcourſes and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables are full of it.</p>
            <p n="18">18. CHRIST's raiſing the dead bodies of many, and riſing himſelf from the dead; alſo, the appearance of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> to the diſciples on the <hi>mount of transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> were ſo many occular demonſtrations of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul, and that its exiſtence depends not on the life of the body.</p>
            <p n="19">19. IT is no objection to this important doctrine, that the faculties of the ſouls of <hi>aged</hi> or <hi>ſick perſons,</hi> are <hi>impaired</hi> and <hi>infeebled</hi> by the diſeaſes and decays of the body; ſeeing the ſoul muſt exert its faculties <hi>by</hi> and

               <hi>through</hi> the bodily organs. On the contrary alſo, the ſouls of ſome men are uncommonly active and vigorous when their bodies are in the deepeſt decays, and juſt at the point of death.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THOUGH we can hardly conceive of the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural immortality</hi> of a body compoſed of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood;</hi> yet GOD could doubtleſs have made our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies immortal, if he had ſo pleaſed. And had we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in a ſtate of innocence, there is no doubt but that we would have been immortal; for this ſeems implied in the promiſe of the covenant of works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHETHER this reward and privilege of innocent man, would have been an immortality on earth or in heaven, is no where plainly revealed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THOUGH man was <hi>naturally mortal;</hi> yet GOD could have preſerved him from death, by the ſalubriety of the air and water, the wholeſome, reſtorative and medicinal quality of the fruits of the earth, and that compoſure and equability of the paſſions and affections, reſulting from the innocency and perfection of the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="4">4. SOME have ſuppoſed, that the <hi>tree of life,</hi> from which man was excluded by ſin, had, in its fruit, the

               <hi>preternatural quality</hi> of preſerving man immortal, ſo long as he had acceſs to eat it: Others, that it was a <hi>ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental pledge</hi> of his immortality ſo long as he continued in a ſtate of innocence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. HOWEVER theſe things may be, yet we are aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both from ſcripture and experience, that <hi>fallen, ſinful</hi> man, is <hi>mortal;</hi> that death is the <hi>wages</hi> and <hi>conſequent</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> in all the race; and that death hath paſſed upon <hi>all,</hi> becauſe <hi>all have ſinned</hi>

            <p n="6">6. As death is the <hi>wages of ſin,</hi> and by the unalterable purpoſe of GOD, all men are doomed to die; ſo a great many <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> may have concurred to ſecure the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of this purpoſe; as the curſe of the earth, poiſoning its fruits with the ſeeds of death; the baneful influences of the accurſed air upon our lungs and juices; the intemperature of the ſeaſons, and the quick ſucceſſions from wet to dry, and from extreme heat to extreme cold; the exorbitancy and irregularity of our paſſions and appetites through ſin; the ſickly and enfeebled conſtitutions of our forefathers, and the like.</p>
            <p n="7">7. WITH regard to beaſts, we ſuppoſe death to put a period to their pains, pleaſures and very beings.

            <p n="8">8. WITH regard to man, <hi>death</hi> in itſelf conſidered, or the <hi>mere ſeparation of ſoul and body,</hi> ought not to be greatly dreaded, as probably the pain of it is much ſmaller than we imagine: But what renders death peculiarly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and formidable to man, is its <hi>awful conſequences.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. IT is appointed for all men once to die, and after that the judgment, Heb. ix. 27.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. THE holy ſcriptures <hi>fully, clearly,</hi> and <hi>circumſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> eſtabliſh and teach this doctrine<note n="*" place="bottom">See Jude 14. and Eccleſ. xii. 14. Matth. xxv. Rev. xii. and xxii. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD will judge the world by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by whom he <hi>made</hi> and <hi>governs</hi> it, and by whom he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed it.

            <p n="3">3. THEY will then go away with Chriſt and the holy

            <p n="4">4. WE muſt conſider heaven both as a <hi>place</hi> and a <hi>ſtate</hi> of bleſſedneſs; but <hi>where</hi> this place, or <hi>what</hi> this ſtate preciſely is, we are not at preſent permitted to know.</p>
            <p n="5">5. AS Chriſt has, and the ſaints will have <hi>glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> there muſt needs be a <hi>local heaven,</hi> or <hi>ſome place</hi> where theſe bodies will <hi>be</hi> and <hi>reſide.</hi> But whether the whole univerſe may not be turned into a heaven to them; or whether any particular part of it may be appropriated for their peculiar reſidence, is what we cannot certainly tell. True, the heaven of the ſaints is termed a <hi>city,</hi> the <hi>New Jeruſalem, manſions in</hi> GOD<hi>'S houſe, ſure habitations,</hi> and the like; but for all we know, theſe may be only <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative expreſſions.</hi> GOD may create a heaven around his ſaints wherever they are, even in hell; and they may have intimate communion with each other, from the moſt diſtant parts of the univerſe.

            <p n="8">8.

The righteous in heaven are alſo <hi>altogether holy;</hi> have no propenſity to ſin; no ſtruggles with corruption; no conflict with temptation; no remorſe for guilt, nor any fear of diſpleaſing GOD, or enduring his diſpleaſure. They <hi>clearly ſee</hi> and <hi>know</hi> GOD, and therefore they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>love</hi> and <hi>admire</hi> him. They know the equity of his laws and the beauty of holineſs, and therefore they cannot but delightfully obey him and work holineſs, and can be in no danger of inclining to the hateful ways of ſin.

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:014137_0125_0F97D4FF335E11F8"/>thought it abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the poſitive torments of damned ſpirits, of the devil and his angels, ſhould be excited <hi>by material fire.</hi> But if we conſider, that it is our <hi>ſpirits</hi> which feel the pain of burning through our bodies, we ſhall not think it incredible, that GOD ſhould excite the ſame idea of pain from ſire in <hi>pure ſpirits,</hi> without the intervention of bodies. However, fire may be only <hi>figuratively</hi> uſed, to ſignify the moſt intenſe pain and torments. And as for the <hi>place</hi> of the damned, it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becomes us to endeavour to ſhun it, than curiouſly to enquire <hi>where</hi> or <hi>what</hi> it is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. AT the reſurrection of the wicked, their ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united to their bodies, they ſhall be judged; and that awful ſentence being paſſed upon them, <q>Depart from me ye curſed, &amp;c.</q> they ſhall be dragged away by devils, and with them, ſhut up in the priſon of hell; thus ſharing in the puniſhment of thoſe with whom they apoſtatized.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT appears from ſcripture, that the miſery of the damned will be <hi>properly eternal, everlaſting fire;</hi> a <hi>worm that dieth not,</hi> and <hi>a fire that is</hi> not <hi>quenched.</hi> It appears agreeable to reaſon alſo, that creatures who have deſpiſed and rejected <hi>an everlaſting heaven of bleſſedneſs,</hi> ſhould have <hi>an everlaſting hell of miſery;</hi> and that thoſe who have ſlighted the glorious hope ſet before them, ſhould inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit endleſs deſpair, which, indeed, upon the whole, was <hi>their own choice</hi> and <hi>preference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. AS to the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>hell,</hi> or rather of <hi>the damned,</hi> it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes in a great meaſure from their own wicked and helliſh diſpoſitions, which cannot admit of happineſs, but are naturally productive of miſery. A wicked man is, and muſt be <hi>a hell to himſelf.</hi> He is <hi>ſelf-fitted</hi> and <hi>prepared to this deſtruction;</hi> and he needs only to be out of the body, and out of a capacity of taſting GOD'S goodneſs, to be in <hi>hell,</hi> and to be equally a <hi>devil.</hi> So that repentance of ſin, and
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:014137_0126_0F97D5010E2C0D40"/>holineſs, are in their own nature, neceſſary to deliver men from hell, and to qualify them for happineſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE chief ingredients in the miſeries of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, are, (1.) Their being baniſhed from the preſence and enjoyment of GOD, the fountain of happineſs:— (2.) The ſociety of <hi>devils</hi> and other damned ſpirits, who will be continually upbraiding them, and exciting their helliſh paſſions:—(3.) A remembrance of the good things of this life which they have loſt, and a ſenſe of their deſperate madneſs in rejecting that eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they might have enjoyed, for the meereſt trifles:—(4.) Envy at the happineſs of the bleſſed:— (5.) A painful ſenſe of GOD'S wrath, and the infliction of poſitive torments from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power;—and <hi>finally,</hi> deſpair of ever ſeeing an end of their miſery—with, perhaps—a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual increaſe and aggravation of it, from their increaſing wickedneſs and guilt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IF any thing can awaken our fears, ſurely it ought to be a dread of our falling into this place of torment<note n="*">Luke xii. 4, 5.</note>.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="unknown:014137_0127_0F97D501BB4EA9B8"/>of Chriſt, who hope for ſalvation through faith in him and obedience to his goſpel, muſt do much more, and go much farther in the duties of religion and ſound mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, than theſe. The following may ſerve as a few illuſtrations of this obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. OTHERS, even <hi>publicans</hi> and <hi>ſinners may</hi> and <hi>do</hi> love thoſe that love them: But we muſt love and wiſh well to our enemies; pray for them and do them good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. OTHERS <hi>may</hi> and <hi>do</hi> take ſome care of the decency of their outward behaviour, that they may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before men: But we muſt watch over the moſt hidden movements, thoughts and deſires of our hearts; —labour to approve ourſelves to the eye of GOD, and to keep conſciences, as well as appearances, void of offence both towards GOD and man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. OTHERS will <hi>ſometimes</hi> mind religion when they have nothing elſe to do, either for their worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or profit: But we muſt make religion the <hi>principal leading</hi> buſineſs of our lives, to which all things muſt give way.</p>
            <p n="4">4. OTHERS perform the duties of religion, as a <hi>diſagreeable taſk,</hi> either to ſtand fair in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, or to ſatisfy the importunate demands of conſcience: But we muſt <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>rejoice</hi> in them, as our moſt ſweet and pleaſurable enjoyments.</p>

            <p n="8">8.

            <p n="9">9. OTHERS, even <hi>publicans</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> may and do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attend the duties of public religion: But, we muſt alſo be found conſcientious in the religion of the <hi>family</hi> and <hi>cloſet;</hi> in the duties of <hi>private</hi> and <hi>ſecret</hi> devotion.</p>
            <p n="10">10. OTHERS perform <hi>ſome duties,</hi> and deny <hi>ſome ſins:</hi> But we muſt be governed throughout by a principle of <hi>uniform obedience;</hi> hating every falſe way, and having an equal reſpect to all GOD'S commandments, as <hi>holy, juſt</hi> and <hi>good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11.

            <p n="13">13. OTHERS will <hi>ſin</hi> rather than <hi>ſuffer:</hi> But we muſt <hi>ſuffer</hi> rather than <hi>ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. OTHERS render evil for evil, and railing for railing: But if we would be the true diſciples of Chriſt, we muſt render <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> after the moſt amiable and perfect example of him, who, <q>when he was reviled,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:014137_0129_0F97D502F3B18D10"/>reviled not again: when he ſuffered, threatened not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 23.</note>.</q>

            <head>ESSAY XXV. <hi>Of</hi> HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS, <hi>and the contrary</hi> VICES.</head>
            <p n="1">1. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS is a very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive virtue, and eſſentially neceſſary to every Chriſtian. It conſiſts in the prevailing bent and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the mind and heart towards GOD, and the things of God and heaven; and is directly oppoſed to <hi>worldly-mindedneſs, earthly-mindedneſs, covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS neceſſarily preſuppoſes <hi>regeneration, converſion,</hi> a change of mind and heart be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace, or a ſanctified nature, in ſome degree at leaſt; for every man, by nature, is <hi>earthly, ſenſual, devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> not having the Spirit of GOD;—ſeeing that that which is born of the fleſh <hi>is</hi> and <hi>muſt be fleſh;</hi>—and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>unrenewed</hi> mind, is <hi>enmity againſt</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HEAVENLY-MINDEDNESS will principally ſhew it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the following inſtances:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) IN a ſupreme regard to GOD above the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The heavenly-minded man loves GOD and the Saviour, although unſeen, above all things in this world, by means of that faith which is the evidence of things not ſeen, and the ſubſtance of things hoped for. No object of ſight or ſenſe ſo ſtrongly moves the nobleſt affections of his ſoul, or ſo powerfully elicites and draws forth his defires, as an inviſible GOD, and an exalted Redeemer, whom having not ſeen, he loves, and in whom, although now he ſees them not, he yet rejoices with joy unſpeakable and full of glory<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 8.</note>. Tell the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:014137_0131_0F97D504735C5890"/>heavenly-minded man of enjoying riches, power, pomp or honour;—recount to him the various gratifications and pleaſures of ſenſe—of women, wine, luxurious and delicate living;—place his affections to all theſe, and deſires of enjoying them, over againſt his love of an unſeen GOD and Saviour, and his deſire of enjoying them;—put it to his choice, and he will deſpiſe the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> in comparriſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. iv. 6, 7.—xlii. 1,—4.—lxiii. 1, &amp;c.—lxxiii. 25.</note>.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THE heavenly-minded man ſees and enjoys GOD in his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>providences.</hi> His mind is turned to a contemplation of GOD in his vaſt and wonderful works. In theſe he has a deep and affecting conviction of the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of him who made them all. He taſtes the goodneſs of GOD in every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of ſenſe; in every pleaſure and refreſhment. He eyes and enjoys GOD in every diſpenſation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. He receives every mercy as the gift of GOD, and a freſh obligation to gratitude, love and praiſe; and hears the voice of GOD in every affliction, reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chaſtening and calling him home from ſin, or quickening him to the performance of ſome long-ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected duty.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THE heavenly-minded man, converſes with, and enjoys GOD, in his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>ordinances.</hi> He reads the ſcriptures diligently, with correſpondent holy affections; with gratitude and ſpiritual deſire and appetite. He hears GOD ſpeaking to his ſoul in them; trembles at his word; delights in the purity of his laws, humbly ſubmits to their authority, and feeds pleaſurably upon his promiſes and offers of mercy. He frequents ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, with no other view than to <hi>glorify</hi> and <hi>enjoy</hi> GOD in them. In <hi>prayer,</hi> he really, humbly and delightfully converſes with GOD. In <hi>praiſe</hi> his ſoul exalts and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Almighty. He hears ſermons that he may
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:014137_0132_0F97D5053363C300"/>the better know GOD, and his duty, and love them; and that he may, by this means, cleanſe his way, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his life, and get ſtrength for both. He prepares for ſacraments and attends them, that he may actually renew his covenant with GOD, and receive comfort and ſtrength to keep it ſtedfaſtly: And he has a pleaſure and delight in theſe duties, ſuperior to any which he feels in the enjoyments of this earth<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. xxvii. 4, 5.—lxiii. 1, 2.—lxv. 4.—lxxxiv. —xix. 7,—10.—cxix. 73, 127.—cxxii. 1,—4.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) THE heavenly-minded man has a turn for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualizing all the common occurrences and events of life. He is diſpoſed to give a uſeful and edifying turn to every topic of converſation; and to profit even by the worſt, or moſt common things that happen to himſelf, or to others around him. It would be endleſs to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this remark.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) THE heavenly-minded man, having his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, his heart, his hopes, his treaſure, and the object of his deareſt love, and ſtrongeſt deſire in heaven, muſt needs have a peculiar and uncommon delight in thoſe companions, and in that kind of conference and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which are employed about ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. Companions and converſation of this kind, exactly hit his taſte, as his mind is high and heavenly bent. This is ſo juſt and obvious a character of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindedneſs, that it needs no farther confirmation or illuſtration.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) THE heavenly-minded man may be ſaid to live by the faith and hope of unſeen and heavenly things. He conſiders this world but as a wilderneſs through which he is journeying towards his Father's houſe, and eternal inheritance. Hence, preſent things affect him but little, as preſent conveniences would a travelling wayfaring man. He had rather have them than want them; but
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:014137_0133_0F97D505F36A1818"/>if he ſuffers a little in his journey, he cares not much for it. His Father, his Redeemer and almighty friend, and his brethren and ſiſters in Chriſt which has left this world, are in heaven before him; his treaſure is there; his reſt, reward, crown, and inheritance are there.— His heart therefore muſt be there alſo.—He is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>habitually, believingly, hopefully</hi> and <hi>joyfully</hi> looking for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to his journey's end. And indeed, the more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the eye of his faith and hope is fixed upon the heavenly prize, <hi>i. e.</hi> the more heavenly-minded he is, the leſs will he regard or mind the things that are around him, or the croſs accidents that happen to him on his journey thither. Hence it follows; that he walks by <hi>faith,</hi> not by <hi>ſight;</hi> looketh not on the things that are ſeen and temporal, but at the things which are unſeen and eternal;—ſetteth his affection on things above, and not on things below. His fears and cares, hopes and deſires, ſorrows and joys, are chiefly of the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> kind, and but <hi>little, ſeldom,</hi> and <hi>moderately</hi> moved about this world, and the things of it, which paſs away. On the contrary, earthly-mindedneſs, diſcovers itſelf by the following marks:—A loving and preferring the creature above GOD;—the body and its concerns above the ſoul and its intereſt;—earth above heaven;—the objects and enjoyments of ſight and ſenſe, above thoſe of faith and hope. The earthly-minded man, prefers mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney before grace;—earthly honour above heavenly;— the favour of men before that of GOD;—a good living in this world, before the hopes of heavenly bleſſedneſs. He is little moved by the <hi>works</hi> or <hi>providences</hi> of GOD; little affected by <hi>his word;</hi>—little delighted with <hi>his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> or <hi>people;</hi> has no pleaſurable reliſh for holineſs itſelf, or the means of attaining it: But performs theſe, if he does perform them at all, in a <hi>cuſtomary, formal, earnal, lifeleſs</hi> manner, to ſtop the mouth of conſcience;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:014137_0134_0F97D506B374C290"/>to pleaſe the world and promote worldly ends; or to be ſeen and praiſed of men.</p>

2. GOSPEL ſincerity ſuppoſes a ſingle aim and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleaſing GOD, in the whole of our courſe. And although this intention may not be actually alive in our hearts, as the moving and producing cauſe of every ſingle action; yet if we are <hi>ſincere,</hi> it muſt be our <hi>habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, prevailing intention;</hi> and wherever we have time to <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>deliberate</hi> about the nature of any action, this muſt be our <hi>actual intention</hi> in it; and that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this intention prevails with us.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. GOSPEL ſincerity, ſuppoſes an impartial enquiry into our duty, what it is;—a hearty deſire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know, in every inſtance, <hi>what is the good</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> and <hi>holy will of the Lord,</hi> and how <hi>we may ſo walk as to pleaſe</hi> GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Theſ. iv. 1.</note>.

Nathaniel's</hi> conduct affords a fine illuſtration of this branch of ſincerity; and our Saviour ſeems to fix the noble character he gives him, on his impartial enquiry after truth<note n="*" place="bottom">John iii.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. GOSPEL ſincerity runs through the whole of a man's religious character and conduct, and ſuppoſes an entire and univerſal application to the practice of duty, ſo far as we know it, without any ſtated, allowed reſerves to the contrary. The ſincere man, as his governing aim is to pleaſe and ſerve GOD, ſo he will be as careful of the exerciſe of every grace and virtue, in the frame and temper of the heart, as in the outward actions of the life.—He will be as careful and watchful over his <hi>private</hi> conduct, as his <hi>public;</hi>—as ſorry for his <hi>ſecret</hi> ſins, and the follies of his <hi>heart,</hi> as for his outward offences; —as devout and conſtant in the religion of the <hi>family</hi> and <hi>cloſet,</hi> as in that of the <hi>church;</hi>—as conſcientious in ſhunning one ſin as another, and in performing one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as another. And indeed, there cannot be a more <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>deciſive trial</hi> of our ſincerity than this; namely, to examine and obſerve how we ſtand affected to thoſe parts of morality and religion, to which none but GOD <hi>and our own conſciences</hi> are privy. If we perform theſe as carefully and circumſpectly, as we do the moſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and viſible duties, which are ſeen and praiſed of men, then may we conclude on juſt grounds, that we have truth in the heart, and ſincerity in the inward parts.</p>

5. SINCERITY ſuppoſes a conformity and agreement between the ſentiments of a man's heart and his words and actions. A ſincere man will not ſay that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a doctrine which he really does not believe, to pleaſe, or gain the good opinion of any man. He will not ſpeak of exerciſes, feelings, or experiences which he never had, in order to obtain any privilege:—He will not profeſs a ſorrow for ſin which he feels not, nor reſolution of repentance and amendment which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly nor ſolemnly made. The ſincere man, either ſpeaks not at all, in matters of religion, or elſe ſpeaks ſincerely what he thinks. He <hi>canteth</hi> not, he <hi>diſſembleth</hi> not, he <hi>lieth</hi> not either <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>concerning</hi> GOD, or the things of his ſoul.—St. <hi>Peter</hi> was flagrantly guilty of this kind of <hi>inſincerity</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. ii. 11,—14.</note>, and ſo are all hypocrites.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE ſame thing will ſincerity produce in all our conduct <hi>towards men.</hi> A ſincere man will ſcorn to uſe <hi>trick, artifice,</hi> and <hi>diſſimulation,</hi> to gain his ends with his fellow-creatures; he will not pretend friendſhip or kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs where he has none; nor make promiſes which he intends not to perform; nor act an unfriendly part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind men's backs, after profeſſions of reſpect and regard to their faces;—much leſs will he ſtoop to the baſeneſs of making pretences of friendſhip, on purpoſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on men, or uſe ſly inſinuations to draw things from them in the freedom of diſcourſe, with the murderous deſign of divulging theſe very things afterwards to their diſadvantage. This is the wicked cunning and craftineſs of the old ſerpent, and not the <hi>openneſs</hi> and <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> of a Chriſtian indeed, in whom there ſhould be no guile.</p>
            <p n="7">7. WE are obliged to this temper and conduct by numberleſs conſiderations: (1.) It is expreſsly required by the precepts of our religion<note n="‡" place="bottom">Joſh. xxiv. 14. John vi. 24. Rom. xii. 8. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We cannot have peace of mind, or ſtand acquitted at the bar of our own conſciences, if we are inſincere in religion, 1 John iii. 19,—21. 2 Cor. i. 12. Gal. vi. 4. (4.) To be ſincere in religion, would ſave the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of it abundance of trouble which hypocriſy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions them. The eaſieſt and ſureſt way of ſeeming to be religious, is to be ſo in reality; and it is the moſt difficult and diſagreeable taſk in the world to be ever wearing a maſk and falſe diſguiſe. (5.) Inſincerity is the very image of the <hi>devil,</hi> that <hi>ſubtile, malicious, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, guileful</hi> old ſerpent, who transformeth himſelf into an angel of light.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

            <head>ESSAY XXVII. CHRISTIAN ZEAL, <hi>and its</hi> OPPOSITES <hi>and</hi> COUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERFEITS.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ZEAL ſeems properly to ſignify, a <hi>heat, fervour</hi> and <hi>impetuoſity</hi> of <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>action;</hi> and is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> either a <hi>virtue</hi> or a <hi>vice,</hi> either <hi>religious</hi> or <hi>common</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi> according to its objects, and the proportion it bears to their importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. EVEN religious zeal is not ſo much a Chriſtian grace or virtue, as a qualification which ſhould attend the exerciſe of every Chriſtian grace and virtue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſcriptures give as many inſtances of a <hi>bad</hi> zeal as of a <hi>good</hi> one: We cannot therefore be too cautious about what objects our zeal is employed, and in what degree, leſt, while we imagine we are pleaſing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring GOD, we may in fact be diſhonouring and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him, and increaſing our own guilt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As Chriſtian zeal is, however, a very important and indiſpenſible duty, and as we are expreſsly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>be zealous</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 10.</note>, it may be right to enquire into the properties of a true Chriſtian zeal; to conſider its ſpecious and impoſing counterfeits, to ſpeak of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations we are under to be zealous, and of that temper which is contrary to it; and by doing this we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) EVEN a religious zeal is no farther good and commendable, than when it is on the ſide of truth and virtue. The <hi>cauſe</hi> therefore muſt be <hi>good</hi> about which our zeal is concerned, or it will have the moſt miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſequences. To be zealous, that is, to have a
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:014137_0140_0F97D50BF3A9A988"/>ſtrong and ardent concern, for falſehood, and againſt truth; or for vice and againſt virtue, and to act vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly in conſequence of this zeal, is to do the very greateſt miſchief in our power, and to act the <hi>devil,</hi> as much as our capacities and influence will admit. Such was the zeal of the Jews againſt Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and the primitive Chriſtians. Such, particularly, was the zeal of <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> when he <hi>madly,</hi> and with uncommon ardor and activity perſecuted the church of Chriſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts v. 17, 18.—xiii. 45.—xvii. 5. Rom. x. 2. Gal. i. 14. Phil. iii. 6.</note>. The caution therefore of this ſame Apoſtle is extremely appoſite and neceſſary; <q>It is good to be always zealouſly affected in a good thing<note n="†" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 18.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) IGNORANCE of truth and duty, where there is a poſſibility and opportunity of coming to the knowledge of them, will not excuſe in this matter, otherwiſe it would have excuſed St. <hi>Paul</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their miſguided and miſchievous zeal. Therefore, our zeal, eſpecially our religious zeal, ſhould always be preceded by a careful, ſerious enquiry into the truth, and accompanied with knowledge. The reaſon of this is plain; for, of all zeal, religious zeal where it is blind and miſguided is the moſt furious and miſchievous. It is increaſed by the importance of its object; and when it is blind and miſguided, it rages againſt the cauſe and glory of GOD, and the higheſt concerns of men, which are truth and righteouſneſs. We may ſee its dreadful effects in the primitive <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>heathen</hi> perſecutions, and in the ſeas of Proteſtant blood ſpilt by the church of Rome. If the <hi>Jews</hi> had known Chriſt, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; yet ſince they <hi>might</hi> have known him, their ignorance was no excuſe for their zeal againſt him. It was their ſin, that their
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:014137_0141_0F97D50CB3626758"/>zeal of GOD was not according to knowledge<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. x. 2.</note>. What things Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did againſt Chriſt, were <hi>ignorantly thro' unbelief;</hi> yea, he verily thought that he ought to have done them; yet was he not thereby juſtified in doing them<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 12,—15.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) RIGHT and good zeal, muſt be proportioned to the value and importance of the objects about which it is employed. As there is diverſity in the importance even of theſe things which are of divine duty and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſo we ſhould be moſt zealous about the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant things and duties of religion, and proportionably leſs zealous about thoſe things and duties which are of leſs importance. It is the way of hypocrites to be mighty zealous about triſles; about ſmall matters, and ceremonial obſervances, while they are very luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and indifferent, about the greater duties of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>morality.</hi> They tithe <hi>mint, aniſe</hi> and <hi>cummin;</hi> while they neglect the weightier matters of the law, <hi>mercy, judgment</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. xxiii. 23, 24.</note>. How prepoſterous and abſurd is it to ſee a man break charity with his Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the neglect of <hi>modes, ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,</hi> while he would careſs him, though a drunkard, an adulterer, or a profane ſwearer, if he obſerved theſe? Reaſon will teach us, that duties of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſhould be the moſt ardently cared for, and the moſt diligently performed. We would deem him a fool, who would be more concerned about the ſecurity and welfare of his finger or toe, than of his heart or brain. Every thing appertaining to true religion merits our regard and obſervance; but the vitals of religion merit our warmeſt zeal. <q>GOD loveth mercy more than ſacrifice, and righteouſneſs more than all burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:014137_0142_0F97D50D73607358"/>
(4.) TRUE zeal always takes its riſe in <hi>the heart,</hi> and is founded on a <hi>right temper</hi> and <hi>right affections</hi> there. It is termed <hi>fervency of ſpirit</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xii. 11.</note>. Chriſtian zeal is the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vigour, and ſtrenuous activity of every holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſpoſition; and theſe ſprings ſet the active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſoul and body to work in the cauſe of GOD and goodneſs.—And here we may take notice of the <hi>oppoſites</hi> and <hi>counterfeits</hi> of true zeal, in this view of it;— ſuch as, <hi>firſt,</hi> a <hi>Laodicean, careleſs, indolent, lukewarm</hi> temper of mind: The perſon is neither hot nor cold;— he will not wholly throw up a profeſſion of religion; yet is he too indolent and unconcerned to act up to it with becoming earneſtneſs and intenſeneſs, ſpirit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. He, as it were, <hi>halts between two opinions;</hi> his mind is in a ſtate of <hi>torpid equilibrium,</hi> without heat enough to eſpouſe its intereſts and perform its duties, or coldneſs enough to abandon it and give it up. This is the ſad caſe of millions in the Chriſtian church<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. iii. 14,—19.</note>. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> there is a ſeeming counterfeit zeal for religion, where there is no warmth of <hi>affection,</hi> a <hi>bluſtering, noiſy,</hi> profeſſion, ſpending itſelf either in religious diſcourſe or controverſy, or in uncharitable and cenſorious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and railings againſt the characters and profeſſions of others, where there is really no true regard to religion at heart. This ſeems to have been the zeal or (hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy) of the <hi>ſcribes</hi> and <hi>phariſees;</hi> and is well deſcribed by the prophet<note n="§" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxiii. 31. Pſal. lxxviii. 36, 37. Iſa. xxix. 13.</note>. Or, <hi>thirdly,</hi> it is a dreadful counterfeit of true Chriſtian zeal, when men make a great ſhew and ſtir in religion, merely to deceive others, and to obtain <hi>wicked</hi> or <hi>ſecular</hi> ends, as was the caſe with <hi>Jehu,</hi> when he ſaid; "Come ſee my zeal for the Lord<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Kings x. 16.</note>."</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) TRUE Chriſtian zeal always begins at home; it firſt caſts the beam out of our own eye; its indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:014137_0143_0F97D50E3366E7B0"/>riſes higheſt at our own faults; it is vigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for our own reformation, correction, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in knowledge and grace; perfection and final ſecurity and happineſs. It is abſurd to imagine, that a man can have any right and true hatred of ſin in others, while he has none againſt it in himſelf; or that a man ſhould be anxiouſly concerned for another man's reformation, ſalvation and happineſs, while he has no regard to his own.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) TRUE Chriſtian zeal is ever properly employed about others in the <hi>ſecond place.</hi> Chriſtians are zealous of good works, both in themſelves and others<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 14.</note>. We have inſtances of this kind, Acts xvii. 16. Rev. ii. 2. Charity ſhould quicken our zeal both <hi>againſt the ſins</hi> and for <hi>the happineſs</hi> of others. <hi>David</hi> was grieved, and ſhed tears, when he beheld tranſgreſſors.—<hi>Lot</hi> was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the filthy converſation of the wicked. Chriſt caſt the money changers out of the court of the temple, and in this was fulfilled in him that ſcripture, <q>The zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up.</q> 
               <hi>Paul's</hi> ſpirit was moved, at the ſight of <hi>Athenian</hi> idolatry. True zeal will engage us to reprove the ſins of others, in a proper place, time and manner<note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. v. 11. Tit. i. 10,—13. 2 Tim. iv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. True zeal againſt ſin, will make us ſhun ſinful companions, Pſal. cii. 4.—It will alſo engage us to do all the good for the ſouls of others that we can, Eccleſ. ix. 10.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THAT we may ſhun irregularities in the exerciſes of our zeal towards others, we ſhould obſerve the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing cautions: 1. Let us take heed of a cenſorious, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable ſpirit in our reproofs of others.—This is a zeal <hi>unchriſtian</hi> and <hi>without knowledge,</hi> and is never likely to do any good. 2. Let us beware of <hi>paſſion</hi> and <hi>wrath</hi> in our zeal to reclaim and reform tranſgreſſors. Love to the perſon of the offender, and meekneſs ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:014137_0144_0F97D50EF6A26F58"/>our moſt zealous endeavours to reform him: For, in this caſe, as in others, <hi>the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD. 3. The inſtruments of Chriſtian zeal, are <hi>ſcripture, reaſon</hi> and <hi>perſuaſion.</hi> It is a wicked, antichriſtian, unwarrantable zeal, to deſtroy men's bodies, or rob them of their intereſts, for the good of their ſouls. This is the zeal of Popiſh inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. 4. Our zeal ſhould be tempered with <hi>prudence.</hi> The zeal of a private Chriſtian cannot, with prudence, be carried ſo far in the reformation of abuſes, as that of a <hi>magiſtrate</hi> or <hi>public miniſter of religion.</hi> Although every Chriſtian ſhould be zealous for the propagation of truth and goodneſs, yet the meaſure of his zeal ſhould cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with his ſtation.—Beſides, the exertions of our zeal againſt ſin ſhould be regulated, by the character of offenders, and the nature of their offences. <hi>Public, bold</hi> and <hi>ſhameleſs</hi> offenders are to be <hi>rebuked ſharply</hi>

            <p n="8">(8.) TRUE Chriſtian zeal is enforced upon us by many reaſons and obligations: 1. The importance of religion deſerves our zeal.—2. The difficulties that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the right diſcharge of our Chriſtian duty require zeal, and render it neceſſary.—3. We can have no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our own ſincerity, without becoming fervour and earneſtneſs in the duties of religion; for, conſidering the unſpeakable importance of religion, if we are <hi>truly</hi> concerned about it at all, it muſt be <hi>zealouſly.</hi>— 4. We ſhall never do much good to the ſouls of others, or much honour to our common Chriſtianity, without a proper degree of Chriſtian zeal.—5. We have the examples of the <hi>prophets,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of all eminently good men, to countenance
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:014137_0145_0F97D50FB31D57A8"/>and encourage us in a zealous adherence to religion, and in the zealous practice of the duties of it.</p>

            <p n="3">3. THAT we have the command and poſſeſſion of our own ſouls and are not rifled or diſcompoſed, by the croſs or painful accidents of life; but that we are ſo much <hi>our own man</hi> as to ſee, and ſteadily to purſue and perform the duties which become us as <hi>men,</hi> and <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. PATIENCE will prevent us from making haſty judgments either concerning GOD or <hi>man;</hi> either againſt ourſelves or others. <hi>Impatience</hi> makes men fretful and diſcontented, and hurries them on in the heat of their ſpirits, to raſh and wicked judgments both of GOD and

            <p n="5">5.

               </gap> the following reaſons.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IMPATIENCE under afflictions, or in the delay of expected good, can be of no manner of ſervice to us, but muſt do us a great deal of hurt. Our fretting and murmuring under afflictions, diſcompoſe us, and make their weight <hi>double.</hi> It ſhews a rebellious temper, and renders us unworthy of the relief which we deſire; while, at the ſame time, it cannot procure us any relief, but muſt needs make our caſe worſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. WE deſerve no good thing at the hand of GOD, but all evil, even <hi>eternal miſery;</hi> and therefore, if we <hi>think right,</hi> a living man has no right to complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins; but it is his evident duty to bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe he hath ſinned againſt him. If we had our deſerts, we would be in hell; therefore, we ſhould bear patiently every afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is ſhort of this.</p>
            <p n="10">10. EVEN where GOD hath made promiſes to deliver his people from afflictions, or to beſtow upon them mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he hath not <hi>ordinarily</hi> limitted himſelf to <hi>any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time:</hi> but juſtly expects that we ſhould refer the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> wholly to his own infinite juſtice, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs, and wait upon him believingly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently and reſignedly for the event.</p>
            <p n="11">11. GOD'S mercies and deliverances are ſo <hi>full, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete</hi> and <hi>ſatisfying</hi> in themſelves; and the very ſmalleſt of them is ſo great an honour, when conferred by ſo great a being, upon ſuch worthleſs, undeſerving and hell-deſerving creatures as we are, that it becomes us to wait patiently for them, in the moſt diligent and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denying means, all the days of our lives.

<pb n="150" facs="unknown:014137_0149_0F97D512B30C92B0"/>Thus Chriſt was anointed to <hi>preach good tidings to the meek:</hi> And GOD dwells with them who are of a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and who tremble at his word; and guides the meek in judgment<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxv. 9. Iſa. lxi. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. MEEKNESS towards GOD, implies an <hi>humble, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential ſubmiſſion</hi> to his <hi>providential will,</hi> in its <hi>ſevereſt</hi> and <hi>moſt afflictive diſpenſations.</hi> And this is ſubmiſſion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the will of GOD, in oppoſition to a fretful, murmuring, impatient ſpirit againſt his providence. The man who is thus meek towards GOD, is dumb and openeth not his mouth; and is ſtill, and ſubmits quietly to the rod; and humbles himſelf under the mighty hand of GOD, and accepts the puniſhment of his iniquities, and ſays with Eli, <q>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. MEEKNESS, as it is a right temper of mind and ſpirit towards our neighbour, conſiſts in a ſweet and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, courteous and obliging, peaceable and compoſed temper and behaviour, and is oppoſed to a boiſterous, unruly, moroſe, revengeful, and more eſpecially to a ſurly and angry temper and conduct towards others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE meek perſon is calm under provocations, and, having a command over his own ſpirit, is not hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to curſing, railing, reproachful language, or to haſty reſentment and revenge, which always drives peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of furious, ungoverned paſſions, to ſinful, and often to very unjuſt and injurious extremes. The meek man will never be angry without a cauſe, or above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; will never take an affront where none is meant, nor reſent a real affront above what it deſerves. He is ſlow to wrath; not eaſily provoked; thinketh no evil; ſpeaketh not unadviſedly with his lips; rendereth not railing for railing; but, by ſoft and reaſonable anſwers, turneth away wrath, and overcometh evil with good. Anger reſteth in the boſom of fools: But it is not ſo
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:014137_0150_0F97D5137402A6C8"/>with the meek man; he letteth not the ſun go down on his wrath. If his brother ſin againſt him <hi>ſeventy-ſeven</hi> times in a day, and ſay, <hi>I repent,</hi> he forgiveth him, and eaſily maketh up any breach, upon proper acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment and ſubmiſſion. <hi>Peace</hi> is his <hi>element,</hi> and wrath the averſion of his nature.</p>
            <p n="7">7. MEEKNESS diſcovers itſelf, in a great cautiouſneſs of giving offence to others. Proud, angry, wrathful and turbulent men, are not cautious of this: They are perpetually giving offence, and ſeem to delight and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it, as a ſign of courage. But the goſpel teacheth us to ſpeak evil, (unneceſſarily) of no man; not to be brawlers, but gentle, kind, tender-hearted, thus ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all meekneſs to all men<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. iii. 2.</note>. The meek man is ever a civil, affable, courteous man; and a good heart teaches him that which is the grand precept in <hi>politeneſs</hi> and <hi>true good breeding;</hi> namely, to give no oftence or uneaſineſs to any in company; but to endeavour to give pleaſure and ſatisfaction to all, ſo far as that may be done with a good conſcience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. MEEKNESS will ſhew itſelf in a modeſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming deportment in every different rank, ſtation and relation of life. It will make <hi>ſervants, children,</hi> and all <hi>inferiors</hi> contented and pleaſed with their low and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſtations; the poor with their poverty, and the afflicted with their afflictions. And it will make ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors humble in their exalted ſtations, affable, and courteous, juſt and merciful, mild and gentle to thoſe that are under them, in inferior ſtates.</p>
            <p n="6">6. ABOVE all, a meek temper will ſhew itſelf in things that relate to religion. Surely the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of GOD. We are to contend indeed earneſtly for the faith once delivered to the ſaints, and not to deny or diſſemble what, we take to be the truth of the goſpel, even at the riſque of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:014137_0151_0F97D5143310D488"/>life itſelf: But to manage religious diſputes and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies with angry contention and a perſecuting ſpirit, is to defend and maintain truth in a manner quite op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the temper and ſpirit of the goſpel, and which is never like to make proſelytes. It is to offer a holy ſacrifice with unhallowed fire,—and, like <hi>Uzzah,</hi> to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the ark of GOD, by a <hi>wrong touch:</hi> Therefore, we are commanded, <q>In meekneſs to inſtruct thoſe who oppoſe themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii, 25.</note>. To be ready to give an anſwer to every man that aſketh us a reaſon of the hope that is in us, with meekneſs and fear<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 15.</note>.</q> And even <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending brethren</hi> are to be treated, and if poſſible recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſnares of the <hi>devil,</hi> 
               <q>In the ſpirit of meekneſs<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. vi. 1.</note>. Nay, the wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, (or meek) full of mercy and good works;</q>—and a wiſe and knowing man in religion, is to rule his tongue and angry paſſions, and to ſhew, out of a good converſation, his works, with <hi>meekneſs of wiſdom</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Jam. iii. 13, &amp;c.</note>. Indeed, the very genius of the goſpel is <hi>meekneſs.</hi>—It is the miniſtry of reconciliation with GOD and man.—It proclaims <hi>peace upon earth,</hi> as well as <hi>good will towards men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. WE cannot be Chriſtians without this temper; without all <hi>lowlineſs</hi> and <hi>meekneſs:</hi> For, this is the very temper and ſpirit of Chriſt, and he has commanded us to take his yoke upon us and learn of him; for, ſays he, "I am meek and low of heart." And this <hi>temper</hi> he eminently expreſſed through the whole of his own life.</p>
            <p n="11">11. MEEKNESS is one of the fruits of the regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſanctifying ſpirit, without which we are ſure, none will enter into the kingdom of heaven. Indeed, the moſt of theſe fruits, as enumerated by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:014137_0152_0F97D514F3299860"/>branches of meekneſs. <q>Meekneſs, love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs;</q>—and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of the works of the fleſh, are directly the oppoſites of meekneſs; ſuch as, <q>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife and envyings.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. MEEKNESS is a grace exceedingly ornamental to the Chriſtian character. We are commanded to be clothed with humility (which is a ſiſter grace to meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) <q>and to put on the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight or GOD, of great price<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. iii. 4.</note>.</q> It is ſaid alſo, <q>that he who is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 32.</note>.</q> The meek alſo are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>bleſſed,</hi> by our Saviour, and have a promiſe that they ſhall <hi>inherit the earth</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matth. v. 5.</note>.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE meek man has the only chance of going <hi>eaſily, quietly</hi> and <hi>happily</hi> through the world. Nothing that happens will much rifle or diſturb him, and his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will render him beloved and admired by all.</p>

            <p n="15">15.

            <head>ESSAY XXX. CHARITY, <hi>and the oppoſite</hi> VICES.</head>
            <p n="1">1. CHARITY is but another word for <hi>love;</hi> and when it is uſed as a term in divinity, in its largeſt and moſt extenſive ſenſe, it ſignifies the whole of our duty to GOD and man, both in its principle and proper fruits and effects. In a word, charity is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the whole law, and includes the two great commandments laid down by our Saviour as the ſum and ſubſtance of the law and the prophets. <q>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy GOD with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, &amp;c. and thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</q> Charity, therefore, in this largeſt ſenſe, implies a right temper of mind, both to GOD and our <hi>neighbour,</hi> and all its genuine fruits and effects, and therefore, is the whole of true religion and morality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS grace or virtue, as it reſpects GOD, (1.) preſuppoſes a right knowledge of GOD; that we know him, or have worthy and juſt conceptions of him in his adorable and amiable perfections (for there is not a more certain maxim, than that we can have no love for an unknown object;) and this knowledge, though it may be obtained in part, and in ſome degree, from his works and providences, yet it is moſt perfectly obtained from his revealed word, illuſtrated and ſet home upon the ſoul by the influences of his Spirit. (2.) It implies that we love him <hi>ſupremely,</hi> and above all other beings; for if we do not love him <hi>thus,</hi> we do not love him as GOD; or the affection does not correſpond with the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:014137_0154_0F97D5178D18C498"/>object of it. (3.) It implies that we are cheerfully and cordially devoted to his ſervice and obedience: <q>for this is the love of GOD, that we keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 THE vices oppoſite to this branch of charity— are, (1.) A wilful and careleſs ignorance of GOD; a neglecting the means of knowing him and acquainting ourſelves with him, without which it is impoſſible we ſhould love him as we ought. (2.) An exceſſive <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> or love of any creature, or creature enjoyment, by which the ſupreme love and affection of the ſoul is ſtolen away from GOD, and placed on the creature; which is <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual idolatry.</hi> (3.) All ſin and vice is a violation of this branch of charity; but more eſpecially thoſe ſins, which ſtrike moſt directly at the <hi>glory of</hi> GOD, ſuch as <hi>blaſphemy, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſwearing, atheiſtical</hi> thoughts and ſpeeches, ſpeaking irreverently and ſlighting of GOD, his works, word, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, laws, and people. Indeed, the natural mind is enmity againſt GOD, and none but ſuch as are born of him, can truly love him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſecond grand branch of charity, and as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as the former, is <hi>love to our neighbour.</hi> And this may be divided into two branches, <hi>humanity</hi> and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>charity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. EVERY man, in ſcripture account, is <hi>our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> be of what <hi>nation,</hi> or <hi>religion</hi> he will, and we owe <hi>love</hi> or <hi>charity</hi> to every man as ſuch; as our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; a partaker with us in the ſame common nature; as ſprung from the ſame original ſtock, a creature of the ſame GOD, an inhabitant with us of the ſame world; ſubject to the ſame feelings, paſſions, appetites, wants, neceſſities, miſeries with ourſelves, and bound with us to the ſame eternal world. From which relations naturally flow the duties of juſtice, ſympathy, mercy, compaſſion, all ſpringing from the root of charity or love to our neighbour. Hence we are to <hi>owe no man
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:014137_0155_0F97D517F33B72B0"/>any thing but love;</hi> and <hi>this love</hi> is the <hi>fulfilling of the whole law,</hi> as far as it reſpects our neighbour; becauſe it will naturally and powerfully diſpoſe us to treat our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in all reſpects <hi>as we ought,</hi> wherever it truly takes place, and prevails in the heart.</p>
            <p n="6">6. CONTRARY to this branch of <hi>charity</hi> or <hi>humanity,</hi> is all injuſtice, evil-ſpeaking, evil-thinking, or raſh and cenſorious judging of our neighbour; all narrow, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal prejudices againſt men; all local, contracted affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhut out a party of mankind from our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, on account of their being of a different nation or religion from ourſelves; all envy, malice, and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards our fellow-creatures, and all partiality in the adminiſtration of juſtice.</p>
            <p n="7">7. CHRISTIAN <hi>charity</hi> or <hi>love,</hi> properly ſo called, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a peculiar affection for our fellow Chriſtians, under the notion of their being <hi>our brethren;</hi> diſciples of the ſame LORD and Maſter; ſpiritual children of the ſame GOD by adoption and regeneration; heirs of the ſame precious hope, and incorruptible inheritance; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-pilgrims in the ſame ſtrange country, and fellow-travellers together to the ſame land of promiſe. This is ſtill an advance upon humanity, and unites Chriſtians together in the moſt peculiar bonds; ſo that whatever is a violation of the laws and bonds of common <hi>humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> is much more ſo of the laws of <hi>Chriſtian charity.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, charity, or Chriſtian love, is the peculiar genius of chriſtianity, and is that grace which Chriſt has honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by making it the peculiar and diſtinctive badge of his diſciples. <q>By this, ſays Chriſt, ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if you have love one for another.</q> Nor is the exerciſe of any grace ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged upon Chriſtians, as this.</p>
            <p n="8">8. A PECULIAR fruit of charity is <hi>alms-giving,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the neceſſities of the <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>needy,</hi> the <hi>miſerable</hi> and the <hi>oppreſſed;</hi> and indeed, this is what commonly
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:014137_0156_0F97D518B4D69898"/>paſſes in the world by the name of <hi>charity,</hi> though very unjuſtly: For, the Apoſtle aſſures us, that a man may <hi>give</hi> even <hi>all his goods to feed the poor,</hi> and yet <hi>have no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> An alms, if it proceeds not from <hi>charity,</hi> that is, from a true Chriſtian love to GOD and our neighbour, and from a principle of dutiful obedience to GOD, is no grace at all.</p>
            <p n="9">9. WE have an excellent character and deſcription of charity given, 1 Cor. xiii. 4, &amp;c. <q>Charity ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth long and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave itſelf unſeemly; ſeeketh not her own; is not eaſily provoked; thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things; believeth all things; hopeth all things; endureth all things: Charity never faileth. And now abideth faith, hope and charity, theſe three; but the greateſt of theſe is charity.</q>

            <p n="1">1. CONTENTMENT is a grace which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects only our <hi>outward condition in this world,</hi> and not our ſpiritual condition here, or our lot and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in the world to come; and it conſiſts in ſuch a moderate value for, and attachment to the things and enjoyments of the body and of this mortal life, that whether we have or want them; whether we have little or much of them, we are ſo well ſatisfied, and ſo little diſturbed, that we are thankful to GOD for what we

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. CONTENTMENT cannot reach to a man's ſpiritual condition or future ſtate; for, although a ſinner may have reaſon to thank GOD that he is out of <hi>hell;</hi> yet, it would ill become him to ſay, <q>Whatever ſtate my ſoul is in, whether in a ſtate of grace or ſin, converted or unconverted, I am therewith contented.</q> The deſign of GOD'S word is, that ſinners ſhould have no peace or contentment in their ſinful and periſhing condition, and that they ſhould never reſt contented, till their peace is made with GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. NOR would it become a gracious man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with low attainments in grace and holineſs, and an imperfect meaſure of conformity to GOD.

            <head>ESSAY XXXII. CHASTITY <hi>and the contrary</hi> VICES.</head>
            <p n="1">1. GOD hath implanted in the ſexes ſuch appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and affections towards each other as are neceſſary for the propagation of our kind, and without which, probably the firſt command, <q>Multiply and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh the earth,</q> would not have been readily obeyed. And it is here worth obſerving, as a proof of the divine wiſdom and goodneſs, that a natural pleaſure is annexed to thoſe actions by which our kind is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, and life ſupported and ſuſtained.</p>
            <p n="2">2. CHASTITY conſiſts in the regulation of theſe appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and deſires between the ſexes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As GOD hath implanted no natural appetites in his creatures, for which he hath not provided lawful gratifications; ſo the appetites between the ſexes, may be gratified in a lawful manner. Wherefore, chaſtity conſiſts not in <hi>eradicating</hi> theſe natural appetites, but in <hi>regulating</hi> them; reſtraining them within the bounds of moderation, and directing them to right objects. Hence appears the unreaſonableneſs of <hi>celebacy</hi> and a <hi>monaſtic life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. ALTHOUGH brutes, generally ſpeaking, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably moderate in the gratification of theſe appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, yet they cannot be called <hi>chaſte,</hi> having no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and being under no moral or divine law. <hi>Chaſtity</hi> therefore is a <hi>human</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> virtue, ariſing from reaſon, reflection, and ſubmiſſion to the authority of a divine law.</p>
            <p n="5">5. REASON and <hi>reflection</hi> will quickly convince us that the looſe and unbounded gratification of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:014137_0162_0F97D51D33EDEA30"/>between the ſexes, would be productive of the greateſt miſchiefs in human ſociety; and therefore <hi>marriage,</hi> (the only remedy againſt this miſchief) has been held ſacred and venerable among almoſt all nations, who have had little elſe than the dictates of natural reaſon for their guide. Indeed, other gratifications of theſe appetites have been tolerated among ſome of them. And the more brutiſh theſe nations have been, the more unbounded and unreſtrained have they been in the gratifications of theſe appetites, (witneſs the ancient Britons.)</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE Chriſtian revelation has limitted the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe appetites to <hi>one woman</hi> and <hi>one man,</hi> in a ſtate of marriage, during the life of either of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and has ſtrictly, and upon the ſevereſt penalties, forbid the gratification of them in any other way: The reaſons of which limitation and prohibition, are very wiſe, and ſufficiently obvious: Hence we may learn what is <hi>unchaſtity,</hi> in <hi>deed, word,</hi> and <hi>thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. UNCHASTITY in <hi>deed,</hi> is when ſingle and unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried perſons do at all actually gratify theſe appetites; or when married perſons at all actually gratify them, with any other perſons than their own huſbands or wives; and is diſtinguiſhed into ſins of <hi>fornication, adultery, inceſt, poligamy, ſodomy</hi> and <hi>ſelf-pollution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. UNCHASTITY in thought or deſire, is when one of either ſex, looketh upon one of the contrary ſex, which is a forbidden object, ſo as to luſt after them, or deſire criminal converſe with them. And how much more criminally unchaſte muſt it be, ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the heart with an abſent, forbidden object, as to act over the guilty ſcene in imagination?</p>
            <p n="9">9. UNCHASTITY in word, is when we uſe ſuch fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſcene language, as has a tendency to excite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſte thoughts and deſires, either in ourſelves, or others. In order to maintain and preſerve our chaſtity,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:014137_0163_0F97D51DF3D0FBF0"/>the following things ſeem neceſſary and uſeful:—(1.) To pray for, and endeavour after <hi>true converſion,</hi> or a <hi>new, clean,</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> heart; for while we have a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our paſſions and appetites will ever be inordinate and ungovernable.—(2.) To ſhun all unneceſſary inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and familiarity with forbidden objects of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſex, by which we may inſenſibly contract unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſires, which may in time lead to criminal actions; or, where a friendſhip is cultivated between the ſexes, to improve it to the promoting of purity and virtue.—(3.) To chuſe and conſort with ſuch companions of our own ſex, as are moſt chaſte and modeſt in their language and deportment; and on the contrary, to ſhun all lewd, immodeſt, profligate companions, who will ſoon vitiate our taſte, and corrupt our manners.—(4.) To be much in reading the ſcriptures, and ſuch other books, as tend to purify the mind, and inſpire chaſte and holy thoughts; and cautiouſly to ſhun the peruſal of looſe plays, ſongs, romances, and ſuch traſh as corrupt and debauch the mind.—(5.) Often to examine our own hearts, and meditate on the extreme evil and danger of unchaſtity; how unlike it renders us to the pure and holy GOD; how unfit for his enjoyment, and how obnoxious to his vengeance; that burning luſts, are fuel to kindle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable flames, in the place of torment.—(6.) Faſting and prayer, have been found excellent and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual remedies for unchaſtity; and indeed, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental duties of religion ſhould be uſed in this view.—(7.) Chaſtity agrees well with diligence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and often dwells under the ſame roof with them. —(8.) Marriage is to many, the only remedy for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſtity; and it is a lawful and honourable one.—(9.) But, in ſhort, without a new and divine nature, and grace in exerciſe, nothing will effectually ſecure either married or ſingle from <hi>unchaſtity,</hi> either in <hi>thought, word,</hi> or <hi>action.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. HUMILITY conſiſts in a right judgment of ourſelves, compared with other beings; and is oppoſed to the vices of <hi>pride, arrogance, ſelf-righteouſneſs, ſelf-conceit, vanity,</hi> and <hi>boaſting</hi> and <hi>glorying</hi> in one's ſelf, with a contempt of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HUMILITY, like all the other Chriſtian graces, muſt be ſeated in the mind, and thence diſplay and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt itſelf in our words and outward deportment; and therefore the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to <q>put on humbleneſs of mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. HUMILITY does not conſiſt in making a wrong judgment of ourſelves or others, or in thinking leſs or worſe of ourſelves than we deſerve; but in making a right and juſt judgment of ourſelves and others on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parriſon; and if we do ſo, we ſhall have little reaſon for pride, arrogance or ſelf-conceit. Nor,</p>
            <p n="4">4. DOES humility conſiſt (as many have ſuppoſed) in mean clothes, dejected looks, and a complaiſant cringing behaviour to our fellow creatures: All theſe may conſiſt with the moſt inſufferable pride and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are often only cloaks to conceal it. Yet the world makes humility to conſiſt wholly in theſe things, and will not allow a man to have any pride, who is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent or ſlovenly in his dreſs, or affable in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE humble ſoul ſees that he is <hi>nothing</hi> before GOD, or in comparriſon with him; that he is but a creature of a day, ſprung from the duſt, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, wholly depending on GOD for his ſoul
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:014137_0165_0F97D51F74CA9278"/>and its faculties, his body and its ſenſes; for every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his exiſtence, every ſupport and comfort of the preſent life, and every hope of future life; and therefore, he <hi>walks</hi> exceeding <hi>humbly with his</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE humble ſoul ſees that it is not only a <hi>dependent</hi> creature, but a <hi>ſinful, guilty, helpleſs, periſhing, loſt, miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> creature, who has deſtroyed itſelf; who deſerves hell, and no kind of mercy or favour from GOD at all: Therefore, he is contented in all ſtates without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring; bears afflictions with patience; is thankful for every, even the ſmalleſt favour; rejoices in the glad tidings of a Saviour and ſalvation; gladly diſclaims and renounces his own righteouſneſs and merit, and joyfully embraces and pleads the righteouſneſs and merit of Chriſt; comes to GOD poor and empty, wretched and miſerable, humble and penitent, and falls down before the throne of his mercy, willing to accept the free ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with the utmoſt gratitude, on GOD'S own terms; on <hi>any terms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. THE humble ſoul, knowing its own natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, blindneſs, ignorance and fallibility; how prone it is to errors, miſtakes and prejudices; readily renounces and diſclaims its own weak, corrupt, fallible judgment in religious matters; ſubmits its reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly to the dictates of GOD'S <hi>word</hi> and the <hi>guidance of his Spirit,</hi> and is willing humbly and gladly to learn from GOD and his <hi>bleſſed Son,</hi> the truths and duties of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

            <p n="8">8. THE humble ſoul thinks meanly of its own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and goodneſs, compared with that of other men of nobler powers, and higher attainments and advantages; eſteeming others better than himſelf, and in honour preferring them.

To bear this patiently ſhews true humbleneſs of mind.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE humble ſoul, ſenſible that all its knowledge and goodneſs is <hi>borrowed</hi> and <hi>derived;</hi> is the fruit of GOD'S gifts and grace, and of the opportunities and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which he has conferred upon it; and how ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limitted and imperfect its knowledge is at the beſt; how very little it knows of what may be known, and how imperfect its knowledge is of the things which it knows, how many degrees of grace and goodneſs there are between it and the perfection of holineſs of which our nature is capable: The humble ſoul, I ſay, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and being convinced of all this, can never deſpiſe thoſe who have leſs knowledge and goodneſs than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; becauſe, he hath nothing which he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and it is GOD who hath made him to differ, and he is ſtill but a poor, imperfect creature, full of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and corruption. This therefore keeps him from <hi>ſpiritual pride;</hi> from <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conceit;</hi> from being puffed up, and from glorying in a ſtate which is ſo very far ſhort of perfection.

            <p n="10">10. PRIDE was the firſt ſin of men and angels, and is ſtill the predominant vice of ſinners, and the laſt ſin which is totally ſubdued and rooted out of the human heart by renewing grace.</p>

            <p n="12">12. PRIDE <hi>towards men,</hi> ſhews itſelf in undervaluing and deſpiſing others, and preferring ourſelves before them; in contradicting and oppoſing others upon all occaſions; in looking down upon others as beneath our notice, and undervaluing all their good qualities and accompliſhments; in ſpeaking much of ourſelves, praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves, and boaſting and glorying in our actions and diſpoſitions.</p>

            <p n="6">6. IN order that we may be preſerved from this moſt diſgraceful and moſt deſtructive of all vices, the following maxims and cautions may be found ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—(1.) Shun the company of ſuch as are addicted to this ſwiniſh vice<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xiii. 20.—xxiv. 20, 21.—iv. 14, 15.

Take care never to exceed that quantity of wine or ſtrong liquor, which you find by experience to be a proper and moderate refreſhment. The boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of temperance is ſo very narrow, that we may eaſily exceed it; which, if we do, we loſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ourſelves, and may quickly be hurried to the greateſt length of exceſs.—(4.) Endeavour never to make ſtrong liquor neceſſary to your refreſhment. There is much wiſdom in laying reſtraints on the appetites, at times, even in the uſe of innocent enjoyments. Theſe wholeſome reſtraints ſtrengthen ſelf-power and ſelf-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.—(5.) Shun habitual idleneſs, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the parent of drunkenneſs, gaming and moſt other pernicious vices.—(6.)

            <head>ESSAY XXXV. CHRISTIAN COURAGE <hi>or</hi> FORTITUDE, <hi>and its oppoſites.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1. FORTITUDE or courage, is that temper or diſpoſition of mind which ſets a man upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>brave</hi> and <hi>commendable</hi> actions in the face of any <hi>danger</hi> or <hi>oppoſition</hi> which may lie in his way. Nay, the truly brave man is rather <hi>animated</hi> than <hi>diſheartened,</hi> by the number or greatneſs of the dangers and difficulties which lie in the way of his duty. <q>The righteous is bold as a lion; and he that hath clean hands grows ſtronger and ſtronger.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. CHRISTIAN courage or fortitude, is a being <hi>bold, fearleſs</hi> and <hi>intrepid</hi> in the cauſe of Chriſt, and in our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and allegiance to him. As bravery in war has been ever eſteemed the higheſt proof of courage, (becauſe <hi>life,</hi> the deareſt of all earthly enjoyments, is riſked in war) ſo we borrow our idea of Chriſtian courage, from the ſtate of chriſtianity in this world, which is very properly repreſented as a ſtate of warfare;—and to exerciſe Chriſtian courage, is but another phraſe for <q>being good <hi>ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
               </q> who is called very expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively the <hi>Captain of our ſalvation</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. ii. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. COURAGE naturally ſuppoſes difficulties, dangers and oppoſition; for, without theſe, there could be no proper trial or exerciſe of this virtue. This therefore proves, that the Chriſtian life, as a ſtate of warfare, is not that eaſy, inactive, indolent thing, which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of nominal profeſſors ſeem to imagine; but a life of conflict, full of hazards, difficulties and oppoſition; and that he who has never experienced and encountered
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:014137_0172_0F97D525735C4508"/>theſe, has never yet truly enliſted himſelf under the banner of Jeſus, nor wared a good warfare.</p>
            <p n="4">4. COURAGE, in order to denominate it a <hi>Chriſtian virtue,</hi> muſt, as well as <hi>zeal,</hi> be founded upon <hi>knowledge,</hi> and a rational conviction, not only of the goodneſs of the cauſe in which we are engaged, but alſo of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties we have to encounter; the riſk we run; the meaſure of our ſtrength; the aids and ſuccours we have to expect, and the wages we have to receive if we come off conquerors. In ſhort, it ſuppoſes that we have <hi>counted the coſt</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xiv. 26,—33. Phil. iii. 7,—14. Acts xx. 22,—24. Rom. viii. 18. 2 Cor. iv. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE neceſſity and expediency of Chriſtian forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will appear from the <hi>numerous, ſubtile</hi> and <hi>powerful</hi> enemies of our ſalvation: (1.) From inviſible, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirits<note n="†" place="bottom">Ehp. vi. 8, &amp;c.</note>. (2.) From our own luſts and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which treacherouſly take part with theſe ſpiritual enemies againſt us, and being, as it were, our very ſelves, are the more difficult to deny, mortify and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. (3.) From our fellow creatures, who too often uſe every artifice to allure us to ſin, or to ſhame and fright us from duty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of our Chriſtian duties ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely require the exerciſe of this virtue. What for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude muſt it require to comply with that exhortation of our Lord, <q>If any man will be my diſciple, let him deny himſelf and take up his croſs and follow me?</q> 
               <hi>Self-denial</hi> and <hi>ſelf-conqueſt</hi> are the nobleſt feats of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and require the exertions of a firm, reſolute and determined ſoul. <q>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city<note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. xvi. 32.</note>.</q> To be more particular: (1.) Repentance, which is a general and indiſpenſable
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:014137_0173_0F97D526332619D8"/>Chriſtian duty, requires the utmoſt degree of fortitude and reſolution to ſubdue and eradicate old rooted habits, and to deny ourſelves ſuch things as we have long had great pleaſure in, and to abſtain from which, will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely painful. We muſt forſake old companions; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely withſtand their enticements to ſin and vanity, endure their ſcoffs, and, at length, their rage. It may happen, that we cannot truly repent without diſobliging our neareſt relations and deareſt friends; without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuing <hi>gainful buſineſs,</hi> as well as renouncing <hi>beloved luſts;</hi> or without making acknowledgments for injuries done, and reſtoring, with ſhame, what we have unjuſtly acquired. But under all theſe difficult and ſelf-denying duties, the cowardly and irreſolute man muſt ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuccumb.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) .THE falſe opinions and depraved cuſtoms of the world make ſad havock among human ſouls, and it is the duty of every Chriſtian to oppoſe them, and to counteract their miſchievous tendency. The evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical precept is, <q>Be not conformed to this world; but be ye transformed by the renewing of your minds.</q> Now, the falſe maxims and depraved cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the world, like irreſiſtable torrents, ſweep the cowardly and irreſolute Chriſtian along with them. He hears his religious opinions ridiculed; his GOD irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently mentioned; his Saviour traduced, and his pious friends made the laughing ſtock of fools, yet dares not reply; fears to be rude; dreads the ridicule or reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome fellow-worm—nay, perhaps the ſame puſillanimity leads him baſely to lend the ſmile of ſeeming approbation to this wickedneſs, and at length cordially to fall into it himſelf. But the reſolute and courageous Chriſtian, dares to be ſingularly good; he dares to ſtem the torrent of popular depravity and chr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; —he dares to be pious and upright, againſt the example of <hi>the multitude who do iniquity.</hi>—He can
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:014137_0174_0F97D526F34B5CE8"/>bear to be laughed at as an unfaſhionable fool, by both the great and little vulgar, with all the fortitude and magnanimity of a Chriſtian hero. He ſhines as a light in the world, amidſt a crooked and perverſe generation, holding forth the word of life, and counting it all joy to be perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake. We the whole world to deride, to perſecute, to oppoſe him, he would, with the heroic leader of Iſrael's tribes, reſolve, <q>As for me and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord<note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxiv. 15.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To be brief: Would we ſee the excellency and neceſſity of Chriſtian fortitude, we muſt view the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the following ſtations of duty and of providence— Reproving ſin—oppoſing error—propagating truth— conſſicting with temptation—ſtruggling under the preſſure of pain and heavy calamities and afflictions— expoſed to the rage and malignity of perſecuting zeal— and upon the very verge of eternity, encountering <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>moſt terrific</hi> enemy in the Chriſtian warfare:—Eſpecially, in the awful hour of death, and amidſt the agonies of diſſolving nature, the irreſolute man is ſtupified with horror. He dares not take a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect of his by-paſt life, nor look into the fathomleſs abyſs of eternity. He recollects, that the face of man has often terrified him ſo, as to make him do violence to conſcience: How then ſhall he behold the face of GOD, whom he hath offended through a ſinful fear of man, and of whoſe words he has been aſhamed before an <hi>adulterous generation? Fearful</hi> he clings to life; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant</hi> he ſtarts back from the brink of eternity, and dreads the ſight of his almighty judge. Diſmal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodings ſill his ſoul with diſtreſsful agonies, and he quits the world, leaving the ſpectators under a painful uncertainty whither he is gone.—But the Chriſtian who has courageouſly ſerved his GOD in life, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bold as a lion in the near proſpect of death.—
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:014137_0175_0F97D527B30FB760"/>To him, death is a meſſenger of peace. He triumphs over his terrors through the blood of the Lamb; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires fearleſs for his ſting, and demands his guidance to the unknown regions of eternity! <hi>There</hi> he expects congratulating angels to meet him. <hi>There</hi> he hopes to ſee GOD as his reconciled Father, face to face, and that wonderful God-man Chriſt Jeſus, who was ſo much his friend as to die for him;—to ſee him exalted to the higheſt honours,—exalted to be his judge:—And recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſome of the tokens and maniſeſtations of his love, he deſires now to teſtify to all around him, the <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>loving kindneſs</hi> of his Lord. He dies in hope; dies exulting; moves and inſtructs the ſpectators of his exit, and perhaps does more honour to GOD, and more good to his fellow-men, in his death, than he has been enabled to do in all his life.</p>
            <p n="7">7. FAITH begets this virtue in the ſoul, and gives vigour to all its acts and exertions. (1.) By that faith, which is the evidence of things not ſeen, we perceive, that the cauſe we have eſpouſed is good; that it is the cauſe of GOD and of Chriſt; the cauſe in which the eternal intereſt of our ſouls is embarked. (2.) By faith we ſee the arm of omnipotence ſtretched out for our ſuccour, and may ſay, with humble confidence, that we have <hi>almighty ſtrength,</hi> reſpecting what we have to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with in the way of our duty. How baſe then to be <hi>daſtardly</hi> and <hi>faint-hearted,</hi> with ſuch odds on our ſide? (3.) By the eye of faith we ſee the glorious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our ſalvation ſpreading his ſtandard over us— ſtanding with a celeſtial crown in his hand to reward our valour, and millions of our fellow-ſoldiers, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, from the battlements of heaven, our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in the Chriſtian race and warfare. Seeing then we are encompaſſed with ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, ought we not, <q>Laying aſide every weight, and the ſin
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:014137_0176_0F97D528740CBCD0"/>which eaſily beſets us, to run with patience the race ſet before us, looking unto Jeſus<note n="*">1 Cor. ix. 23. 2 Tim. iv. S. Heb. xii. 1,—4.</note>?</q> (3.) By faith we look back and behold the gracious army of <hi>martyrs, apoſtles, prophets,</hi> and <hi>patriarchs,</hi> who were bold to attempt, and reſolute to perform the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous things. <hi>Theſe</hi> have each conquered ſingly, and triumphed. <hi>Theſe</hi> were <hi>men</hi> as <hi>we are,</hi> and juſtly expect that we ſhould behave with equal ardour, fortitude and perſeverance in the Chriſtian warfare. They ſeem to chide our ſloth, and animate us to activity by obſerving, that <q>GOD is ſtill almighty;—that our religion is ſtill divine;—that our Redeemer is ſtill the ſame Jeſus, and his goſpel worthy as much honour now as ever it has been.</q>

            <head>ESSAY XXXVI. <hi>The</hi> CHRISTIAN USES <hi>of the</hi> TONGUE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE nobleſt uſe that can be made of the tongue, is to <hi>glorify</hi> GOD; which is done by this little inſtrument, (1.) By praying to him. Thus we acknowledge our entire dependance on him for all that is needful to our happineſs. (2.) By praiſing him. Thus we make known his loving kindneſs to his needy undeſerving creatures. (3.) By expreſſing our admiration of his infinite perfections: Thus exalting his great name. (4.) By confeſſing our iniquities: Thus magnifying his grace, which continues with us, notwithſtanding our ſo great unworthineſs. (5.) By
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:014137_0177_0F97D52932F4B168"/>contending for the truth of his word; teſtifying our confidence in it, and diſcouraging every indecent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with it. (6.) By vindicating his providential go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and diſplaying the wiſdom, goodneſs and equity of his ways. Theſe are, doubtleſs, ſome of the principal ends for which the tongue is given to man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A VERY good and noble uſe of the tongue is, to promote by it the good of our neighbour; which we may do, (1.) By labouring to inſtruct the ignorant in what may relate to the concerns of his body; but more eſpecially in what reſpects his ſoul. (2.) By commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in ſuch manner as may be an encouragement to him to proceed in the way of godlineſs and virtue, ſo as to advance his good name, and extend the ſphere of his uſefulneſs: But in this good office, we ſhould guard in a particular manner againſt flattery, or imprudent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, which is deadly poiſon to moſt men. (4.) By <hi>peace-making:</hi> There being nothing more deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to religion and virtue than malicious ſtrife; nor any thing more unſeemly in a Chriſtian. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who are the happy inſtruments of removing this helliſh evil from between men, are, in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſidered by the GOD of peace as <hi>his children:</hi> And, (5.) By vindicating injured characters and perſons.

(6.) One of the nobleſt and moſt benevolent uſes of the tongue, towards our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, after inſtructing them in the principles of religion, and animating them to the practice of it; is to pour the balm of conſolation into the wounded ſpirit. Words fitly ſpoken to the broken in heart; to thoſe agoniz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls who are ſinking as it were, under the preſſure of ſome heavy affliction into the black ſea of deſpair, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, (1.) atheiſtical ſpeeches: As ſaying, that <hi>there is no</hi> GOD; denying or diſputing his being, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating ſuch hints and arguments, as tend to deſtroy this belief in ourſelves or fellow-creatures. This is ſtriking at the glory of GOD with a witneſs, and erazing the very foundations of all religion among men. Equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pernicious are thoſe ſpeeches and arguments, which, while they ſeem to admit the being of a GOD, inſinuate, that he did not create, and does not rule and govern the world:—Or, allowing his univerſal providence, in giving general laws to nature, while they deny his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular providence, or his ordering and over-ruling all the particular actions of his creatures.—Nor is it a whit better to deny GOD'S moral government of his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures; that he is the <hi>obſerver of men;</hi> the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and judge, the rewarder and puniſher of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conduct. To this may be added the vile guilt of robbing GOD of any of his perſections, of his omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, omnipreſence, his holineſs, juſtice, mercy or
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:014137_0180_0F97D52B731E6D00"/>truth;—or of extolling any of theſe perfections, to the prejudice of the reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) BLASPHEMY: Either curſing GOD, as <hi>Job</hi>'s wife would have perſuaded him to do; or challenging GOD to come forth, and do his worſt; or boldly and inſolently defying his vengeance; or charging him fooliſhly, as cruel and unjuſt, and laying more on us than we deſerve; or boldly calling down his vengeance upon ourſelves or others; or ſporting with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, undervaluing his mercies, and ridiculing his works, or word, or providences. This is to do all that we can to debaſe and viliſy the Almighty, by ſpeaking of him in a manner that we dared not to do of a digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied fellow-worm.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) PROFANITY, nearly bordering on the former. Speaking ſlightly and diſreſpectfully of holy things and ordinances, and that holineſs which is the image of GOD on his people;—mimicking and mocking holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſuch as prayer, preaching, the ſacraments, and the like;—making a jeſt of the ſcriptures, and uſing them proverbially to proſane purpoſes;—ſpeaking ſlightingly of the laws of GOD and the rules of holineſs, as not worth our notice;—making a mock at ſin as a meer trifle, and talking of the moſt awful and ſerious matters, ſuch as death, judgment, heaven and hell, in ſuch a ſlight, vain, and ſportive manner, as plainly ſhews that we have no practical belief of them.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) SOLEMN perjury; or calling GOD to witneſs a known lie, and praying down his vengeance upon us, in caſe our declaration be not true, when we know that it is not.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) COMMON ſwearing; which by the frequent and familiar abuſe of GOD'S holy name, leſſens our own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and that of others for an oath; turns the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable name of JEHOVAH, into a meer <hi>ſcarecrow,</hi> or an <hi>empty ſound,</hi> to convey our helliſh paſſions to others, and
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:014137_0181_0F97D52C33442158"/>paves the way to <hi>cuſtomary, horrid perjury.</hi> This is an abuſe of the tongue, which, beſides its being forbidden by the word of GOD, on the penalty of his ſevereſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, is attended with neither pleaſure, profit nor ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; —is rude, barbarous, uncivil, and unmeaning, and fit only for <hi>devils</hi> and <hi>damned ſpirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) THE common and profane uſe of GOD'S name, even where neither curſing, ſwearing, nor damning is annexed to it: Such as, O GOD! O LORD! O CHRIST! <hi>E Gad! O Je!</hi> and GOD bleſs us! CHRIST bleſs us! and the like, when they are ſpoken in a <hi>light, unmeaning, cuſtomary</hi> manner: For, as GOD'S name is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and glorious, ſo every <hi>common uſe</hi> of it, is an <hi>irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent abuſe</hi> of it, and is expreſsly forbidden in the third commandment, <q>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the LORD thy GOD in vain, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As the next important uſe of the tongue, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the good of our fellow-creatures; ſo, whatever tends directly, or indirectly to hurt or injure our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, in any of his intereſts, is a <hi>vile, unchriſtian, diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> abuſe of it. Indeed, all the above-mentioned abuſes of it, are againſt <hi>Chriſtian charity:</hi> For, though they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately tend to diſhonour GOD, yet they mediately and indirectly tend to corrupt and ruin our neighbour. Indeed, whatever ſin comes the length of the tongue, <hi>is,</hi> and neceſſarily <hi>muſt be</hi> deſiling to all around us, who are diſpoſed to receive infection. But the abuſes of the tongue, which are moſt immediately repugnant to Chriſtian charity, are the following: (1.) <hi>Direct lying,</hi> or <hi>untruth:</hi> For, as the tongue and ſpeech were given to be a true and regular <hi>index</hi> and <hi>interpreter</hi> of the mind; ſo a man who ſpeaks not truth, is like a <hi>clock</hi> whoſe hand points to the wrong hour, or like a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> whoſe needle deviates from the true pole, <hi>uſeleſs</hi> and <hi>worth nothing.</hi> Beſides, as truth is the foundation of all right intercourſe between men, ſo there could be no liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Indeed, truth is ſo <hi>ſacred, valuable</hi> and <hi>important</hi> a branch of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian morality, and ſo eſſentially neceſſary to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of human ſociety, that it ſhould never be violated, even in jeſt, or upon the ſlighteſt and moſt trivial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) DISSIMULATION: Either by willfully conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary truth, or ſpeaking in a doubtful, ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, enigmatical manner, with a deſign to deceive or mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">(7.) SPEAKING the very worſt that we can of our

            <head>ESSAY XXXVIII. <hi>The beſt</hi> METHOD <hi>of maintaining</hi> PEACE, LOVE, <hi>and</hi> UNITY <hi>among</hi> CHRISTIAN BRETHREN.</head>
            <p n="1">1. CONSIDER, that although Chriſtianity is a <hi>perfect inſtitution,</hi> and tending to make <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians perfect;</hi> yet Chriſtians being only in the way of cure, in a ſtate of recovery, do not arrive at abſolute perfection in this life, at leaſt, not before death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is therefore <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable</hi> in one Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to expect abſolute perfection in the character and temper of another, while here below in the ſchool of Chriſt. As long as I live, I will have my failings and infirmities, and my brother will have his.—Hence ariſes,</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE duty of, and obligation to, <hi>mutual forbearance</hi> among Chriſtian brethren: For, if I hope and expect, that any brother will <hi>bear with my failings</hi> and <hi>infirmities</hi> in temper and conduct, and will have pity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on my weakneſs; juſtice and charity require that <hi>I ſhould bear with his,</hi> and not be <hi>over rigid</hi> and <hi>ſevere</hi> in my requirements from him. If not, I <hi>do not</hi> unto others, as I <hi>would they ſhould do unto me,</hi> and am become a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of this golden rule of equity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF this Chriſtian maxim of <hi>bear and forbear,</hi> or of <hi>pitying,</hi> and, in love, <hi>forgiving one another,</hi> is not regarded and obſerved, there cannot poſſibly be any ſuch thing as a Chriſtian ſociety, great or ſmall, held together upon earth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE failings and imperfections of our Chriſtian brethren, though very undeſirable in themſelves, yet are over-ruled to ſerve excellent purpoſes in this ſtate of trial
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:014137_0186_0F97D530B31C6960"/>and probation: Upon them are grafted ſome of the nobleſt Chriſtian virtues, ſuch as <hi>charity, meekneſs, patience, ſelf-denial, compaſſion, forbearance,</hi> and a <hi>forgiving temper;</hi>— and they are excellent <hi>touch-ſtones,</hi> whereby we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and prove our own ſpirits, and diſcover whether we are indeed poſſeſſed of theſe Chriſtian graces, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether we are Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WHOLLY to break ſociety and fellowſhip with my Chriſtian brother or brethren, becauſe <hi>he</hi> or <hi>they</hi> have offended me, ſpeaks the moſt unſufferable pride.—It is, in plain conſtruction, to preſume that I myſelf am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and blameleſs, and need no forbearance or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs from my brethren.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF GOD ſhould break with us for every offence, what would become of us? Yet the example of GOD and of CHRIST are expreſsly ſet before us for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in this duty<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 2, 32. Col. iii. 13, 14.</note>.</p>
            <p n="8">8. BUT what are the terms and conditions of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, or being reconciled with our Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he offends us? I anſwer, <hi>ſigns of true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;</hi> and to forgive him, and be reconciled with him, and keep up Chriſtian fellowſhip and communion with him, upon <hi>theſe ſigns,</hi> is a Chriſtian duty ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary, that our Saviour has charged us, if our Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian brother offend us, not only <hi>ſeven times,</hi> but even <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty times ſeven, i. e.</hi> 490 times in one day, and return, and ſay, <hi>I repent,</hi> we muſt <hi>as often forgive him</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. xviii. 15,—35.</note>.</p>
            <p n="9">9. BUT are there not ſome offences, which, though they claim our forgiveneſs, yet give juſt cauſe of our quitting all Chriſtian fellowſhip and ſociety with our brethren? Anſwer. No offence can juſtify <hi>private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> in a Chriſtian. If my brother ſhould even attempt to take away my life, and turn again and ſhew ſigns of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:014137_0187_0F97D53172DA72A8"/>true ſorrow and penitence, I muſt as a Chriſtian, forgive him and be reconciled with him; though, in ſuch caſes, public juſtice muſt be allowed to take place for the good of ſociety: But, a man who is called a <hi>brother,</hi> may, by the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>number</hi> of his offences, and by a <hi>proud, haughty, impenitent</hi> diſpoſition, render himſelf wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Chriſtian fellowſhip and communion in any ſociety; yet ſo as to be again received and re-admitted, upon giving proper ſigns of true penitence.</p>
            <p n="10">10. BUT muſt we <hi>ſo put up with,</hi> and <hi>forbear</hi> the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and infirmities of our Chriſtian brethren, as to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the duties of <hi>reproof</hi> and <hi>admonition,</hi> leſt we break the bond of peace, and provoke or diſpleaſe our offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brother? Anſwer. By no means. This would be to <hi>ſuffer ſin upon our brother. Unity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an brethren, muſt be founded on, and comport with truth, integrity and a charitable zeal for each other's welfare. We are to continue rebuking and exhorting, in a Chriſtian manner, but never to break the bond of Chriſtian fellowſhip, till men appear to be <hi>incorrigible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates. I</hi> have <hi>one failing, you</hi> have <hi>another:</hi> I muſt bear with your failing, while I uſe every endeavour to correct it; <hi>you</hi> muſt do the ſame by <hi>me.</hi> No giving up with this mutual duty, till we both get to heaven; where, being both perfect, we ſhall have no need of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſorbearance and forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I WILL not renounce or diſown my <hi>natural bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> nor quit the family, though he offends me, or is angry with me without cauſe. He is my <hi>brother,</hi> and a multitude of tender and endearing conſiderations plead for forgiveneſs, and a re-eſtabliſhment of peace and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And ſhall I renounce and diſown a <hi>Chriſtian bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and quit <hi>the fellowſhip of the ſaints,</hi> for the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where the obligations to brotherly love are much more <hi>numerous, ſacred</hi> and <hi>noble,</hi> and the motives to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and unity, much more tender and endearing.</p>

12. THE ſame reaſons which will engage us to quit one Chriſtian ſociety, becauſe of the failings and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of our brethren, ſhould engage us to quit the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the church itſelf; and then we renounce all union and communion with the body of Chriſt, and putting ourſelves out of the way of all the means of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, do <hi>virtually</hi> renounce heaven itſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize!</p>
            <p n="13">13. IF we are indeed Chriſtians, we muſt all <hi>meet in heaven,</hi> and <hi>there</hi> live together as friends, in one ſociety for ever: And ſhall we part ſociety for every triſle on the road, where we have ſo much need of each other's mutual advice, reproof, forbearance and charity?</p>
            <p n="14">14. CONSIDER the damage done to Chriſtianity by <hi>ſchiſm</hi> and <hi>diviſions</hi> among Chriſtian brethren; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it gives to the <hi>devil;</hi> the tendency it has to prevent others from uniting themſelves to thoſe communities, from which deſerters have carried off an evil report, and the malicious and wicked triumph it gives to the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies of Chriſtian union, communion and peace, and the injury it does to the great and noble deſigns of ſuch ſocieties.</p>
            <p n="15">15. IF a deſerter from a religious ſociety ſhould be aſked by an enemy of religion, what his reaſon was for deſerting? Conſider the danger he is in of wounding religion in the anſwer he muſt make. <q>I did not like the men; or, I did not like their proceedings; or, I got no good, but rather harm, by being of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</q> Here a man ſpeaks at once <hi>uncharitably</hi> of his Chriſtian brethren, and <hi>falſely</hi> and <hi>unfavourtably</hi> of the ways of GOD: For, few men are ſo juſt and modeſt as to declare the true reaſons of ſuch a conduct, and to lay the blame, where it properly is, upon their own fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, inconſtancy, unchriſtian diſpoſition, and diſtaſte and diſreliſh to that which is good; or, perhaps, a mean and
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:014137_0189_0F97D40FF446D7D0"/>vile ambition to pleaſe and gratity ſome declared and malicious enemy to ſo good a deſign.</p>
            <p n="16">16. LET a man conſider, whether, on his <hi>death-bed,</hi> he could approve of having broken the bonds of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian peace and unity, and quitted a ſociety, formed on Chriſtian principles, and in which he might have both <hi>done</hi> and <hi>received</hi> ſome ſpiritual good; merely, becauſe all his Chriſtian brethren were not juſt, in all reſpects, ſuch as he would have them; while he himſelf had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly as great failings as any among them.</p>

2. THE words and actions of Chriſtian profeſſors, as members of Chriſtian ſocieties, againſt the laws of Chriſt, and the duties of their Chriſtian calling, may, and ought to be judged, cenſured, condemned, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually puniſhed, by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> and other proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of ſuch ſocieties, who are authoriſed by GOD to this buſineſs<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. v. 11, 12. Heb. xiii. 17.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is ſo far from being a <hi>ſin,</hi> that it is an eminent proof and branch of love and Chriſtian charity, to fear for our Chriſtian brethren, and be jealous over them with a godly jealouſy, leſt they ſhould be overtaken by the temptations which ſurround them, and to warn and admoniſh them againſt their danger<note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 3.</note>;—alſo, to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> them for things plainly <hi>erroneous</hi> in their principles, or <hi>immoral</hi> in their conduct, and in tenderneſs and love, ſharply to reprove and rebuke them<note n="§" place="bottom">Lev. xix. 17.

            <p n="6">(6.) CRUELLY and unmercifully making the very worſt of our neighbour's conduct, without making proper allowances for the temptations he lay under, and the diſadvantageous circumſtances in which theſe temptation might attack him.

            <p n="1">1. THE very diſtinguiſhing <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>genius</hi> of Chriſtianity is <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> and one of the fruits of the ſpirit is <hi>peace;</hi>—not only a ſenſe of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and peace with GOD through the merit and interceſſion of Chriſt, and, as a fruit of this <hi>peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicience,</hi> or an inward complacential well-pleaſedneſs with our own ſtate and frame, ariſing from the joyful hope that we are objects of the divine favour, and have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from death unto life;—but alſo a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> diſpoſition <hi>towards all men,</hi> ariſing from Chriſtian principles and motives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS peaceableneſs being a fruit of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, muſt <hi>begin,</hi> and be <hi>radicated</hi> in the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>temper.</hi> So far as it is truly Chriſtian, it ſuppoſes a <hi>change of nature:</hi> For, although ſome men are more indolent and eaſy in their temper than others, and are naturally averſe to quarrelling, and fond of eaſe and quiet, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſtudy peace,</hi> upon goſpel motives, until their natures are changed and renewed by the GOD
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:014137_0195_0F97D41475C45010"/>
               <hi>of peace.</hi> Such perſons may be ſaid to ſlee from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as a coward from a man that bruiſes him; not from a true and hearty diſlike to quarrelling, or love of friendſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. PEACEABLENESS, therefore, as a Chriſtian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſuppoſes not only an hearty love and value for peace, from the amiableneſs of ſuch a temper <hi>in itſelf,</hi> from the <hi>authority of</hi> GOD who enjoins it, in imitation of the example and Spirit of Chriſt, who ſet us the brighteſt pattern of it, and from the valuable purpoſes it ſerves in the world and church; but alſo, zealous and unwearied endeavours to maintain as peaceable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ourſelves towards all men, and to promote it among others. A pretence to love peace, while we are litigious and provoking, impatient, fretful and peeviſh, ſtubborn and refractory, and while we promote the quarrels of others, is the vileſt and baſeſt hypocriſy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE Apoſtle tells us, <q>If it be poſſible, as much as in us lies, to follow peace with all men.</q> This plainly ſuppoſes, that, however we ought zealouſly and ſincerely to endeavour it, and to let nothing fail on our part, in order to obtain this univerſal peace with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yet the thing may be often <hi>impoſſible to us;</hi> and that, in ſuch caſes, we cannot charge ourſelves with blame.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THIS may happen through the perverſe humours of thoſe with whom we have to do. Captious perſons often take offence without any occaſion, and will heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to no reaſon againſt their preconceived prejudices. The more you yield to them, ſtill the more unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are their demands; ſo that the only way of being at peace with them, is to break off all intercourſe and connexion<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. cxx. 5, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WITH others we cannot be at peace without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating our conſciences, or acting contrary to our duty.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:014137_0196_0F97D415348196E0"/>If we do our duty to them, or upon them, they will not be at peace with us: But we cannot, we muſt not buy their peace and good-will ſo dear, as to ſell our own peace with GOD for the purchaſe. Neither <hi>truth,</hi> nor <hi>holineſs,</hi> nor <hi>juſtice</hi> are to be ſacrificed for peace. To obtain peace <hi>with men,</hi> we muſt not make ſhipwreck of faith and a good conſcience <hi>towards</hi> GOD. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, thoſe who in a modeſt and charitable manner, maintain and defend their own religious principles againſt adverſaries,—or zealouſly reprove vice, cannot juſtly be charged with <hi>unpeaceableneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. To do what in us lies to follow peace with all men, implies, that we humbly lay aſide all <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> in the purſuit of peace; that we <hi>try,</hi> and <hi>try</hi> and <hi>try</hi> again, without wearying, as far as we lawfully may, to obtain this deſirable end; and that we labour zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to promote the peace of our neighbours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out widening their differences by ill offices<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxiv. 14.</note>. A <hi>proud man</hi> can never be a <hi>truly peaceable man.</hi> He who would ſeek peace and purſue it, muſt not be aſhamed to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, confeſs his faults, and make every needful and reaſonable conceſſion, in order to the re-eſtabliſhing of peace.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THIS Chriſtian grace of peaceableneſs, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a few friends, or to a favourite party, but muſt extend to <hi>all men.</hi> Some think, that if they can live at peace in their families, with their friends, their next neighbours, or their church, it is immaterial what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per they have to the reſt of the world, thoſe of other iſlands, kingdoms, or religious profeſſions. But peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, as a Chriſtian grace, ariſes from a principle of <hi>univerſal love and charity to</hi> ALL MEN, and therefore has ALL MEN for its object. As we are to love ALL MEN, and do good to ALL MEN, ſo, as much as in us lies, we are to live peaceably with ALL MEN; and for this purpoſe,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:014137_0197_0F97D415F4E1DF50"/>our Saviour teacheth us to conſider <hi>every man</hi> as <hi>our neighbour,</hi> and every <hi>true Chriſtian</hi> in the world, be he of what denomination he will, as <hi>our brother.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</p>
            <p n="9">9. WE ſhould be careful to behave inoffenſively to all men<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 32.</note>. A peaceable temper will reſtrain us from inſolence, rudeneſs, injurious reflections, and outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſions towards others: It will engage us to ſtudy men's tempers, and be tender of uſing ſuch innocent freedoms, with paſſionate perſons, as might be no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to others who are of a milder temper. It will reſtrain us from acting the buſy-body, by intermedling unneceſſarily in the affairs of others, or prying into their ſecrets with a deſign to reveal them, whereby they are provoked and others inflamed. It will alſo engage us for conſcience ſake to give unto all, in their ſeveral ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that honour and reſpect which is due to them, and the neglect of which might be juſt matter of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. i. 13.

            <p n="10">10. A TRULY peaceable man is <hi>ſlow</hi> in taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: <hi>ſlow</hi> to wrath. It is amazing how many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances and contentions happen in the world, by <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending offences</hi> where none are either <hi>meant</hi> or <hi>given.</hi> A peaceable perſon, will be loath to ſuppoſe that an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front is deſigned againſt him; he will be ready to put the beſt conſtruction on doubtful words or actions; nor will he over-rate a real offence, or be willing to reſent it in a haſty and rigid manner.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A PEACEABLE man is not implacable, but is deſirous to regain and re-eſtabliſh peace as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

            <p n="6">6. MERCY, as a Chriſtian grace, has its firſt and <hi>chief</hi> reſpect to <hi>men's ſouls;</hi> the troubles and miſeries which they ſuffer, and the dangers to which they are expoſed by ſin: And indeed, this concern for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of men's ſouls, is the chief character which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes <hi>Chriſtian mercy,</hi> from <hi>mere humanity.</hi> How many good natured men in the world, whoſe hearts bleed to ſee a fellow-creature in bodily pain or miſery, and who would go almoſt any lengths to relieve him; yet have no mercy on their own ſouls, or the ſouls of their
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:014137_0201_0F97D49C366EFF60"/>fellow-ſinners, but would ſee them go to hell, and help them thither, without the leaſt attempt to prevent it: But Chriſtian mercy <hi>bleeds,</hi> and is <hi>moved</hi> chiefly by the <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>human ſouls;</hi> does all that it can to inſtruct the ignorant, and to reclaim the wicked and erroneous;—and what it cannot do itſelf, it rejoices to ſee done by others, and gives every encouragement in its power, to deſigns and endeavours to reform men's manners and ſave their ſouls, that they may be plucked as brands out of the burning.—Noble proofs and examples of this merciful diſpoſition, we have in <hi>Lot, David,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>

And when in its power, it labours to mitigate all theſe afflictions, by drawing out its ſoul to the hungry; by clothing the naked; by helping the ſick; by pleading the cauſe of the oppreſſed; by adminiſtring counſel to the perplexed, and comfort to the ſorrowing and afflicted. And whereas, <hi>mere humanity</hi> only does theſe things from <hi>inſtinct,</hi> and to eaſe the anxiety of the mind on the ſight of diſtreſs;—the merciful Chriſtian does them from love to his neighbour, from a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of duty, and from obedience to the authority of GOD.</p>
            <p n="8">8. BUT a merciful diſpoſition is ſeen in its greateſt luſtre and advantage, when it pities and forgives per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who, by injurious treatment to ourſelves, are wholly at our mercy, and upon whom we have it fully

            <p n="9">9. IT belongs to Chriſtian <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> to judge, <hi>to whom,</hi> and <hi>how far,</hi> ſuch acts of mercy ſhould extend. That lenity which would prompt us to give up our rights upon all occaſions to lawleſs men, might often be of miſchievous conſequence:—It might often tend to harden ſinners in their vices, and embolden them to treat others as they have done us, with hopes of impunity. By forgiving a man who attempts my life, I may procure the murder of other innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. By pardoning and giving liberty to a robber, whom I have caught breaking open my houſe, and pillaging my goods, I embolden this villain to rob my neighbour's. Nor is it in all caſes proper or prudent for a man to forgive perſonal injuries, without legal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and examplary puniſhment. Acts of lenity and mercy to offenders, ſhould always conſiſt with a proper concern for the public good, and our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety.</p>
            <p n="10">10. CHRISTIAN mercy, however, is always ſorry for the authors of injuries, and heartily wiſhes their <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> and <hi>eternal welfare.</hi> It will never admit of cruelty or revenge againſt an offender. If his crime will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of it, it is willing to forgive him, upon proper marks of repentance. If puniſhment is neceſſary, it would have it to be of the mildeſt and gentleſt nature, that the offence will admit of; and it pities the perſon of the guilty ſufferer, and would rejoice if the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be wholly remitted;—having nothing at heart but the intereſt of human ſociety, virtue and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and, like GOD, taking no pleaſure in the miſery of ſinners.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THERE is alſo ample room for the diſplay of mercy, in the exaction of debts. If the debtor is
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:014137_0203_0F97D49DB52944A8"/>fallen into poverty by accidents or misfortunes, it will bear with him, if able; or if able, and circumſtances allow, will remit <hi>part</hi> or <hi>whole</hi> of the debt: Or, if he is even bankrupt by his own fault, and therefore, juſtly deſerves to ſuffer as a criminal, yet it will conſider the neceſſitous circumſtances of his innocent family and connexions, and will remit what it can on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THOUGH mercy ſhould extend to <hi>all</hi> in <hi>theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;</hi> yet it will be ſhown in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> and in the <hi>higheſt degree,</hi> to thoſe whom GOD and nature hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected moſt intimately with us; ſuch as our families, relations and friends: For, it would be a prepoſterous diſpoſition, and not Chriſtian mercy, to pity and help ſtrangers, while our own houſehold, kindred and friends were diſregarded by us, in their miſery.—Above all,</p>
            <p n="13">13. OUR <hi>Chriſtian brethren</hi> claim a <hi>peculiar part</hi> in our bowels of mercies. If one member ſuffers, all the members ſhould ſuffer with it. <q>We are to bear one another's burdens, and ſo fulfil the law of Chriſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14. OUR <hi>heathen ſlaves</hi> are proper objects and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent teſts of a merciful diſpoſition. Their <hi>caſe</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> is allowed to be very <hi>pitiable</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi> upon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all accounts. They often provoke us, and needs muſt. They are, in a manner, entirely at our mercy, and their very lives in our hands. They are <hi>our fellow creatures,</hi> and <hi>might</hi> and <hi>ſhould</hi> be our <hi>Chriſtian brethren.</hi> They are GOD'S <hi>creatures,</hi> and <hi>our neighbours,</hi> whom we ſhould <hi>love as ourſelves.</hi> And ſurely, if a merciful man, will be merciful even to his beaſt, much more ought he to be ſo to his <hi>human ſlave!</hi>—It may therefore be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on, that thoſe who have no pity for their ſlaves, but are of an <hi>unfeeling, cruel, mercileſs</hi> temper towards them, are ſtrangers to this grace.</p>
            <p n="15">15. THIS is one of the moſt amiable and GOD-like of all the Chriſtian virtues, being that temper by which we
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:014137_0204_0F97D49E766D0F48"/>do, in a moſt eminent manner, reſemble and bear the image of the bleſſed GOD, and his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> CHRIST; who forgive us <hi>ten thouſand talents,</hi> and are merciful to the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>unthankful.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1.

In ſhort, <q>It is to render unto every one his due.</q> And, in this <hi>general view,</hi> it may be called, <hi>integrity, uprightneſs</hi> or <hi>righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IF we act <hi>juſtly</hi> towards GOD, we ſhall love, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and eſteem him ſupremely, and above all things; we ſhall believe, obey and truſt him without reſerve, and we ſhall worſhip and praiſe him, according to his glorious perfections.</p>

IF we are <hi>juſt</hi> to the <hi>holy angels,</hi> we ſhall love them as our fellow-creatures; as the ſubjects and ſervants of our Redeemer; as pure, holy, and benevolent beings; and, more particularly, as miniſtring ſpirits ſent forth to miniſter to them who are heirs of ſalvation, and as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and affectionately intereſting themſelves in <hi>our good,</hi> and in <hi>our Redeemer's glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. IF we are <hi>juſt</hi> to our <hi>fellow men,</hi> we ſhall love them as ourſelves; we ſhall ſympathize with, and help them in their wants and afflictions; we ſhall conſcientiouſly abſtain from <hi>injuring</hi> them in their perſons, families, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, or intereſts; we ſhall deal fairly, truly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly and equitably with them in all dealings and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of life; we ſhall perform to each of them the honours, duties, or ſervices, which of right belong to them, according to the various relations in which they

            <p n="5">5. IF we are <hi>juſt</hi> to <hi>ourſelves,</hi> we ſhall prefer our ſouls to our bodies; eternity to time; and the favour of GOD and eternal happineſs, to all the alluring, deceitful offers of ſin.

            <p n="6">6.

            </p>
            <p n="7">7. THE meaſure of our acting towards others, here propoſed, is not what they <hi>actually do</hi> to us, but what <hi>we would they ſhould do to us.</hi> Yet this is the meaſure by which moſt men act towards their neighbours: They render evil for evil; railing for railing, &amp;c. Nor will they do good to thoſe who will not do good to them. Nay, many think themſelves juſtified in cheating others, becauſe they firſt cheated them. But this is <hi>retaliation</hi> and <hi>private revenge,</hi> not <hi>equity.</hi> The goſpel has taught us a quite different rule of acting, and denies to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians the right of private revenge, farther than <hi>ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> requires<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke vi. 31,—35.

            <p n="8">8.

            <p n="9">9. THE <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the precept is plainly this: <q>In all our tranſactions with our neighbour, we ought, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide prejudice and partiality, to ſuppoſe ourſelves in our neighbour's place and circumſtances, and he in ours; and then we ſhould attentively conſider what we might <hi>reaſonably</hi> and <hi>lawfully</hi> expect from him, if he were in our place, and we in his; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, we ſhould be the ſame to him in our thoughts, words and actions, as we would <hi>have him to be unto us,</hi> if the tables were turned.</q>

He that is now a king, may be ſoon a ſubject: The maſter may ſoon be a ſervant: The rich may ſoon be poor; and the honourable may fall into diſhonour and contempt. I may need that juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or kindneſs from my neighbour to-morrow, which he demands from me to-day. It is plain then, that there ſhould be <hi>one common rule</hi> or <hi>meaſure</hi> of juſtice and equity for all men. If it is unjuſt to keep two kinds of weights and meaſures, one to <hi>buy</hi> with, and the other to <hi>ſell</hi> by; it is ſurely equally unjuſt that I ſhould have <hi>one</hi> law for <hi>myſelf,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> for <hi>my neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. THIS is a rule of juſtice which has obtained among all nations, it being a clear dictate of reaſon, and of the law of nature,—<q>Not to do to others what we would not bear from them; and to do to others, in all caſes, what we would reaſonably expect from them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. AS this is a rule, the equity of which is ſo clear and ſelf-evident, that none can diſpute or deny it; ſo it is eaſily carried about with a man in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and an honeſt man of the weakeſt judgment can eaſily and quickly apply it, on the moſt ſudden emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. Moſt arts and ſciences are ſo tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, that they are hard to learn, and difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.

In ſhort, to act juſtly in all caſes for ordinary, needs only a <hi>ſingle honeſt appeal to the heart and conſcience,</hi> by the light of this rule; <q>All things whatſoever ye would that others ſhould do unto you, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>

            <p n="15">15. THE uſe of this precept extends to the whole of our intercourſe with our fellow-creatures, and to all our <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>words</hi> about them. It would prevent all raſh, uncharitable and cenſorious opinions and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our fellow-creatures, and all injurious actions towards them.—It would lead us to uſefulneſs and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs in converſation; to integrity and rectitude in all our dealings and commerce, and to a right me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treating thoſe who need our compaſſion or kindneſs.

            <head>ESSAY XLIII. CHRISTIAN HOPE.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Chriſtian hope</hi> is a firm expectation of that future and eternal happineſs, which GOD hath promiſed to his faithful obedient people, upon a rational and well-grounded perſuaſion, that they have complied with the terms of his gracious covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE object of Chriſtian hope is the <hi>divine promiſes,</hi> contained in GOD'S word; for, it is upon his word that he cauſeth his ſervants to hope: And it ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes, a firm faith in theſe promiſes.—Chriſtian hope, therefore, is ever built upon <hi>faith,</hi> and can reach no farther than its foundation: For, we cannot rationally <hi>hope for,</hi> or <hi>expect</hi> that which we do not believe that we ſhall receive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I HAVE ſaid, the object of Chriſtian hope is the divine promiſes; though it may be rather ſaid to be the bleſſings contained in the divine promiſes, the chief and moſt comprehenſive of which is, GOD himſelf, as the <hi>chief good of our natures,</hi> the comprehenſive ſum total of all our happineſs; and therefore it is ſaid, by way of eminence, "That our hope may be in GOD," as the ultimate object of it<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 31.</note>. For, if we purſue every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:014137_0211_0F97D4A489011978"/>bleſſing or happineſs to the ſource of it, we will find it centered in GOD, and flowing from him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. CHRIST is alſo ſometimes called <hi>our hope,</hi> as the channel of all divine bleſſings to us, and the great <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgator</hi> and <hi>revealer</hi> of the divine promiſes. And we are ſaid to abound in hope, through the power of the <hi>holy Ghoſt;</hi> becauſe, as he is the worker of <hi>faith,</hi> ſo of <hi>hope,</hi> in the hearts of Chriſtians; bearing witneſs with their ſpirits, that they are children and heirs of GOD; confirming their rational inferences as to the goodneſs and ſafety of their ſtate; perſuading them of the power and faithfulneſs of GOD, and the certain accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his promiſes, and ſweetly aſſuring their hearts, ſo as to raiſe them above tormenting fear, anxious doubtings, and diſtracting deſpair.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE primary foundations of Chriſtian hope, as well as of Chriſtian faith, are the <hi>unchangeable truth</hi> and <hi>almighty power</hi> of GOD.—He <hi>cannot lie,</hi> and he can do all things which are the objects of power; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he can neither <hi>deceive our faith</hi> nor <hi>diſappoint our hopes.</hi> Whatſoever therefore GOD hath <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>promiſed,</hi> we can never confidently enough expect and hope for, nor firmly enough believe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. MEN may be ſtrong in the Chriſtian hope, giving glory to GOD; that is, they may firmly believe the truth of his word, and the ſure accompliſhment of his promiſes to his people, while they may be very doubtful of their own ſtate, and ſo be deprived of the <hi>joy of hope:</hi> For, as hope ſuppoſes faith, and faith reſts upon a divine promiſe; while we cannot clearly and rationally apply this promiſe to ourſelves, we cannot yet hope for the accompliſhment of it to ourſelves.— Yet we may clearly ſee our title to the promiſed bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on condition we did but truly believe and apply the promiſe. Hence it clearly follows, that our hope
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:014137_0212_0F97D4A53672E760"/>muſt ever keep pace with the evidence of our title to the promiſed bleſſing. Where we have no rational evidence of this, we can have no rational hope; and according to the <hi>ſtrength of our evidence,</hi> ſuch will be the <hi>ſtrength of our hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. HENCE it is alſo clear, that all the hopes of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and even of men (however ſober, moral, and orderly in their lives) who are yet without any rational evidence of their being truly religious, are mere <hi>wicked, groundleſs preſumptions,</hi> which only ſerve to keep up their fatal ſecurity, and to render their damnation the more certain and the more dreadful: For, how dreadful muſt it be for thoſe men to find all their <hi>towering airy</hi> hopes, piercing them like broken reeds, and breading under them like a ſpider's web, only to render their fall into endleſs miſery and deſpair the deeper and more diſtreſſing?</p>
            <p n="8">8. HENCE it appears, that <hi>deſpair,</hi> is a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſymptom in wicked men, than the moſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident hopes.</hi> And that the foundation of a true Chriſtian hope in all ſuch, muſt be laid deep in an utter deſpair of ever ſeeing the face of GOD in mercy, while they continue void of true religion, and under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of wicked habits.</p>
            <p n="9">9. CHRISTIAN hope is diſtinguiſhed from worldly hopes, by the <hi>excellency of its objects,</hi> and the <hi>ſtability of its foundation.</hi> Its principal object, as we obſerved, is GOD, and an eternal ſtate of glory and happineſs; in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, wherein we ſhall be conformed to the image of his Son; and its foundation is the <hi>divine power</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> ſo that it is a <hi>ſure, glorious</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> hope. But <hi>all, all</hi> ſublunary hopes are mean in their nature, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their attainment, and deceitful and unſatisfying in their fruition and enjoyment.</p>
            <p n="10">10. TO hope for the perfection of our nature, and the full enjoyment of GOD, is a <hi>glorious hope,</hi> which by

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the objects of the Chriſtian's hopes, are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unſeen, yet his hope gives them a preſence and reality, and therefore the patient waiting for this hope, is attended with joy and comfort.

            <p n="15">15. THE Chriſtian hope tends to <hi>purify, cleanſe</hi> and <hi>ſanctify</hi> all who have it, in various ways; as, (1.)

            <p n="2">2. HE is, indeed, a moſt <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>myſterious</hi> perſon; but the holy ſcriptures have revealed to us a number of his glories, and given us many rich materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for the growing knowledge of him, and acquaintance with him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. HE is repreſented in one view, as the <hi>wonderful councellor,</hi> the <hi>mighty</hi> GOD, the <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> the <hi>Prince of peace;</hi> the Word which was in the beginning with GOD, and which was GOD; the Creator of all things, viſible and inviſible, by whom all things <hi>are</hi> and <hi>conſiſt:</hi>—And, in another view, he is repreſented, as the <hi>Son of man;</hi> the <hi>man Jeſus; born of a virgin;</hi> appearing in the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> and in the <hi>likeneſs of ſinful fleſh; ſmitten, wounded</hi> and <hi>bruiſed,</hi> a <hi>man of ſorrows</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with <hi>grief; hungering, thirſting, weary, ſorrowing, bleeding</hi> and <hi>dying; made of a woman;</hi> made <hi>under the law,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4.

Now it would be impious to ſuppoſe, that the GOD-HEAD or <hi>divine nature</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>ſuffered,</hi> or felt any uneaſy paſſion.

            </p>
            <p n="5">5.

But others, with <hi>Dr.</hi> WATTS, hold, that it was created the firſt of all creatures; and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature of Chriſt, acting by it, created all other worlds and creatures; converſed with <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>paradiſe;</hi> was made viſible to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and was the grand agent in tranſacting all the affairs of man's redemption in all ages of the world; and really deſcended from heaven, diveſted of the glory and happineſs it had there enjoyed from the beginning, and humbled itſelf, by entering into the virgin's womb<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. i. 15.—18.</note>.</p>

He is <hi>omnipotent,</hi> for he <hi>raiſed the dead; turned water into wine; created bread and fiſh</hi> in the eater's hands, and <hi>made all things,</hi> viſible and inviſible.

            <p n="9">9. AS the human nature of Chriſt was to be the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice</hi> for the ſins of the world; therefore, it behoved to be perfectly pure and immaculate, without any taint of <hi>inherent</hi> or <hi>derived</hi> corruption (otherwiſe it could not have been a ſacrifice acceptable to GOD, nor available for us;) therefore, it pleaſed GOD to ſecure the ſinleſs purity of this nature, by its being conceived and formed by the holy Ghoſt, in the ſanctified womb of a pure virgin. Whence he was called the <hi>holy child Jeſus;</hi> the <hi>lamb of</hi> GOD, <q>without ſpot or blemiſh; holy harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. THERE is no reaſon to doubt but that the <hi>human ſoul</hi> of Chriſt was the <hi>nobleſt ſpirit</hi> which GOD ever cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and his body the moſt perfect human body that ever was formed; ſeeing, that in this <hi>conſecrated temple</hi> the DEITY himſelf was to reſide, and <q>all the fulneſs of the GOD-HEAD, to dwell bodily.</q> So that there is no doubt but this glorious dignified man, conſidered
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:014137_0221_0F97D4ABF3F5A6A8"/>only as a man, <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> the <hi>moſt glorious creature of</hi> GOD; and is filled with all the graces and perfections, whereof a limited, created nature is capable; ſeeing that it was <hi>by</hi> and <hi>through this nature,</hi> that GOD was to diſplay and manifeſt himſelf to men.</p>
            <p n="11">11. AS the divine nature of Chriſt was not capable of <hi>ſuffering,</hi> ſo neither was it capable of <hi>humiliation, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation</hi> or <hi>reward.</hi> CHRIST'S divine nature could not properly be ſaid to humble itſelf; to empty itſelf of its glory, or to be rewarded for its ſervices, or exalted to a higher degree of glory, or bleſſedneſs, or dominion, than it enjoyed before; therefore, wherever we find theſe changes of ſtate aſcribed to Chriſt in ſcripture, we muſt underſtand it of his human nature, which indeed humbled itſelf in the work of our redemption, and has obtained a glorious exaltation and an increaſe of dignity and bleſſedneſs, as the reward of its humiliation, labours and ſufferings<note n="*" place="bottom">Philip. ii. 5,—11.

            <p n="12">12. ALTHOUGH there was a perfect union of the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>divine nature</hi> of Chriſt with his human nature, while upon earth; yet the manner and degree in which the divine nature communicated the perfections of power and knowledge to the human nature, is, to us, a great myſtery. It appears, that Chriſt, as a man, grew up from his childhood, and increaſed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as other men do: Yet, no ſooner does he enter upon his public miniſtry, having been thereunto ſet apart by the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and the anointing of the holy Ghoſt, but we find him poſſeſſed of <hi>amazing,</hi> even <hi>infinite knowledge</hi> and <hi>almighty power.</hi> From which it would ſeem to appear, that during his private life, the divine nature of Chriſt communicated little elſe to his human nature, than ſanctifying knowledge and holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, and that his communications became more

<pb n="224" facs="unknown:014137_0223_0F97D4AD746200F0"/>of ſinners:—As ſinners are naturally <hi>ignorant</hi> and blind in the knowledge of GOD, and in the way of ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him acceptably, in compaſſion and relief of this miſery of our fallen race, he is become our <hi>prophet</hi> to inſtruct us:—As they are <hi>guilty</hi> and ſubject to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and wrath, and have no acceſs to GOD or power with him; in this our guilty and rebellious ſtate, he is become our <hi>Prieſt</hi> to atone for our ſins by the ſacrifice of himſelf, and to plead, pray and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for us with his juſtly offended Father, and to procure us acceſs to him with humble boldneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance with him:—As we are by nature bond ſlaves of <hi>ſatan</hi> and of luſt, having numberleſs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which ſeek our perdition, and neither power nor ſkill to oppoſe them, he is graciouſly become our <hi>King,</hi> not only to give laws to our conſciences, but to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our hearts to himſelf; to rule and reign within us by the power of his Spirit, and having thus reſcued us from the power of inward enemies, to lead us on to the conqueſt of the world and the <hi>devil,</hi> with all their ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems and temptations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>prophetic office</hi> conſiſts chiefly of two parts: 1. To reveal, preach and inculcate thoſe truths and doctrines of GOD, which are neceſſary to the ſalvation of ſinners: And, 2. To foretel, with certainty, future events, relative to the church of GOD, or the members of it, or others, which ſeemed to depend, for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, on uncertain contingencies and events. This was the twofold buſineſs of both the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> prophets; and in the Jewiſh church, there were certain eſtabliſhed marks of trial, whereby the <hi>true</hi> prophets, were diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>falſe.</hi> Now, in both theſe reſpects, Chriſt is the <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> prophet of the church; nay, he may be ſaid, by way of eminence, to be the <hi>only true</hi> Prophet of GOD; becauſe all other true
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:014137_0224_0F97D4AF5C634DB0"/>prophets were only his <hi>organs</hi> or <hi>inſtruments,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) deriving all their <hi>revelations, predictions, gifts</hi> and <hi>graces,</hi> from the light of his Spirit, communicated to them, illuminating, <hi>inſpiring</hi> them, and ſpeaking and writing <hi>by</hi> and <hi>in</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHATEVER revelations, or divine inſpirations, <hi>Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Job, David,</hi> or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the patriarchs of old, were favoured with, or have recorded in the ſcriptures, for illuminating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and building up the church;—or, if any Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of old, <hi>Socrates, Heraclitus,</hi> or any of the Heathens at this day, have obtained, or do obtain, any <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> revelations of GOD or his will, or any <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light</hi> or <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> all has proceeded from the <hi>Mediator,</hi> that fountain of light and grace; that <hi>light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> and <hi>glory of his people Iſrael;</hi>—that <hi>true light</hi> which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world;—who, having been from eternity in the boſom of the Father, and having learned of him, declareth him to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;—for none hath <hi>thus</hi> known the Father, but the <hi>Son;</hi> the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>wiſdom</hi> of GOD, and him to whom the Son revealeth him. In particular, we are aſſured, that "all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of GOD;" and that the prophets ſpake in old time, as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt, which is the Spirit of Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="5">5. ALTHOUGH the Mediator was <hi>thus</hi> the Prophet of GOD in all ages; yet he was more <hi>viſibly, ſenſibly</hi> and <hi>ſolemnly</hi> inaugurated and ſet a part to his prophetic office, at his baptiſm by <hi>John,</hi> where, inſtead of being anointed with oil (a ceremony uſed of old at the inſtalment of <hi>propliets,</hi> as well as of <hi>prieſts</hi> and <hi>kings</hi>) he was anointed with a plentiful effuſion of the holy Ghoſt, with which he was filled without meaſure; and all men commanded to hear him, under that character, by a voice from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:014137_0225_0F97D4AFB43EC568"/>which ſeems a ſurpriſing, literal fulfilment of <hi>Moſes's</hi> propheſy concerning him<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 15, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IT may be obſerved, that Chriſt, in the courſe of his miniſtry, remarkably fulfilled and diſcharged the two branches of the prophetic office, mentioned above: 1. He revealed the will of GOD to men for their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, 2. He foretold future events.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IN the firſt of theſe branches, Chriſt the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, reveals the will of GOD to men, for their ſalvation, both by his <hi>word outwardly,</hi> and by <hi>his ſpirit</hi> applying the word to their hearts. In this reſpect, how far has he the pre-eminence above all other prophets? Other prophets can only declare GOD'S will to men, from the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Jeſus Chriſt, and after this have no more that they can do, not being able to diſpenſe the quickening Spirit, without which the outward declaration of GOD'S will, is ineffectual to the ſalvation of ſinners: But this divine Prophet is not only the original <hi>revealer</hi> and <hi>declarer</hi> of GOD'S <hi>will,</hi> but alſo the <hi>diſpenſer of the Spirit,</hi> by which he can, when he pleaſes, reveal GOD'S will inwardly to the hearts and conſciences of ſinners, and make it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and effectual there for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="8">8. BY his perſonal miniſtry, and that of his Apoſtles, he as the Father's righteous ſervant, has revealed all truth and duty neceſſary to the ſalvation of ſinners. He expreſsly declares, that what he ſpoke and taught was <hi>from the Father,</hi> and not of <hi>his own will</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">John xii. 49.</note>. He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and caſt a new light on the dark prophetic parts of the old Teſtament, and ſhewed how all the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and ſacrifices there ſhadowed forth, prefigured and pointed to <hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>goſpel bleſſings,</hi> as the <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xxiv. 27.</note>. He made thoſe things clear to us, which were not well
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:014137_0226_0F97D4B073D82010"/>underſtood by the prophets who revealed them, by the ſecret impulſes of his Spirit<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet, i. 12.</note>. He declared the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual nature of GOD, and that worſhip he requires, and vindicated the <hi>purity, ſpirituality,</hi> and <hi>vaſt extent</hi> of the divine law, from the falſe gloſſes, and corrupt interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Jewiſh teachers<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. v. vi. and vii.</note>. He diſtinctly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the way and method of our recovery through himſelf; gave a clear revelation of a judgment to come, and of an eternal ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; thus bringing life and immorality to ſuch a clear light by his goſpel, as it had never appeared in before, by former divine revelations.</p>
            <p n="9">9. AS a Prophet, he foretold many future events, (which is deemed the higheſt proof of the prophetic ſpirit and character) ſuch as <hi>Peter's</hi> denial of him; the treachery of <hi>Judas;</hi> his <hi>own</hi> ſufferings, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Jews forty years before it happened<note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xii. 44.—xxi. 24.</note>: The ſurprizing ſucceſs and ſpread of his own goſpel<note n="§" place="bottom">mark xvi. 17, 18.</note>: The ſufferings and perſecutions of his followers, and the degeneracy and corruption which ſhould prevail among them. And, as all theſe things have punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to paſs, we have abundant ground to believe, that the propheſies contained in the book of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to his ſervant <hi>John,</hi> and thoſe propheſies, which by his Spirit, he enabled his other Apoſtles to utter, concerning the fall of <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> the reſtoration of the <hi>Jews;</hi> the gathering in, and converſion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations; the glory of his church in the latter days, and the final deſtruction of our earth by fire, will, all of them, be accompliſhed in due time.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="228" facs="unknown:014137_0227_0F97D4B134D59AB0"/>
10. CHRIST alſo as a Prophet, teaches not only by <hi>outward revelations,</hi> but by the <hi>inward operations of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> on the ſouls of man. He not only ſpake as never man ſpoke; but his words (when he pleaſes) are <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>life;</hi> working powerfully and effectually in them who believe. He opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſhe attended to the things ſpoken by <hi>Paul.</hi> He open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the underſtandings of his diſciples, that they might underſtand the ſcriptures, and cauſed their hearts to burn within them, by the ſacred energy of his Spirit, while he opened to them the ſcriptures concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Thus does he, when he pleaſes, make the light of his glorious goſpel ſhine upon the hearts of ſinners: enlighten, transform, and renew them, and thereby give free courſe to the word of his grace, and glorify it: And to him we are to look, as our Prophet, for thoſe <hi>inward teachings,</hi> and <hi>effectual illuminations</hi> of his Spirit, to make his word effectual and ſaving.</p>
            <p n="11">11. CHRIST the Mediator was foretold by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as a Prophet, like unto himſelf, to be raiſed up, to the Jews, from among their brethren, to whom they ſhould hearken without gainſaying or reſerve. And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between HIM and <hi>Moſes</hi> is remarkably ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in many reſpects: (1.) In their birth; they were both <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> both born in obſcurity: (2.) In their early expoſure to great <hi>riſks, dangers</hi> and <hi>hardſhips:</hi> (3.) Both come to <hi>their own</hi> with ſpecial commiſſion and miraculous power from GOD, and their own received them not kindly, but evilly requited them, and perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebelled againſt them: (4.) Both were exceedingly meek in their temper; expoſed themſelves to much hardſhip and ſelf-denial in their miniſtry; were zealous, diligent and faithful in all GOD'S houſe: ſhewed great ſigns and wrought great miracles to confirm their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: (5.) Both were authors of a new diſpenſation
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:014137_0228_0F97D4B1F4703D78"/>of religion, and Mediators between GOD and <hi>man:</hi> (6.) Both had near acceſs to, and familiar converſe with GOD, and peculiar marks of his favour; and had their revelations immediately from GOD, and confirmed them with the ſeal of miracles: (7.) Both faſted forty days: (8.) Both were very zealous for the LORD GOD of <hi>hoſts,</hi> and affectionate lovers of an ungrateful people: (9.)

            <head>ESSAY XLVI. <hi>The</hi> PRIESTLY OFFICE <hi>of</hi> CHRIST.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE Aaronical prieſthood, was a type of the prieſthood of Chriſt, though the prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> was a more perfect one: Conſequently, the Jewiſh high-prieſts, and <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> were types of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. TWO qualifications were neceſſary to the Jewiſh high-prieſts: (1.) That they ſhould be of the ſame nature with their brethren<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. v. 1. 2.—iv. 15.</note>.—(2.) That they ſhould be ſolemnly ſeparated and ſet apart to their office, by the appointment of GOD, and by conſecretion or inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titure<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. v. 1, 4.</note>. Now Chriſt, the great high-prieſt of our profeſſion, had both theſe qualifications<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 14, 17.—v. 5. 6, 9, 10.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AS the prieſt's office, is founded on the fallen ſtate of human nature, and appointed in relief of the guilty, it conſiſts of two parts or branches: (1.) To offer ſacrifice: And, (2.) To make interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. SACRIFICES were of two kinds under the law: Either <hi>euchariſtical,</hi> as acknowledgments of mercies; and theſe were commonly called <hi>gifts,</hi> and were <hi>unbloody,</hi> conſiſting of the fruits of the earth, &amp;c. Or, they were <hi>expiatory,</hi> or <hi>atonements</hi> for ſin, and theſe were called <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> and were always <hi>bloody;</hi> for, without ſhedding of blood, there was no remiſſion of ſins.</p>
            <p n="5">5. CHRIST, in this ſenſe, was a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real ſacrifice.</hi> His ſoul was made <hi>an offering for ſin.</hi> Thus he is called, <q>The Lamb of GOD which taketh away the ſins of
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:014137_0230_0F97D4B373C3D8A8"/>the world:—Our paſſover ſacrificed for us:—The Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world:—The propitiation for our ſins, and the ſins of the world: —He was offered to bear the ſins of many<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 12, 26.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. THE entire human nature of Chriſt was the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he offered up for the ſins of the world.—He not only gave his <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>life</hi> and offering for ſin, but bore our ſins in his own body on the tree:—And this ſacrifice received its dignity and value from his <hi>divine nature,</hi> which offered the human: For he, through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf up without ſpot unto GOD<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 14.</note>.</p>
            <p n="7">7. BY this ſacrifice has Chriſt made an atonement for ſin; ſatisfied the demands of divine juſtice; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and illuſtrated the truth, holineſs and juſtice of GOD, and made his law exceeding honourable; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our forfeited bleſſings and loſt happineſs; open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a way for the mercy of GOD to all the ſinful race of <hi>Adam;</hi> and procured the pardon of ſin, the divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the gift of the Spirit, and eternal life for every ſoul of man who will fall in with his ſaving deſign, and take him as their <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>King</hi>

            <p n="8">8. THE interceſſory part of the Prieſt's office, was to offer up the prayers of the people and to intercede for them. The high-prieſt entered into the holieſt of all on the great day of atonement or expiation, and bleſſed the people in the name of the Lord; ſprinkling the blood of their ſacrifices before the mercy-ſeat. Chriſt, in like manner, having offered himſelf a ſacrifice of atonement for our ſins, hath entered into heaven, in the virtue of his moſt precious blood, to offer up the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his people, and make interceſſion for them<note n="§" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 12, 24. Rom. viii. 34. Heb. 7. 25.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="232" facs="unknown:014137_0231_0F97D4B435532F20"/>
9. AS Chriſt was of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> not of <hi>Levi,</hi> from whom the Aaronical prieſthood deſcended, ſo he is ſaid to be a <q>prieſt for ever after the order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec.</q> The reſemblance between the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Chriſt and that of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is remarkable in ſeveral caſes: (1.) In the ancientneſs of that order, and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s paying tithes to <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and being bleſſed by him, although the father of the Aaronical prieſthood. (2.) <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was a <hi>prieſt upon a throne,</hi> or a <hi>king</hi> as well as a <hi>prieſt;</hi> ſo was Chriſt. (3.) The original and deſcent of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was peculiar<note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. vii. 3.</note>; ſo was Chriſt's: For, who can declare his generation? (4.) The prieſthood of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was not encumbered with ſuch a <hi>ritual,</hi> and ſo many ceremonies and carnal commandments and ordinances, as that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> but was more ſimple and catholic: So is Chriſt's.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THERE are ſeveral things in the prieſthood of Chriſt peculiar to itſelf; as, (1.) He was perfectly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, although he tranſacted with GOD for ſinners. (2.) Other prieſts offered <hi>brutal ſacrifices,</hi> but Chriſt offered <hi>himſelf.</hi> He was both the <hi>Prieſt</hi> and the <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> His divine nature was the altar on which he offered up the humanity. (3.) Other prieſts offered <hi>many ſacrifices,</hi> even <hi>daily;</hi> whereas he offered but <hi>one ſacrifice</hi> of infinite value and virtue. (4.) Other prieſts and ſacrifices, were ineffectual for expiating or taking away <hi>moral guilt:</hi> They made not him who did the ſervice, or for whom it was done, <hi>perfect</hi> as pertaining to the <hi>conſcience:</hi> They only took away the guilt of ceremonial pollutions or omiſſions: But the ſacrifice of Chriſt takes away the guilt of all ſin. This is <q>the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the ſin of the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. THE prieſthood of Chriſt, and his moſt expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſacrifice, ſhould put us in mind of our guilty ſtate,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:014137_0232_0F97D4B4F4AF1B38"/>and of the malignant nature of ſin; ſeeing there could have been no remiſſion of the very ſmalleſt ſin, without the ſheding of the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12. HENCE we ſee the wonderful love of GOD in preparing <hi>ſuch a Prieſt</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> for our guilty race, and not ſparing him, but freely giving him up for us all:—As alſo the amazing condeſcenſion and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy of Chriſt, in becoming a ſacrifice and victim for the <hi>ungodly;</hi> for <hi>ſinners;</hi> for <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. HOW <hi>freely, cheerfully,</hi> and <hi>aſſuredly</hi> ſhould we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the merit of ſuch a ſacrifice as this? And how entirely give ourſelves over to the guidance of ſuch an high-prieſt? How ſhould we reverence him? And with what humble confidence enter into, and approach the holieſt, in the new and living way which he hath conſecrated by his blood? How <hi>compaſſionate</hi> and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> is he? How ſenſible of our infirmities, and how ready to pity them, and able to help them or remove them?</p>
            <p n="14">14. WHAT encouragement have we to <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> having ſuch an interceſſor?

            <p n="1">1.

<pb n="235" facs="unknown:014137_0234_0F97D4B6754D7260"/>him as their rightful Lord and Sovereign; and that in vain they expect the benefits of his <hi>prieſtly office,</hi> if they ſubmit not to him as <hi>a king</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xiv. 11, &amp;c.</note>.—(5.) He convinces them of the infinite advantage reſulting to them from an entire ſubjection to his laws and government: That they ſhall be pardoned;—received into favour;—made kings and prieſts to GOD;—kept from falling; and preſented faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceeding joy.—(6.) He gives them the laws of his kingdom;—ſhews them the duties they muſt perform, and the ſins they muſt watch againſt; that they muſt be <hi>diligent,—zealous,—fervent</hi> and <hi>perſevering;</hi> that they muſt wait upon him, and not draw back by apoſtacy. And, (7.) He holds out both the <hi>crown</hi> and the <hi>croſs:</hi> he ſhews them what they may expect to <hi>loſe</hi> and <hi>ſuffer</hi> in his ſervice; that they muſt be willing to part with, and forego all things for the crown of glory in reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that they muſt be willing to deny themſelves; to be hated of all men, and to loſe life itſelf in his cauſe and in fidelity to him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHEN ſinners become the ſubjects of Chriſt, they caſt themſelves at his feet,—not deſiring to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late or ſtand on terms; but give him (as a victorious prince) a <hi>blank paper</hi> to make his own terms; reſolved, cheerfully and without reſerve, to ſubſcribe them. And this ſubjection is accompanied with the greateſt love to, and deſire after Chriſt,—his <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>ſervice,</hi> as well as his <hi>rewards;</hi> with a conſent to be the Lords to all intents and purpoſes,—both to <hi>ſerve,</hi> to <hi>ſuffer for,</hi> and to <hi>enjoy</hi> him. It is accompanied with a firm reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and dependance on him, for all needed grace and help to fulfil their duties and obligations;—with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a perpetual and unremitting warfare againſt all his enemies; and with zealous endeavours to promote
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:014137_0235_0F97D4B7354BFF48"/>the intereſts of his kingdom, and gather ſubjects to it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. AFTER the ſubjection of ſinners to Chriſt, he rules him <hi>in love;</hi> gives them needed ſuccours and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in his ſervice;—corrects them for their ſins;—ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them under temptations and ſufferings;—helps them to conquer their enemies, and leads them on to triumph and a crown.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IN his government of enemies, he ſets bounds to their power, malice and wickedneſs;—he turns the evil deſigned by them, into good; and in the end, he will exerciſe kingly power and authority over them, in taking vengeance on all that have continued incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, Chriſt hath exerciſed his kingly office in all ages of the world and church; but he will ſhew it more gloriouſly in the latter days, when the world will be full of his dutiful ſubjects.</p>

            <head>ESSAY XLVIII. <hi>The due</hi> IMPROVEMENT <hi>of</hi> TIME.</head>
            <p>WHEN we ſhall have conſidered the ſhortneſs of time; its vaſt importance, and pointed out the beſt methods of redeeming and improving it, we ſhall have exhauſted this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſhortneſs of time, both <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>relative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> conſidered, is ſo very obvious to perſons who are the leaſt capable of reflection and obſervation, that little need be ſaid of it: For, (1.) How ſmall a thing is the aggregate of time, making one total ſum of all its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctive periods, from the firſt birth of created things, to the final diſſolution of this world and the preſent ſcene, and till time ſhall be computed no more? A few thouſands of fleeting years will ſum it all. Yet a little while, and the mighty angel ſhall lift up his hand to heaven, and ſwear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that <hi>time ſhall be no more.</hi> (2.) If we conſider time as <hi>relative to us,</hi> or the <hi>meaſure of our duration;</hi> what a <hi>ſpan,</hi> what an <hi>hand-breadth,</hi> what a <hi>cvpher</hi> is it? How quickly are our years gone, as a tale that is told? A <hi>day,</hi> how quickly is it gone; and yet how few are the days of the years of our lives? That mighty thing a <hi>year,</hi> which looks ſo large and extenſive before us, how ſwiftly does it paſs, and how ſhort and trifling does it look in retroſpect? Yet how few are the years of moſt lives?—How quickly does a clock tell a <hi>ſecond?</hi> While we pronounce the word, it is expired? Yet a ſhort row of figures in <hi>ſeconds,</hi> makes the ſum of a long life. When we ſee the heap of ſand in the upper lobe of an
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:014137_0237_0F97D4B8B46C5578"/>
               <hi>hour-glaſs,</hi> and mark how ſlow it waſtes, by running into the lower; we are apt to ſay, ſurely this will be long in expending; yet within the ſhort compaſs of an hour, all is fallen! Juſt ſuch is the life of man. Look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon fifty or ſixty years, it ſeems an immenſe heap of time; but the fleeting tranſient minutes quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run it out, and bring it to a period. (3.) How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively ſmall is the period of moſt human lives? It is ſuppoſed, that not every tenth perſon reaches the age of thirty years. The two thirds of our ſpecies die in infancy, and theſe are happy? But from that age up, in which all are moral agents, and accountable for their actions, how many graves do we find of every length? How many die of every age? The thread of time (ſhort at the very longeſt) is <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> and alas! <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly</hi> cut off, and they drop into their graves, like unripe fruit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE neceſſity of improving time, will appear not only from the <hi>ſhortneſs of its duration,</hi> but from its <hi>vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.</hi> (1.) Time is our <hi>only opportunity</hi> both for <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>receiving good,</hi> as <hi>accountable creatures. Opportunity</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary to the accompliſhment of every great and good deſign. If we had all the <hi>will</hi> and all the <hi>power</hi> in the world, to do good for ourſelves or others; yet without opportunity, we can do nothing. The being that never exiſted, (if ſuch an <hi>ideal being</hi> is fairly ſuppoſable) could never have any capacity or opportunity, either of enjoying or communicating good. The being which exiſts but a ſhort time, though it may have the nobleſt capacities for doing and receiving good, yet <hi>its opportunity</hi> is only <hi>as its time.</hi> It is owing to the infinite goodneſs of GOD, that he ever created any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, or gave unto them capacities and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of giving and enjoying good. The ſimple exiſtence of every living creature which GOD hath made, is an
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:014137_0238_0F97D4BAA05DBC70"/>intentional favour and mercy to that creature; for, to <hi>exiſt,</hi> is to be in a capacity for happineſs. It is better even for <hi>ants</hi> and the moſt <hi>trifling inſects to be,</hi> than <hi>not to be;</hi> for, even their ſhort and inſignificant duration, is filled with a happineſs ſuitable to their nature. But, where <hi>ſenſe, reaſon</hi> and <hi>immortality</hi> are ſupperadded, to ſuch beings, the intentional goodneſs of GOD is even infinitely greater; becauſe, to ſuch beings, GOD hath not only given nobler capacities of communicating and receiving a higher and more ſublime happineſs, but hath alſo given them an opportunity of enjoying this happineſs eternally! O, then, under what high obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are <hi>men,</hi> are <hi>human creatures,</hi> to GOD, even for his creating goodneſs, who hath taught them more than the beaſts of the field, made them wiſer than the fowls of heaven, ſtampt upon their nature the image of his own immortality, and made them capable of eternally enjoying the <hi>chief good?</hi> But, (2.) We muſt conſider that the <hi>only opportunity</hi> which we have of enſuring the eternal enjoyment of the chief good of our natures, is our <hi>preſent, ſcanty, uncertain ſpan of time.</hi> When the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of time falls, all opportunity ceaſes of either <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>receiving</hi> that good, which will be eternal in its fruits, conſequences and rewards: For, when the night of death cometh, no man can work the rewardable works of GOD; there is no knowledge, device or repentance in the grave. The reaſon is, becauſe we are probation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary creatures, and our preſent precarious exiſtence, is the only time of our trial. Hence it appears, how <hi>all-important</hi> time is to us, as our <hi>eternal all</hi> depends on the manner in which we improve our ſhort allotment of it. It is our ſeed time for eternity. It is our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, labouring day, wherein we are to lay up in ſtore a good foundation for the time to come. It is our only opportunity of providing for, and enſuring a bleſſed immortality. (3.) Hence it will follow, that
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:014137_0239_0F97D4BAF4984B60"/>as this is the talent which gives worth to all other ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, every day or hour of it abuſed, or not uſed in ſubſerviency to our eternal intereſts, though it may not totally deprive us of <hi>eternal happineſs itſelf,</hi> yet it will certainly leſſen the <hi>degree of that happineſs.</hi> He who, with <hi>one pound,</hi> gained <hi>ten,</hi> was made ruler over <hi>ten cities;</hi> and he who gained but <hi>two,</hi> was made ruler only over <hi>two</hi> cities. A plain proof, that a vigorous improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>this,</hi> and every other talent, will be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably rewarded; and that the more ſlothful and idle ſervant (though he may not be altogether unfaithful) will fall ſhort of the reward which he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by diligence and circumſpection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AS to the beſt methods of <hi>redeeming</hi> and <hi>improving</hi> time, the following may be worthy our attention: (1.) An habitual daily conſideration of, and attention to the great importance of it, as it ſtands connected with our eternal intereſts.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) DAILY ſerious reflections on its <hi>exceeding ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>uncertainty,</hi> and how quickly our day of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be at an end. And this will naturally lead us,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) TO conſider the greatneſs of the work we have to do in this our day, and how dreadful the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will be to us, if we ſhould leave it unfiniſhed.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) MOST will find it worth their ſerious enquiry, whether they have ever, to this day, conſidered for what purpoſe they have had <hi>time,</hi> and been ſent into this world; and whether they are not yet to learn the very meaning of the <hi>improvement of time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) PERSONS who have a due ſenſe of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and value of time, will employ as little of it as poſſible in <hi>abſolute idleneſs;</hi> or, which is the ſame thing, in buſying themſelves in matters, which contribute no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their own advantage, or that of other perſons, much leſs in miſchief.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="241" facs="unknown:014137_0240_0F97D4BBB4784BF8"/>
(6.) TIME employed in worldly buſineſs and cares, is not always <hi>miſſpent</hi> or <hi>thrown away;</hi> for, while we have bodies, families, and the poor and needy to care for, lawful worldly induſtry, will ever be an eſſential part of our Chriſtian duty. But that the time ſpent in worldly buſineſs be <hi>lawfully ſpent,</hi> it is neceſſary that we thus ſpend it in ſubſerviency to a higher, nobler end; that we do it to the glory of GOD, and in obedience to his command, and that the world is kept down from the higheſt place in our affections.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) ALL time ſpent in diverſions and amuſements is not loſt or ſquandered; for, it is needful, that the mind be unbent and the ſpirits refreſhed, in order to fit both for more important duty. But diverſions ſhould never exceed this meaſure. A perſon who is running for a rich prize, ſhould not ſtop and turn aſide to catch butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flies.</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) WHERE perſons are conſcious, that they have trifled away the prime of life in <hi>idleneſs; diſſipation</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and in a wretched unconcern about their high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſts, it becomes them to be more frugal and parſimonious of time than others;—<hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe much of it is already guiltily ſquandered and loſt, and in all probability little remains,—and <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe they have peculiar need to redeem their time by a double di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in well doing, that, if poſſible, they may make ſome amends for former trifling.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) A RIGHT <hi>contrivance</hi> and <hi>planning</hi> of buſineſs, would be an excellent expedient for the better improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time:—So much of every day to the duties of religion;—to the improvement of the mind;—to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares and labours;—to company;—diverſion, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>(10.) DILIGENCE and <hi>diſpatch</hi> in buſineſs, is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to make the beſt of time.</p>

            <head>ESSAY XLIX. <hi>The</hi> CONSIDERATION <hi>of</hi> ETERNITY.</head>
            <p n="1">1. ETERNITY, what a <hi>vaſt, amazing, unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomable, incomprehenſible</hi> ſubject! It is the <hi>exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of him, who is incomprehenſible to all but himſelf!—As we quickly loſe all our ideas in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering <hi>immenſity,</hi> or <hi>infinite ſpace;</hi>—ſo we are equally loſt in conſidering <hi>eternity,</hi> or <hi>infinite duration;</hi> and no wonder, ſince they are in ſome ſort attributes of the <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> JEHOVAH, which none by ſearching can find out unto perfection!</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE word <hi>aion,</hi> which we Engliſh <hi>eternity,</hi> ſignifies <hi>perpetual exiſtence;</hi> and ſince we are finite creatures, it is little wonder, that we ſhould be incapable of forming any adequate conception of it: For, it is not to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that a being who has <hi>begun to exiſt,</hi> ſhould be able to conceive the nature of a being who is <hi>ſelf-exiſtent,</hi> and never had a beginning of exiſtence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ETERNITY is generally diſtinguiſhed into two periods (if one many be allowed ſo to expreſs it;) the <hi>firſt,</hi> is the eternity of duration which <hi>is paſt,</hi> and which can be attributed only to GOD, who alone poſſeſſes it all: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> is that eternity of duration which flows on endleſsly from any given period of time. This laſt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not peculiar to GOD, but is attributed alſo to all immortal creatures, ſuch as <hi>angels, men</hi> and <hi>devils;</hi> who, though they have begun to exiſt, yet never ſhall ceaſe to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS laſt eternity, I mean the eternity of creatures, is not <hi>neceſſary</hi> like the duration of GOD'S exiſtence; but wholly depending on the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>will of</hi> GOD, who
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:014137_0242_0F97D4BD364ECD30"/>has been pleaſed to form ſome of his creatures, for an exiſtence co-eval with himſelf; <hi>i.e.</hi> to <hi>will</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> their duration to be <hi>eternal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. HOW wonderful a being is <hi>that</hi> GOD, who is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in his duration, and immenſely unlimited in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence! his <hi>duration</hi> and his <hi>being</hi> admit of no limits, and therefore admit of no kind of compariſon with the <hi>exiſtence</hi> or <hi>duration</hi> of any created being.</p>
            <p n="6">6. HOW entirely are we dependent on GOD, from whoſe <hi>neceſſary exiſtence,</hi> we have borrowed our <hi>limited exiſtence;</hi> and by the very power of whoſe will, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to exiſt every moment?</p>
            <p n="7">7. THOUGH <hi>abſolute eternity</hi> belongs only to GOD, yet as we ſhare in all that eternity which is before us, and muſt be happy or miſerable through this endleſs dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according as we ſpend our preſent time; it follows that we ſhould live here below, with a conſtant habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al view and regard to our eternal exiſtence and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THIS will enable us upon all occaſions to form a proper eſtimate of things. For, if any <hi>temporary</hi> or <hi>momentary</hi> pleaſures, honours or gains, which would rob us of eternal happineſs, ſhould ſolicit our attention or purſuit, they ought, at all events, to be forborne and rejected.—And if any <hi>temporary</hi> ſufferings or ſelf-denials, which are neceſſary to our eternal happineſs, ſhould fall in our way, they ſhould at all adventures, be endured rather than we ſhould run the riſk of ſuffering eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For, whatever of joy or pain is <hi>temporary,</hi> bears proportion to that which is <hi>eternal.</hi> And it is a maxim of eternal reaſon, that leſſer inconveniences ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be preferred to greater; and that to <hi>ſell eternal happineſs</hi> for the pleaſures of a <hi>moment,</hi> yea, of <hi>ten mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of years,</hi> argues deſperate folly.</p>

            <p>MASTERS of families are pretty univerſally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſuſtain the offices of <hi>prophets, prieſts</hi> and <hi>kings</hi> in their own families, and if we borrow our ideas of the number and importance of the duties they owe to their families, from the ſuſtaining <hi>theſe three offices,</hi> their duty, in this relation, will appear very weighty and important indeed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is the buſineſs of a <hi>prophet</hi> to <hi>inſtruct;</hi> it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the buſineſs of maſters of families, to inſtruct their families, not only in the maxims of prudential wiſdom, but more eſpecially in the doctrines and duties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT will not excuſe parents in the neglect of this duty, that they are <hi>ignorant</hi> themſelves. They ought to <hi>learn</hi> and get knowledge for this very purpoſe. And there are few, but if they take due pains, may acquire knowledge enough, to give <hi>good, wholeſome</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi> inſtructions to their houſholds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IGNORANT and unlearned parents ſhould be the more conſcientious in providing proper inſtructors for their families.</p>
            <p n="4">4. PARENTS may inſtruct their families very uſefully and effectually by ſetting before them blameleſs, virtuous and religious examples; and the beſt inſtructions without this, will be very <hi>ineffectual,</hi> if not perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF it is the duty of <hi>kings</hi> to give good laws, and to preſerve good order among their ſubjects; maſters of families are obliged to do this in their families.</p>

               <pb n="245" facs="unknown:014137_0244_0F97D4BEB4C8D140"/>
6. THE orders and regulations of maſters of families, in their families, ſhould not be more numerous than is neceſſary, leſt they be neglected or forgotten through the multiplicity of them; and their neceſſity ſhould be <hi>made apparent,</hi> that they may be enforced with firmneſs and reſolution.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the government of a family (a ſociety often made up of perſons of very different tempers and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions) great prudence, ſkill and attention are needful, and above all, the divine counſel and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IT appears to be of ill conſequence for the ruler of a family, to give way to the petulency or unreaſonable humours of a capricious domeſtic; as this would be implicitly giving up his prerogative, and foſtering ill humours, and rebellious, lawleſs diſpoſitions in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. It belongs to Chriſtian prudence to determine when this rule ought to be diſpenſed with, in order to prevent greater evils.</p>
            <p n="9">9. LENITY, <hi>compaſſion</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> ſhould be tempered with <hi>firmneſs, ſteadineſs</hi> and <hi>reſolution,</hi> in him, who would govern a family well. Tyranny in little domeſtic ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, is odious; and too much lenity may produce great evils.</p>
            <p n="10">10. BODILY <hi>puniſhment</hi> ſhould be the laſt expedient uſed to reform or correct a domeſtic offender; and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence alone can point out the proper time and place for this.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THE good example of a king is equally binding with his laws, and far more encouraging and alluring; ſo it is in the maſter of a family.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE chief duties of a <hi>prieſt,</hi> are <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion.</hi> This points out the obligation of <hi>praver,</hi> as a duty incumbent on all maſters of families, in their own families.</p>

            <p n="2">2. THE difficulty of our reſiſting a temptation, is in proportion to our natural or habitual proneneſs to the particular ſin to which we are tempted, and the ſtrength or weakneſs of our virtue or grace, taken together.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A PERSON who has been, by <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>cuſtom,</hi> and may ſtill be by <hi>conſtitution,</hi> exceeding prone to ſome particular ſin; yet, by improvement in virtue and ſtrength of grace, may much more eaſily reſiſt a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to that particular ſin, than another perſon of weaker grace and feebler virtue, who is, and has been naturally and conſtitutionally leſs inclined to that ſin.</p>
            <p n="4">4. SOME very vicious and wicked perſons, have little inclination to ſome certain ſins, and therefore are in leſs danger of being tempted to commit them than others of much better diſpoſitions upon the whole; yet whoſe unhappineſs it is, to be naturally prone to thoſe ſins, and eaſily drawn into them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WORLDLY-MINDED, <hi>covetous</hi> perſons, are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily tempted to the ſins of idleneſs, gaming, ſquander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or luxury, and but ſeldom have any ſtrong propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:014137_0247_0F97D4C0F53A5BA8"/>to carnal, ſenſual indulgences, or the ſins of the fleſh; becauſe, all theſe oppoſe and tend to deſtroy their ruling paſſion, which is the love and purſuit of gain. But they are prone to the ſins of lying for gain, of cheating, over-reaching, injuſtice, uſury, cruelty, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and immoderate worldly cares, hazards and toils; and againſt theſe their ſtrongeſt watch and guard ſhould be placed: For, it is but a vain and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty boaſt, for a covetous man to ſay, <q>I am no game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, prodigal, or ſpendthrift; no careleſs, ſlothful man.</q> The world knows he is not, cannot be ſuch, in conſiſtence with his ruling paſſion; and that care, diligence and frugality in him, are only miniſters and hand-maids of his capital vice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. ANGRY, <hi>envious, malicious, revengeful</hi> perſons; as alſo, <hi>vain, boaſting, ambitious</hi> men, are ſeldom prone to the ſins of the fleſh, or the ſoft, ſocial, effeminate vices. This is not the complexion of their nature, or the caſt of their corruption. Their ruling paſſion leads them to other objects, and renders them an eaſy prey to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſet of temptations. Therefore it is little virtue in them, to be free from a ſet of ſins, to which they have naturally ſo little propenſity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THOSE who are extremely addicted to the ſins of the fleſh, are often free from the ſins of <hi>pride, vanity, ambition, malice, covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>revenge;</hi>—not becauſe they are <hi>virtuous,</hi> but becauſe they have no ſtrong biaſs towards theſe ſins, and becauſe the current of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions hurries them another way, and leads them to different objects. It would therefore be an empty boaſt in <hi>ſuch a perſon,</hi> to ſay, <q>I am juſt in my commercial dealings, eaſy in my temper, affable in my deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, kind, charitable, and good natured to all,</q>—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the oppoſite ſins do not claſh or interfere with his <hi>ruling paſſion.</hi>

8. THE <hi>firſt</hi> rule for reſiſting temptations, is to be perfectly acquainted with our <hi>ruling paſſion,</hi> and our ſtrongeſt propenſities to vice;—or in the more nervous language of ſcripture, <hi>To know, every man,</hi> the <hi>plague of his own heart;</hi> the ſin which does <hi>moſt eaſily beſet him;</hi> his <hi>boſom ſin,</hi> his <hi>beloved luſt.</hi> Every man has ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſion or propenſity which <hi>predominates</hi> above the reſt. And to <hi>know</hi> this ſin, is to have diſcovered our greateſt enemy, and our greateſt weakneſs.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> rule is, to ſet the ſtrongeſt guard upon the weakeſt avenue of our ſoul, and againſt our moſt powerful enemy.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>third</hi> rule is, to hold no deliberáte parley with this prevailing luſt, nor ever to ſpare or give it quarter, when it makes its aſſaults however artfully.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>fourth</hi> rule is, to ſhun thoſe thoughts, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and amuſements, which we have found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to prove fuel to the ſins which moſt eaſily beſet us.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>fifth</hi> rule is, to pray and ſtrive in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner againſt theſe particular ſins.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſixth</hi> rule is, to conſider the danger of falling under the power of theſe enemies, and the difficulty of recovering. To all theſe may be added, a</p>
            <p>SEVENTH prudential maxim, namely, to keep our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diligently employed in ſome honeſt calling or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which is a very powerful preſervative againſt temptation, as it cuts off thoſe occaſions and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which miniſter to it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. TEMPTATIONS may turn to the advantage of thoſe who reſiſt them many ways:</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) As conqueſt over them is a proof of grace, and ground of joy.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As every conqueſt of this kind ſtrengthens the habit of virtue; gives courage and magnanimity to the
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:014137_0249_0F97D4C273BDBE28"/>ſoul, and renders future victories over the ſame enemy more eaſy.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) As it renders thoſe who have thus conquered, the better qualified to adviſe and ſuccour thoſe that are tempted, and gives them a better right to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) As it ſhews us experimentally the power put into our hands to conquer other temptations, and tends to humble and give us remorſe for not having availed ourſelves of this power upon former occaſions.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) As it tends to beget gratitude in us towards that Being, by whoſe grace alone we are enabled to conquer any temptation; and teaches us <hi>on whom</hi> to rely, and <hi>whence</hi> to draw our ſuccours, in future trials. And,</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) As it is beating the devil in the field of battle, depriving him of a triumph, and diſcouraging him from farther attempts upon us.</p>
            <p n="10">10. WE may make the reſiſting of temptations uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to others, in various ways: As, (1.) If we are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by any particular perſon to ſin, to reſiſt his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may be a means of reforming him. (2.) On ſome occaſions it may be lawful and uſeful to encourage and ſupport the tottering virtue of others, by informing them of our ſucceſs; or by relating it under the fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of ſome third perſon: As, <q>I have known a perſon, who was thus tempted, and thus reſiſted.</q> (3.) If the temptation is of <hi>a public kind,</hi> he who reſiſts it, preaches a loud ſermon againſt vice; and it is much if ſome one or more, in company, are not benefited by it. (4.) If none for the preſent are bettered by ſuch a public teſtimony againſt vice, yet it muſt leave the guilty, under ſuch a conviction of the power and merit of virtue, as may ſome time or other prevail.</p>

            <head>ESSAY LII. PUBLIC SPIRIT.</head>
            <p n="1">1. PUBLIC <hi>ſpirit,</hi> is a <hi>generoſity of temper,</hi> ariſing from the principle of univerſal benevolence, and is directly oppoſed to a <hi>narrow, ſelfiſh, contracted</hi> temper, which ſeeks only its own private intereſt, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and advantage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A TRULY public ſpirited perſon, does not, indeed, neglect himſelf as an individual, nor his family, as parts of himſelf; but he does not live for himſelf or his family alone; his generous heart deviſeth liberal things, and takes pleaſure in forming ſchemes and projects for the good of mankind, with whoſe intereſt he feels his own intereſt to be cloſely and inſeparably connected. On the contrary, a <hi>ſelfiſh perſon,</hi> deſtitute of the virtue of public ſpirit, has his eye chiefly fixed on that dear idol <hi>himſelf</hi> (of which he conſiders his family as a part.) All his ſchemes and projects terminate there, and he takes little or no pleaſure in any advantage, or honour, but what comes in to this dear idol.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHATEVER promotes the public honour or good: whatever ſcheme <hi>brings</hi> or <hi>offers</hi> benefit to one's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or tends to promote its credit and reputation among ſtrangers, gives a peculiar pleaſure to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirited perſon, and he is ready to encourage, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and aſſiſt it, to the utmoſt of his power. If he has not the talent of projecting ſuch ſchemes himſelf, he readily falls in with them when propoſed, and is ſo far from needing to be prompted to join in them, that he rejoices in having an opportunity of <hi>doing public good,</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:014137_0251_0F97D4C3F3B27388"/>which is his favourite ruling paſſion. And if he can do but little himſelf in gratifying ſo benevolent a paſſion, he labours to encourage others, who are better able. On the contrary, the <hi>ſelfiſh man,</hi> has a thouſand pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reaſons againſt conſenting to a ſcheme which might coſt him ſomething: <q>It will beggar the public; it will oppreſs the poor; it is impracticable; or it will never anſwer the end propoſed.</q>—If he is out-voted by a majority, he conſents with reluctance, and is for bringing the terms of expence as low as poſſible, always having an eye to <hi>ſelf.</hi>—If for ſhame be is obliged to contribute, the heſitating manner in which he does it, or the boaſts he makes of it, give plain evidence that he did it unwillingly.—If the ſcheme miſcarries, or does not anſwer the intention, he reproaches and abuſes the projectors, and makes this an argument againſt all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture public ſpirited projects.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A TRULY public ſpirited perſon has a real, ſenſible pleaſure in the proſperity and ſucceſs of his neighbours, and heartily feels for their adverſity and ill-fortune. It would give his generous benevolent heart a refined plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee all proſperous, all rich, all healthy, all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, all honoured and eſteemed:—And when he ſees the reverſe, he <hi>feels</hi> for the calamity of his neighbours, and is himſelf the leſs happy amidſt his own health, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſucceſs and abundance. On the contrary, the <hi>ſelfiſh man</hi> has an <hi>unfeeling heart</hi> towards his neighbour.— Is he happy and proſperous himſelf? He hugs and bleſſes himſelf in his good fortune: He ſacrifices to his own net, and burns incenſe to his own dreg. He imputes it to his own induſtry, diligence, honeſty or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and has no pity for his neighbour's misfortunes which, according to him, are all owing to ſome neglect or miſconduct on his part. In ſhort, he <hi>feels only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> unaffected either with hearty joy or grief for the good or bad fortune of others.</p>

5. THE public ſpirit of a place may be pretty cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly inferred, from the monuments of it in that place. Do we ſee in a nation or in a neighbourhood, <hi>learning, arts</hi> and ſciences encouraged and flouriſhing; rich and ſtately churches; charity foundations for educating the poor, and healing the ſick; the public roads in good repair and the like; it may be depended on, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit prevails in ſuch places.—On the contrary, where <hi>public works</hi> and <hi>public charities</hi> are neglected in places, otherwiſe rich and opulent, and where private property abounds, it may be depended on, that <hi>there</hi> a <hi>ſelfiſh ſpirit</hi> and <hi>narrow, contracted principles prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. PUBLIC ſpirit was cultivated and cheriſhed with the greateſt care amongſt the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> and had wonderful effects in <hi>that commonwealth.</hi> It ſeems now to prevail much in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh colonies.</hi> Wherever <hi>true learning</hi> and <hi>noble ſentiments of liberty</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, it flouriſhes. Under the contrary circumſtances, it is <hi>ſtarved</hi> and <hi>periſhes.</hi> It is at a low ebb among theſe Iſlands, a few only excepted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. PUBLIC ſpirit is <hi>a ſhinning</hi> and a uſeful virtue: (1.) It is the offspring of univerſal charity and benevolence. (2.) It is the brighteſt reſemblance of GOD and his <hi>bleſſed San.</hi> (3.) It is the certain mark of a <hi>brave, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, benevolent</hi> ſoul. (4.) It is the parent of <hi>noble, generous</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> actions.—And therefore, (5.) It is the ſource of the trueſt and moſt roſined delight and pleaſure to thoſe who are poſſeſſed of it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE Apoſtles of Chriſt, and thoſe of their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors who propagated the goſpel in foreign nations, at the expence of every thing dear and comfortable in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, gave proof of the higheſt and nobleſt public ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>

            <p n="1">1. OUR bleſſed Saviour has laid down an expreſs precept to his diſciples, which <hi>ſtates</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> their duties towards enemies: <q>But I ſay unto you love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you,</q> Matth. v. 44.

Yet there is no precept of the goſpel, the equity of which has been more diſputed than this, and the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of obedience to it, more ſtiffly and publicly aſſerted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE reaſon of the great reluctance of men's minds againſt this precept ſeems to be this, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and revenge are the moſt radical parts of the <hi>devil's</hi> image remaining in the minds of men, through their apoſtacy and the corruption of their nature; and <hi>theſe</hi> together with <hi>miſtaken notions of ſelf-preſervation,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſelf-love,</hi> diſpoſed men to imagine, that to love an enemy is <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and to hate him is <hi>juſt.</hi>

3. BUT when we ſpeak of the duty of <hi>loving enemies,</hi> we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the love of <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> and <hi>eſteem,</hi> and the love of <hi>benevolence</hi> or <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.</hi> As to the <hi>former,</hi> we cannot have it for one who does not appear amiable to our underſtanding, even to a child;—but the latter we owe, and ought to pay to all men. A parent for inſtance, is far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving a <hi>ſtubborn, refractory, immoral</hi> child; yet ſtill his love of benevolence and good-will, ſhall continue in its full force and efficacy. <q>GOD hateth the workers of iniquity, and is angry with the wicked every day:</q> He cannot therefore love them with a love of <hi>eſteem</hi> and <hi>complacency;</hi> yet is he <hi>good</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> to the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>unthankful;</hi> and with ſuch a love of benevolence and beneficence did he love this <hi>ſinful, inimical</hi> world, as to give his only begotten Son to it, <q>that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. v. 45.

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. THIS is occaſioned by the univerſal corruption and degeneracy of human nature, and by the conſequent carnal, earthly, impure nature of the paſſions and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ungovernable licentiouſneſs of the tongue which is actuated by thoſe inward, irregular and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure movements of the ſoul. Human ſociety, in its preſent ſtate, may be compared to a <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> where all are weak and diſeaſed, and where, by a ſpreading con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, every one more or leſs infects another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes his weakneſs and diſorder: So, that every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, is more or leſs infected and contaminated by others. No two can aſſociate together, who are in a ſtate of perfect health and ſoundneſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. UPON the whole, the <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>more virtuous</hi> our company is, the leſs will we be expoſed to tempations of any kind;—and it may happen, that in many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional interviews with wiſe and virtuous perſons, all may, upon the whole, be made better.—This effect might be expected from religious ſocieties and conferences, were they rightly conducted.—But we now chiefly mean, the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>occaſional</hi> interviews of mankind with each other, at <hi>entertainments, complimental viſits, parties of

That a man is to ſtudy his own eaſe, pleaſure and intereſt, and the like.</q> Theſe errors though they may ſeem, at firſt ſight, of little conſequence, yet lead men to the moſt pernicious and immoral practices, and confirm them in them.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

The great doctrines of religion are diſputed and controverted, with an angry warmth, or a flippant lightneſs, which tends to diſcredit them both in our own minds, and in the minds of others. The names of GOD and CHRIST, <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>hell, ſalvation</hi> and <hi>damnation,</hi> are bandied about as the meereſt trifles. Diſreſpectful and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hints are often uttered, in the heat of paſſion and diſcontent, againſt doctrines or duties, which we do not like, and which croſs the grain of our corrupt nature: All which tend to deſtroy our reverence for holy things, an eraze the very foundations of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſeriouſneſs and piety.</p>

For ordinary to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and aſſociate with the beſt companies: For, man being a ſocial creature, cannot well be wholly without company.—(2.) When we accidentally or on buſineſs fall into company of a worſe kind, to endeavour as far as our influence will reach, to give the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a profitable, or, at leaſt, an innocent turn and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.—(3.)

If we find ourſelves unable to do this, and that we are in danger of ſinful compliances, to make our ſtay as ſhort as poſſible.—(5.) To make reflections after retiring, on the temptations we have met with, and to fortify our minds againſt future dangers of the ſame kind.—(6.) To ſhun, if poſſible, for the future, thoſe companies, or kinds of company, in which we have met with temptations too ſtrong for our virtue and reſolution: And, (7.) which ought to have been mentioned <hi>firſt,</hi> To aim our prayers and endeavours againſt the temptations of ſociety, and eſpecially of thoſe companies, which, by the nature of our ſituation or bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in lie, we are obliged moſt commonly to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</p>

            <p n="1">1. ALTHOUGH a ſocial life, or a life ſpent in company, has its ſnares and dangers, yet it has its advantages too; and the ſociety of our fellow-creatures, well conducted, may contribute greatly to our improvement in virtue and happineſs. How many noble and uſeful hints are often ſtarted in converſation, which we would have laboured for in vain in the way of private meditation? How many motives to virtue, and diſſuaſives againſt vice? How often has a tottering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution been ſupported and ſtrengthened by a ſingle word; by a ſingle look or frown?</p>
            <p n="2">2. NOR need we imagine, that we can flee from the danger of temptation, by ſhunning the ſociety of our fellow-creatures; for, there are a number of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſeem almoſt peculiar to <hi>ſolitude,</hi> and which will purſue us to the moſt remote and hidden receſſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AS GOD hath made man a <hi>ſocial creature,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with <hi>ſocial bents,</hi> it appears he is chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for a <hi>ſocial, active</hi> life, to give aſſiſtance to, and receive aſſiſtance from his fellow-creatures; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that it is not the duty of men to ſeek and affect ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and retirement, unleſs it be ocaſionally, for the purpoſes of meditation, ſelf-examination, extraordinary prayer and devotion.</p>

4. IF it be the intention of GOD, that me ſhould live in ſociety, and employ their ſocial powers and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents for the purpoſes of devotion; we may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a <hi>monkiſh, recluſe</hi> life, is againſt the intention of GOD, and that he may juſtly give over men to ſtrong temptations, who thus affect a kind of life, ſo contrary to the end and deſign of their being.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT has been obſerved, that the firſt <hi>hermits</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſes,</hi> did greatly corrupt Chriſtianity; and that the monks and nuns of later ages, have been, generally ſpeaking, a very wicked kind of people, infamous for many great vices: For, by binding themſelves up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſolemn vows, to auſterities which GOD never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, their corruptions have been the more outrageous, and they have been ſuffered to fall into the vileſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IT is remarkable, that the <hi>devil</hi> purſued our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to a wilderneſs, where he thought he could more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ply his temptations againſt him, than in the ſociety of men. And the evil ſpirit, in the parable, who left the poſſeſſed man, is ſaid to have wandered in <hi>ſolitary</hi> and <hi>dry places,</hi> where he conſorted with many other ſpirits. Nor is it unworthy of a remark here, that if there is any truth in <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p n="7">7. SOLITUDE often tempts men to ſins, through the advantage of ſecrecy, which they would be aſhamed to practiſe in human ſociety.</p>
            <p n="8">8. SOLITUDE naturally generates melancholy, and clouds the mind with gloomy thoughts; thereby dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening and ſpoiling the judgment.</p>
            <p n="9">9. RECLUSES, as they have little ſociety with the world, and know little of the force of theſe temptations
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:014137_0263_0F97D4CDB399E278"/>which accompany a ſocial life, ſo they are naturally prone to an over-rigid, uncharitable diſpoſition of mind, and cenſorious reflections on the actions and conduct of thoſe who are engaged in active, ſocial life.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THE <hi>devil,</hi> ever vigilant and active to ſeduce rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal creatures, when he cannot get the advantage over them, by the temptations which ariſe from ſociety, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten drives them into ſullen ſolitude; puts them out of temper with the world, and the proper duties of life, and there purſues them with <hi>blaſphemous ſuggeſtions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thoughts,</hi> and <hi>deſperate reſolutions.</hi> And it has been generally obſerved, that thoſe whom he drives to <hi>ſelf-murder,</hi> have been long haters of ſociety, and lovers of ſolitude and retirement.</p>
            <p n="11">11. UPON the whole. To ſhun ſociety leſt we fall into temptation, is not only rank cowardice, but alſo very abſurd.

St. Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of meats forbidden by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> declares the power and liberty which Chriſtians have to uſe them freely: <q>I know, ſays he, and am perſuaded by the Lord Jeſus, that there is nothing unclean of itſelf;</q>—yet he adds—<q>But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkeſt thou not charitably.—Deſtroy not him with thy meat for whom Chriſt died:—For, through thy knowledge (of thy Chriſtian liberty, and uſe of it) ſhall the weak brother periſh, for whom Chriſt died: For, when we ſin ſo againſt the brethren, and would their weak conſcience, we ſin againſt Chriſt.—Let no man put a ſtumbling-block, or an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fall, in his brother's way. It is good nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eat fleſh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.

6.—(2.) OUR Chriſtian liberty is by no means to be betrayed or given up, in order to eſcape perſecution. This treachery ſeems to have been the chief crime of the <hi>Judaizing teachers,</hi> who urged it upon the Gentile converts to be circumciſed, and who themſelves obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ceremonies of the Jewiſh law, that they might paſs for <hi>Jews,</hi> with the Jewiſh and Heathen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, under that pretext; and for which <hi>St. Paul,</hi> ſo ſeverely reproaches them and their followers<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gal. ii. 1,—6.—iii. 1,—4.—v. 1,—13.</note>.— And indeed, all perſecution for religion, and among Chriſtians, is founded on ſome incroachment on Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian liberty,—or on impoſing ſome things on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inconſiſtent with it.</p>
            <p n="7">7.—(3.) OUR Chriſtian liberty ſhould not be given up to meer peeviſhneſs, humour and caprice. Many perſons who know, or ought to know the extent of Chriſtian liberty, are yet ſo unreaſonable in their humours or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in their temper, that they will not allow to others the ſame innocent liberties which they allow to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. or, while they themſelves <hi>ſwallow a camel,</hi> they loſe all charity and temper with their brother, if he does not <hi>ſtrain at a gnat.</hi> Now, to endeavour to pleaſe ſuch perſons to their good unto edifying, is to aim at an impoſſibility. Caprice and contradictory humour can never be pleaſed, never be edified. Indeed, every attempt to pleaſe it, is to increaſe the diſorder, and to ſtrengthen its petulancy.</p>
            <p n="8">8. OUR Chriſtian liberty ought to be vindicated and adhered to reſolutely, where the giving it up is like to be hurtful to the ſouls of men, and the intereſts of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by propagating <hi>idolatry</hi> and <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi> And in this caſe, perſons of the greateſt note and weight in the church, ſhould be ready to ſuffer all things, rather than
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:014137_0267_0F97D4D0B515BCA8"/>give it up by baſe compliance. This was <hi>Archbiſhop Cranmer's</hi> crime. Reformation in religion, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from idolatrous and ſuperſtitious communities, can never be accompliſhed or juſtified, but on this principle. Upon this foundation is built the <hi>proteſtant reformation,</hi> and thoſe proteſtants who ſtill labour to reduce Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to its original and native ſimplicity, act very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably on this principle, and will ever be had in eſteem by the proper judges and true friends of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an liberty.</p>
            <p n="9">9. CHRISTIAN liberty, is in many caſes to be given up in compaſſion to the ignorance and inveterate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of others, until this ignorance and theſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices can be removed. The apoſtolic decree<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xv. 22.</note> was made on this account; and the Jewiſh converts were allowed to have their children circumciſed, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from certain meats, and to obſerve certain legal ceremonies, until they would be better inſtructed in the principles of their Chriſtian liberty:—Whereas, the Gentile or Heathen converts were not indulged in theſe matters, as they had no inveterate prejudices of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their favour<note n="†" place="bottom">See the whole Epiſtle to the Gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="10">10. OUR Chriſtian liberty ought perhaps in many caſes to be given up in favour of <hi>incurable weakneſs,</hi> eſpecially where it is <hi>general.</hi> Suppoſe a whole neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of weak of Chriſtians had got it their heads, from the apoſtolic decree, that it was ſinful to eat blood, or things ſtrangled; or, from any other means were perſuaded, that it was an unpardonable crime to eat with unwaſhen hands, or to ſhave their heads or beards, or any other whimſy; it would perhaps become

There can be no moral evil in often viſiting a tavern, or a houſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous report, ſuppoſing there is no ill deſign, or ill practice; nay, perhaps, it may be done with the beſt views and from the beſt motives: Yet, becauſe of the ſcandal that might attend this practice, it might be beſt to refrain it.

Such are games of <hi>hazard,</hi> and ſucceſs in which depends in a great meaſure on <hi>lottery,</hi> ſuch as <hi>cards, dice,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF there are any other diverſions which are either directly ſinful in themſelves, or lead unavoidably to the corruption of manners, theſe are wholly out of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion at preſent, as being in themſelves unlawful, and therefore forbidden to Chriſtians; ſuch as rioting and drunkenneſs, chambering and wantonneſs, impure dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, laſciviouſneſs, effeminacy, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. OF <hi>lawful diverſions,</hi> ſome are calculated to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the body, and thoſe are beſt ſuited to ſedentary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe callings afford them too little exerciſe for the purpoſes of health; ſuch as <hi>running, walking, leaping, fencing,</hi> and all thoſe plays or diverſions which give mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exerciſe to the body, and tend to circulate the blood, and promote digeſtion and perſpiration. Others are calculated to recreate and unbend the mind, ſuch are <hi>cheſs,</hi> and a number of others; and theſe ſeem beſt adapted for thoſe who live an active, laborious, fatiguing life.</p>

               <pb n="271" facs="unknown:014137_0270_0F97D4D33848E7B0"/>
4. THE very words, <hi>diverſions</hi> and <hi>amuſements,</hi> point out the uſe and deſign of theſe paſtimes. They are only intended to unbend the mind, and refreſh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and animal ſpirits, that thoſe who uſe them may be the better fitted and qualified to diſcharge the ſerious, neceſſary and important buſineſſes of life; the care of the ſoul and of the body.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM this notion of <hi>diverſions, amuſements</hi> or <hi>recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> we may learn many important leſſons about the right choice, uſe and regulation of them. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) IT is evident, that a life ſpent in a continual, or almoſt perpetual round of diverſions, muſt be a <hi>wicked, ill ſpent</hi> life. This is wholly to miſemploy life, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the proper buſineſs of it; and that too, under the wicked notion, that it is innocent, proper and beneficial to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) IF diverſion or amuſement may be properly conſidered as the <hi>phyſic of life,</hi> by which the diſorders of the body and mind, contracted by an intenſe application to the ſerious and proper buſineſs of it, are relieved and cured, and their vigour, ſprightlineſs and activity reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a freſh application: Then, to ſpend one's life in a perpetual round of diverſions, is as abſurd and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, as though a perſon, neglecting all food, ſhould live wholly upon phyſic, under a pretence of preſerving his health and vigour.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) IF habits are contracted by repeated act; then a life ſpent in giddy diverſions and amuſements, muſt in courſe of time ſo relax and effeminate both the body and mind, as to render them wholly unfit for any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the ſerious and important buſineſſes of life; muſt beget an inveterate habit of the worſt kind of idleneſs; and, in ſine, muſt turn perſons, thus devoted to diverſions, into meer <hi>whirligigs</hi> and <hi>uſeleſs drones,</hi> bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and nuiſances to ſociety. A life of perpetual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:014137_0271_0F97D4D50E4A5B10"/>verſion, is a life of perpetual intoxication; and perſons devoted to it, are generally the moſt uſeleſs and miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous members of ſociety. Witneſs perpetual dancers and gameſters.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) WHEN diverſions are turned into the conſtant buſineſs of life, they wholly change their nature, and loſe their good effects; they are ſo far from unbending the mind, that they become its only burden; they are ſo far from recreating and refreſhing the body, that they fatigue it, and exhauſt the animal ſpirits; they are ſo far from rendering the body vigorous, and the mind chearful, that they injure the health and ſink the ſpirits. This is, with a witneſs, to make a toil of a pleaſure; and to turn that cordial drop, which makes life's bitter draught go glibly down, into a <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>deleterious poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5.) IF the proper deſign of diverſions is, by refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body and recreating the mind, to render both more lively and vigorous, and thereby fit them for a more vigorous application to the proper, neceſſary and important duties of life; then all ſuch diverſions and amuſements as evidently tend to hurt the body or the mind, and obſtruct the proper end of diverſions, muſt needs be unlawful and ſinful: And the ſame will hold true of lawful and innocent diverſions continued too long at a time. Although <hi>gaming</hi> were innocent in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet it were extremely unlawful to ſpend whole weeks, night and day, in that diverſion, to the breaking of natural reſt, and thereby hurting both the body and mind, and to the neglect of all duties, civil, ſocial and religious. Although <hi>dancing</hi> may be innocent in itſelf, yet to ſpend whole nights in that exerciſe, to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing of the body, neglecting all the duties of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and cloſet, and unfitting perſons for the proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the next day, is certainly criminal and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.—For
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:014137_0272_0F97D4D535295448"/>a poor man, whoſe family calls for all his time and labour to clothe and feed them, to ſpend <hi>one day,</hi> much more, <hi>ſeveral days</hi> in diverſions, is a ſin againſt <hi>juſtice, charity</hi> and <hi>mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. DIVERSIONS which may be innocent and lawful to <hi>ſome,</hi> and in <hi>certain circumſtances,</hi> may be yet unlawful to <hi>others,</hi> and in certain <hi>different circumſtances.</hi> As, (1.) It may not be abſolutely unlawful in a Chriſtian, to amuſe himſelf by playing an <hi>innocent game,</hi> or play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a <hi>muſical inſtrument,</hi> or <hi>walking,</hi> or <hi>riding,</hi> or, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps dancing;—yet to mix with <hi>ſwearing, drinking,</hi> or <hi>profane</hi> company for the ſake of partaking in theſe amuſements, as it would be extremely <hi>indecent,</hi> ſo it would alſo be very <hi>criminal;</hi> as it would ſhew, that this <hi>love of pleaſure</hi> was ſuperior to his <hi>averſion to vice</hi> and <hi>evil example;</hi>—and as his example in this particular inſtance, would look like a giving a ſanction to the vices of his company.—(2.) To perſons who find, that by any particular diverſions and amuſements, they are ſtrongly tempted to ſin; ſuch <hi>diverſions</hi> or <hi>amuſements</hi> muſt needs be extremely ſinful;—Thus, ſuppoſing <hi>dancing</hi> and <hi>gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to be <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>inoffenſive</hi> in themſelves, yet to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who, by the one, are tempted to <hi>fret, ſwear</hi> and <hi>cheat;</hi> or who, by the other, are tempted to <hi>other ſins,</hi> theſe diverſions muſt be <hi>highly criminal.</hi>—(3.) Where any particular diverſion, though innocent in itſelf, is greatly abuſed in a place, and madly purſued by the inhabitants, to the prejudice of <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>good morals;</hi> Chriſtians ought not only to <hi>ahſtain from,</hi> but alſo <hi>bear a teſtimony againſt</hi> ſuch diverſions, ſo abuſed, for the good of ſociety.—(4.) Diverſions which may be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in themſelves, may change their nature and become exceeding criminal, either by being <hi>miſtimed,</hi> or <hi>too long continued.</hi> For inſtance, to indulge to amuſements on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> or in a time of <hi>public diſtreſs</hi> or <hi>calamity</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="unknown:014137_0273_0F97D4D5F42F8710"/>which calls for conſideration, mourning, prayer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;—or, indulge to diverſions and amuſements, when <hi>juſtice, charity</hi> and <hi>mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. A LIFE ſpent in giddy diverſions, is utterly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the hopes of ſalvation; being inconſiſtent with a <hi>due</hi> and <hi>ſerious concern</hi> either for the <hi>ſoul</hi> or the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> for ourſelves, or for others.</p>
            <p n="8">8. IT might be a good touch-ſtone for ſuch diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as are <hi>ſuitable</hi> and <hi>becoming</hi> for Chriſtians; to try within ourſelves whether we could ſeriouſly aſk GOD'S bleſſing upon them; or quit them at an inſtant, and addreſs ourſelves to GOD in ſolemn prayer: For, as it is our duty always to watch and pray, leſt we enter into temptation, and to be ever in a poſture of readineſs to meet the ſummons of death in the way of our duty; and as we know not the moment we may be called to give an account of our ſtewardſhip, all diverſions inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this frame of mind, ſeem improper for Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
            <p n="9">9. TO render diverſions or amuſements <hi>lawful,</hi> they muſt have theſe properties:—(1.) They muſt be <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> in themſelves:—(2.) They muſt be <hi>decent</hi> and of <hi>good repute,</hi> or ſuch as the generality of good people have not condemned (and this will cut off <hi>card-playing,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>games of hazard,</hi> more eſpecially <hi>all gaming for money,</hi> from the liſt of innocent diverſions):—(3.) They ought to be ſuch as are not of pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, by the bad regulation and abuſe of them in the places where we live:—(4.) No more of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:014137_0274_0F97D4D6B403DF48"/>time ſhould be conſumed by them, than is barely neceſſary for the purpoſe of recreation; nor ſhould they be oftener uſed than is needful, leſt the mind be intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by them, and led off from more important mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by contracting a habit of trifling and levity:— (5.) They ſhould be ſuch as we find by experience are not attended with ſtrong temptations to ourſelves, and as have no ſenſible tendency to draw off our minds from the duties of religion, or from the neceſſary and important duties of life. Upon the whole, they ſhould be ſuch, and ſo uſed and regulated as not to excite any remorſe of conſcience in a ſenſible, ſerious and tender mind.</p>
            <p n="10">10. THOUGH it does not ſeem reaſonable, or conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the preſent frail and imperfect ſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, to forbid all kinds of worldly amuſements and recreations, as <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet to perſons of a right way of thinking, and of a ſpiritual and refined taſte; theſe kinds of diverſions will he found <hi>very little neceſſary;</hi> and the very duties of religion, ſuch as <hi>reading, ſinging of pſalms</hi> with melody in the heart, <hi>meditation</hi> and <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation</hi> on the works and ways of GOD, <hi>religius conference,</hi> and <hi>doing good offices</hi> to the ſouls and bodies of men, will furniſh pleaſures and delights, far preferable to any that can reſult from worldly pleaſures and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="11">11. IN ſhort, the faſhionable diverſions are attended with ſo many ſnares and dangers to virtue and innocence, and, at the beſt, are ſuch <hi>thieves of precious time,</hi> that thoſe diſcover the <hi>ſoundeſt judgment</hi> who have the leaſt taſte and fondneſs for them, and who leaſt frequent and join in them.</p>
            <p n="12">12. RELIGION promiſes the <hi>higheſt</hi> and <hi>nobleſt comforts and pleaſures,</hi> and thoſe who betray too fond a deſire for worldly pleaſures and diverſions, either prove that

            </p>
            <p n="13">13. THE <hi>devil,</hi> by a ſurprizing dexterity, has turned ſome of the moſt ſolemn periods of life, into ſeaſons devoted to the madeſt riot and giddy diverſion; witneſs our <hi>birth-days,</hi> and the <hi>firſt day of every New Year.</hi>

            <head>ESSAY LVIII. <hi>The</hi> VALUE <hi>and</hi> IMPORTANCE <hi>of a</hi> CHILD.</head>
            <p n="1">1. IMMORTALITY has ſtamped an amazing value on man. No conſcious being, who is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of eternal happineſs or miſery, can poſſibly be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>important</hi> or <hi>of little account.</hi> Man, who carries about with him a <hi>rational, undying</hi> ſoul, little knows or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of what a treaſure he is poſſeſſed. All the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, all the riches, all the ſtupendous wonders of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial nature are, in compariſon with it, leſs than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and vanity! If man conſidered this, would it not be more his endeavour to act up to the dignity of his nature? Would he not be aſhamed of <hi>baſe, mean</hi> and <hi>ignoble</hi> actions, which vilify and debaſe his real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and degrade him below his rank in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE moment in which a rational, immortal ſpirit animates a human <hi>foetus,</hi> a ſpark is kindled which ſhall never be extinguiſhed. The material ſun will grow old, wax dim with years, and be probably put out as a lamp that burneth; the ſtars ſhall fall from their orbits, and
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:014137_0276_0F97D4D833C3FFB8"/>be covered with darkneſs; but this breath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, this intellectual ſpark once kindled up in the moral world, ſhall burn on with undiminiſhed and ever-increaſing luſtre, as long as GOD himſelf endures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE birth of a child we deem to be but a trifling event, and look with <hi>indifference,</hi> perhaps with <hi>contempt,</hi> on the little, helpleſs ſtranger. But if we viewed it with the penetrating eye of reaſon; if we conſidered it as emerging from eternal night into life immortal;—as an heir of worlds unknown, and a candidate for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſtate;—as a glimmering ſpark of being, juſt ſtruck from nothing by the all-creating rock, which muſt burn and flame on to eternity, when ſuns and ſtars have returned to their native darkneſs or non-entity;— which muſt ſurvive the funeral of nature, and live through the rounds of endleſs ages; which muſt either riſe from glory to glory, aſcending perfection's ſcale by endleſs gradations, or ſink deeper and deeper into the bottom leſs abyſs of miſery, and to which its immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt either prove an <hi>unſufferable curſe,</hi>—or a <hi>bleſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,</hi> according to the manner in which it ſhall have acquitted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſelf in its preſent probationary ſtate— we ſhall clearly diſcern, that the value and importance of a human infant can ſcarcely be computed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To illuſtrate this thought, let us briefly conſider, <hi>The evil</hi> or <hi>good</hi> which may be either <hi>done</hi> or <hi>received</hi> by a child, in the courſe of its exiſtence. And,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) PERHAPS this child is an <hi>embrio-fiend.</hi> Knoweſt thou, O man, O parent, to what this child is born? Of what this child is capable? It is now a pitiable, helpleſs infant, but if thou kneweſt the enormous ſins and dreadful ſufferings with which its future exiſtence is pregnant, and moſt of them probably through thy own ſinful example and guilty neglect, thou wouldſt be ſo far from rejoicing at its birth, that thou wouldſt weep
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:014137_0277_0F97D4D8F6053558"/>and lament for the miſeries which are coming upon it, and upon thyſelf for thy neglect of the duties which thou oweſt it. Perhaps thou haſt never prayed that GOD might ſanctify this child while in the womb. It has been indeed baptized; but haſt thou ever offered up one fervent prayer for it ſince it has been born? Haſt thou offered it up to the holy Trinity by faith, and with that ſolemnity which the baptiſmal dedication requires? Inſtead of ſetting before it a pious and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous example, teaching it to pray, inſpiring it with a horror againſt vice, inſtilling into its tender opening mind, the principles of piety and good morals, correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its errors, and reſtraining its paſſions and appetites, haſt thou not ſet before it the very worſt example— taught it the language of blaſphemy and profanity, foſtered every malignant paſſion, and cheriſhing every budding vice in its ſoul? And what is the conſequence? It grows up a monſter of wickedneſs, a <hi>devil incarnate.</hi> It ſpreads the baneful contagion of vice as far as its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence can reach; becomes the <hi>tempter,</hi> the <hi>devil</hi> of every company; the ſpoiler and obſtructer of all good! How many of its fellow-immortals has it drawn into guilt and miſery? Perhaps it at len<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Neros,</hi> the <hi>Herods,</hi> the <hi>tyrants,</hi> the <hi>ſcourges</hi> of the earth, were once helpleſs infants!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) PERHAPS this child is an <hi>embrio-angel.</hi> Knoweſt thou, O man, O parent, to what this child is born, of what this child is capable? It has been the child of thy prayers and vows. Thou haſt ſolemnly given it up to GOD in baptiſm, and he has graciouſly accepted the ſurrender. It is thy conſtant ſolicitous care to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:014137_0278_0F97D4D9B384CC08"/>it daily to the guidance and protection of its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven; to ſet a blameleſs, pious and virtuous example before it; to inſtil into its tender opening mind the principles of piety, integrity and univerſal goodneſs. Indulgent heaven ſmiles on thine endeavours and renders them ſucceſsful by the concurring aids of omnipotent grace, The ſeed of knowledge and of grace ſo liberally ſown, will preſently grow up into a plenteous harveſt of uſefulneſs here and glory hereafter. The child, like the holy child JESUS, will grow up in knowledge, as in ſtature, and in favour both with GOD and <hi>man.</hi> The implanted principle of grace, ſhall be in him a well of water, ſpringing up into everlaſting life<note n="*" place="bottom">John iv. 14.</note>. He ſhall bring forth much fruit to the glory of GOD, and to the good of his fellow mortals. Every day will bring him ſome good, or make him the inſtrument of ſome good to his fellow men. Nor ſhall his progreſs in holineſs and happineſs be terminated by this mortal life, but probably go on through eternal ages. In a word, who can conceive the good of which ſuch a child may be made the inſtrument, or the degrees of happineſs and of glory to which it may be advanced? St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and all thoſe worthies under the <hi>Patriarchal, Moſaical</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> diſpenſations, who wrought ſo much good in the world, and who now ſhine in ſuch ſuperior orbs of glory, were once <hi>feeble, deſpiſed infants!</hi> May I ſpeak it with propriety on this occaſion, The bleſſed JESUS was once a child!</p>
            <p n="5">5. SINCE <hi>ſuch</hi> therefore, is the <hi>amazing importance</hi> of a child, why ſhould we wonder, that JESUS took up ſuch in his arms and bleſſed them, declaring, that of ſuch was the kingdom of heaven? Why ſhould we wonder, that their guardian angels continually behold the face of our Father in heaven?

(2.) Providence has ſo ordered it, that children are long continued in a helpleſs ſtate under the care of their parents, that they may have a ſufficient time and opportunity to form them for uſefulneſs in this life, and glory in that which is to come; and has implanted a ſtrong <hi>ſtorge</hi> or <hi>natural affection</hi> in their hearts towards their children, which ſhould powerfully prompt them to this duty.

            <p n="8">8. THREE things ſeem of prime importance in the education of children, <hi>inſtruction, government</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) INSTRUCTION ſhould be begun as ſoon as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are capable of receiving it, which is generally very early in life. The plaineſt and moſt practical truths ſhould firſt be inſtilled into the tender minds of children, and that in the plaineſt and moſt familiar manner, with
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:014137_0280_0F97D4DC4B1FAFD0"/>ſuch a <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>ſolemnity</hi> as is not forbidding and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting, but which may rather convey <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to the mind. And parents ought to improve their own underſtandings, that they may be better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified properly to inſtruct their children; which is no eaſy taſk to the wiſeſt.</p>

            <head>ESSAY LIX. THE CONSTRAINTS OF CHRIST'S LOVE; A SERMON FROM 2 CORINTHIANS V. 13, 14.</head>
            <head type="sub">For whether we be beſide ourſelves, it is to <hi>GOD:</hi> Or whether we be ſober, it is for your cauſe. For the love of <hi>CHRIST</hi> conſtraineth us.</head>
            <p>IT ſeems evident by the whole tenor of this epiſtle, that the holy and zealous Apoſtle had not a few enemies in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and thoſe too ſuch as he might leaſt of all have expected—his fellow profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and fellow-teachers of chriſtianity. Theſe vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious teachers, inſtead of building upon the Apoſtle's foundation, and ſupporting and confirming his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over his beloved converts, endeavoured by every trick of artifice and calumny to overturn and ſubvert it. They repreſented him to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as mean and contemptible, as light and inconſtant, as proud, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing and imperious, as a ſubverter of the law, yea, as a downright <hi>mad-men.</hi> They put a bad conſtruction on all his words and actions, preferred themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:014137_0282_0F97D4DD8AA9F330"/>him, and endeavoured by every art to raiſe their own credit on the ruins of his apoſtolical authority and reputation.</p>
            <p>SUCH treatment as this could not but greatly affect the good Apoſtle. not only as it tended to cool and weaken the affections of his beloved Corinthian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts towards him; but more eſpecially, as it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prejudice their minds againſt the important doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel which he had, with great labour, zeal and ſincerity, preached amongſt them. And hence it is, that we find ſo great a part of this epiſtle employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>St. Paul's</hi> vindication of his own character and conduct, as an Apoſtle of CHRIST;—in reclaiming the <hi>Corinthian</hi> church from an undue attachment to theſe Judaizing teachers,—and in rekindling proper regards to thoſe diſtinguiſhing and unadulterated doctrines of the goſpel, which he had, in the courſe of his miniſtry, propagated amongſt them.</p>
            <p>As that peculiar <hi>fervency</hi> and <hi>ardour</hi> with which this elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Apoſtle of the Gentiles proſecuted the goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſeems to be one of the great quarrels which his enemies had againſt him, he makes a noble and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apology to the Corinthians for his conduct in this reſpect, from the 10th verſe to the end of the chapter; alledging the <hi>grandeur</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> of the doctrines which the goſpel reveals, as a ſufficient reaſon for the greateſt poſſible zeal and importunity of addreſs.</p>
            <p>AT the <hi>tenth verſe</hi> he had laid down the certainty of a future judgment, in which all men muſt appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the tribunal of CHRIST, to receive, every one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deeds done in the body, whether good or bad. And this he alledges as one powerful reaſon and motive of zeal and fervor in the goſpel miniſtry: <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the terrors of the</hi> LORD, <hi>we perſuade men;</hi> that is, being firmly aſſured of a ſtrict and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:014137_0283_0F97D4DE33B7A3A8"/>judgment, and its awful conſequences—of that eternal and irreverſible ſentence of condemnation which ſhall then paſs upon all finally unbelieving ſinners, and which ſhall fill their ſouls with unſpeakable terror and endleſs deſpair, we uſe every argument and every art of addreſs to perſuade men;—to <hi>urge,</hi> and, if poſſible, to <hi>engage,</hi> them to eſcape the terrors of that day, by a timous application to CHRIST, and a ſincere repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>AND as ſome of theſe enemies, had probably unjuſtly charged him with a vain-glorious applauding, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of himſelf in his former epiſtle, he wipes off this aſſertion by telling them, that what he had been obliged to ſay of this kind, was only in his own neceſſary defence, and to furniſh his friends with a ſuitable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his cenſorious and hypocritical enemies: For, ſays he, <q>We commend not ourſelves again unto you, but give you occaſion to glory on our behalf, that you may have ſomewhat to anſwer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart;</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> who ſeem out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to glory and triumph over us, although inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are <hi>ſelf-condemned,</hi> and are conſcious, that they have no reaſon to glory againſt us.</p>
            <p>IN the words of our text the Apoſtle ſtill continues to vindicate himſelf, and ſuggeſts a <hi>farther</hi> and <hi>ſtill more powerful</hi> motive of his zeal and earneſtneſs in the work of the miniſtry: For, ſays he, <q>whether we be beſide ourſelves, it is to GOD: Or whether we be ſober, it is for your cauſe; for the love of CHRIST conſtraineth us.</q> As though he had ſaid; <q>If, to <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> ſpectators, who are not actuated by the ſame motives, and have not the ſame view and ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things as we the Apoſtles have, we ſhould ſeem to ſpeak and act with a degree of zeal bordering upon frenzy or enthuſiaſm, and to be tranſported beyond
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:014137_0284_0F97D4DEF69C4920"/>our <hi>natural ſelves</hi>—beyond the cold meaſures of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man prudence or diſcretion—it is a <hi>zeal for the glory of</hi> GOD which animates us and produces theſe <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effects:</hi>—Or if, on the other hand, we be <hi>ſober,</hi> and proſecute all the arts of calm and diſpaſſion are reaſoning to convince ſinners, and lead them to GOD through CHRIST, it is <hi>for your ſakes</hi> we take ſuch ſerious pains, in a matter which ſo nearly concerns your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intereſts.

            <p>THE Greek word <hi>ſunechei,</hi> which we render <hi>conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> is vaſtly emphatical.

               </gap>ably moves, impels, and bears us on to zeal and importunity in the ſacred duties of our Apoſtleſhip, ſo that we can by no means diſengage ourſelves from the binding nature and urgency of thoſe motives and obligations it lays us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <q>For, as though he had ſaid, how can we be cold and unaffected in promoting the ſalvation of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; a cauſe in which our glorious Maſter not only <hi>laboured</hi> and <hi>ſuffered,</hi> but even <hi>laid down his life:</hi>
               </q> Or, <q>We thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: And that he died for all, that they which live, ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him which died for them and roſe again.</q> Therefore, this dying love of Chriſt conſtraineth us to be <hi>inſtant</hi> and <hi>importunate</hi> with ſinners, not only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the precious benefits it has purchaſed for them, but alſo to walk worthy of the glorious privileges and hopes it has conferred upon them.</p>
            <p>Now, that we may the better perceive the <hi>propriety</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of the Apoſtle's reaſoning, and feel the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>conſtraint</hi> of a Saviour's love, I ſhall, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, by divine aſſiſtance, briefly ſhew you the <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>ſpecific</hi> nature of the love of CHRIST, and by what characters it is diſtinguiſhed from, and exalted above the love of mortals. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Explain it by its effects,
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:014137_0286_0F97D4E0738F9D90"/>or ſhew in what inſtances it moſt eminently appears and is expreſſed. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> Apply the doctrine to ſome practical uſes, by ſhewing what influence it ſhould have upon us, both as <hi>Miniſters</hi> and <hi>people.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to ſhew you the peculiar and ſpecific nature of this love of CHRIST, and by what properties it is chiefly diſtinguiſhed from, and exalted above the love of mortals. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE will find, on the ſmalleſt reflection, that <hi>love</hi> is a certain mode or affection of the mind, drawing it forth with deſire and complacency towards ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and, including in it (according to the ſcripture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and as it is exerciſed from GOD to man) <hi>compaſſion, benevolence</hi> and <hi>bounty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LOVE, as it exiſts in us, beſides its imperfection, has generally a great mixture of <hi>ſelfiſhneſs.</hi> 
               <q>We are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a penury and want in our own beings.</q> We feel a dependance not only upon GOD, but alſo in ſome meaſure on our <hi>fellow-creatures,</hi> both for <hi>being</hi> and <hi>well-being.</hi> Our happineſs in the preſent ſtate, is neither complete, nor independent, and therefore we <q>ſeek ſome augmentation of it, and ſome addition to it, by union with the objects we love.</q> If we cloſely and impartially examine the frame of our own nature, and the motives of our actions, we will find, that perhaps the moſt pure and diſintereſted acts of our love, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and charity, are mixed with ſome degree of ſelfiſhneſs.—Let even a wicked perſon, who has any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of natural tenderneſs and humanity left in his breaſt, ſee a man who is an object of great pity and compaſſion, his heart will melt towards him,—he will <hi>feel</hi> for his diſtreſs, and, if poſſible, give him ſome ſuccour or relief;—not perhaps from any hope of reward in this
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:014137_0287_0F97D4E13470A6F0"/>life, nor merely out of oſtentation, <hi>that he may be ſeen and praiſed of men;</hi>—not out of any love to GOD, or obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his command, nor from any proſpect of a future reward—(the ſuppoſition excludes all ſuch motives); but <hi>purely</hi> to relieve the anxious and ſympathetic feelings of his own breaſt. He relieves the miſerable, that he himſelf may be leſs miſerable. He endeavours to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate the pain of his ſuffering and diſtreſſed fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he himſelf may be leſs pained and diſtreſſed. And although good and truly virtuous and gracious men may have <hi>nobler</hi> and <hi>purer</hi> motives of their charity, yet it is much to be queſtioned, whether ſomething of ſelf-intereſt may not mix itſelf with their moſt diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted actions.</p>
            <p>I AM far, indeed, from condemning this natural ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and compaſſion, ſo deeply implanted in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man heart, by the GOD <hi>of nature,</hi> for the ſuccour and relief of our fellow-men. I only mention this in proof of what I have advanced, namely, <q>That human love or charity, in the pureſt inſtances of it, is not perhaps wholly diſintereſted: Either <hi>glory,</hi> or <hi>fame,</hi> or <hi>pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>commodity,</hi> or ſome <hi>intereſted ſelfiſh</hi> motive or obligation ſo mix themſelves with the moſt <hi>generous heroic</hi> acts of our love and charity, as to blaſt their pretenſions to <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>diſintereſtedneſs,</hi> and greatly to impair their merit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now <q>the love of CHRIST is not this way excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We had neither done any thing to <hi>oblige</hi> him, nor had we any thing to <hi>engage</hi> him, farther than the miſery in which he ſaw us involved might <hi>move</hi> him.</q> He loved us <hi>only</hi> becauſe he <hi>would</hi> love us. He had no <hi>by-end,</hi> no <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> to ſerve in loving us and having compaſſion upon us. <hi>Herein is love</hi>—a peculiar and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing love—<hi>not that we loved him, but that he loved us;</hi> which is equally true of the Father and of the Son<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John iv. 10.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="289" facs="unknown:014137_0288_0F97D4E1F45F93D8"/>
2. THIS love of CHRIST, as it is a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>diſintereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſo it is <q>a <hi>free, generous</hi> and <hi>heroic</hi> love; like that of ſome great and public benefactor, who touched with commiſeration for the afflictions and diſtreſſes of mankind, undertakes their relief. <hi>When we were without ſtrength, ungodly ſinners, enemies,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, CHRIST <hi>died for us</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. v. 6, 8, 10.</note>.</q> Either of theſe three laſt characters might, in the eſtimate of human reaſon, have fruſtrated the kind intentions of a Saviour's love: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o! it triumhps over them all. It is a <hi>ſingular, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable, unconquerable, triumphant</hi> love;—a love, as the wiſe man deſcribes that paſſion, <hi>ſtronger than death; many waters,</hi> numberleſs provocations and indignities, <hi>could not quench it</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Cant. viii. 6.</note>. Many and great obſtacles ſtood in its way, the wrath of GOD, the cruelty of men, the rage of devils, the ſhame and pain of the croſs, and, what was worſe than all, the ingratitude and obſtinacy of thoſe very ſinners who where the objects of this love, and their contempt of and averſion to its ſaving deſigns— and vet it ſurmounted them all! Are mankind <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, ſinners, enemies?</hi> Yet CHRIST will love them and die for them! O wonderful philanthropy! Surely no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of human love can equal this. We have heard of and applauded brave and generous men, who have hazarded and expoſed their lives for their friends, their country, their religion;—yea, we have heard, <q>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the ſingle inſtance of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pythias,</hi> of one friend's offering to lay down his life for another. And indeed, as our Saviour obſerves, <hi>greater love has</hi> no man <hi>than this, that he lay down his life for his friends;</hi> this being the very utmoſt extent of <hi>human friendſhip</hi>

3. YEA, ſo great and unparalelled is this love of CHRIST to ſinners, that it ſurmounts all human thought and comprehenſion. The Apoſtle urges his beloved <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>comprehend with all ſaints, the breath, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the love of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which,</hi> adds he, <hi>paſſeth knowledge</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Epheſ. iii. 18, 19.</note>. The breadth, and length, and depth, and height of this love are beyond our <hi>ken</hi> in the preſent ſtate; and indeed, we ſhall, perhaps, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able <hi>fully</hi> to comprehend them. In order to know the juſt dimenſions of a Saviour's love, we muſt firſt know the full dignity of his perſon, the greatneſs of his condeſcenſion, and the depth of his ſufferings; and theſe, perhaps, no created underſtanding will ever be able fully to comprehend. What a ſtrange com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or requiſition, therefore, is this?—to know and comprehend a love, which is <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> and <hi>paſſeth knowledge!</hi>—I anſwer, this is a lively expreſſion of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing greatneſs of CHRIST'S love, in the Apoſtle's <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>maſterly</hi> manner. The love of CHRIST is a ſubject which all the ſaints ſearch and pry into with the greateſt attention and delight. They endeavour to comprehend it more and more: <q>ſomething they know; more they deſire to know; they ſtoop down with the angels, <hi>and deſire to look into theſe things</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 12.</note>.</q> They are daily making new diſcoveries and new reſearches into the wonders of his love which paſſeth knowledge, and which will prove the continual exerciſe and the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy and admiration of their perfected ſpirits, through the ages of eternity,—when they ſhall join in that new and perpetual ſong, <q>Worthy is the lamb, that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory and bleſſing:—for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to GOD, by thy blood, of out every kindred, and tongue, and people and
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:014137_0290_0F97D3D034253A58"/>nation<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. v. 9,—12.</note>.</q>—Now, the Apoſtle prays for theſe <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that the <hi>ſame mind</hi> might be in them, and that with all ſaints, they might ſtudy more and more to comprehend the boundleſs and amazing dimenſions of the love of CHRIST, as being the moſt powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to reciprocal love, and cheerful univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>BY ſuch characters then is this love of CHRIST diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from, and exalted above, the love of mortals. It is <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>diſintereſted</hi>—<hi>free, generous,</hi> and <hi>heroic</hi>—and exceeds all human comprehenſion. I proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To explain this love of CHRIST by its effects; or to ſhew in what inſtances it moſt eminently appears and is expreſſed. And here the field is ſo exceeding large, that I muſt of neceſſity, be very brief and general. Were an angel, with all his heavenly knowledge and eloquence, to attempt a diſplay of the grand proofs and effects of his love, how infinitely muſt he come ſhort of doing juſtice to the ſubject? How much more <hi>we,</hi> whoſe views and apprehenſions are limited and confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—But that we may attempt it in our feeble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect manner,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE greatneſs of our Saviour's love manifeſts itſelf in the <hi>readineſs</hi> and <hi>cheerfulneſs</hi> with which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook our relief in the covenant of redemption.—Great was the miſery into which mankind were fallen. <hi>All were dead,</hi> as the verſe below our text aſſures us. The hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, as <hi>one man,</hi> had revolted and apoſtatized from GOD, and were become ſlaves to <hi>ſatan</hi> and their own luſts. The whole world of mankind were become guilty before GOD, and were enemies to him by wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed works. This is that <hi>ſpiritual death,</hi>—that ſeparation of the ſoul from GOD, the fountain of <hi>ſpiritual and eternal,</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="unknown:014137_0291_0F97D3DDB55A18A8"/>as well as of <hi>natural</hi> life,—that <hi>death in treſpaſſes</hi> and <hi>ſins,</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle, Epheſ. ii. 1.—And the plain and juſt conſequence of this, was a ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to <hi>eternal death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUCH was the condition of lapſed man when CHRIST undertook for him; proportionably great therefore muſt that price and work of redemption be, which was neceſſary to reſtore the human race to GOD'S forfeited favour, and to their own loſt purity, perfection and happineſs.

               </gap>-ſtone, if ſuch a view of the love of CHRIST, how meanly ſoever diſplayed, can have no ſoftening influence over them, no conſtraining force upon them! But this naturally leads me in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. PLACE to improve the doctrine to ſome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal uſes, by ſhewing <hi>what influence</hi> and <hi>conſtraint</hi> this love of CHRIST ſhould have upon us, both as Miniſters and people.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the <hi>diſciples</hi> and <hi>followers</hi> of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed JESUS, ſurely this love of his ſhould conſtrain us to reciprocal acts of love, imitation, and obedience.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To reciprocal acts of love. The natural effects of love, are <hi>gratitude</hi> and <hi>reciprocal love.</hi> Love begets love, as naturally as a parent begets his own likeneſs. 'Tis as natural for us to love our friends, and be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to our benefactors, as to dread and ſly from our enemies.—Now, as the bleſſed JESUS is not only moſt amiable and lovely in himſelf, poſſeſſed of every natural and moral excellency which can attract the eſteem of an intelligent being, but as he is alſo our beſt friend and moſt generous benefactor, hence our obligations to gratitude and reciprocal love are quite indiſputable. He has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed our love and gratitude at the deareſt price, and has engaged us <hi>to love him</hi> by the moſt aſtoniſhing acts of love and beneficence to us; in ſo much, that nothing can be more juſt and equitable than that dreadful denouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle, againſt all who are inſenſible to the attractions of a Saviour's love: <hi>If any man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>love not the</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>let him be anathema, maranatha, i. e.</hi> let him be <hi>accurſed,</hi> and the LORD will come ſpeedily and execute that curſe upon him<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xvi. 22.</note>. The
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:014137_0300_0F97D3D6F533DF80"/>queſtion therefore, is not, <hi>whether</hi> the love of CHRIST to <hi>us,</hi> ſhould <hi>be</hi> a motive of ours to <hi>him;</hi> for this is ſelf-evident? But rather, <hi>in what manner</hi> we may beſt expreſs our love to our great benefactor? And it is plain, that this is beſt done by imitation and obedience. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THAT the love of CHRIST ſhould conſtrain us to the <hi>imitation</hi> of him, our beloved Lord and Maſter. To imitate the beloved object, is a natural and genuine effect of love. We naturally endeavour to imitate thoſe whom we love, eſpecially in thoſe things for which we love them, and by which we hope to commend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their favour and eſteem. Now, as the <hi>moral perfections of</hi> CHRIST, and thoſe divine graces and virtues which ſhone ſo conſpicuous in him, through the whole of his incarnate ſtate, are one of the principal foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our eſteem for him; and as the imitation of thoſe virtues and graces ſerve principally to recommend us to his friendſhip and regard: So <hi>in theſe</hi> we will earneſtly endeavour to imitate him, if we truly love him. We will endeavour, that the ſame mind and temper be in us, which was alſo in CHRIST JESUS<note n="*" place="bottom">Philip. ii. 5.</note>. If we are indeed his <hi>ſheep</hi> we will hear his voice and follow him; —will deny ourſelves and take up our croſs, learning of him to be meek and lowly, pure and patient, humble and reſigned, that, in all things, we may be conformed unto him, and, in ſo doing, find peace, and reſt, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to our ſouls<note n="†" place="bottom">Math. xvi. 24.—xi. 29. John x. 27.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE ancient philoſophers manifeſted their love to the leaders of their reſpective ſects, by a <hi>moſt ſcrupulous imitation</hi> of them, in the whole tenor of their behaviour: And ſhall we, the diſciples of JESUS, be leſs obſervant of the moſt holy and perfect example of our divine
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:014137_0301_0F97D3E234F80348"/>Maſter, than they were of thoſe of <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle?</hi> Eſpecially, when the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>even hereunto are we called; becauſe</hi> CHRIST alſo ſuffered for us, LEAVING US AN EXAMPLE, THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS STEPS<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 21.</note>. And when another Apoſtle aſſures us, that <hi>he who ſaid he abideth in him,</hi> or is his diſciple, <hi>ought himſelf alſo</hi> SO TO WALK, <hi>even as</hi> HE WALKED<note n="†" place="bottom">1 John ii. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THE love of CHRIST ſhould conſtrain us, his followers and diſciples, to a <hi>cheerful and univerſal obedience to all his commandments.</hi> And what is this but to <hi>imitate his example?</hi> For, what duty hath he commanded us to perform, of which he hath not given us an example in his own conduct, ſo far as difference of nature and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances would permit? To obey him, therefore, in his moſt difficult and ſelf-denying precepts, what is it but to imitate his own example, and to do that out of love and duty for him, which he, in obedience to his Father, hath done for our ſakes, and to promote our ſalvation and happineſs? To obey him, therefore, is to imitate him, and to imitate him is to be like him both in holineſs and happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>is the love of</hi> GOD, ſays the Apoſtle, that is, the moſt certain and ſubſtantial evidence of our love to him, <hi>that we keep his commandments</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John v. 3.</note>. And as this is the ſureſt teſtimony of our love to the Father, ſo it is alſo of the Son. <q>He that hath my commandments and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he it is that loveth me. If a man love me, he will keep my words; but he that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings<note n="§" place="bottom">John xiv. 21, &amp;c.</note>.</q> We cheerfully and readily <hi>obey</hi> they perſon whom we <hi>love.</hi> Duty and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation here unite their kindred influences; laying a

            <p>THE Chriſtian character, <hi>my brethren,</hi> is a moſt <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>amiable</hi> character; although alaſs! it is a moſt <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>uncommon</hi> one in the world, even in the <hi>Chriſtian world,</hi> where, as all are Chriſtians by <hi>name</hi> and <hi>profeſſion,</hi> ſo all ought to be ſuch in <hi>deed</hi> and in <hi>truth.</hi> 
               <q>He is not a Jew, (ſays the Apoſtle) who is one outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; neither is that circumciſion which is outward in the fleſh: But he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:014137_0307_0F97D3E5F4C8D910"/>circumciſion is that of the heart, in the ſpirit, and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of man but of God<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 11. 28, 29.</note>.</q> —So may we ſay with regard to <hi>chriſtianity:</hi> 
               <q>He is not a Chriſtian who is one meerly in name and outward profeſſion; but he only who has the <hi>heart,</hi> the <hi>ſpirit</hi> the <hi>temper,</hi> the <hi>principles,</hi> and the <hi>conduct</hi> of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, whoſe praiſe is not of <hi>man</hi> only, but of GOD alſo.</q> To be Chriſtians <hi>indeed</hi> and in <hi>reality, my brethren,</hi> is to be lights in the world, to be harmleſs and blameleſs; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukeable and unreproveable, in the midſt of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverſe generation.

Hence alſo, GOD, the great ſource and examplar of all truth and virtue, is called <hi>light.</hi> 
               <q>GOD is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all.</q> And CHRIST, who is the <q>brightneſs of the Father's glory, and the expreſs
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:014137_0308_0F97D3E6B42307D8"/>image of his perſon,</q> is called, by way of eminence, <q>The light of the world;—and that light which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man, which cometh into the world.</q> The ſcriptures alſo, which are the pureſt channels of truth and virtue to a benighted world, are called, <q>Lights in a dark place;—a light to our feet, and a lamp or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn thorn to our paths.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AGREEABLE to all this;—when ſinners are <hi>converted,</hi> or turned from <hi>error</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi> to <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>virtue,</hi> they are ſaid to have <hi>their eyes opened;</hi> their <hi>underſtandings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,</hi> and to be <hi>brought from darkneſs to light,</hi> and from the power of ſatan to GOD: And GOD is ſaid to <hi>bring them out of darkneſs into his marvellous light.</hi> 
               <q>Ye were ſometime darkneſs, (ſays the Apoſtle) but now are ye light in the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND hence, true Chriſtians are called <hi>children of the light,</hi>—and commanded to <hi>walk in the light;</hi> to <hi>ſhine as lights in the world,</hi>—and to <hi>let their light ſo ſhine before men, that others, ſeeing their good works, may glorify our Father which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To be a <hi>true Chriſtian,</hi> therefore, <hi>my brethren,</hi> is to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain the <hi>moſt honourable</hi> and <hi>beautiful</hi> of all characters:— It is to <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>reſemble</hi> GOD, who is the great ſource and fountain of light, and in whom there is no darkneſs at all;—to imitate and reſemble CHRIST, who is the <hi>light of the world,</hi> and the <hi>life of men;</hi>—to imitate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the <hi>ſaints,</hi> thoſe brave and generous ſouls, who, in all ages, have copied after GOD, and ſhone as lights in the world, in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation, holding forth the word of life.—To be <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> is to be as like to the glorious GOD, both in virtue and happineſs,—and to do as much good to our fellow-creatures in our day and generation, as poſſibly we can:—in a word, to be as lovely, as venerable, as virtuous, as holy, as happy and as uſeful, as
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:014137_0309_0F97D3E77522DFF0"/>the capacities of our limited, depraved nature will permit.</p>
            <p>ST. PAUL had founded a church in <hi>Philippi,</hi> which worſhipped the true GOD, and received the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, while many of their brethren and fellow-citizens, ſtill continued in their idolatry and infidelity. It was, therefore, the deſire and ambition of the good Apoſtle, that the converted <hi>Philippians</hi> ſhould labour for the converſion of their heathen brethren. He deſired, that the unbelieving and idolatrous <hi>Philippians,</hi> (who were attentive and malicious obſervers of their Chriſtian brethren, becauſe of the new religion they had embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and the new kind of life they had devoted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to) ſhould ſee nothing in them, but what was <hi>wiſe, reputable,</hi> and of <hi>good report;</hi> and <hi>ſuch as becometh the goſpel of</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THIS, however, it ſeems had not been the caſe, ſo much as the good Apoſtle wiſhed. Theſe <hi>young converts</hi> although they had broke off from the idolatry and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of their neighbours, yet were ſtill of very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect characters, in point of morality:—Although they had embraced the profeſſion of Chriſtianity; yet they had not fully imbib'd its ſpirit and temper. However ſound they might be in <hi>faith,</hi> yet they lacked that <hi>charity,</hi> which is the bond of <hi>perfectneſs,</hi> and without which true Chriſtianity, cannot either <hi>live</hi> or <hi>move</hi> or have <hi>its being.</hi> No ſooner had they broke off from their unbelieving and idolatrous brethren, than they began to quarrel among themſelves. This ſeems to have been the true ground and motive, of the Apoſtle's noble and excellent exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, in our text; which will ever be equally uſeful, and equally applicable, while Chriſtianity has a being in a corrupt, imperfect, world and ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Do all things, (ſays the Apoſtle) without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and diſputings: That ye may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the ſons of GOD, without, &amp;c.</q>

IN the words, we have <hi>three</hi> things obſervable, and which-ſhall (through the divine aſſiſtance) be the ſubject of the preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE <hi>poſt</hi> or <hi>ſtation</hi> of a Chriſtian in this world. He lives <q>in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</q> who are, at heart, enemies to that holineſs which he profeſſes; who will be cloſe and malicious obſervers of all his conduct; and who are capable of being either greatly benefited, or greatly hurt by his example and converſation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE have the <hi>Chriſtian's deſtination</hi> in this world; what divine providence deſigns he ſhould be; or what purpoſe he is deſigned to ſerve, in the midſt of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverſe generation. He is to <hi>ſhine as a light in the world: Holding forth the word of life,</hi>—that he may ſerve the double purpoſe of both ſaving himſelf and others.</p>
            <p n="3">III. WE have the <hi>duty of a Chriſtian</hi> in this world, in order to his anſwering this deſtination of providence: <q>He is to be <hi>harmleſs</hi> and <hi>blameleſs; a child of</hi> GOD, <hi>without rebuke;</hi>
               </q> that the goſpel may not be blamed; that ſinners may be converted, and that his Chriſtian brethren may be edified: In a word, <q>He is to let this light of his ſo ſhine before men, that others, ſeeing his good works, may glorify our Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ARE there any amongſt us, <hi>my brethren,</hi> who have the noble ambition, not only of obtaining this heavenly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ourſelves, but alſo of leading others in the ſame road? Are there any amongſt us, who have the noble ambition of concurring with JESUS CHRIST in the work of human redemption? Let ſuch learn, to day, from St.
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:014137_0311_0F97D3E8F4F6D680"/>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> to proſecute ſo noble a deſign by ſhining as lights in the world; by being <hi>harmleſs and blamleſs</hi> as the <hi>children of</hi> GOD, <hi>without rebuke,</hi> in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation. May the holy Spirit himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire us with this divine ambition—and may the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of GOD, attending this diſcourſe, give us power and ſpirit to purſue ſo noble a deſign, until our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours are crowned with heavenly glory.—Amen.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THEN we are briefly to conſider the <hi>poſt</hi> and <hi>ſtation</hi> of a true Chriſtian in this world:—<q>He lives in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſentiment and expreſſion of the Apoſtle might be eaſily <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>illuſtrated,</hi> by conſidering the <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>morals</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> amongſt which the primitive Chriſtians lived, to whom he here writes. The character which our Saviour and his Apoſtles have left us on record, both of the Jews and Gentiles of that age, (and which is abundantly confirmed by contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary writers) makes it appear, that they were, indeed, "a crooked and perverſe generation."</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> had ſcarcely the very ſhadow of religion left amongſt them in that abandoned age. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their iniquity ſeems then to have been <hi>filled,</hi> and they were <hi>ripe for deſtruction.</hi> To the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the 'moſt <hi>numerous</hi> and reſpectable ſect amongſt them, our Saviour thus addreſſes himſelf—<q>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hell?</q> And, as to the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> they were men of <hi>atheiſtical principles,</hi> and deteſtable morals.</p>
            <p>FOR the <hi>morals</hi> and <hi>manners</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> of that time, and into what a ſtate of luxury, bebauchery, and univerſal corruption they had degenerated, I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to their own hiſtorians, moraliſts and ſatyriſts: But that portrait which this Apoſtle himſelf has given
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:014137_0312_0F97D3E9B5215950"/>us of the <hi>Romans,</hi> one of the moſt learned, philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and civilized Heathen nations, ſhall ſuffice in lieu of every other authority.—<q>Being filled (ſays the Apoſtle) with all unrighteouſneſs, fornication, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, covetouſneſs, maliciouſneſs; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity, whiſperers, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters, haters of GOD, deſpiteful, proud, boaſters, inventers of evil things, diſobedient to parents, without underſtanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful; vile in their affections; changing the truth of GOD into a lie; and worſhipping and ſerving the creature more than the CREATOR, who is GOD over all, bleſſed for ever<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 21,—34.</note>.</q> What a black catalogue of vices is this? And was not that a "crooked and perverſe generation," indeed, of which this was the general and prevailing character?</p>
            <p>BUT, <hi>my brethren,</hi> we need not go back to antiquity, to juſtify and illuſtrate this obſervation of the Apoſtle. In every age of the world, GOD'S true church and people, <q>live in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle is ſtill addreſſing every Chriſtian amongſt us, in the words of our text, with equal propriety as he did his converts at <hi>Philippi</hi>—<q>Be ye harmleſs and blameleſs, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, amongſt whom ye ſhine as lights in the world.</q> The world, as diſtinguiſhed from the church, ever has been, and ever will be, "a crooked and perverſe generation." This world has been ever diſtinguiſhed into two grand claſſes of men, diametrically oppoſite in their principles, ends, motives, diſpoſitions and manners, and generally diſtinguiſhed in ſcripture by the appellation of the <q>world, and the church;—the ſeed of the woman, and ſeed of the
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:014137_0313_0F97D3EA743497F0"/>ſerpent;—the ſheep and the goats;—the tares and the wheat;—the righteous and the wicked;—the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world, and the children of light.</q> If we attentively read the ſcriptures, we will find that the word world, is generally uſed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the worſt of theſe two claſſes.—<q>The world (ſays St. <hi>John</hi>) lieth in wickedneſs.—The world (ſays he) knoweth us not.—Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him: For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, and the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.</q> St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <q>that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with GOD;</q> and therefore beſeeches Chriſtians, <hi>to keep themſelves unſpotted from the world.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <q>the LORD JESUS CHRIST gave himſelf for our ſins, that he might deliver us from this preſent evil world, according to the will of GOD;</q>—and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly beſeeches Chriſtians not <hi>to be conformed to this world,</hi> in its manners, cuſtoms, ſpirit or maxims, but <hi>to be transformed by the renewing of their minds.</hi> 
               <q>If the world hate you (ſays CHRIST to his diſciples) ye know that it hated me before it hated you. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſe you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT were eaſy, <hi>my brethren,</hi> to multiply quotations to this purpoſe; but ſurely evidence enough has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prove, that the world, in which Chriſtians live; or, that that company of men with which the church is contraſted, and from which it is diſtinguiſhed every where in ſcripture, is <q>a crooked and perverſe genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>

THE <hi>ſame truth</hi> will evidently appear from the <hi>general maxims</hi> and <hi>prevailing manners of</hi> the world, by which the crookedneſs and perverſeneſs of their ſentiments and conduct will be clearly manifeſted. Will either the dictates of enlightened reaſon, the beſt intereſts of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or the <hi>goſpel of</hi> CHRIST, juſtify ſuch maxims as the following:—<q>Youth is the proper ſeaſon for pleaſure and gallantry:—It is ridiculous to make much ado about religion:—We ſhould not aſpire to be ſaints: All that religion requires of us, is to be juſt and honeſt in our dealings:—Calumny and ridicule are the ſalt or zeſt of converſation:—It is unworthy of a man of honour to put up with an affront. Revenge is ſweet: —Ambition is the vice of noble ſouls:—Impurity is intollerable in women, but pardonable in men. We ſhould be conformed to the world, and act agreeable to its maxims.</q>—Which of theſe my friends, (and a great many more might be added to the number) does not flatly contradict ſome precept of CHRIST, and the very ſpirit and genius of Chriſtianity?—And yet which of theſe maxims is not received in ſociety as a firſt principle, againſt the truth of which, it would be deemed affectation to diſpute?</p>
            <p>AND are not the <hi>prevailing manners</hi> of the world, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conformable to <hi>theſe maxims?</hi>—How few regard even the ſolemnity of an oath, where intereſt is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? —What faith is, now a days, to be put in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or profeſſions of men? The very form of religion is in ſuch ſovereign contempt, that it is deemed highly impolite to introduce even the mention of it into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. How few in Chriſtian countries, comparatively ſpeaking, attend the ordinances of CHRIST, or pay any regard to the public worſhip of GOD?—What are the lives of the generality, but a courſe of mere extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, ſenſuality, and diſſipation—of enquiry how they may provide for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof—
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:014137_0315_0F97D3EBF45C5F88"/>what they ſhall eat, or drink, and wherewithal they ſhall be clothed, without a ſingle ſerious thought about the ſtate of their ſouls, or eternity? If we enquire into the ſource of mirth and pleaſantry in moſt companies, ſhall we not find the laugh almoſt perpetually raiſed, either at the expence of religion, or at the natural or moral failings and infirmities of our fellow-creatures? Subjects which drew tears from the eyes of <hi>David,</hi> and which no right mind can contemplate, without pain and anxiety! Indeed, what is modern wit and gaiety, but calumny, ſlander and profanity, rendered laughable, by the ludicrous garb in which they are dreſſed?—To all this, may I not add, that ſome of the moſt ſcandalous and filthy vices are become ſo common and faſhionable in Chriſtian countries, that to reſiſt or decline them, would be deemed an almoſt unpardonable ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>SURELY nothing more need be added to prove, That the <hi>world</hi> in which Chriſtians live, is <q>a crooked and perverſe generation;</q>—that to follow the multitude, is to renounce the guidance of reaſon and religion; and that to be conformed to this evil world, in its general cuſtoms, maxims and manners, is to imitate the very worſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and to forfeit all that glory and happineſs which the goſpel has ſet before us. I am now to lay before you, under the</p>
            <p n="2">II. HEAD of diſcourſe, The <hi>Chriſtian's deſtination</hi> in this <hi>evil world;</hi> or, <hi>what purpoſes</hi> he is <hi>deſigned</hi> and <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to ſerve in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.—<q>He is to ſhine as a light in the world, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the word of life.</q> Upon ſuch a view of things, Chriſtians may poſſibly ſay, <q>Since <hi>such</hi> is the world in which we live;—ſince human ſociety is ſo empoiſoned and corrupted, let us ſhun the contagion: —Let us break off all commerce with the living:—
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:014137_0316_0F97D3EE4EC22708"/>Let us abandon the ſociety of men, and, like hermits, ſecure our innocence in obſcurity and retirement, in the ſolitude of deſarts and caves of the earth.</q> By no means, ſays St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Man is a ſocial creature, and is deſigned for ſociety: Flee not, therefore, from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination of Providence: Continue in that world where the example of your virtue is ſo neceſſary: Labour to diſabuſe and undeceive your fellow-mortals, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them, if poſſible, from falling into miſery: Let your life, your converſation, and your whole deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be a reproach to their vices, and a light to direct their feet into the paths of peace, holineſs and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <q>Shine as lights in the world; holding forth, in your example and behaviour, the word of life, for the direction and inſtruction of others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Greek word, which we tranſlate <hi>light,</hi> has a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar energy in the text. It is compounded of two words, which ſignify <hi>an elevated light,</hi> or a <hi>light held up,</hi> for the guidance and direction of others. The Apoſtle probably alludes to the ancient <hi>Pharos,</hi> a <hi>tower</hi> or <hi>light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> built by <hi>Ptolemy Philadelphus,</hi> on an iſland of the ſame name, in the mouth of the river <hi>Nile</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> on the top of which a fire was kept continually kindled in the night, to direct veſſels into the harbour. The allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>my brethren,</hi> is very plain and very beautiful. The Chriſtian ſerves as a <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>director</hi> to a crooked and perverſe generation. Elevated above the falſe maxims and corrupt manners of the world, he holds forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the word of life; <hi>i. e.</hi> he <hi>ſhows</hi> and <hi>manifeſts,</hi> by his example, <hi>that</hi> which the word of GOD demands of us, in order to our entering into life eternal.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>word of</hi> GOD is termed<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. cxix. 105.</note>, <q>A light to our feet and a lamp to our paths,</q> becauſe it gives us direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the whole of our conduct. When our temporal
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:014137_0317_0F97D3EEF56E8EF0"/>and eternal intereſts claſh and interfere with each other, it puts that important and ſignificant queſtion, <q>What ſhall it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul?</q> In the time of affliction, it calls us to <hi>conſider,</hi> 
               <q>and to humble ourſelves under the mighty hand of GOD, that he may exalt us in due ſeaſon.</q>—Under the influence of riches and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it directs us, <q>not to truſt in uncertain riches—to be rich in the good works of charity and liberality— to be good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God; willing to diſtribute; ready to communicate:—To make unto ourſelves friends of the mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, that when we fail here, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us into everlaſting habitations.</q>—On a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and in the near proſpect of eternity, it is a light to our feet, and a lamp to our paths—by repreſenting death as a <hi>conquered, diſarmed</hi> tyrant;—by opening an eternal world of glory to the faith of the Chriſtian;— by aſſuring him, that when <q>his heart and his fleſh fail, GOD will be the ſtrength of his heart and his portion for ever;—that bleſſed are the dead, who die in the Lord, for they do reſt from their labour and their works do follow them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that which <hi>David</hi> ſays of the <hi>word of</hi> GOD, St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſays of the <hi>deſtination of the Chriſtian.</hi> As GOD hath given his word to be a light to men's feet and a lamp to their paths,—to guide their feet into the way of peace and happineſs,—ſo he hath alſo deſtined and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Chriſtians, <q>to ſhine as lights in the world, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation,</q>— practically <hi>holding forth,</hi> and <hi>examplifying</hi> the word of life, for their guidance and direction.</p>
            <p>THE Chriſtian's life and converſation ſhould be the word of GOD reduced to practice; a living comment on the word of life; ſo that the ignorant and wicked
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:014137_0318_0F97D3EFCC758F58"/>world, who either cannot or will not read the word of GOD, may ſee it clearly held forth, and plainly exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in the life of the Chriſtian. And indeed, <hi>my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> what have the lives of the ſaints been, in all ages, but juſt a <hi>holding forth of this word of life?</hi> They have preached more powerfully and more effectually, by their lives and examples, than their doctrines, to thoſe crooked and perverſe generations, among whom they ſhone as lights in the world. GOD hath <hi>ſet them up,</hi> in every age and generation, as <hi>beacons</hi> and <hi>Pharoſes,</hi> to ſtem the torrent of human depravity and corruption;— to ſhew the practicability of virtue in human nature; —to be a reproof and reproach to prevailing vice and immorality, cauſing iniquity, as aſhamed, to hide its face,—and to allure mankind into the paths of virtue and happineſs.</p>
            <p>WOULD we ſee, for inſtance, the preference which the intereſts of <hi>eternity</hi> ſhould have to thoſe of <hi>time;</hi> let us behold it examplified in the conduct of Moſes, <q>Who refuſed to be called the ſon of Pharaoh's daughter; chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction with the people of GOD, than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon; eſteeming the reproach of CHRIST great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er riches than the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe he had reſpect to the recompence of reward.</q>—In the lives of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> we have the nobleſt examples of pious maſters of families: <q>As for me, (ſays <hi>Joſhua</hi>) and my houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</q> 
               <q>For I know <hi>Abraham,</hi> (ſays GOD) that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do juſtice and judgment<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xvii. 19.

            <p>NOR, <hi>my brethren,</hi> was <hi>this duty peculiar</hi> to theſe <hi>great lights</hi> of the <hi>ancient world;</hi> it is equally the duty, the honour and the intereſt of every individual Chriſtian to the end of time, to be a <hi>burning and a ſhining light</hi> in his day and generation, and thus to <hi>hold forth the word of life,</hi> to the crooked and perverſe generation, among whom he is ſtationed by divine providence.</p>
            <p>MANY Chriſtians, indeed, are not able to <hi>build church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> to <hi>found hoſpitals,</hi> to <hi>preach</hi> or defend the goſpel, or to propagate it to diſtant parts of the world;—but every Chriſtian is ſurely able to live a good, virtuous and
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:014137_0320_0F97D3F13489DC10"/>examplary life.—Every Chriſtian is able <q>to adron the doctrine of GOD his Saviour,</q> to exhibit the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces of genuine Chriſtianity;—to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage virtue and piety, and diſcountenance vice and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality as far as his influence and example can reach. And this is every Chriſtian's duty: <q>Let your light, (ſays CHRIST, the great Lord and Law-giver of Chriſtians) ſo ſhine before men, that others ſeeing your good works, may glorify your Father in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. —Be ye harmleſs and blameleſs, (ſays the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle) the children of GOD without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation.—Have your converſation honeſt among the Gentiles; (ſays St. <hi>Peter</hi>) having a good conſcience, that whereas they ſpeak evil of you, as of evil doers, they may be aſhamed that falſely accuſe your good converſation in CHRIST—and may, by your good works which they ſhall behold, glorify GOD in the day of viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE ſcriptures, <hi>my brethren,</hi> while they point out the duty of Chriſtians, alſo ſhew the propriety and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of it. It is proper, it is fit and expedient, that Chriſtians ſhould maintain and preſerve an immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and examplary character—that the goſpel may not be blamed;—that their profeſſion may not be diſgraced; —that ſinners may be reclaimed, and that the church may be edified. They owe this duty to GOD, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the Church, and to that crooked and perverſe generation, among whom GOD hath placed them as <hi>lights,</hi> to hold forth the word of life.</p>
            <p>THIS is the <hi>poſitive part</hi> of the Chriſtian's duty. He is to be <hi>actively holy</hi> and <hi>examplary,</hi> in all manner of life and converſation; and that, not merely from the ſelfiſh and contracted view of ſecuring his own ſalvation;— but alſo, from the more <hi>catholic</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> motive of promoting the ſalvation of his fellow men;—that he
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:014137_0321_0F97D3F1F8225C80"/>may proſecute the <hi>noble</hi> and GOD-<hi>like</hi> deſign of ſaving both himſelf and thoſe who behold his good converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in CHRIST.—Proceed we now,</p>

            <p>I CALL you, my brethren, to conſider the <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>ſublime</hi> of your Chriſtian character and calling.

            <p>BUT what <hi>Timothy did by his miniſtry,</hi> every Chriſtian is called, in our text, to do by his <hi>example.</hi> If, indeed, <hi>my brethren,</hi> you are <q>harmleſs and blameleſs, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD, without rebuke, in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation, among whom you ſhine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life,</q> you ſhall not only <hi>ſave yourſelves,</hi> but alſo be highly inſtrumental in <hi>ſaving others.</hi> And oh! what an <hi>honour,</hi> what a bleſſedneſs is this?—In purſuing this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, you enter into the plan of redemption, and partake of the honours of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer;—you do a <hi>work</hi> the moſt pleaſing to GOD; the moſt profitable to yourſelves, and the moſt beneficial to your fellow-creatures:—A <hi>work</hi> which employed the counſels of GOD from all eternity;—and a <hi>work,</hi> on which he laviſhed (if I may ſo ſpeak with reverence)

Are not even ye in the preſence of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, at his coming? For ye are our glory and our joy.</q>—In like manner, <hi>my brethren,</hi> thoſe ſouls, to whoſe ſalvation you have contributed, by your virtuous and pious examples, will be your crown, your joy, and your glory, through eternal ages. In thoſe regions of perfect love, you will be happy, not only in ſeeing the happineſs of thoſe whom you loved here, but alſo in having promoted their eternal happineſs;—in having preſerved them from the contagion of the age;— in having recovered them from a crooked and perverſe generation, and in having ſnatched them as brands from the burning.—And O! my friends, can there be any difficulty unconquerable—any virtue too ſevere—any ſelf-denial too painful with ſuch motives as theſe before your eyes? Is it poſſible, that any frivolous pleaſure, or trifling emolument of ſin, ſhould have power or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough to rob you of this glory, this joy, and this crown of rejoicing? I would,</p>
            <p n="2">2. BEG leave to addreſs myſelf in a few words, to ſuch as are unhappy enough ſtill to make a part of that crooked and perverſe generation, amidſt whom the few righteous ſhine as lights in the world.</p>
            <p>MY unhappy fellow-ſinners! Let me beſeech you in the ſpirit of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>meekneſs,</hi> to enter into the views of providence, who has ſet thoſe eminent examples of virtue and piety before your eyes! For what reaſon hath GOD, the Father of mercies, kindled up ſo many <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining lights</hi> in this world of his—Men of
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:014137_0325_0F97D3F435012720"/>our own nature and make, adorned with ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous virtues—who have been ornaments to human nature, and benefactors to the world?—Is it only that we ſhould behold them with an eye of <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>contempt?</hi> Is it only that we ſhould blacken their characters, and purſue them with calumny and ſlander; thus aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating our own guilt and condemnation?—Is it not that we ſhould emulate their virtues, imitate their examples, and be corrected, reformed and inſtructed by their manners?</p>
            <p>LET us <hi>bluſh</hi> to think that men of the <hi>ſame common nature</hi> with ourſelves; compoſed of the ſame fleſh and blood; animated with the ſame paſſions, and born heirs of the ſame corruptions and infirmities, ſhould have yet ſo far outſtripped us, in every thing <hi>noble,</hi> GOD-<hi>like, rational</hi> and <hi>divine?</hi>—Are not the ſame ſuccours, the ſame promiſes of aid and aſſiſtance, the ſame ſources of grace, virtue and holineſs, open to us, as were to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Job,</hi> to <hi>Elijah,</hi> to <hi>Paul;</hi> and as are to all the good, the virtuous, the pious, and examplary, of this as well as every foregoing age? Wherefore then do we not avail ourſelves of theſe advantages?—Is there any aſſignable reaſon why any of our fellow-creatures ſhould outdo us in any thing <hi>amiable, lovely, virtuous, praiſe-worthy</hi> and <hi>of good report?</hi> Why any of our fellow-men ſhould excel us in the care of their own ſouls, or of the ſouls of their fellow-creatures? <q>The ſaints, are the excellent ones of the earth, in whom ſhould be all our delight:</q> Let us reſpect their virtues: Let us cheriſh their acquaintance: Let us love their ſociety, and follow their examples. Too, too long have we ſcandalized the church, it is now time we ſhould edify it. Too, too long have we laboured for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our fellow-men, it is now time we ſhould labour for their converſion and ſalvation. Too, too long have
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:014137_0326_0F97D3C5414A9100"/>we been <hi>joined to this crooked and perverſe generation; this world which lies in wickedneſs.</hi>—It is now time we ſhould ſhine as lights in the world; holding forth the word of life, for the guidance and direction of thoſe whom our bypaſt evil examples have perverted and confirmed in their wickedneſs!</p>
            <p>To conclude in one word: Let me addreſs that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all of you, <hi>my dear hearers,</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> addreſſed to the Jews—<q>Save yourſelves from this untoward generation.</q>—Deliver yourſelves from their <hi>principles, maxims, cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>manners;</hi> from their <hi>ſins</hi> and from their <hi>judgments.</hi>—<q>Make haſte, flee for your lives, leſt ye periſh.</q> May GOD, the merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our ſpirits, give weight to this exhortation, and ſet it home powerfully upon each of our conſciences; and to his great name ſhall be the eternal praiſe, through JESUS CHRIST our only Lord and Redeemer.

            <head>ESSAY LXI. THE AGGRAVATED GUILT OF MURDER: A SERMON FROM EXODUS XX. 13.</head>
            <head type="sub">Thou ſhalt not kill.</head>
            <p>IT may perhaps be deemed a little unſeaſonable and impolite to handle a ſubject of this kind, before a civilized and chriſtianized aſſembly. Methinks, I hear ſome of my hearers object, and ſay, <q>You pay us but a rude and unwelcome compliment, by even ſuppoſing us capable of committing ſuch an atrocious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural crime as this. Murder! The ſhedding of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood! Our blood runs chill, and freezes at the very thought of it. No; GOD forbid! Our hearts are too tender and humane ever to harbour ſuch a deſign, or liſten to ſuch a temptation!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THERE was a time, <hi>my hearers,</hi> when moſt murderers could doubtleſs have ſaid all this, with as much <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>ſincerity</hi> as any of us now can, and when their very
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:014137_0328_0F97D3F5B4FE7F70"/>ſouls would have ſhuddered at the thoughts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſo great a wickedneſs. But there was alſo a time when the increaſed ſtrength of their corruptions hurried them on to commit it with greedineſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt aggravated circumſtances of guilt.</p>
            <p>ALAS! we little know the <hi>deceitfulneſs</hi> and <hi>deſperate wickedneſs</hi> of our own hearts, or the <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>inveteracy</hi> of our corruptions, when we imagine ourſelves above the danger or poſſibility of committing the greateſt and moſt atrocious crimes. <q>The heart (ſays the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked; who can know it? It ſtarts aſide like a broken bow<note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 9.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE look upon murder, (and juſtly) as the moſt atrocious crime which can be committed by man—we have no compaſſion for the perſons of murderers, but regard them as <hi>monſters of iniquity,</hi> who have even no claim to <hi>human pity:</hi>—But I am perſuaded, <hi>my friends,</hi> that nothing but the reſtraining grace of GOD, prevents multitudes, who are thus <hi>mercileſs</hi> in their judgment of others, from committing the very ſame crime. <q>
                  <hi>Cruel man!</hi>—Thou haſt no mercy on thy fellow-ſinner!— Thou thinkeſt him unworthy the pity either of GOD or man!—Thou deemeſt it impoſſible for thee to fall into the ſame wickedneſs!—Yet thou art <hi>proud, imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, intolerant</hi> and <hi>unforgiving!</hi> Yet thy ſoul often <hi>boils, ferments,</hi> and <hi>rankles</hi> with the paſſion of <hi>anger, fury, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, envy,</hi> and <hi>malice prepenſe</hi> againſt thy neighbour! Yet thou prayeſt for his damnation, and deviſeſt evil againſt him, and wiſheſt him dead, becauſe he ſtands in the way of ſome gratification, or has wounded thy imaginary honour, or hurt thy pride! Be it known unto thee, <hi>O blind</hi> and <hi>mercileſs man,</hi> that <hi>thou art the very murderer</hi> whom thou condemneſt without pity;
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:014137_0329_0F97D3F675392EE0"/>and that nothing but ſome <hi>prudential motive,</hi> or rather, the <hi>reſtraining grace of</hi> GOD, bridling thine outrageous paſſions, for the ſafety and ſecurity of human ſociety, prevents thee from perpetrating the very fact thyſelf, which thou thinkeſt <hi>unpardonable</hi> in <hi>another.</hi>

            <p>Thou ſhalt not kill, <hi>ſays GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT would be paying a bad compliment to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of my hearers, to take up much of your time in ſhewing you—That there are many circumſtances, wherein the taking away of human life, is not to be deemed <hi>ſinful</hi> or <hi>criminal;</hi>—ſuch as <hi>chance-medly,</hi> when one man takes away the life of another, by <hi>mere acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> without any <hi>knowledge</hi> or <hi>deſign</hi> in the action;—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>man-ſlaughter, on one's own defence,</hi> when a man from a principle of <hi>ſelf-preſervation,</hi> is, as it were, compelled to take away the life of another who aſſaults him unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, in order to ſave his own. The ſame alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in <hi>a lawful, defenſive war,</hi> when men are forced to deſtroy an invading enemy, in defence of their own lives, liberties and properties;—or, <hi>laſtly,</hi> when men have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their lives, by ſuch crimes as eſſentially affect the public good and ſafety, and which are adjudged worthy of death, by laws <hi>human and divine.</hi> In all theſe caſes, and perhaps in ſome others, the taking away of human life, is ſo far from being criminal, that it may be a duty which we owe to GOD, <hi>our neighbour</hi> and <hi>ourſelves!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE crime therefore <hi>here</hi> forbidden by GOD, and which is emphatically expreſſed in the Engliſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage by the word murder, is the <hi>ſhedding of innocent blood;</hi> —or <q>wilfully and feloniouſly killing of another, upon prepenſed malice; whether ſecretly or openly; whether ourſelves, or by others.</q> And this prepenſed malice, is either, (1.) Expreſs, when it may be evidently proved, that there was ill-will;—or, (2.) Implied; when one kills another ſuddenly, having nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:014137_0330_0F97D3F7347C3BC8"/>himſelf: For, in ſuch a caſe, the law juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes, that there muſt have been <hi>malice.—To this</hi> may alſo be added, the atrocious crime of <hi>ſuicide,</hi> or a man's laying violent hands upon himſelf;—as alſo, <hi>duelling,</hi> which contains in it the eſſence and guilt of both the above crimes.</p>
            <p>IN farther improving this ſubject, I ſhall, I. <hi>A little</hi> expoſe the heinous and and aggravated guilt of murder. —II. Shew you that it is a crime juſtly puniſhable by death.—III. Endeavour to expoſe thoſe <hi>paſſions, tempers</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> which lead to it. I am,</p>
            <p n="1">I. A LITTLE to open and <hi>expoſe</hi> the <hi>heinous</hi> and <hi>aggravated guilt</hi> of murder. And this may be ſhown 1ſt, From the very <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>conſequences</hi> of the crime itſelf; and, 2dly, From the light in which both the <hi>word of</hi> GOD, and the <hi>conſciences of men</hi> repreſent it. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM the very nature and conſequences of the crime itſelf. (1.) Man is fearfully and wonderfully made; <hi>made,</hi> we are told, in the <hi>image</hi> and <hi>likeneſs</hi> of GOD. Man is GOD'S offspring and <hi>repreſentative</hi> on this earth. His body is, perhaps, the nobleſt piece of divine workmanſhip; and GOD, when he had made it, breathed into it the breath of life, and made it <hi>a living</hi> and <hi>intelligent image</hi> of <hi>himſelf!</hi> Now to break to pieces this <hi>living temple;</hi>—to <hi>deface, undo,</hi> and, as much as in us is, <hi>wantonly to deſtroy</hi> this workmanſhip of GOD;— to ſeparate this ſoul and body whom GOD hath joined together;—to diſunite and take down this tabernacle, which GOD hath built and ſet up, by a miracle of his power, wiſdom and goodneſs;—what a <hi>daring</hi> crime? What an <hi>audacious</hi> wickedneſs? All our power, wiſdom and contrivance cannot give <hi>form, exiſtence</hi> or <hi>life</hi> to a
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:014137_0331_0F97D3F7F6274BE8"/>worm; and ſhall we dare to deſtroy a fellow-man? Shall we perfume to take away, in the wantonneſs of our pride and paſſion, that which all the powers on earth, and all the angels in haven cannot give?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THAT GOD <hi>makes nothing in vain,</hi> is a maxim not to be diſputed. Who knows the deſtiny of a human creature, or for what purpoſes Providence may have deſigned him? Preſumptuous, ſhort-ſighted mortals that we are, we are apt to pronounce a being worthleſs and uſeleſs, on whom his Maker may ſet much value, and by whom he may do great things! When we ſee <hi>Saul perſecuting the church,</hi> and aſſiſting in the ſtoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> we may adjudge him worthy of death, and think the world would be well rid of ſuch a monſter; yet this very <hi>Saul</hi> was <hi>a choſen veſſel,</hi> who was to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte half the Roman empire to JESUS! How many wicked and worthleſs men, have become benefactors to the world and ornaments to humanity!</p>
            <p>How many peſts to human ſociety have become fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of children, who have done honour to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and become the ſaviours of their country?—This ſhould reach us not to deſpiſe the meaneſt of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of GOD, or the wickedeſt of men, who are ſtill in a place of repentance. But the murderer does what in him lies to defeat the deſigns of GOD'S providence, and cut off the purpoſes of his will. True, he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver effect this: <q>GOD'S counſel ſhall ſtand, and the thoughts of his heart to all generations: For there is neither wiſdom or device, or counſel againſt the Lord!</q>—Yet no thanks to the murderer for this— who, in the rage or wantonneſs of his paſſions, cuts off a human creature, who, for all he knew or conſidered, might have been appointed by GOD to anſwer the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt purpoſes, and to bring about the nobleſt deſigns in the world!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="333" facs="unknown:014137_0332_0F97D3F8B4A74368"/>
               <q>CRUEL and inhuman mother!—Knoweſt thou how uſeful, how worthy, how ornamental a member of ſociety, that child might have proved, whom thou art now about to <hi>ſtrangle</hi> or <hi>abandon</hi> to certain death;—to what honours, to what happineſs, to what uſefulneſs, to what degrees of future glory it might have been advanced!</q>—<q>Vile and <hi>ſavage barbarian,</hi> who, for the ſlighteſt provocation, or to gratify the moſt diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal revenge, art juſt about to plunge the murderous ſteel into thy neighbour's bowels, or to level him to the earth by a leaden death!—Stop thy hand, till thou haſt conſidered, That thou art now about to rob helpleſs children, of a father—a helpleſs wife, of her provider—the poor and needy, of a helper—his friends, of a friend, and the world, perhaps, of a more uſeful member of ſociety than thy worthleſs ſelf!</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THE chief end and deſign of this world and ſtate is, that men ſhould prepare and provide for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and an eternal world. Human life was given chiefly for this purpoſe, and would be worth nothing on any other ſuppoſition. I may even affirm it, with confidence, that it would be unworthy of the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD to create ſuch a being as man, and to expoſe him to the many calamities and afflictions of this life, <hi>merely</hi> for the ſmall portion of pleaſure and happineſs which he enjoys in it.</p>
            <p>LIFE, <hi>human life,</hi> is a <hi>time</hi> and <hi>ſpace</hi> of <hi>trial</hi> and <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> for eternity. In this view of it, human life is an <hi>invaluable treaſure,</hi> and every moment of it is of the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance!</hi> For this purpoſe the Pſalmiſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately prays; <q>LORD, cut me not off in the midſt of my days; thy years are throughout all generations<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. cii. 24.</note>.</q>
               <pb n="334" facs="unknown:014137_0333_0F97D3F974730080"/>For this purpoſe we pray againſt <hi>ſudden deaths;</hi> leſt we ſhould be hurried into eternity, and before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, with our ſins upon us, and in an unprepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT, now, the murderer robs us of all our precious time,—ſends us ſuddenly and unexpectedly before the tribunal of GOD, without the poſſibility of a GOD <hi>have mercy;</hi> and, perhaps, plunges us, impenitent, into an everlaſting hell of miſery and deſpair!—O! <hi>what reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can be made in this caſe! What reparation for this injury! If any guilt can look too big for divine mercy, it muſt be ſuch guilt as this!</p>
            <p>WHAT can <hi>our ſorrow,</hi> what can <hi>our tears, what</hi> can <hi>even our blood</hi> do towards atoning ſuch aggravated guilt as this? Can we redeem this ſoul from hell? Can we again give it a new ſtate of trial and probation; or one hour wherein to work out its own ſalvation?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) THIS is a crime againſt <hi>humanity;</hi> a crime againſt all the ſoft, tender and ſympathetic feelings of the heart! It ſpeaks an infatuated underſtanding, a hard heart, a ſeared conſcience!—A man muſt firſt kill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as it were; do violence to all his feelings, as a man; have totally diveſted himſelf of his humanity before he could imbrue his hands in the blood of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his neighbour, his friend, his brother of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) IT is a crime truly <hi>diabolical.</hi> The <hi>devil</hi> was a murderer from the beginning; and hence he is called <hi>Abaddon</hi> and <hi>Apollyon,</hi> the <hi>deſtroyer. Envy, malice</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,</hi> from which murder ſprings, as from its proper ſource, are paſſions <hi>truly diabolical;</hi> and a man muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be a <hi>devil incarnate,</hi> before he can coolly premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate murder, and take pleaſure, or enjoy gratification, in ſpilling innocent blood. And this is the infamous glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of thoſe, who ſcruple not to declare, that <hi>revenge is
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:014137_0334_0F97D3FA34683E98"/>ſweet!</hi> If there be, indeed, a pleaſure in this kind of revenge, it is truly the pleaſure of a devil, and perhaps the only ſpecies of pleaſure of which a devil is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable!</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) GREAT and <hi>horrible</hi> as the crime of murder is <hi>in itſelf,</hi> yet there are many circumſtances which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly aggravate and increaſe its guilt; from the time when, and place where it is committed; from the perſons upon whom, and deliberate manner in which it is perpetrated. Perhaps it was a poor innocent, a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infant! Perhaps it was an aged, indulgent father, or the child of our bowels! Perhaps it was a brother, or a friend who ſticketh cloſer than a brother, and whom we ought to have protected at the hazard of life! Perhaps it was done deliberately, in cold blood, after long premeditation, and for ſome ſlight provocation, or upon ſome mere punctilio of honour! Perhaps it was the father of a family, whoſe helpleſs children depended wholly upon his life for their ſupport! Theſe, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of other circumſtances, render this crime exceedingly heinous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE aggravated guilt of murder farther appears from the light in which both the <hi>word of</hi> GOD, and the conſciences of men, repreſent it. When <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew his brother <hi>Abel</hi>—<q>The LORD ſaid, what haſt thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cryeth unto me from the ground. And now thou art curſed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. iv.</note>.—Your blood of your lives will I require, at the hand of every beaſt will I require it; and at the hand of man, at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. ix.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="336" facs="unknown:014137_0335_0F97D3FB4C93D170"/>
IT is a crime of a <hi>deep die,</hi> and of a <hi>crimſon colour;</hi>—a <hi>land-polluting, land-defiling</hi> ſin. <q>Ye ſhall not pollute the land wherein ye are, for blood it defileth the land, and the land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. xxi. 12,—15.</note>.</q> 
               <q>By ſwearing, and lying, and killing, and ſtealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood: Therefore ſhall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein ſhall languiſh<note n="†" place="bottom">Hoſ. iv. 2, 3.</note>.</q> 
               <q>Ye know, (ſays the Apoſtle) that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John iii. 15.</note>.</q> And how earneſtly does the Pſalmiſt pray, <q>Deliver me, O LORD, from blood-guiltineſs<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. li.</note>.</q>—<q>Surely, at the command of the LORD came this upon <hi>Judah,</hi> to remove them out of his ſight, for the ſins of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and for the innocent blood which he ſhed: For, he filled <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> with innocent blood, which the LORD would not pardon<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Kings xxiv. 3,4.</note>!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE heinouſneſs of this crime is alſo manifeſt from <hi>thoſe terrors of conſcience</hi> which generally follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of it. How dreadful was the caſe of <hi>Cain?</hi>

Indeed, it is very remarkable, that <hi>man-ſlayers</hi> are haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt frightful terrors, which leave them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eaſe or peace of mind; and that many of thoſe who have perpetrated the moſt horrid murders, in the moſt ſecret manner, have been driven by theſe terrors, to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their guilt,</hi> to confeſs <hi>their crimes,</hi> and to die for them, rather than enjoy a life, wholly inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able!</p>
            <p>NOR, my friends, are theſe terrors <hi>vain things:</hi>—They have their ground in the very conſtitution of our nature, and in that moral law which GOD hath written on the human heart.

The divine law is expreſs in the matter, and ſeems to inſiſt on the death of the murderer, at the riſk of the community, without leaving any room or plea for mercy. <q>At the hand of every man's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I require the life of man: Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. ix. 6.</note>.</q>

            <p>THE ſame paſſions and barbarity of temper which have led a man to commit <hi>one murder,</hi> may lead him to commit many;—and ſuch are the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this crime, that it would be dangerous to ſpare the life of ſuch a criminal, unleſs we could be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his true converſion, which is a matter not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſcertained: And therefore no ſecurity could be given to ſociety, for his future good behaviour.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that above all crimes, <hi>murder</hi> ſeldom goes unpuniſhed even in this life; Providence often ſtrangely ſo ordering it that thoſe who have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this crime in the moſt <hi>ſecret manner,</hi> have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been diſcovered by the moſt ſurpriſing means, and brought to condign puniſhment, often many years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the commiſſion of the fact.</p>
            <p>SINCE, therefore, <hi>my brethren,</hi> murder is ſuch an atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious crime, and condemned by the laws of GOD and

Of what importance is it, therefore, that we ſhould keep the heart with all diligence, and cruſh and ſtifle thoſe ſeeds of <hi>murder</hi> there, before they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable and <hi>bring forth fruit unto death?</hi>—How dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous is an <hi>irraſcible temper?</hi> And therefore the wiſe man counſels, <q>Make no friendſhip with an angry man, and with a furious man thou ſhalt not go; leſt thou learn his ways, and get a ſnare to thy ſoul<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxii. 24.</note>.</q>

Of what importance is it, therefore, to <hi>watch over the heart,</hi> and to have <hi>this fountain of the life cleanſed</hi> and <hi>purified</hi> by grace! Were men at any pains with their <hi>hearts</hi>—would they look into theſe <hi>chambers of imagery,</hi> and put a ſtop to the workings of iniquity there;—would they give no quarter, no indulgence, to the ſenſual and malignant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but inſtantly <hi>cruſh</hi> and <hi>exterminate</hi> them as they riſe in the imagination, and check the thought of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which is ſin; and, while they attempt this, would they <hi>pray for</hi> GOD'S <hi>help,</hi> and that he would cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in them a clean heart, and renew a right frame of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within them, they would have few out-breakings of ſin in their lives.—But juſt the reverſe of this is the

            <p n="2">2. AVARICE, or <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> is often the cauſe of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <q>The love of money, hath, in this reſpect, been the root of much evil—which, while many have coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows<note n="†" place="bottom">Tim. vi. 7,—10.</note>.</q> Many of the <hi>wholeſale murders</hi> committed under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of war—and moſt of the <hi>private murders</hi> committed in robberies, have ſprung from this ſource.</p>
            <p>AHAB committed this kind of murder on <hi>Naboth,</hi> for his vineyard. A king covets a neighbouring ſtate, and ſends his ſoldiers to murder the inhabitants, the rightful proprietors, that he may poſſeſs it: And yet <hi>this</hi> ſhall be ſanctified by the name of <hi>a lawful war,</hi>—and the <hi>murderers</hi> who fall in the attempt, ſhall be ſaid to <hi>die in the bed of honour;</hi> and the <hi>chief murderer,</hi> who ſet them on, ſhall be called a <hi>mighty hero!</hi> And his name ſhall ſhine in the annals of hiſtory! But that GOD who ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the throne of the univerſe, and is the avenger of innocent blood, ſeeth his guilt and ſhall repay it.—If the poor wretch, who, under a ſenſe of provocation, taketh away the life of his neighbour, ſhall be deemed a murderer—What ſhall we think of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> and many other doughty <hi>heroes</hi> ſince their time, who have ſhed the blood of many <hi>millions</hi> of innocent men,

            <p n="3">3. DRUNKENNESS often <hi>leads to, and ends</hi> in the ſin of murder. What ſays the Wiſe Man? <q>Who hath wo? Who hath ſorrow? Who hath contentions? Who hath babblings?

               <q>While they are drunken as drunkards, (ſays <hi>Naham</hi>) they ſhall be devoured as ſtubble ſully dry.</q>— <q>Wine is a mocker, (ſays <hi>Solomon</hi>) ſtrong drink is a raging, and whoſoever is deceived thereby, is not wiſe.</q> How many unnatural quarrels; wounds without cauſe, and even murders, have been the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of intoxication? And, indeed, what elſe can we expect, when the underſtandings of men are extinguiſhed, their paſſions enflamed, and their reaſon dethroned? in ſuch a ſituation as this, to what lengths of exceſs may not men go? Or what is to reſtrain them from committing the moſt atrocious crimes?—The light of reaſon <hi>is put

They have no guide; no guard; no director! Their words and actions are all at random; and are more likely to have a bad than a good direction.</p>
            <p>INDEED, the generality of <hi>private murders,</hi> are owing more or leſs to this cauſe. Ought not this, therefore, to be better than a thouſand arguments <hi>for ſobriety,</hi> and <hi>againſt drunkenneſs?</hi> Can we poſſibly be over cautious againſt an exceſs, which <hi>unmans us,</hi> which deprives us of the guidance of reaſon, proves a <hi>ſtimulus</hi> to all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and renders us the dupe of every temptation, and liable to commit the greateſt and moſt deſtructive crimes?—How many thouſands are there this day in the world, who have ſuddenly committed ſuch crimes in their liquor, in a drunken, unguarded moment, as have ruined themſelves and their families, and as they never would probably have thought of in ſobriety?</p>
            <p>WE have reaſon to tank GOD, indeed, that this vice is not very common amongſt us. But ſurely we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not guard too much againſt it. The</p>
            <p n="4">4.

            <p>THE <hi>fear of ſhame</hi> has drove many unhappy mothers, to commit the moſt unnatural and barbarous of all murders, upon the <hi>fruit of their own bodies</hi>—their ſmil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, helpleſs infants?—A dread of the imputation of cowardice, from the meaneſt and vileſt part of the human ſpecies, has driven many a man to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon his neighbour, or to expoſe himſelf to the ſame fate, againſt every dictate of reaſon, humanity, charity, and even ſelf-preſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="344" facs="unknown:014137_0343_0F97D4033560C798"/>
How many men deem themſelves as much in <hi>honour</hi> and duty bound, to take away a man's life, who, in paſſion, would <hi>give them the lie,</hi> (when, perhaps, it was only giving them their due!)—as to perform any duty of juſtice, charity or mercy! And what is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, <hi>theſe men of honour,</hi> theſe <hi>heroes of the point,</hi> are often perſons of the moſt <hi>infamous principles,</hi> and of the moſt <hi>inſolent</hi> and <hi>provoking</hi> behaviour; ſo that thoſe who converſe with them, are under the ſad dilemma, either of treating them with a reſpect which they by no means deſerve; or, of being run through the body, for telling them a <hi>naked,</hi> and oftentimes a <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> truth!</p>
            <p>AND yet the perſon who, from Chriſtian principles, or from the principle of ſelf-preſervation, would decline this way of determining a point of honour, muſt loſe the eſteem of the world, and be poſted and ſtigmatized as a <hi>coward!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many murders have had their riſe from a word miſunderſtood, from an affront never deſigned, or from other punctilios ſo trifling, as not to deſerve the ſmalleſt degree of reſentment?</p>
            <p>To conclude. Would we be removed at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible diſtance from the commiſſion of this heinous and atrocious crime,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) LET us labour to obtain a <hi>ſound converſion!</hi> Let us pray that GOD would give us a <hi>new heart</hi> and a <hi>right frame of ſpirit;</hi> that he would root out of our heart eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter root of <hi>malice, envy</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> and that he would implant, in their ſtead, the principles of <hi>humanity, mercy, meekneſs, patience</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian charity;</hi> that we may <hi>do juſtly, love mercy</hi> and <hi>walk humbly</hi> with our GOD!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) LET us keep a ſtrict watch and guard over our <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>appetites;</hi> thoſe luſts which war againſt the ſoul, and hurry it no to every ſpecies of exceſs.</p>
            <p>AND while we watch, let us <hi>pray</hi> that we enter not into temptation; that GOD would, by his grace, keep
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:014137_0344_0F97D403F44A5A40"/>us from falling; and powerfully <hi>aſſiſt</hi> and <hi>uphold</hi> us in every time of need. And,</p>
            <p>LASTLY; let us ſhun evil company, which is often the occaſion of theſe ſins. <q>Evil communications cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good manners.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE miſchiefs which have ariſen from evil company, and the ſnares which men have been brought into by it, are innumerable. <q>Bleſſed is the man, that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful, (ſays <hi>David</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. i.</note>). He that walketh with the wiſe, ſhall be wiſe; but a companion of fools ſhall be deſtroyed. My ſon, (ſays <hi>Solomon</hi>) if ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not: walk not thou in the way with them: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain thy foot from their path: For their feet run to evil, and make haſte to ſhed blood. Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men: Avoid it, paſs not by it; turn from it and paſs away: For they ſleep not unleſs they have done miſchief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MAY GOD ſanctify theſe inſtructions of his word to us, and make them <hi>operative on our hearts,</hi> and <hi>fruitful in our lives,</hi> through the power and Spirit of CHRIST. Amen.</p>
