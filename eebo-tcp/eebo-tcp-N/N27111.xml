            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>As Congreſs muſt by law provide at their next ſeſſion for any ſimilar caſes which may occur under the Britiſh treaty, and as it is of general importance to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States, the following examination of the caſe of Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, lately decided in the Diſtrict Court of South Carolina, is with deference, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their conſideration.</p>
            </argument>
            <opener>
               <salute>Fellow Citizens,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>As I believe you have not been much troubled with my remarks on any ſubject, I hope you will more readily excuſe the favor I now aſk, in requeſting your attention to the preſent. I am induced to make them becauſe the queſtion is of very great public conſequence, and involves the deareſt and moſt valuable rights of every man in the United States. It reaches all ſituations, as well the elevated and opulent, as the moſt indigent. It affects the knowledge and independence of our judicials in the moſt important manner; and as I know it has excited the ſenſibility of the people, and muſt be ſo far made the ſubject of enquiry in congreſs, as to enable them to provide for ſimilar caſes, I have ſuppoſed ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036121_0003_10084C16FAC165A8"/>
of it may be neceſſary, in that ſpirit of deference and delicacy in which all ſuch enquiries ſhould be conducted.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not go into a definition of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a free government, and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings its citizens ought to expect; becauſe few of our own, even amongſt the moſt illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, are ignorant of the nature of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative government, the right of ſuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the ineſtimable privelege of the trial by jury in all caſes in which their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, lives, or property are concerned. To a people ſo informed, it is ſcarcely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to remark, that to men of feeling the value of character, of honorable fame, is dearer than life or property, or even the moſt tender connections; that to all men, whether of the niceſt honor or otherwiſe, the love of life is dearer than that of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and that they would readily ſacrifice the one to preſerve the other. Hence it follows, that thoſe privileges which guard the characters and lives of our citizens, are viewed with a more jealous eye, and will be aſſerted with more firmneſs and promptitude than even thoſe which protect their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vigilant as they are with reſpect to theſe, A number of our citizens therefore, believing that the ineſtimable privileges ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to them by the conſtitution and laws of the United States, have been affected in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036121_0004_10084C18886673A0"/>
the caſe of <hi>Jonathan Robbins,</hi> that it is one which may, if eſtabliſhed as a precedent, reach ſome valuable inhabitants of this country, and to the intent that theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges ſhould be more carefully guarded by a poſitive law in future, the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are ſubmitted, with a view to bring this buſineſs more fully before the public than it has hitherto been.</p>
            <p>The following is the ſtatement of the caſe with the accompanying affidavits.</p>

            <p>The ſignature made by the priſoner to this affidavit in court, appeared to be in the ſame hand writing as the ſignature to the one made in 1791, from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it is preſumable, that Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins is the priſoner's real name. The body of the affidavit made in New-York, in 1796, was printed; the names, dates, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures, &amp;c. were filled up in writing; it had the notarial ſeal of of John Keeſe, <abbr>eſq</abbr> affixed, and had the appearance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a genuine paper deemed at that day by ſeamen to be a protection.</p>
            <p>It appears, however, by the reſult, that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036121_0011_10084C309552B998"/>
theſe affidavits, and the queſtion, whether the priſoner was an American, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſeaman, or not? were, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the court, altogether immaterial; the court would have felt itſelf bound to deliver up any reſpectable citizen of the U. States, if claimed under the circumſtances of the priſoner.</p>
            <p>It appears by the preceding ſtatement, that the judge, under the circumſtances of this caſe, would feel himſelf obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up any "reſpectable citizen of the United States." I do not mention this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he uſed the words "reſpectable citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen;" but I do it to ſhew, that this is a queſtion which ſeriouſly concerns every part of the community, and that no citizen, whoſe buſineſs may oblige him to go to other countries, is hereafter ſafe from ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. It will not depend upon him to ſay, he is not a marine, or to ſhew certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates or proofs to the contrary; it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the force with which he is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, and the temper or violence of the officer who directs it. Inſtances, it is ſaid, have lately occurred, where not only the ſeamen, but the paſſengers have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, who, although declaring they were not ſeamen, were ſtill impreſſed as ſuch, and obliged to perform their duties. No production of papers, no intreaties availed

them; they were compelled to ſubmit.—Had theſe men been enterpriſing, or an opportunity offered, and they had poſſeſſed themſelves of their oppreſſors, and brought them into port, or had they, in the attempt to regain their freedom, been obliged to deſtroy them, while the world would have applauded the act, the judge muſt, from the deciſion, have delivered them to a ſimilar demand, neither influence, friends, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune could ſave them; however ſuperior in theſe, in political privileges they were only equal to the unknown and friendleſs Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins; a conſiſtent and inflexible magiſtrate muſt view them with the ſame impartial eye; he muſt give to them the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the law or conſtitution; he could not vary them without the immediate, loſs of character. An enlightened people therefore will as attentively, nay, they ought more carefully to guard them in the perſon of a poor or unprotected, than a rich or conſiderable man, The latter will always find powerful friends to ſupport and protect his privileges; while the rights of the former may in ſilence and with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be unattended to, merely becauſe he is unknown, and has not an advocate to aſſert them. This would probably have been the caſe in the preſent inſtance, had not ſome
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036121_0013_10084C34E2751B20"/>
gentlemen voluntarily offered themſelves to examine and diſcuſs its conſequences. The public are obliged to them: it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent example; I hope it will be followed upon every occaſion, and that it will make us infinitely more vigilant of our rights than ever. We muſt never forget that in this country the poor and the rich, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the influential, are all entitled to equal privileges; that we ought to conſider a violation of the rights of the moſt indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and unprotected man, as an injury to the whole; while we have a pen to guide, or a voice to lift, they ſhould be conſtantly exerted againſt the exerciſe of tyranny or oppreſſion, by whatever nation committed, or to whomſoever the violence may be done.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to examine the caſe, and the nature of the evidence, on which Mr. Bee determined to deliver Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, to the demand of the Britiſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>I believe it is the firſt inſtance which has occurred, of a demand under the Britiſh treaty in the United States; certainly, in this ſtate. The law reſpecting the delivery of fugitives from juſtice was ſilent on the delivery of fugitives to foreign powers, tend therefore, the judge conceived himſelf not only authoriſed, but bound to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036121_0014_10084C36A68BF350"/>
By his own ſtatement it appears to have been entirely a new caſe, in which I ſhould ſuppoſe he had conſiderable diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was not bound by any particular legiſlative act to deliver on a mere affidavit, or any "trevial ſurmiſe or hearſay evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence." It was his duty to have maturely conſidered what were the legal import and meaning of the words, "Charged with murder and forgery," and how far, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the laws of this country, there was ſuch evidence of criminalty as would juſtify the ſending any man, claiming to be a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and not diſproved as ſuch, from his country, to be tried by a foregn tribunal, and moſt probably by a court martial.—The judge's auditors muſt have been ſurpriſed when they heard him ſay, "that no man can be puniſhed by the laws of G. Britain without a trial; if he is innocent he will be acquitted; if guilty, he muſt be puniſhed." This obſervation was by no means applicable to the preſent caſe; the true queſtion before the court was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jonathan Robbins, producing a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial certificate of being a citizen of the United States, and aſſerting that he was impreſſed by violence into the Britiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was, from the nature of the affidavits before him, to be torn from his country and connections, and deprived of all the rights

of citizenſhip, and ſent to be tried by a foreign tribunal, acting with a jury, in the moſt ſummary manner, and by martial law.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to equal legal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the judge; but, I have ſometimes attended to points of this kind, and as far as I am able to form, am clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the priſoner, not having been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to be a citizen of the United States, there was not ſuch evidence before the court as juſtified the judge in giving ſo important an order, as to ſurrender him to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Britiſh conſul. This I will, endeavor to prove from the examination of the affidavits, and the nature of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony required by our laws, as ſufficient even to juſtify the putting a citizen upon his trial in this country, without adding to it the inexpreſſible diſgrace and danger of ſending him to be tried by a foreign tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
            <p>The firſt affidavit is William Portlock, on which I ſuppoſe the judge could not have reſted at all; he appears from his age, and the ſtatement in the affidavit, to have been a ſailor lad, as little known in this country as Robbins himſelf, and to have been ſo illiterate as not to have been able to write his name. This lad ſays, he heard, a perſon who anſwered to the name of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="17"

Robbins, declare he was boatſwains's mate on board the Hermione, when the was carried into the port of "Cavilla;" and that ſometimes, when he was drunk, he would mention the Hermione, clench his fiſt, and ſay, "bad luck to her."</p>
            <p>From the ſtatement it reſults, that this Portlock was an illiterate ſailor lad, ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as not to know the name of the port the frigate was carried into. It does not appear that he was ſhewn the priſoner, or that he could ſwear that Jonathan Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins was the perſon he knew on board the Tanner's Delight; he avowedly knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf. He does not ſay the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſpoke of, confeſſed to him that he was concerned in the murder or piracy charged on him. From the youth, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſituation of Portlock; from the vague and uncertain account he gave, I muſt ſtill be of opinion that the judge could not have reſted at all on his teſtimony; he knew, that even if Portlock had ſworn poſitively to the identity of Robbins, and the latter had, when ſober, made any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of guilt to him, that it was the duty of a judge not to have attended to it.—Any confeſſion of a criminal muſt be made in a particular manner, before magiſtrates, or in open courts, to operate to conviction. An elegant writer, treating on this ſubject,
<pb n="18"
                   facs="unknown:036121_0017_10084C41078AFC08"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſays, "the confeſſion of a criminal, when taken even before a magiſtrate, can rarely be turned againſt him, without obviating the end for which he muſt be ſuppoſed to have made it. Beſides we have known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of murders avowed, which never were committed; of things ſtolen, which had never quitted the poſſeſſion of the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner."</p>
            <p>The evidence of words alledged to have been ſpoken by the perſon accuſed, and connected with the criminality of the charge, ought alſo to be received with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt. Such words are either ſpoken in the zeal of unſuſpicious confidence, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be repeated without a breach of private faith, which detracts much from the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the witneſs, or, in the unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hours of boaſting diſſipation, in which caſe they are not unlikely to be falſe in themſelves, and very likely to be falſely repeated.</p>
            <p>If every ſituation, therefore, in which Portlock can be viewed as witneſs, or the teſtimony he gave examined, it muſt at once be ſeen, that it was not ſuch as a grand jury could have found a bill on, or ſuch as will be conſidered ſufficient to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the delivery the judge has ordered. It muſt therefore have been altogether on the ſingle teſtimony of lieutenant Forbes; he ordered it, and this remains to be examined
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:036121_0018_10084C45F0E75538"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
The whoſe of lieutenant Forbes's exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ſays, that a man confined in the gaot of this diſtrict, who calls himſelf Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, but whoſe real name he believes to be Thomas Naſh, was a ſeaman for a certain term on board the Hermione; that after he left the Hermione, ſhe was ſeized by the crew and carried into an enemy's port; and that he has heard, from the depoſitions of others in courts-martial, that the man whom he believes to be named Thomas Naſh, was a principal in the commiſſion of the ſaid acts of piracy and murder, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From this account, Mr. Forbes has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he knows nothing of himſelf—that he was not ſure what the priſoner's name was, but that he believes it to be Thomas Naſh, and what is extremely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant he does not attempt to ſay he is an Iriſhman, and not an American, or that he was not impreſſed by violence into the Britiſh ſervice. But that from the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of others, and what he has heard, he conſiders him as one of the principals in the ſaid act. He does not explain what is the nature of the teſtimony he has heard on the ſubject, as it reſpects Naſh—by whom given—whether by reſpectable, or unprincipled witneſſes; by ſuch as were intimidated and forced into confeſſion of any thing—or by ignorant and illiterate

men, ſtanding (without a jury to interpoſe their lenient and impartial deciſions) before a court of ſtrict military officers, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and diſpatch of whoſe decrees they are every moment fearing to experience themſelves.</p>
            <p>His teſtimony therefore, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearſay, ought, in ſtrictneſs of law, to have operated leſs forcibly upon the mind of the judge, than even Portlock's, for however more reſpectable as an officer and a gentleman, Mr. Forbes is, yet, when he tells you himſelf he was not on board the frigate when the murder and piracy was committed, and that he knows nothing but by hearſay, either from the relations or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of others, he at once comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that deſcription of teſtimony which the laws of England, and the deciſion of the beſt judges, and our laws borrowed from them, forbid either a judge or a jury to receive in any caſe affecting the life or a limb of a ſubject of the one, or a citizen of the other.</p>
            <p>This being the ſtate of the evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judge, two important queſtions ariſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Whether the judge was ſtrictly au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed; and ff there was a doubt, whether he ought to have decided alone upon this queſtion? And,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:036121_0020_10084C4A5058CC98"/>
2dly, Whether in deciding, he had any and what diſcretion, as to the nature of the evidencee to be required, and whether his deciſion was ſuch as the ſecurity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal privileges of our citizens, or the policy of the United States, demanded.</p>
            <p>To the firſt queſtion—It appears that from the law of congreſs reſpecting the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of fugitives from juſtice from one ſtate to another, being ſilent, the judge was of opinion, on the application being firſt made to him, that it was a matter for executive interference; but that upon reconſideration, as the law and the treaty were ſilent, he was under the neceſſity of deciding. I think a further view of this ſubject muſt have, by this time, convinced him that he was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that no poſſible conſtruction that he can give to the 3d article of the conſtitution, can juſtify the opinion he formed, of his having a right to decide on this caſe. The article reſpecting the judicial, after veſting in congreſs the right to eſtabliſh ſuperior and inferior tribunals, defines the important powers they ſhall exerciſe, but leaves the boundaries of each to be aſcertained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. They have accordingly detailed the duties and fixed the limits of the ſupreme circuit and diſtrict courts, in a manner ſo clear, that it is aſtoniſhing a doubt ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036121_0021_10084C4BE0AE2660"/>
have for a moment ariſen as to the court really having juriſdiction to decide this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The diſtrict courts have no right to decide on any crime, where the puniſhment is to exceed 30 ſttripes, 100 dollars fine, and ſix mouths impriſonment: in any caſe exceeding theſe and particularly for capital offences, however the judge like any other magiſtrate, may on proper teſtimony com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for trial here, he has no right to decid: this authority is given to the circuit courts.</p>
            <p>Had therefore Robbins been committed for trial in this ſtate, could Mr. Bee have tried him? Certainly not—he muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to be tried by the circuit court.</p>
            <p>With what authority, therefore, could he decide upon a queſtion, which not only went to diveſt the priſoner of his right of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizenſhip, baniſh him from his country, and deprive him of the trial by jury; but alſo to diſpoſſeſs the circuit court of a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide upon as new, delicate and important a ſubject as ever came before them: one which de hoped would have been reſerved for much more ample diſcuſſion and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and in which I ſhould have ſuppoſed the public would have been pleaſed to hear the opinions of all the moſt experienced council at the bar, and to have ſeen decided by the ſupreme court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:036121_0022_10084C4D9EE17CB0"/>
It is no anſwer to ſay, that the 27th arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the treaty ſpeaks of commitment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the latter clauſe qualifies it, and makes this commitment depend upon the evidence of criminality according to our laws; and there is ſurely an aſtoniſhing difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mere commitment for trial, and a delivery over to a foreign tribunal. Nor is it more to ſay that the law of Congrdſs reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fugitives from juſtice, in the different ſtates, makes them deliverable on a bill found, or BY AN AFFIDAFIT, becauſe they are only removed from one ſtate to another, where the ſame laws, ſame right of jury, and ſame forms exiſt; and what is equal to all, THE INVALUABLE RIGHT OF HABEAS CORPUS, where a priſoner, improperly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, can, after delivery and removal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be brought before a judge, and have the reaſons of his confinement examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But where is the HABEAS CORPUS that can, in this ſituation, reach an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate American? However ſlight or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the accuſation againſt him, or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous the opinion of the SINGLE JUDGE who delivered him may be, when once dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered he is for ever deprived of this invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble privilege. The moment the order is given, HE IS BURIED IN CHAINS ON BOARD AN ARMED CUTTER, from whence,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036121_0023_10084C51B0D05680"/>
on his arrival in a diſtant and foreign port, he is immediately transferred, to another veſſel, on whoſe deck, after a ſummary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary trial, he is doomed to meet his fate.</p>
            <p>I will pauſe here, and aſk you, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, if there is no difference between this, and an ordinary commitment by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate for TRIAL HERE?—Your own good ſenſe, and the ſecurity you muſt wiſh to the rights of your fellow citizens and yourſelves, will beſt dictate the anſwer you ſhould give.</p>
            <p>There is another important reaſon why the judge ought not, upon this occaſion, SINGLY to have decided. I think if it had occurred to him he certainly would have poſtponed the deciſion, until the meeting of the circuit court it is this—That however all nations may have agreed upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of delivering up fugitives from juſtice, in the caſe of forgery; yet, that in times of war, and particularly in revolutions, when different nations hold ſuch oppoſite opinions upon what are piracy or murder, and what juſtifiable reſiſtance to tyranny and oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; when it is ſo extremely difficult, and requires all the acuteneſs, and all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of the ableſt judges, to draw the line between them: moſt certainly, in this country, our judges ought not to have decided, in caſes that may hereafter be
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036121_0024_10084C55CE69FCB8"/>
quoted as precedents, without the utmoſt caution and deliberation.</p>
            <p>They ſhould have reflected, that in all trials where there was a claim of birth right or citizenſhip, on the part of the accuſed, and where there was not the fulleſt and moſt poſitive proof of his criminality, that it was ſafeſt to try him here <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following is taken from the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of the Britiſh government of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigua, April 14, 1798, deſcribing Thomas Naſh, with the other men that were on board the Hermoine:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thomas Naſh, an Iriſhman, one of the forecaſtle men, about 5 feet 10 inches high, dark complexion, long black hair, remarkably hairy about his breaſt, arms, &amp;c. had left the ſhip in Porto Caballo; had entered on board either an American or Spaniſh trading ſchooner</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this advertiſement it is remarkable that Thomas Naſh is not called a warrant officer; he is only advertiſed as a common ſeaman, and not charged as one concerned in the murder of the officers. But the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing is this—that while Robbin's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate ſays he is a man five feet ſix inches high, the other, (that is the Antigua adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement,) ſays he is five feet ten inches—Now, four inches is ſo conſpicuous a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the height of a man, that ſurely it was of ſufficient conſequence in fixing the identity to have deſerved attention.</p>
               </note> In this inſtance they ought certainly to have done ſo. The teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony was ſlight and trivial; it was nearly ALL HEARSAY; it was indiſpenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to juſtice, that the priſoner ſhould have had an opportunity of ſending to New-York

and Connecticut to prove, if he could in the caſe of ſuch delicate importance, and of ſuch ſlight proof, could the Britiſh government have cenſured the procedure. It was as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy for them to ſend their witneſſes here, as to have ſent an armed cutter to carry him away. Juſtice would have been done to all parties; and venerating as their nation is ſaid to do, the trial by jury, a generous and free people would have applauded the reſpect that was paid to it here.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond queſtion, it has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obſerved, that this was a new caſe, in which Congreſs had not legiſlated, and the more that if the judge thought proper to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the power of deciding be was bound by no particular act or reſtriction, but at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to declare the nature of the evidence on which in his opioion ſo important a deciſion
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036121_0026_10084C5A65EBBBB0"/>
ſhould have been made. Suppoſing him, as the diſtrict Judge to have been at all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to decide his diſcretionary power, certainly it would have extended to this; and the point then for conſideration is, that having the power to determine on what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſo important an order ſhould be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what ought to have been his conduct, and what the nature of the proof he ſhould have required? My own opinion decidedly is, that he ſhould at leaſt have required ſuch proofs as a grand jury would have thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to find a bill. Perhaps he ought to have gone further, and before he conſented to his removal into a foreign country and military tribunal, he ſhould have demanded complete proof of his guilt, ſuch as would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a petit jury to convict him. But that he ſhould at leaſt have required the proof ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to find a bill no one I think will contend. The enquiry then is what is the proof which the Engliſh law and the laws of this country require to enable a grand jury to find a bill? Although I think there are many defects in the adminiſtration of juſtice—ſuch for inſtance as the dependance of the judges on the crown, from which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their appointment, and to whom they may be looking up for further promotion and honor, that of being removable by an addreſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036121_0027_10084C6460052C90"/>
from parliament, which a miniſter can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways command, and whoſe views and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es therefore none elſe but an inflexible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate will dare oppoſe; and particularly in the ſheriffs having the power to ſummons whom they pleaſe as jurors, and to pack them if they think proper: yet there is one part of their ſyſtem which I have always admired—that is, the inſtitution of a Grand Jury.</p>
            <p>Their laws hare wiſely and humanely conſidered, that next to the diſgrace of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted of an infamous offence, is the diſhonour of being charged with one; and therefore, before they would ſubmit a ſubject to the danger and inconvenience of being publicly arraigned, an impartial jury are on their oaths to declare the juſt cauſe for accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. We have copied their ſyſtem, and improved upon it. Our juries cannot be packed; they are drawn by lot, and in my judgment criminal trials in this ſtate are as perfect as they can be.</p>
            <p>The nature of the evidence which can alone be properly offered to a grand jury, although not entirely concluſive as to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual guilt of the priſoner, muſt be ſuch as if offered to the petit jury would be legal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—Even examinations taken agreeably to the 2d and 3d Philip and Mary, chapter
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036121_0028_10084C685DA09070"/>
10, (of force in this ſtate) can only be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in evidence before a jury, when the court is ſatisfied the witneſs is dead, unable to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, or kept away by the means or procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the priſoner. No other examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be given, or ought to be received in evidence; and a preſentment founded upon any other, would not be that due preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without which a citizen's life ſhould not be put in danger.</p>
            <p>The above opinion is founded on the higheſt law authorities. A learned En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh judge, ſpeaking on this ſubject, ſays "The evidence to be given ought to ariſe to a high degree of probability—abſolute poſitive proof if not to be inſiſted upon before a grand jury; AND SLIGHT TRIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AL SUSPICION AND HEARSAY evidence, are not ſufficient to ground ſuch preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon; for although they are only in the nature of a charge, and do not carry a conviction, yet as many inconveniences, as well as expence and danger attend a charge of this ſort, which no ſubject ought to undergo, but upon legal and ſufficient evidence."</p>
            <p>This is the law of England, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of legal evidence ſufficient to enable a grand jury to find a bill. Our law is taken from, and founded on it; and the public can now judge whether the teſtimony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036121_0029_10084C69F22305A0"/>
in this caſe, was ſuch as ought, in one of ſo much importance and danger to the priſoner, to have authorized his delivery.</p>
            <p>Some diſtinctions are attempted to be drawn, reſpecting territory and juriſdiction, the counſel for the priſoner having contended that the treaty entirely alluded to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar excluſive juriſdiction of each. I have no doubt in my own mind, that Mr. Jay meant no other than the excluſive territorial juriſdiction of each nation. He ſeems to have carefully omitted the word piracy, aware of the difficulty I have before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of diſtinguiſhing between what may be called PIRACY, or what laudable reſiſtance to violence and oppreſſion. This omiſſion therefore muſt once convince us, that Mr. Jay could only have meant private acts of premeditated and deliberative murder, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from motives unconnected with any attempts which individuals, coming to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e the citizens of this country might at any time make to free themſelves from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of impriſonment. It is wonderful however, to me, that Mr. Jay having ſeen the neceſſity of omitting piracy, did not alſo omit, at leaſt during the exiſtence of the war murder alſo: For in attempts to regain veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or eſcape from impreſſment, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as difficult to diſtinguiſh what is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as what is piracy. Upon an occaſion
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:036121_0030_10084C6BA2FEA9F8"/>
of ſuch importance to the future ſafety of his fellow-citizens Mr. Jay certainly ought, and will I ſuppoſe explain, what was his meaning in that article of the treaty. The quotations from Vattel and Rutherford did not apply at all. They are merely meant to refer to the caſes of children born at ſea, to aſcertain, as Vattel does very properly, that right as ſubject or citizens of the nation to which the veſſel they are born in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe that Vattel deſigned to extend the doctrine, ſo far as to mean that the ſhips of a nation are, with reſpect to the ſpace of water they cover on the ocean, its rerritory as to juriſdiction, as completely as its land or rivers are, is to prove him not only guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an inconſiſtency unbecoming ſo well-informed an author, but to make him flatly contradict doctrines expreſſed in other parts of his work. He then contradicts that neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral veſſels do not make free goods; and it is on his authority the Britiſh reſt more than any other, their rights to ſearch neutrals.</p>
            <p>Among the reaſons which ſhould make our judges very cautious in deciding againſt the claim of citizenſhip, by perſons aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be citizens, there is one PECULIAR TO THIS COUNTRY, and which ſhould be carefully attended to: it is, the difficulty of diſtinguiſhing between the natives of ſome
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036121_0031_10084C704F087708"/>
of the middle and ſouthern ſtates and the natives of Ireland, Germany, and in ſome inſtances Scotland. The emigrations from thoſe countries, to America were formerly very great. Whole countries have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſettled by them, with ſcarce the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of any other. Their children, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but the language of their parents will as naturally have the German, Iriſh or Scotch accent, as if they were born in Europe. Inſtances of this ſort muſt have occurred to any man, the leaſt acquainted with theſe ſtates. Indeed it is well known, that in ſome places many native Americans, born of German parents, have been met, who could not ſpeak the Engliſh language. If then any of theſe men, born of German parents, have become ſeamen, will it not be impoſſible to diſtinguiſh between them and Europeans.</p>
            <p>And can there be a more fallacious mode of determining than from the voice or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. I know of none more ſo, than that of the countenance; and to neither ſhould an acute or experienced judge ever attend.</p>
            <p>I now come to the policy of the meaſure in the United States, More than any other nation, except Great-Britain, ought the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of our ſeamen to be vigilantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to—they are the inſtrument of our commerce, and to them their country muſt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:036121_0032_1008383B6C8A5800"/>
look up as the true means of becoming an important naval power—of having the abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to protect and guard their rights, and to inſure to its citizens the bleſſings of peace: they are more expoſed to the attacks and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of powerful and overbearing nations than any other claſs of our citizens, and are therefore more entitled to the care and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of our public guardians. Poſſeſſing as the United States do, bulky products, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery day increaſing, and to export which great quantities of ſhipping and number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are neceſſary, to what portion of their citizens can they look with more anxiety than to them? Numerous as they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come within theſe ten years, who knows to what extent the parental and foſtering hand of government may increaſe them within the late ſucceeding period? But to effect this, we muſt value and cheriſh them. We muſt recollect that they are not our men, but cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens—that they do not, the moment they become impreſſed by a ſuperior foreign force, loſe their rights, or become loſt to their country. Can it be ſuppoſed, becauſe they are ſeamen, they have no families, no tender connexions, no comforts to endear their homes to them? Rough and boiſterous as is the element they traverſe, and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as are their lives, among none of our cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036121_0033_10084C7370DCD9A0"/>
are to be found more true independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and generoſity, or more ardent attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their country. If then they have thoſe paſſions, that impatience of inſult, that invincible thirſt for revenge, which indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties like impreſſment and tyranny never fail to provoke, are they to be puniſhed for uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opportunities to exerciſe them? Are they to ſubmit to the manacle and the laſh, without a murmur, becauſe they fear their country, however poſſeſſing the means, may not have the inclination to protect them? If ſo, adieu to your commerce and your navy! Your ſeamen will fly to other governments more ſenſible of their value, and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſert and maintain their rights.</p>
            <p>I will here take notice of the letter which the judge was ſaid to receive from the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of ſtate, mentioning, that "THE PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDENT ADVISED AND REQUESTED THE DELIVERY OF THE PRISONER," becauſe it had made ſome noiſe, and I do not view it in the ſame light with others, I believe that neither of them meant to influence the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the judge—that they ſuppoſed it was a mere matter of courſe—that there was no doubt as to the indentity or country of the priſoner<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and they probably never heard of his claim of citizenſhip: that they were anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, on the part of this government, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036121_0034_10084C7743832798"/>
to execute the treaty, and that the letter to the judge had no other intent. This I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally believe to be the caſe; but the noiſe it has made will ſhew the extreme impropriety of the higher executive officers of our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment ever touching in the moſt diſtant manner on any ſubject that may come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judicial. However innocent the intention, as I think it was in this inſtance, it is very apt to give riſe to unfavourable opinions;—and none more dangerous to a community can be entertained, than that of a wiſh of the executive to influence the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial. It weakens the confidence of the public in both; and leſſens the reſpect it is their wiſh to ſhew them. The preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will probably operate to advantage; becauſe it is to be ſuppoſed, that after this our ſecretaries will be careful to avoid over writing to a judge on any ſubject that may poſſibly come before him.</p>
            <p>In one thing I perfectly agree with Mr. Bee; and that is, in his avoiding to queſtion the conſtitutionality of the treaty, although I think it unconſtitutional. On no ſubject am I more convinced than that it is an unſafe and dangerous doctrine in a republic, ever to ſuppoſe that a Judge ought to poſſeſs the right of queſtioning or deciding upon the conſtitutionality of treaties or laws, or any
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036121_0035_10084C79F49FAE00"/>
act of an individual, or of two or three, above that of both branches of Congreſs—a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which is not warranted by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and will not I hope long have many advocates in this country.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here conclude my remarks on this eaſe. They are made in that ſpirit of defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſpect, which is intended to avoid giving offence, while it examines with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour the ſubject under diſcuſſion. My earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt wiſh is to draw the attention of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to the amendment of the act, and to prove to them the neceſſity of providing in future againſt the delivery of any fugitives, unleſs a bill is found againſt them by a grand jury: ſo guard them againſt entering into any articles on this ſubject in other treaties, unleſs they aſſent to it, and partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly to warn them againſt ever <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any agreements, reſpecting fugitives from juſtice except with nations whoſe citizens poſſeſs the right of trial by jury, and willing to recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſo indiſpenſible a proviſion.</p>
