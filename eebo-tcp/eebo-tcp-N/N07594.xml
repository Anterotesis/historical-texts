         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Relation might be acceptable to many of my Readers, being intended impartially as near the Truth as it hath come to my Knowledge. At <hi>Philadelphia</hi> on the third Day of the Second Month 1764. GEORGE the THIRD then happily Reigning. <hi>John Penn,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Tidings came from the <hi>North</hi> of a great Number of Men, who had aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Arms, and were actually on their March for the ſaid City, in order to take their Revenge on a Number of poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Savages, then in the Barracks of ſaid City, under the Protection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, however, juſt their Cauſe might have been in Pointing out ſuch of them as were actually Murderers (who would have been try'd by Law, and received their Deſtiny) yet to fly in the Face of Government where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very Individual and in ſhort our All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, muſt be productive of very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and fatal Conſequences.</p>
            <p>HWOBEIT, <hi>Philadelphia</hi> at this Time prov'd not to be the <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> expreſſes daily and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009697_0004_0F77860F1E628C98"/>hourly arriving of their nearer Approach, Orders were ſent to all the Ferrys on the River <hi>Schuylkil,</hi> to ſtop them by cutting away the Ropes and ſinking their Boats, which greatly impeded their March, and about Four Hundred croſs'd the River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourteen Miles <hi>North</hi> of the City at a Place call'd the <hi>Swedes Ford.</hi> Upon which being the Second Day of the Week, and the Sixth of the ſame Month, a Number of the Inhabitants of the City and others appeared under Arms, the Barracks and Streets lin'd with Cannon, and nothing was expected but the doleful Scene of War. Among the reſt were the People call'd Friends, prepared with Arms like <hi>Spartans</hi> brave, ſtriding forth with Gigantic Pace to defend their Laws and Liberty, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than Life, let it be Recorded in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of after Ages in LETTERS of GOLD.</p>
            <p>ON the Seventh Day of the ſame Month an Expreſs arrives, informing that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Guard, amounting to near two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, had come into <hi>Germantown,</hi> whereon a Council was held, in which it was determined, that they ſhould be met in Order to know their Demands, and why
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009697_0005_0F77860FDFD4C5F0"/>they came Arm'd in ſuch a Manner that they might drop their Intention by being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of our Strength and Reſolution to Defend our Rights to the laſt.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER on the eighth Day of the ſame they were viſited at <hi>Germantown;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon after ſome Communication with the Recorder and his Aſſociates; attended by a great Number of the Inhabitants, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they were found a ſelected Band of Gentlemen, Decendants of the Noble <hi>Eniskillers,</hi> who were the great Means of ſetting that great and never to be forgotten Prince King <hi>William</hi> on the Throne. Their Demands were too reaſon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able to be rejected, they were Gentle and eaſy, not farther then Pointing out to the Government ſuch of theſe Savages as had been guilty of Murder, and a praying like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the Government would take notice, and try them by the Laws of the Place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; they had no Intent in the leaſt to moleſt Man, Woman or Child. Their Grievance as it is ſaid were yet ſomewhat farther; they had paid for Lands, paid alſo their Taxes, ſerv'd his Majeſty, and all were in a Manner taken from them; indeed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009697_0006_0F778610A1C09060"/>ſome went ſo far as to ſay, that it was given to Savage Indians, who were at this Time rioting in all the Plenty that ſo great and Fertile a Province could afford; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Perfideous Outrages, on the Poor back Inhabitants, their Wives and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs Children. Their Grievances by Information is at length to be laid before the Honourable Governor, and Houſe of Repreſentatives, and undoubtedly from ſo juſt a Conſtitution will receive the juſt Merits of their Cauſe, which we hope in due Time will be made Manifeſt and openly publiſh'd.</p>
            <p>THESE Things are the Effects of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring a Savage Nation, who Wolf-like for theſe many Years have been Murdering and Deſtroying Poor defenceleſs People; and all they had thro' out our Frontiers, and when driven to Extremity for want of Cloathing or Victuals, they then propoſe a Treaty with our People, who generouſly complies with almoſt every Things they ſay and want, then the next Step will be, give them ſome Thouſands of Pounds in Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Arms, Ammunition, and in ſhort every Thing they can ſay that they have
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009697_0007_0F77861175C69A00"/>need of, and when the Renderzvous is over, and the Indians have well Eaten and Drank, they return to their own Country, killing whether Man or Beaſt they meet in their Way, this is the Retaliation the Government who muſt pay all Sums thus expended get in return, ſome may ſay it's a neceſſary Scourge for our Evil; others that it is not a Welcome One, and full of Ingratitude and Deceit.</p>
            <p>MAY <hi>the</hi> GOD <hi>of all Nature direct us as Chriſtians to Humility, walk humbly before him, and to love our Neighbours as ourſelves,</hi> and then undoubtedly will ceaſe all this Tumultuous Factions: <hi>He will ſay to the Fomenting Sea, whoſe Winds are Outrageous, be thou ſtill as the fine gliding Brook, whoſe purling Streams are harmonious to the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Ears, is the earneſt Prayer of your true and affectionate Lover of King and Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. S.</hi> It would be well in this Critical juncture of Things, as the White People moſt in General, hates any Thing that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Name of an Indian; that they were remov'd to their own Country and there ſet down in the moſt Peaceable terms
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009697_0008_0F778612273206F0"/>we could make with them, in hopes for the Future they wou'd reſt ſatisfied, and in their Way, endeavour for an honeſt Living by Hunting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Trade with us in my Opinion, for their Skins and Furrs, wou'd be valuable; and the Heart ſcald that now ſubſiſts among People; chiefly on their Account, wou'd weare away; on the other Hand if they ſhould misbehave; there are Men enough here, and more will be very ſoon here, and be able to follow them into their Towns, and undoubtedly take full Satisfaction, for any Inſults they dare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. If we rightly inform'd, our Mother Country had always ſome Jealouſy of our behaviour one Day or other, and in this Situation of Things, there is a beginning made. SOLOMON ſays; <hi>A rod for the Fools hack,</hi> and we ſhall have it, a ſtanding Army to maintain.</p>
