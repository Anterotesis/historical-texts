            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Hope my collecting in one volume, the following Orations, which were firſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally printed at your requeſt, but many of which have been long ſince not to be purchaſed, will be conſidered in the mild light of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to pleaſe the Public.</p>
                  <p>Americans have been reprehended for not preſerving, with ſufficient care, the various pamphlets and political tracts which this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has afforded during the late war.</p>
                  <p>Many of thoſe productions which appear trite to us who live on the ſpet where they grew, may, however, be conſidered as ſources of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to ſtrangers. Many of theſe Orations have been conſidered as the ſentiments of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, from time to time, touching the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,
<pb facs="unknown:018997_0004_0FA9127DC20ACFD8"/>and as our earlieſt public invectives againſt oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>As the inſtitution of an Oration upon the Eifth of March is now ſuperſeded by the celebration of the anniverſary of Independence upon the Fourth of July, I have given to this volume a general title, which will apply to both inſtitutions: ſo that if hereafter there ſhall be a like volume, containing the Orations of that anniverſary, this may be conſidered the firſt and that the ſecond volume of Boſton Orations.</p>

                  <p>YOUR deſign in the appointment of this ceremony, <hi>my Friends and Fellow-Townſmen,</hi> cannot fail to be examined in quite different lights at this ſeaſon of political diſſention. From the principles I profeſs, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of my common right to judge with others, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it was <hi>decent, wiſe, and honorable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE certainty of being favoured with your kindeſt partiality and candor, in a poor attempt to execute the part to which you have invited me, has overcome the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of my inability to perform it in a proper manner; and I now beg the favour of your animating countenance.</p>
                  <p>THE horrid bloody ſcene we here commemorate, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever were the cauſes which concurred to bring it on that dreadful night, muſt lead the pious and humane, of every order, to ſome ſuitable reflections. The pious will adore
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018997_0006_0FA9127F0DCA0398"/>the conduct of that BEING who is unſearchable in all his ways, and without whoſe knowledge not a ſingle ſparrow falls, in permitting an immortal ſoul to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rried by the flying ball, the meſſenger of death, in the twinkling of an eye, to meet the awful Judge of all its ſecret actions. The humane, from having often thought, with pleaſing rapture, on the endearing ſcenes of ſocial life, in all its amiable relations, will lament, with heart-felt pangs, their ſudden diſſolution, by indiſcretion, rage and vengeance.</p>
                  <p>BUT let us leave that ſhocking cloſe of one continued courſe of rancor and diſpute, from the firſt moment that the troops arrived in town: that courſe will now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by your own reflections to much more ſolid, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful purpoſe, than by any artful language. I hope, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that heaven has yet in ſtore ſuch happineſs for this afflicted town and province, as will in time wear out the memory of all your former troubles.</p>
                  <p>I ſincerely rejoice with you in the happy event of your ſteady and united effort to prevent a ſecond tragedy.</p>
                  <p>OUR fathers left their native land, riſqued all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ſea, and came to this then-ſavage deſart, with that true undaunted courage which is excited by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in GOD. They came that they might here enjoy themſelves, and leave to their poſterity the beſt of earthly portions, full <hi>Engliſh Liberty.</hi> You ſhowed upon the alarming cauſe for tryal, that their brave ſpirit ſtill exiſts in vigor, though their legacy of right is much impaired. The ſympathy and active friendſhip of ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns, upon that ſad occaſion, commands the higheſt gratitude of this.</p>
                  <p>WE have ſeen and felt the ill effects of placing ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forces in the midſt of <hi>populous</hi> communities; but thoſe are only what individuals ſuffer. Your vote directs me to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018997_0007_0FA9127FCC637A70"/>point out the fatal tendency of placing ſuch an order in <hi>free</hi> cities—fatal indeed! <hi>Athens</hi> once was free; a citizen, a favorite of the people, by an artful ſtory, gained a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling guard of fifty men; ambition taught him ways to enlarge that number; he deſtroyed the commonwealth and made himſelf the tyrant of the <hi>Athenians. Caeſar,</hi> by the length of his command in <hi>Gaul,</hi> got the affections of his army, marched to <hi>Rome,</hi> overthrew the ſtate, and made himſelf perpetual dictator. By the ſame inſtruments, many leſs republics have been made to fall a prey to the devouring jaws of tyrants.—But this is a ſubject which ſhould never be diſguiſed with figures; it chuſes the plain ſtile of diſſertation.</p>
                  <p>THE true ſtrength and ſafety of every commonwealth or limited monarchy, is the bravery of its freeholders, its militia. By brave militias they riſe to grandeur, and they come to ruin by a mercenary army. This is founded on hiſtorical facts, and the ſame cauſes will, in ſimilar circumſtances, forever produce the ſame effects. Juſtice <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> in his inimitably clear commentaries, tells us, that "it is extremely dangerous in a land of liberty, to make a diſtinct order of the profeſſion of arms; that ſuch an order is an object of jealouſy; and that <hi>the lows and conſtitution of England are ſtrangers to it.</hi>" One article of the Bill of Rights is, that the raiſing or keeping a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army within the kingdom in a time of peace, unleſs it be with conſent of parliament, is againſt law. The preſent army, therefore, though called the peace <hi>eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is kept up by one act, and governed by another; both of which expire <hi>annually.</hi> This circumſtance is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued as a ſufficient <hi>check</hi> upon the army. A leſs body of troops than is now maintained has, on a time, deſtroyed a King, and fought under a parliament with great ſucceſs and glory; but, upon a motion to diſband them, they turned their maſters out of doors, and fixed others in their ſtead. Such wild things are not again to happen,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018997_0008_0FA91280C0A60018"/>becauſe the parliament have power to ſtop payment once a year: but <hi>arma tenenti quis neget?</hi> which may be eaſily interpreted, "who will bind <hi>Sampſon</hi> with his locks on
<note n="*" place="bottom">Trenchard.</note>?"</p>
                  <p>THE bill which regulates the army, the ſame fine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor I have mentioned, ſays, "is, <hi>in many reſpects, haſtily penned,</hi> and reduces the ſoldier to a ſtate of ſlavery in the midſt of a free nation. This is impolitic: for ſlaves envy the freedom of others, and take a malicious pleaſure in contributing to deſtroy it."</p>
                  <p>BY this ſcandalous bill a juſtice of peace is empowered to grant, <hi>without a previous oath</hi> from the military officer, a warrant to break open any (freeman's) houſe, upon <hi>pretence</hi> of ſearching for deſerters.</p>
                  <p>I MUST not omit to mention one more bad tendency: 'tis this,—a ſtanding force leads to a total neglect of militias, or tends greatly to diſcourage them.</p>
                  <p>YOU ſee the danger of a ſtanding army to the cauſe of freedom. If the <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE declarative vote of the <hi>Britiſh Parliament</hi> is the death-warrant of <hi>our</hi> birthrights, and wants only a Czar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh King to put it into execution. <hi>Here</hi> then a door of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is open. <hi>Great-Britain</hi> may raiſe <hi>her</hi> fleets and

                  </p>
                  <p>A BRAVE nation is always generous. Let us appeal, therefore, at the ſame time, to the generoſity of the PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> before the tribunal
<note n="*" place="bottom">I do not think the <hi>QUO WARRANTO</hi> againſt our firſt charter, was tried in a proper court.</note> of <hi>Europe,</hi> not to envy <hi>us</hi> the full enjoyment of the RIGHTS OF BRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THREN.</p>
                  <p>AND now, <hi>my Friends and Fellow-Townſmen,</hi> having declared myſelf an <hi>American</hi> Son of Liberty of true char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principles: having ſhewn the critical and dangerous ſituation of our birthrights, and the true courſe for ſpeedy redreſs; I ſhall take the freedom to recommend, with boldneſs, one previous ſtep.—Let us ſhow we underſtand the true value of what we are claiming.</p>
                  <p>THE patriotic <hi>Farmer</hi> tells us, "the cauſe of Liberty is a cauſe of too much dignity to be ſullied by turbulence and tumult.—Anger produces anger; and differences, that might be accommodated by kind and reſpectful be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, may, by imprudence, be enlarged to an incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable rage. In quarrels—riſen to a certain height, the firſt cauſe of diſſention is no longer remembered, the minds
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018997_0013_0FA912846E06CE70"/>of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting and reſenting the mutual expreſſions of their diſlike.

A people no longer regard their intereſt, but a gratification of their wrath."</p>
                  <p>WE know ourſelves ſubjects of common LAW: to <hi>that</hi> and the worthy <hi>executors</hi> of it, let us pay a ſteady and conſcientious regard.

                  <p>THE <hi>Right</hi> which impoſes <hi>duties</hi> upon us, is in diſpute: but whether they are managed by a <hi>Surveyor-General,</hi> a <hi>Board of Commiſſioners, Turkiſh Janizaries,</hi> or <hi>Ruſſian Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> let them enjoy, during our time of fair tryal, the common perſonal protection of the laws of our conſtitution.

                  <p>WATCHFUL, hawk-eyed JEALOUSY, ever guards the portal of the temple of the GODDESS LIBERTY. This is known to thoſe who frequent her altars. Our whole conduct therefore, I am ſure, will meet with the utmoſt candor of her VOTARIES: but I am wiſhing we may be able to convert even her baſeſt APOSTATES.</p>
                  <p>WE are SLAVES until we obtain ſuch <hi>redreſs,</hi> through the juſtice of our King, as our happy <hi>conſtitution leads us to expect.</hi> In that condition, let us behave with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and dignity of FREEMEN; and <hi>thus</hi> exhibit to the world, a new character of a people, which no hiſtory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes.</p>

                  <p>WHEN we turn over the hiſtoric page, and trace the riſe and fall of ſtates and empires; the mighty revolutions which have ſo often varied the face of the world ſtrike our minds with ſolemn ſurprize, and we are naturally led to endeavour to ſearch out the cauſes of ſuch aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing changes.</p>
                  <p>THAT man is formed for <hi>ſocial life,</hi> is an obſervation which, upon our firſt enquiry, preſents itſelf immediately to our view, and our reaſon approves that wiſe and generous principle which actuated the firſt founders of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; an inſtitution which hath its origin in the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of individuals, and hath for its end, the <hi>ſtrength and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of all: and ſo long as the means of effecting this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant end are thoroughly known, and religiouſly attended to, government is one of the richeſt bleſſings to mankind, and ought to be held in the higheſt veneration.</p>
                  <p>IN young and new-formed communities, the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this inſtitution, is moſt generally underſtood, and

<note n="*" place="bottom">Omnes ordines ad conſervamdam rempublicam, mente, voluntate, ſtudio, virtute, voce, conſentiunt.</note>, and is equally ready to aſſiſt the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> in the execution of the laws, and the <hi>ſubject</hi> in defence of his right; and ſo long as this noble attachment to a conſtitution, founded on free and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent principles, exiſts in full vigor, in any ſtate, <hi>that</hi> ſtate muſt be flouriſhing and happy.</p>
                  <p>IT was <hi>this</hi> noble attachment to a free conſtitution, which raiſed ancient Rome from the ſmalleſt beginnings, to that bright ſummit of happineſs and glory to which ſhe arrived; and it was the loſs of <hi>this</hi> which plunged her from <hi>that</hi> ſummit, into the black gulph of infamy and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. It was <hi>this</hi> attachment which inſpired her ſenators with wiſdom; it was <hi>this</hi> which glowed in the breaſts of her heroes; it was <hi>this</hi> which guarded her liberties, and extended her dominions, gave peace at home, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect abroad: and when <hi>this</hi> decayed, her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates loſt their reverence for juſtice and the laws, and degenerated into tyrants and oppreſſors—her ſenators, forgetful of their dignity, and ſeduced by baſe corruption, betrayed their country—her ſoldiers, regardleſs of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the community, and urged <hi>only</hi> by the hopes of plunder and rapine, unfeelingly committed the moſt fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant enormities; and hired to the trade of death, with relentleſs fury they perpetrated the moſt cruel murders,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018997_0017_0FA91288C2BC0708"/>whereby the ſtreets of imperial Rome were drenched with her <hi>nobleſt</hi> blood. Thus <hi>this empreſs</hi> of the world loſt her dominions abroad, and her inhabitants, diſſolute in their manners, at length became contented <hi>ſlaves;</hi> and ſhe ſtands to this day, the ſcorn and deriſion of nations, and a monument of this eternal truth, that PUBLIC HAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINESS DEPENDS ON A VIRTUOUS AND UNSHAKEN ATTACHMENT TO A FREE CONSTITUTION.</p>
                  <p>IT was <hi>this</hi> attachment to a conſtitution, founded on free and benevolent principles, which inſpired the firſt ſettlers of this country:—they ſaw with grief the daring outrages committed on the free conſtitution of their native land—they knew that nothing but a civil war could at that time reſtore its priſtine purity. So hard was it to reſolve to embrue their hands in the <hi>blood</hi> of their brethren, that they choſe rather to quit their fair poſſeſſions, and ſeek another habitation in a diſtant clime. When they came to this new world, which they fairly purchaſed of the Indian natives, the only rightful proprietors, they cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the then barren ſoil, by their inceſſant labour, and defended their dear-bought poſſeſſions with the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the chriſtian, and the bravery of the hero.</p>
                  <p>AFTER various ſtruggles, which, during the tyrannic reigns of the houſe of STUART, were conſtantly kept up between right and wrong, between liberty and ſlavery, the connection between Great-Britain and this Colony, was ſettled in the reign of King William and Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by a compact, the conditions of which were expreſſed in a Charter; by which all the liberties and immunities of Britiſh Subjects, were confined to this province, as fully and as abſolutely as they poſſibly could be by any human inſtrument which can be deviſed. And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably true, that the greateſt and moſt important right of a Britiſh ſubject is, that <hi>he ſhall be governed by no laws but thoſe to which he either in perſon or by his repreſentative
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018997_0018_0FA9128999BBB908"/>hath given his conſent:</hi> and this I will venture to aſſert, is the grand baſis of Britiſh freedom; it is interwoven with the conſtitution; and whenever this is loſt, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Britiſh conſtitution</hi> (of which ours is a copy) is a happy compound of the three forms (under ſome of which all governments may be ranged) viz. monarchy, ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, and democracy: of theſe three the <hi>Britiſh Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature</hi> is compoſed, and without the conſent of each branch, nothing can carry with it the force of a law; but when a law is to be paſſed for raſing a tax, that law can origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate only in the democratic branch, which is the Houſe of Commons in Britain, and the Houſe of Repreſentatives here—The reaſon is obvious: they and their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuants are to pay much the largeſt part of it; but as the ariſtrocratic branch, which in Britain, is the houſe of lords, and in this province, the council, are alſo to pay ſome part, THEIR conſent is neceſſary; and as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchic branch, which in Britain is the King, and with us, either the King in perſon, or the Governor whom he ſhall be pleaſed to appoint to act in his ſtead, is ſuppoſed to have a juſt ſenſe of his own intereſt, which is <hi>that</hi> of all the ſubjects in general, HIS conſent is alſo neceſſary, and when the conſent of theſe three branches is obtained, the taxation is moſt certainly legal.</p>
                  <p>LET us now allow ourſelves a few moments to examine the <hi>late acts of the Britiſh parliament for taxing America</hi>— Let us with candor judge whether they are conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally binding upon us:—if they are, IN THE NAME OF JUSTICE let us ſubmit to them, without one murmuring word.</p>
                  <p>FIRST, I would aſk whether the members of the Britiſh Houſe of Commons are the democracy of this province? if they are, they are either the people of this province,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018997_0019_0FA9128A58999798"/>or are elected by the people of this province, to repreſent them, and have therefore a conſtitutional right to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a bill for taxing them: it is moſt certain they are neither; and therefore nothing done by <hi>them</hi> can be ſaid to be done by the democratic branch of our conſtitution. I would next aſk, whether the Lords, who compoſe the ariſtocratic branch of the legiſlature, are Peers of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca? I never heard it was (even in theſe extraordinary times) ſo much as pretended, and if they are not, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no act of <hi>theirs</hi> can be ſaid to be the act of the ariſtocratic branch of our conſtitution. The power of the monarchic branch we with pleaſure acknowledge, reſides in the King, who may act either in perſon or by his repreſentative; and I freely confeſs that I can ſee no reaſon why a PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLAMATION <hi>for raiſing money in America,</hi> iſſued by the King's <hi>ſole</hi> authority, would not be equally conſiſtent with our own conſtitution, and therefore equally binding upon us with the <hi>late acts of the Britiſh parliament for tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us;</hi> for it is plain, that if there is any validity in <hi>thoſe acts,</hi> it muſt ariſe altogether from the monarchical branch of the legiſlature: and I further think that it would be at leaſt as equitable; for I do not conceive it to be of the leaſt importance to us by <hi>whom</hi> our property is taken away, ſo long as it is taken without our conſent; and I am very much at a loſs to know by what figure of rhetoric, the inhabitants of this province can be called FREE SUBJECTS, when they are obliged to obey implicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch laws as are made for them by men three thouſand miles off, whom they know not, and whom they never have empowered to act for them; or how they can be ſaid to have PROPERTY, when a body of men, over whom they have not the leaſt controul, and who are not in any way accountable to them, ſhall oblige them to deliver up any part, or the whole of their ſubſtance, without even aſking their conſent: and yet, whoever pretends that the late acts of the Britiſh parliament for taxing America ought to be deemed binding upon us, muſt admit at once that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018997_0020_0FA9128C6B9F28F8"/>we are abſolute SLAVES, and have no property of our own; or elſe that we may be FREEMEN, and at the ſame time under a neceſſity of obeying the <hi>arbitrary commands of thoſe</hi> over whom we have no controul or influence; and that we may HAVE PROPERTY OF OUR OWN, which is entirely at the diſpoſal of another. Such groſs abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I believe will not be reliſhed in this enlightened age: and it can be no matter of wonder that the people quickly perceived, and ſeriouſly complained of the inroads which theſe acts muſt unavoidably make upon their <hi>liberty,</hi> and of the hazard to which their <hi>whole property</hi> is by <hi>them</hi> expoſed; for, if they may be taxed without their conſent, even in the ſmalleſt trifle, they may alſo, without their conſent, be deprived of every thing they poſſeſs, although never ſo valuable, never ſo dear. Certainly it never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the hearts of our anceſtors, that after ſo many dangers in this then deſolate wilderneſs, their hard-earned proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be at the diſpoſal of the Britiſh parliament; and as it was ſoon foun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE ruinous conſequences of ſtanding armies to free communities, may be ſeen in the hiſtories of SYRACUSE, ROME, and many other once flouriſhing STATES; ſome of which have now ſcarce a name! their baneful influence is moſt ſuddenly felt, when they are placed in populous

That this was the avowed deſign of ſtationing an armed force in this town, is ſufficiently known; and we, my fellow-citizens, have ſeen, WE have felt the tragical effects!—THE FATAL FIFTH OF MARCH, 1770, CAN NEVER BE FORGOTTEN—The horrors of THAT DREADFUL NIGHT are but too deeply impreſſed on our hearts— Language is too feeble to paint the emotions of our ſouls, when our ſtreets were ſtained with the BLOOD OF OUR BRETHREN,—when our ears were wounded by the groans of the <hi>dying,</hi> and our eyes were tormented with the ſight of the mangled bodies of the <hi>dead.</hi>—When our alarmed imagination preſented to our view our houſes wrapt in flames,—our children ſubjected to the barbarous caprice of the raging ſoldiery,—our beauteous virgins expoſed to all the inſolence of unbridled paſſion,—our virtuous wives, endeared to us by every tender tie, falling a ſacrifice to worſe than brutal violence, and perhaps, like the famed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018997_0022_0FA9129032ABE4B0"/>LUCRETIA, diſtracted with anguiſh and deſpait, ending their wretched lives by their own fair hands.—When we beheld the authors of our diſtreſs parading in our ſtreets, or drawn up in a regular <hi>battalia,</hi> as though in a hoſtile city, our hearts beat to arms; we ſnatched our weapons, almoſt reſolved, by one deciſive ſtroke, to avenge the death of our SLAUGHTERED BRETHREN, and to ſecure from future danger, all that we held moſt dear: but propitious heaven forbad the bloody carnage, and ſaved the threatned victims of our too keen reſentment, not by their diſcipline, not by their regular array,—no, it was royal GEORGE's livery that proved their ſhield—it was that which turned the pointed engines of deſtruction from, their breaſts
<note n="*" place="bottom">I have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe that I have mentioned the only circumſtance which ſaved the troops from deſtruction.

The thoughts of vengeance were ſoon buried in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred affection to Great-Britain, and calm reaſon dictated a method of removing the troops more mild than an immediate recourſe to the ſword. With united efforts you urged the immediate departure of the troops from the town—you urged <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>THE immediate actors in the tragedy of THAT NIGHT were ſurrendered to juſtice.—It is not mine to ſay how far they were guilty! they have been tried by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ACQUITTED of murder! and they are not to be again arraigned at an earthly bar: but, ſurely the men who have promiſcuouſly ſcattered <hi>death</hi> amidſt the <hi>innocent</hi> inhabitants of a populous city, ought to ſee well

                  <p>THE infatuation which hath ſeemed, for a number of years, to prevail in the Britiſh councils, with regard to us, is truly aſtoniſhing! what can be propoſed by the repeated attacks made upon our freedom, I really cannot ſurmiſe; even leaving juſtice and humanity out of the queſtion, I do not know one ſingle advantage which can ariſe to the Britiſh nation, from our being enſlaved:—I know not of any gains, which can be wrung from us by oppreſſion, which they may not obtain from us by our own conſent, in the ſmooth channel of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHEN man was unconnected by ſocial obligations; abhorrent to every idea of dependence; actuated by a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018997_0028_0FA912958E3E87B8"/>ferocity of mind, diſplayed in the brutality of his manners, the neceſſary exigences of each individual, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally impelled him to acts of treachery, violence and murder.</p>
                  <p>THE miſeries of mankind thus proclaiming eternal war with their ſpecies, led them, probably, to conſult certain meaſures to arreſt the current of ſuch outrageous enormities.</p>
                  <p>A SENSE of their wants and weakneſs, in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doubtleſs inclined them to ſuch reciprocal aids and ſupport, as eventually eſtabliſhed ſociety.</p>
                  <p>MEN then began to incorporate; ſubordination ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to independence; order to anarchy; and paſſions were diſarmed by civilization: ſociety lent its aid to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the weak from oppreſſion, who wiſely took ſhelter within the ſanctuary of law.</p>
                  <p>ENCREASING ſociety afterwards exacted, that the tacit contract made with her by each individual, at the time of his being incorporated, ſhould receive a more ſolemn form to become authentic and irrefragable; the main object being to add force to the laws, proportionate to the power and extent of the body corporate, whoſe energy they were to direct.</p>
                  <p>THEN <hi>ſociety</hi> availed herſelf of the ſacrifice of that <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> and that <hi>natural equality</hi> of which we are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious: ſuperiors and magiſtrates were appointed, and mankind ſubmitted to a civil and political ſubordination. This is truly a glorious inſpiration of reaſon, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, notwithſtanding the inclination we have for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, we accept controul, for the eſtabliſhment of order.</p>

ALTHOUGH unreſtrained power in one perſon, may have been the firſt and moſt natural recourſe of mankind, from rapine and diſorder; yet all reſtrictions of power, made by laws, or participation of ſovereignty, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent improvements upon what began in unlimited power.</p>
                  <p>IT would ſhock humanity, ſhould I attempt to deſcribe thoſe barbarous and tragic ſcenes, which crimſon the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoric page of this wretched and deteſtable conſtitution, where abſolute dominion is lodged in one perſon: where <hi>one</hi> makes the <hi>whole,</hi> and the <hi>whole</hi> is <hi>nothing.</hi> What motives, what events, could have been able to ſubdue men, endowed with reaſon, to render themſelves the mute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and paſſive objects of the caprice of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual.</p>
                  <p>MANKIND apprized of their privileges, in being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and free, in preſcribing civil laws to themſelves, had ſurely no intention of being enchained by any of their equals; and although they ſubmitted voluntary adherents to certain laws, for the ſake of mutual ſecurity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, they, no doubt, intended by the original compact, a permanent exemption of the ſubject body from any claims, which were not expreſly ſurrendered, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of obtaining the ſecurity and defence of the whole. Can it poſſibly be conceived, that they would voluntarily be enſlaved by a power of their own creation?</p>
                  <p>THE conſtitution of a magiſtrate, does not therefore take away that lawful defence againſt force and injury, allowed by the law of nature; we are not to obey a prince, ruling above the limits of the power entruſted to him; for the commonwealth, by conſtituting a head, does not deprive itſelf of the power of its own preſervation

                  <p>THE attentive gravity; the venerable appearance of this crouded audience; the dignity which I behold in the countenances of ſo many in this great aſſembly; the ſolemnity of the occaſion upon which we have met together, joined to a conſideration of the part I am to take in the important buſineſs of this day, fill me with an awe hitherto unknown; and heighten the ſenſe which I have ever had, of my unworthineſs to fill this ſacred deſk; but, allured by the call of ſome of my reſpected fellow-citizens, with whoſe requeſt it is always my greateſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to comply, I almoſt forgot my want of ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what they required. In this ſituation I find my only ſupport, in aſſuring myſelf that a generous people will not ſeverely cenſure what they know was well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though its want of merit, ſhould prevent their
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018997_0041_0FA912A3EBB70A40"/>being able to applaud it. And I pray, that my ſincere at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the intereſt of my country, and hearty deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every deſign formed againſt her liberties, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as ſome apology for my appearance in this place.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE always, from my earlieſt youth, rejoiced in the felicity of my fellow-men; and have ever conſidered it as the indiſpenſable duty of every member of ſociety to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, as far as in him lies, the proſperity of every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, but more eſpecially of the community to which he belongs; and alſo, as a faithful ſubject of the ſtate, to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to detect, and having detected, ſtrenuouſly to oppoſe every traitorous plot which its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies may deviſe for its deſtruction. Security to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and properties of the governed, is ſo obviouſly the deſign and end of civil government, that to attempt a logical proof of it, would be like burning tapers at noon-day, to aſſiſt the ſun in enlightening the world; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable, to attempt to ſupport a government, of which this is not the great and principal baſis; and it is to the laſt degree vicious and infamous to attempt to ſupport a government, which manifeſtly tends to render the perſons and properties of the governed inſecure. Some boaſt of being <hi>friends to government;</hi> I am a friend to <hi>righteous</hi> government, to a government founded upon the principles of reaſon and juſtice; but I glory in publicly avowing my eternal enmity to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Is the preſent ſyſtem which the Britiſh adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have adopted for the government of the colonies, a righteous government? or is it tyranny?—Here ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to aſk (and would to heaven there could be an anſwer) what tenderneſs, what regard, reſpect or conſideration has <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhewn, in their late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, for the ſecurity of the perſons or properties of the inhabitants of the colonies? or rather, what have they omitted doing to deſtroy that ſecurity? they have dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ared that they have, ever had, and of right ought ever
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018997_0042_0FA912A49A877D18"/>to have, full power to make laws of ſufficient validity to bind the colonies in all caſes whatever: they have exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed this pretended right by impoſing a tax upon us without our conſent; and leſt we ſhould ſhew ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance at parting with our property, her fleets and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſent to enforce their mad pretenſions. The town of Boſton, ever faithful to the Britiſh crown, has been inveſted by a Britiſh fleet: the troops of George the III. have croſs'd the wide atlantick, not to engage an enemy, but to aſſiſt a band of TRAITORS in trampling on the rights and liberties of his moſt loyal ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,—thoſe rights and liberties which, as a father, he ought ever to regard, and as a king, he is bound, in honor, to defend from violations, even at the riſque of his own life.</p>
                  <p>LET not the hiſtory of the illuſtrious houſe of Brunſwick inform poſterity, that a king, deſcended from that glorious monarch George the II. once ſent his Britiſh ſubjects to conquer and enſlave his ſubjects in America; but be perpetual infamy entail'd upon that villain who dared to adviſe his maſter to ſuch execrable meaſures; for it was eaſy to foreſee the conſequences which ſo naturally follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſending troops into America, to enforce obedience to acts of the Britiſh parliament, which neither GOD nor man ever empowered them to make. It was reaſonable to expect that troops, who knew the errand they were ſent upon, would treat the people whom they were to ſubjugate, with a cruelty and haughtineſs, which too often buries the honorable character of a <hi>ſoldier,</hi> in the diſgraceful name of an <hi>unfeeling ruffian.</hi> The troops, upon their firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, took poſſeſſion of our ſenate-houſe, and pointed their cannon againſt the judgment-hall, and even continued them there whilſt the ſupreme court of judicature for this province was actually ſitting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the king's ſubjects. Our ſtreets nightly refounded with the noiſe of riot and debauchery; our peaceful citizens were hourly expoſed to ſhameful inſults,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018997_0043_0FA912A53B176160"/>and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage.— But this was not all: as though they thought it not enough to violate our civil rights, they endeavoured to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges; to viciate our morals, and thereby render us deſerving of deſtruction. Hence the rude din of arms which broke in upon your ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn devotions in your temples, on that day hallowed by heaven, and ſet apart by GOD himſelf for his peculiar worſhip. Hence, impious oaths and blaſphemies ſo often tortur'd your unaccuſtomed ear. Hence, all the arts which idleneſs and luxury could invent, were uſed, to betray our youth of one ſex into extravagance and effeminacy, and of the other to infamy and ruin; and did they not ſucceed but too well? did not a reverence for religion ſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay? did not our infants almoſt learn to liſp out curſes before they knew their horrid import? did not our youth forget they were Americans, and regardleſs of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions of the wiſe and aged, ſervilely copy from their tyrants thoſe vices which finally muſt overthrow the empire of Great-Britain? and muſt I be compelled to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that even the nobleſt, faireſt part of all the lower creation did not entirely eſcape the curſed ſnare? when virtue has once erected her throne within the female breaſt, it is upon ſo ſolid a baſis that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant. But have there not been ſome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I fear there have been ſome ſuch unhappy inſtances; or why have I ſeen an honeſt father cloathed with ſhame; or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears?</p>
                  <p>BUT I forbear, and come reluctantly to the tranſactions of that diſmal night, when in ſuch quick ſucceſſion we felt the extremes of grief, aſtoniſhment and rage; when heaven in anger, for a dreadful moment, ſuffer'd hell to take the
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018997_0044_0FA912A6DA8F3D78"/>reins; when ſatan with his choſen band open'd the ſluices of New-England's blood, and ſacrilegiouſly polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltleſs ſons. Let this ſad tale of death never be told without a tear: let not the heaving boſom ceaſe to burn with a manly indignation at the barbarous ſtory, through the long tracts of future time: let every parent tell the ſhameful ſtory to his liſtening children 'til tears of pity gliſten in their eyes, and boiling paſſion ſhakes their tender frames; and whilſt the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandaemonium, let all America join in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer to heaven, that the inhuman, unprovoked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the fifth of March, 1770, planned by Hillſbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boſton, and executed by the cruel hand of Preſton and his ſanguinary coadjutors, may ever ſtand on hiſtory without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, witheld the ready arm of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance from executing inſtant juſtice on the vile aſſaſſins? perhaps you fear'd promiſcuous carnage might enſue, and that the innocent might ſhare the fate of thoſe who had performed the infernal deed. But were not all guilty? were you not too tender of the lives of thoſe who came to fix a yoke on your necks? but I muſt not too ſeverely blame a fault, which great ſouls only can commit. May that magnificence of ſpirit which ſcorns the low purſuits of malice; may that generous compaſſion which often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from ruin, even a guilty villian, forever actuate the noble boſoms of Americans!—But let not the miſcreant hoſt vainly imagine that we fear'd their arms. No; them we deſpis'd; we dread nothing but ſlavery. Death is the creature of a poltroon's brains; 'tis immortality to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ourſelves for the ſalvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale-faced moon, and the affrighted ſtars that hurried through the ſky, can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we fear not death. Our hearts, which at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, glow with a rage that four revolving years have ſcarcely taught us to reſtrain, can witneſs that we fear not
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018997_0045_0FA912A9C1E25878"/>death; and happy 'tis for thoſe who dared to inſult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an everlaſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maſſachuſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We then expected that the hand of public juſtice would ſoon inflict that puniſhment upon the murderers, which, by the laws of GOD and man, they had incurred. But let the unbiaſs'd pen of a Robertſon, or perhaps of ſome equally fam'd Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations. And though the murderers may eſcape the juſt reſentment of an enraged people; though drowſy juſtice, intoxicated by the poiſonous draught pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for her cup, ſtill nods upon her rotten ſeat, yet be aſſured, ſuch complicated crimes will meet their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers! ye villains high and low! ye wretches who contrived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed! do you not feel the goads and ſtings of conſcious guilt pierce through your ſavage boſoms? though ſome of you may think yourſelves exalted to a height that bids defiance to the arms of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man juſtice, and others ſhroud yourſelves beneath the maſk of hypocracy, and build your hopes of ſafety on the low arts of cunning, chicanery and falſhood; yet, do you not ſometimes feel the knawings of that worm which never dies? do not the injured ſhades of Maverick, Gray, Caldwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in your ſolitary walks, arreſt you even in the midſt of your debaucheries, and fill even your dreams with terror? but if the unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed manes of the dead ſhould not diſturb their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, yet ſurely even your obdurate hearts muſt ſhrink, and your guilty blood muſt chill within your rigid veins, when you behold the miſerable Monk, the wretched victim of your ſavage cruelty. Obſerve his tottering knees which ſcarce ſuſtain his waſted body; look on his hagga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018997_0046_0FA912A9D64B8118"/>unhappy Monk! cut off in the gay morn of manhood, from all the joys which ſweeten life, doom'd to drag on a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exiſtence, without even a hope to taſte the pleaſures of returning health! yet Monk, thou liveſt not in vain; thou liveſt a warning to thy country, which ſympathizes with thee in thy ſufferings; thou liveſt an affecting, an alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance of the unbounded violence which luſt of power, aſſiſted by a ſtanding army, can lead a traitor to commit.</p>
                  <p>FOR us he bled, and now languiſhes. The wounds by which he is tortur'd to a lingering death, were aimed at our country! ſurely the meek-eyed charity can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſuch ſufferings with indifference. Nor can her leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hand forbear to pour oil and wine into theſe wounds; and to aſſuage at leaſt, what it cannot heal.</p>
                  <p>PATRIOTISM is ever united with humanity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. This noble affection which impels us to ſacrifice every thing dear, even life itſelf, to our country, involves in it a common ſympathy and tenderneſs for every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and muſt ever have a <hi>particular feeling</hi> for one who ſuffers in a public cauſe.

We have all one common cauſe; let it therefore be our only conteſt, who ſhall moſt contribute to the ſecurity of the liberties of America. And may the ſame kind providence which has watched over this country from her infant ſtate, ſtill ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to defeat our enemies. I cannot here forbear noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſignal manner in which the deſigns of thoſe who wiſh not well to us have been diſcovered. The dark deeds of a treacherous cabal, have been brought to public view. You now know the ſerpents who, whilſt cheriſhed in your boſoms, were darting their invenom'd ſtings into the vitals of the conſtitution. But the repreſentatives of the people have fixed a mark on thoſe ungrateful monſters, which, though it may not make them ſo ſecure as Cain of old, yet renders them at leaſt as infamous. Indeed it would be affrontive to the tutelar deity of this country even to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair of ſaving it from all the ſnares which human policy can lay.</p>
                  <p>TRUE it is, that the Britiſh miniſtry have annexed a ſalary to the office of the governor of this province, to be paid out of a revenue, raiſed in America, without our conſent. They have attempted to render our courts of juſtice the inſtruments of extending the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of acts of the Britiſh parliament over this colony, by making the judges dependent on the Britiſh adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for their ſupport. But this people will never be enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with their eyes open. The moment they knew that the governor was not ſuch a governor as the charter of the province points out, he loſt his power of hurting them. They were al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:018997_0050_0FA912AEFB609B78"/>
THE courts of judicature alſo ſo far loſt their dignity, by being ſuppoſed to be under an undue influence, that our repreſentatives thought it abſolutely neceſſary to reſolve that they were bound to declare that they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other ſalary beſides that which the general court ſhould grant them; and if they did not make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that it would be the duty of the houſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach them.</p>
                  <p>GREAT expectations were alſo formed from the artful ſcheme of allowing the Eaſt-India company to export tea to America, upon their own account. This certainly, had it ſucceeded, would have effected the purpoſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers, and gratified the moſt ſanguine wiſhes of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. We ſoon ſhould have found our trade in the hands of foreigners, and taxes impoſed on every thing which we conſumed; nor would it have been ſtrange, if, in a few years, a company in London ſhould have purchaſed an excluſive right of trading to America.—But their plot was ſoon diſcovered. The people ſoon were aware of the poiſon which with ſo much craft and ſubtility had been concealed: loſs and diſgrace enſued: and, perhaps, this long-concerted maſter-piece of policy, may iſſue in the toral diſuſe of tea, in this country, which will eventually be the ſaving of the lives and the eſtates of thouſands— yet while we rejoice that the adverſary has not hitherto prevailed againſt us, let us by no means put off the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Reſtleſs malice, and diſappointed ambition, will ſtill ſuggeſt new meaſures to our inveterate <hi>enemies.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let <hi>us</hi> alſo be ready to take the field whenever danger calls; let us be united and ſtrengthen the hands of each other, by promoting a general union among us. Much has been done by the committees of correſpondence for this and the other towns of this province, towards uniting the inhabitants; let them ſtill go on and proſper. Much has been done by the committees of correſpondence, for the houſes of aſſembly: in this and our ſiſter colonies, for
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:018997_0051_0FA912B2C67A9990"/>uniting the inhabitants of the whole continent, for the ſecurity of their common intereſt. May ſucceſs ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their generous endeavours. But permit me here to ſuggeſt a general congreſs of deputies, from the ſeveral houſes of aſſembly, on the continent, as the moſt effectual prethod of eſtabliſhing ſuch an union, as the preſent poſture of our affairs requires. At ſuch a congreſs, a firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation may be laid for the ſecurity of our rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; a ſyſtem may be formed for our common ſafety, by a ſtrict adherence to which, we ſhall be able to fruſtrate any attempts to overthrow our conſtitution; reſtore peace and harmony to America, and ſecure honor and wealth to Great-Britain, even againſt the inclinations of her mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, whoſe duty it is to ſtudy her welfare; and we ſhall alſo free ourſelves from thoſe unmannerly pillagers who impudently tell us, that they are licenced by an act of the Britiſh parliament, to thruſt their dirty hands into the poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of every American. But, I truſt, the happy time will come, when, with the beſom of deſtruction, thoſe noxious vermin will be ſwept forever from the ſtreets of Boſton.</p>
                  <p>SURELY you never will tamely ſuffer this country to be a den of thieves. Remember, my friends, from whom you ſprang —Let not a meanneſs of ſpirit, unknown to thoſe whom you boaſt of as your fathers, excite a thought to the diſhonor of your mothers. I conjure you by all that is dear, by all that is honorable, by all that is ſacred, not only that ye pray, but that you act; that, if neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ye fight, and even die, for the proſperity of our Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. Break in ſunder, with noble diſdain, the bonds with which the Philiſtines have bound you. Suffer not yourſelves to be betrayed by the ſoft arts of luxury and offeminacy, into the pit digged for your deſtruction. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the glare of wealth. That people who pay greater reſpect to a wealthy villain, than to an honeſt upright man in poverty, almoſt deſerve to be enſlaved; they plainly ſhew that wealth, however it may be acquired, is, in their eſteem, to be preferred to virtue.</p>

BUT I thank GOD, that America abounds in men who are ſuperior to all temptation, whom nothing can divert from a ſteady purſuit of the intereſt of their country; who are at once its ornament and ſafe-guard. And ſure I am, I ſhould not incur your diſpleaſure, if I paid a reſpect ſo juſtly due to their much-honoured characters, in this place; but when I name an ADAMS, ſuch a numerous hoſt of fellow-patriots ruſh upon my mind, that I fear it would take up too much of your time, ſhould I attempt to call over the illuſtrious roll: but your grateful hearts will point you to the men; and their revered names, in all ſucceeding times, ſhall grace the annals of America.— From them, let us, my friends, take example; from them let us catch the divine enthuſiaſm; and feel, each for himſelf, the GOD-like pleaſure of diffuſing happineſs on all around us; of delivering the oppreſſed from the iron graſp of tyranny; of changing the hoarſe complaints and bitter moans of wretched ſlaves, into thoſe cheerful ſongs, which freedom and contentment muſt inſpire. There is a heart-felt ſatisfaction in reflecting on our exertions for the public weal, which all the ſufferings an enraged ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant can inflict, will never take away; which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and reproaches of thoſe whom we have ſaved from ruin, cannot rob us of. The virtuous aſſertor of the rights of mankind, merits a reward, which even a want of ſucceſs in his endeavours to ſave his country, the heavieſt misfortune which can befal a genuine patriot, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely prevent him from receiving.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE the moſt animating confidence that the preſent noble ſtruggle for liberty, will terminate gloriouſly for America. And let us play the man for our GOD, and for the cities of our GOD; while we are uſing the means in our power, let us humbly commit our righteous cauſe to the great LORD of the univerſe, who loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity.—And having ſecured the approbation of our hearts, by a faithful and unwearied diſcharge of

THAT perſonal freedom is the natural right of every man; and that property, or an excluſive right to diſpoſe of what he has honeſtly acquired by his own labour, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ariſes therefrom, are truths which common ſenſe has placed beyond the reach of contradiction. And no man, or body of men, can, without being guilty of flagrant injuſtice, claim a right to diſpoſe of the perſons of acquiſitions of any other man or body of men, unleſs it can be proved that ſuch a right has ariſen from ſome compact between the parties in which it has been explicitly and freely granted.</p>
                  <p>IF I may be indulged in taking a retroſpective view of the firſt ſettlement of our country, it will be eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with what degree of juſtice the late parliament of Great-Britain have aſſumed the power of giving away <hi>that property</hi> which the Americans have earned by their labour.</p>
                  <p>OUR fathers having nobly reſolved never to wear the yoke of deſpotiſm, and ſeeing the European world, at that time, through indolence and cowardice, falling a prey to tyranny, bravely threw themſelves upon the boſom of the ocean; determined to find a place in which they might enjoy their freedom, or periſh in the glorious attempt. Approving heaven beheld the favourite ark dancing upon the waves, and graciouſly preſerved it until the choſen families were brought in ſafety to theſe weſtern regions. They found the land ſwarming with ſavages, who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened death with every kind of torture. But ſavages, and death with torture, were far leſs terrible than ſlavery: nothing was ſo much the object of their abhorrence as a tyrant's power: they knew that it was more ſafe to dwell with man in his moſt unpoliſhed ſtate, than in a country where arbitrary power prevails. Even <hi>anarchy itſelf,</hi> that bugbear held up by the tools of power (though truly to be deprecated) is infinitely leſs dangerous to mankind than <hi>arbitrary government.

But <hi>tyranny,</hi> when once eſtabliſhed, entails its curſes on a nation to the lateſt period of time; unleſs ſome daring genius, inſpired by heaven, ſhall, unappalled by danger, bravely form and execute the arduous deſign of reſtoring liberty and life to his enſlaved, murdered country.</p>
                  <p>THE tools of power, in every age, have racked their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions to juſtify the <hi>few</hi> in ſporting with the happineſs of the <hi>many;</hi> and, having found their ſophiſtry too weak to hold mankind in bondage, have impiouſly dared to force religion, the daughter of the king of heaven, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a proſtitute in the ſervice of hell. They taught that princes, honored with the name of chriſtian, might bid defiance to the founder of their faith, might pillage Pagan countries and deluge them with blood, only becauſe they boaſted themſelves to be the diſciples of that teacher who ſtrictly charged his followers to <hi>do to others as they would that others ſhould do unto them.</hi>

                  <p>THIS country, having been diſcovered by an Engliſh ſubject, in the year 1630, was (according to the ſyſtem which the blind ſuperſtition of thoſe time ſupported) deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the property of the crown of England.

                  <p>HAVING become the honeſt proprietors of the ſoil, they immediately applied themſelves to the cultivation of it; and they ſoon beheld the virgin earth teeming with richeſt fruits, a grateful recompence for their unwearied toil. The fields began to wave with repining harveſts, and the late barren wilderneſs was ſeen to bloſſom like the roſe. The ſavage natives ſaw with wonder the delightful change, and quickly formed a ſcheme to obtain <hi>that</hi> by fraud or force, <hi>which</hi> nature meant as the reward of induſtry alone. But the illuſtrious emigrants ſoon convinced the rude invaders, that they were not leſs ready to take the field for battle than for labor; and the inſidious foe was driven from their borders as often as he ventured to diſturb them. The crown of England looked with indifference on the conteſt; our anceſtors were left alone to combat with the natives. Nor is there any reaſon to believe, that it ever was intended by the one party, or expected by the other, that the <hi>grantor</hi> ſhould defend and maintain the <hi>grantees</hi> in the peaceable poſſeſſion of the lands named in the patents. And it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly, from the hiſtory of thoſe times, that neither the prince, nor the people of England, thought themſelves much intereſted in the matter. They had not then any idea of a thouſandth part of thoſe advantages which they ſince <hi>have,</hi> and we are moſt heartily willing they ſhould <hi>ſtill continue</hi> to reap from us.</p>
                  <p>BUT <hi>when,</hi> at an infinite expence of toil and blood, this widely extended continent had been cultivated and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018997_0058_0FA912BDF776A390"/>
                     <hi>when</hi> the hardy adventurers juſtly expected that they and their deſcendants ſhould peaceably have enjoyed the harveſt of thoſe fields which they had ſown, and the fruit of thoſe vineyards which they had planted; this country was <hi>then</hi> thought worthy the attention of the Britiſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; and the only juſtifiable and only ſucceſsful means of rendering the colonies ſerviceable to Britain were adopted. By an intercourſe of friendly offices, the two countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo united in affection, that they thought not of any diſtinct or ſeparate intereſts, they found both countries flouriſhing and happy. Britain ſaw her commerce extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her wealth increaſed; her lands raiſed to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe value; her fleets riding triumphant on the ocean; the terror of her arms ſpreading to every quarter of the globe. The coloniſt found himſelf free, and thought himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure: he dwelt <hi>under his own vine, and under his own fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and had none to make him afraid:</hi> he knew indeed that by purchaſing the manufactures of Great-Britain, he contributed to its greatneſs: he knew that all the wealth that his labor produced centered in Great-Britain: But <hi>that,</hi> far from exciting his envy, filled him with the higheſt pleaſure; <hi>that thought</hi> ſupported him in all his toils.— When the buſineſs of the day was paſt, he ſolaced himſelf with the <hi>contemplation,</hi> or perhaps entertained his liſtening family with the <hi>recital</hi> of ſome great, ſome glorious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action which ſhines conſpicuous in the hiſtory of Britain: or, perhaps, his elevated fancy led him to foretel, with a kind of enthuſiaſtic confidence, the glory, power, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an empire which ſhould extend from one end of the earth to the other: he ſaw, or thought he ſaw, the Britiſh nation riſen to a pitch of grandeur which caſt a veil over the Roman glory, and, raviſhed with the praeview, boaſted a race of Britiſh kings, whoſe names ſhould echo through thoſe realms where Cyras, Alexander, and the Caeſars were unknown; <hi>princes</hi> for whom millions of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubjects redeemed from ſlavery and Pagan ignorance, ſhould, with thankful tongues, offer up their prayers and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018997_0059_0FA912BEEAF9C908"/>praiſes to that tranſcendently great and beneficent being, <hi>by whom Kings reign and Princes decree juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THESE pleaſing connections might have continued; theſe delightſome proſpects might have been every day extended; and even the reveries of the moſt warm imagination might have been realized; but unhappily for us, unhappily for Britain, the madneſs of an avaricious miniſter of ſtate, has drawn a ſable curtain over the charming ſcene, and in its ſtead has brought upon the ſtage, diſcord, envy, hatred, and revenge, with civil war cloſe in their rear.</p>
                  <p>SOME demon, in an evil hour, ſuggeſted to a ſhort-ſighted financier, the hateful project of transfering the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the King's ſubjects in America, to his ſubjects in Britain. The claim of the Britiſh parliament to tax the colonies, can never be ſupported but by ſuch a TRANSFER; for the right of the houſe of commons of Great-Britain, to originate any tax, or grant money, is altogether derived from their being elected by the people of Great-Britain to act for them; and the people of Great-Britain cannot confer on their <hi>repreſentatives</hi> a right to give or grant any thing which <hi>they themſelves</hi> have not a right to give or grant <hi>perſonally.</hi> Therefore it follows, that if the members choſen by the people of Great-Britain, to repreſent them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, have, by virtue of their being ſo choſen, any right to give or grant American property, or to lay any tax upon the lands or perſons of the coloniſts, it is becauſe the lands and people in the colonies are bona fide, owned by, and juſtly belonging to the people of Great-Britain. But (as has been before obſerved) every man has a right to perſonal freedom, conſequently a right to enjoy what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by his own labor. And as it is evident that the property in this country has been acquired by our own labor; it is the duty of the people of Great-Britain, to produce ſome compact in which we have explicitly given up to them a right to diſpoſe of our <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>property.</hi>—
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018997_0060_0FA912C2689D9928"/>Until this is done, every attempt of theirs, or of thoſe whom they have deputed to act for them, to give or grant any part of our property, is directly repugnant to every principle of reaſon and natural juſtice. But I may boldly ſay, that ſuch a compact never exiſted, no, not even in imagination. Nevertheleſs, the repreſentatives of a nation, long famed for juſtice and the exerciſe of every noble vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, have been prevailed on to adopt the fatal ſcheme; and although the dreadful conſequences of this wicked po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy have already ſhaken the empire to its centre; yet ſtill it is perſiſted in. Regardleſs of the voice of reaſon— deaf to the prayers and ſupplications—and unaffected with the flowing tears of ſuffering millions, the Britiſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſtill hug the darling idol; and every rolling year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords freſh inſtances of the abſurd devotion with which they worſhip it. Alas! how has the folly, the diſtraction of the Britiſh councils, blaſted our ſwelling hopes, and ſpread a gloom over this weſtern hemiſphere.</p>
                  <p>THE hearts of Britons and Americans, which lately felt the generous glow of mutual confidence and love, now burn with jealouſly and rage. Though, but of yeſterday, I recollect (deeply affected at the ill-boding change) the happy hours that paſt whilſt Britain and America rejoiced in the proſperity and greatneſs of each other (heaven grant thoſe halcyon days may ſoon return.) But now the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton too often looks on the American with an envious eye, taught to conſider his juſt plea for the enjoyment of his earnings, as the effect of pride and ſtubborn oppoſition to the parent country. Whilſt the American beholds the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton as the ruffian, ready <hi>firſt</hi> to take away his property, and <hi>next,</hi> what is ſtill dearer to every virtuous man, the liberty of his country.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the meaſures of adminiſtration had diſguſted the colonies to the higheſt degree, and the people of Great Britain had, by artifice and falſhood, been irritated againſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:018997_0061_0FA912C282374E78"/>America, an army was ſent over to enforce ſubmiſſion to certain acts of the Britiſh parliament, which reaſon ſcorned to countenance, and which placemen and penſioners were found unable to ſupport.</p>
                  <p>MARTIAL law and the government of a well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated city, are ſo entirely different, that it has always been conſidered as improper to quarter troops in populous cities; frequent diſputes muſt neceſſarily ariſe between the citizen and the ſoldier, even if no previous animoſities ſubſiſt. And it is further certain, from a conſideration of the nature of mankind, as well as from conſtant experience, that ſtanding armies always endanger the liberty of the ſubject. But when the people on the one part, conſidered the army as ſent to enſlave them, and the army on the other, were taught to look on the people as in a ſtate of rebellion, it was but juſt to fear the moſt diſagreeable conſequences. Our fears, we have ſeen, were but too well grounded.</p>
                  <p>THE many injuries offered to the town I paſs over in ſilence. I cannot now mark out the path which led to that unequalled ſcene of horror, the ſad rememberance of which, takes the full poſſeſſion of my ſoul. The ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary theatre again opens itſelf to view. The baleful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of terror croud around me—and diſcontented ghoſts, with hollow groans, appear to ſolemnize the anniverſary of the FIFTH of MARCH.</p>
                  <p>APPROACH we then the melancholy walk of death. Hither let me call the gay companion; here let him drop a farewel tear upon that body which ſo late he ſaw vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and warm with ſocial mirth—hither let me lead the tender mother to weep over her beloved ſon—come widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mourner, here ſatiate thy grief; behold thy murdered huſband gaſping on the ground, and to complete the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhow of wretchedneſs, bring in each hand thy infant
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018997_0062_0FA912C337E4D680"/>children to bewail their father's fate—take heed, ye orphan babes, leſt, whilſt your ſtreaming eyes are fixed upon the ghaſtly corpſe, <hi>your feet ſlide on the ſtones beſpattered with your father's brains</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">After Mr. <hi>Gray</hi> had been ſhot through the body, and had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len dead on the ground, a bayonet was puſhed through his ſkull; part of the bone being broken, his brains fell out upon the pavement.</note>. Enough! this tragedy need not be heightened by an infant weltering in the blood of him that gave it birth. Nature, reluctant, ſhrinks already from the view, and the chilled blood rolls ſlowly backward to its fountain. We wildly ſtare about, and with amazement, aſk, who ſpread this ruin round us? what wretch has dared deface the image of his GOD? has haughty France, or cruel Spain, ſent forth her myrmidons? has the grim ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ruſhed again from the far diſtant wilderneſs? or does ſome fiend, fierce from the depth of hell, with all the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous malice, which the apoſtate damned can feel, twang her deſtructive bow, and hurl her deadly arrows at our breaſt? no; none of theſe—but, how aſtoniſhing! it is the hand of Britain that inflicts the wound. The arms of George, our rightful king, have been employed to ſhed that blood, when juſtice, or the honor of his crown, had called his ſubjects to the field.</p>
                  <p>BUT pity, grief, aſtoniſhment, with all the ſofter movements of the ſoul, muſt now give way to ſtronger paſſions. Say, fellow-citizens, what dreadful thought now ſwells your heaving boſoms—you fly to arms—ſharp indignation flaſhes from each eye—revenge gnaſhes her iron teeth—death grins an hideous ſmile, ſecure to drench his greedy jaws in human gore—whilſt hovering furies darken all the air.</p>
                  <p>BUT ſtop, my bold adventurous countrymen, ſtain not your weapons with the blood of Britons. Attend to reaſon's voice—humanity puts in her claim—and ſues to be again
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:018997_0063_0FA912C727D134F0"/>admitted to her wonted ſeat, the boſom of the brave. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is far beneath the noble mind. Many perhaps, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to rank among the vile aſſaſſins, do, from their in moſt ſouls, deteſt the barbarous action. The winged death, ſhot from your arms, may chance to pierce ſome breaſt that bleeds already for your injured country.</p>
                  <p>THE ſtorm ſubſides—a ſolemn pauſe enſues—you ſpare, upon condition they depart. They go—they quit your city—they no more ſhall give offence.—Thus cloſes the important drama.</p>
                  <p>And could it have been conceived that we again ſhould have ſeen a Britiſh army in our land, ſent to enforce obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to acts of parliament deſtructive of our liberty. But the royal ear, far diſtant from this weſtern world, has been aſſaulted by the tongue of ſlander; and villains, traitorous alike to king and country, have prevail'd upon a gracious prince to cloath his countenance with wrath, and to erect the hoſtile banner againſt a people ever affectionate and loyal to him and his illuſtrious predeceſſors of the houſe of Hanover. Our ſtreets are again filled with armed men: our harbour is crouded with ſhips of war; but theſe cannot intimidate us; our liberty muſt be preſerved; it is far dearer than <hi>life,</hi> we hold it even dear as our <hi>allegiance;</hi> we muſt defend it againſt the attacks of <hi>friends</hi> as well as <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> we cannot ſuffer even BRITONS to raviſh it from us.</p>
                  <p>No longer could we reflect, with generous pride, on the heroic actions of our American fore fathers,—no longer boaſt our origin from that far-famed iſland, whoſe warlike ſons have ſo often drawn their well-tried ſwords to ſave her from the ravages of tyranny; could we, but for a moment, entertain the thought of giving up our liberty. The man who meanly will ſubmit to wear a <hi>ſhackle,</hi> contemns the nobleſt gift of heaven, and impiouſly affronts the GOD that made him free.</p>

IT was a maxim of the Roman people, which eminently conduced to the greatneſs of that ſtate, never to deſpair of the commonwealth. The maxim may prove as ſalutary to us now, as it did to them. Short-ſighted mortals ſee not the numerous links of ſmall and great events, which form the chain on which the fate of kings and nations is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. Eaſe and proſperity (tho' pleaſing for a day) have often ſunk a people into effeminacy and ſloth. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and dangers (tho' we forever ſtrive to ſhun them) have frequently called forth ſuch virtues, as have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the applauſe and reverence of an admiring world. Our country loudly calls you to be circumſpect, vigilant, active and brave. Perhaps (all gracious Heaven avert it) perhaps, the power of Britain, a nation great in war, by ſome malignant influence, may be employed to enſlave you: but let not even this diſcourage you. Her arms, 'tis true, have fill'd the world with terror: her troops have reap'd the laurels of the field: her fleets have rode triumphant on the ſea,—and <hi>when,</hi> or <hi>where,</hi> did <hi>you,</hi> my countrymen, depart inglorious from the field of fight
<note n="*" place="bottom">The patience with which this people have borne the repeated injuries which have been heaped upon them, and their unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take any ſanguinary meaſures, has, very injudiciouſly, been aſcribed to cowardice, by perſons both here and in Great-Britain. I moſt heartily wiſh, that an opinion, ſo erroneous in itſelf, and ſo fatal in its conſequences, might be utterly removed before it be too late: and I think nothing <hi>further</hi> neceſſary to convince every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent man, that the conduct of this people is owing to the <hi>tender regard</hi> which they have for their fellow-men, and an <hi>utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the ſhedding of human blood, than</hi> a little attention to their general temper and diſpoſition, diſcovered when they cannot be ſuppoſed to be under any apprehenſion of danger to themſelves.— I will only mention the univerſal deteſtation which they ſhew to every act of cruelty, by whom and upon whomſoever committed; the mild ſpirit of their laws; the very ſew crimes to which capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal penalties are annexed; and the very great backwardneſs which both courts and juries diſcover, in condemning perſons charged with <hi>capital crimes.—</hi> But if any ſhould think this obſervation not to the purpoſe, I readily appeal to thoſe gentlemen of the army who have been in the camp, or in the field, with the Americans.</note>? <hi>you</hi> too can ſhew the trophies of your <hi>forefather</hi>'s victories and your <hi>own;</hi> can name the fortreſſes and battles you have won; and many of you count the honorable ſcars of wounds received, whilſt fighting for your king and country.</p>
                  <p>WHERE juſtice is the ſtandard, heaven is the warrior's
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018997_0065_0FA912C8787D7CA0"/>ſhield: but conſcious guilt unnerves the arm that lifts the ſword againſt the innocent. Britain, united with theſe colonies, by commerce and affection, by intereſt and blood, may mock the threats of France and Spain: may be the ſeat of univerſal empire. But ſhould America, either by <hi>force,</hi> or thoſe more dangerous engines, <hi>luxury</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> ever be brought into a ſtate of vaſſalage, Britain muſt loſe <hi>her</hi> freedom alſo. No longer ſhall ſhe ſit the <hi>empreſs</hi> of the ſea: her ſhips no more ſhall waft her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders over the wide ocean: the <hi>wreath</hi> ſhall wither on her temples: her weakened arm ſhall be unable to defend her coaſts: and ſhe, at laſt, muſt bow her venerable head to ſome proud foreigner's deſpotic rule.</p>
                  <p>BUT if, from paſt events, we may venture to form a judgment of the future, we juſtly may expect that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of our enemies will but increaſe the triumphs of our country. I <hi>muſt</hi> indulge a hope that <hi>Britain</hi>'s liberty, as well as <hi>ours,</hi> will eventually be preſerved by the virtue of America.</p>
                  <p>THE attempt of the Britiſh parliament to raiſe a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from America, and our denial of their right to do it, have excited an almoſt univerſal inquiry into the rights of mankind in general, and of Britiſh ſubjects in particular; the neceſſary reſult of which muſt be ſuch a liberality of ſentiment, and ſuch a jealouſy of thoſe in power, as will,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018997_0066_0FA912C9343D3310"/>better than an adamantine wall, ſecure us againſt the future approaches of deſpotiſm.</p>
                  <p>THE malice of the <hi>Boſton</hi> port-bill has been defeated in a very conſiderable degree, by giving <hi>you</hi> an opportunity of <hi>deſerving,</hi> and <hi>our brethren</hi> in this and our ſiſter-colonies an opportunity of <hi>beſtowing,</hi> thoſe benefactions which have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted your friends and aſtoniſhed your enemies, not only in America, but in Europe alſo. And what is more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtill, the ſympathetic feelings for a brother in diſtreſs, and the grateful emotions excited in the breaſt of him who finds relief, muſt forever endear each to the other, and form thoſe indiſſoluble bonds of friendſhip and affection, on which the preſervation of our rights ſo evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
                  <p>THE mutilation of our charter, has made every other colony jealous for its own; for <hi>this,</hi> if once ſubmitted to by us, would ſet on float the property and government of every Britiſh ſettlement upon the continent. If charters are not deemed ſacred, how miſerably precarious is every thing founded upon them.</p>
                  <p>EVEN the ſending troops to put theſe acts in execution, is not without advantages to us. The exactneſs and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their diſcipline inſpire our youth with ardor in the purſuit of military knowledge. Charles the <hi>invincible,</hi> taught Peter the <hi>great,</hi> the art of war. The battle of Pultowa convinced Charles of the proficiency Peter had made.</p>
                  <p>OUR country is in danger, but not to be deſpaired of. Our enemies are numerous and powerful—but we have many friends, determining to BE FREE, and heaven and earth will aid the RESOLUTION. On <hi>you</hi> depend the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of America. <hi>You</hi> are to decide the important queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on which reſt the happineſs and liberty of millions
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018997_0067_0FA912CBC2D207D8"/>yet unborn. Act worthy of yourſelves. The faltering tongue of hoary age calls on you to ſupport your country. The liſping infant raiſes its ſuppliant hands, imploring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the monſter ſlavery. Your fathers look from their celeſtial ſeats with ſmiling approbation on their ſons, who boldly ſtand forth in the cauſe of virtue; but ſternly frown upon the inhuman miſcreant, who, to ſecure the loaves and fiſhes to himſelf, would breed a ſerpent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his children.</p>
                  <p>BUT, pardon me, my fellow-citizens, I know you want not zeal or fortitude. You will maintain your rights or periſh in the generous ſtruggle. However difficult the combat, you never will decline it when freedom is the prize. An independence on Great-Britain is not our aim. No, our wiſh is, that Britain and the colonies may, like the oak and ivy, grow and increaſe in ſtrength together. But whilſt the infatuated plan of making one part of the empire ſlaves to the other, is perſiſted in; the intereſt and ſafety of <hi>Britain,</hi> as well as the <hi>colonies,</hi> require that the wiſe meaſures, recommended by the honourable the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental congreſs, be ſteadily purſued; whereby the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conteſt between a parent honoured, and a child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, may probably be brought to ſuch an iſſue, as that the peace and happineſs of both may be eſtabliſhed upon a laſting baſis. But if theſe pacific meaſures are ineffectual, and it appears that the only way to ſafety, is through fields of blood, I know you will not turn your faces from your foes, but will, undauntedly, preſs forward, until tyranny is trodden under foot, and you have fixed your adored goddeſs LIBERTY, faſt by a BRUNSWICK's ſide, on the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican throne.</p>
                  <p>YOU <hi>then,</hi> who nobly have eſpouſed your country's cauſe, who generouſly have ſacrificed wealth and eaſe—<hi>who</hi> have deſpiſed the pomp and ſhew of tinſeled greatneſs—refuſed the ſummons to the feſtive board—been deaf to the alluring
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018997_0068_0FA912CFDA95EC68"/>calls of luxury and mirth—<hi>who</hi> have forſaken the downy pillow, to keep your vigils by the midnight lamp, for the ſalvation of your invaded country, that you might break the fowler's ſnare, and diſappoint the vulture of his prey; <hi>you</hi> then will reap that harveſt of renown which you ſo juſtly have deſerved. Your country ſhall pay her grateful tribute of applauſe. Even the children of your moſt inveterate enemies, aſhamed to tell from whom they ſprang, while they, in ſecret, curſe their ſtupid, cruel parents, ſhall join the general voice of gratitude to thoſe who broke the fetters which their father's forged.</p>
                  <p>HAVING redeemed your country, and ſecured the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to future generations, <hi>who,</hi> fired by your example, ſhall emulate your virtues, and learn from <hi>you</hi> the heavenly art of making millions happy; with heart-felt joy—with tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports all your own, YOU CRY, the GLORIOUS WORK IS DONE.

                  <p>WHEN the ambition of princes induces them to break over the ſacred barriers of ſocial compact, and to violate thoſe rights, which it is their duty to defend, they will leave no methods uneſſayed to bring the people to acquieſce in their unjuſtifiable encroachments.</p>
                  <p>IN this cauſe, the pens of venal authors have, in every age, been drawn: with Machiavelian ſubtilty, they have laboured to perſuade mankind, that their public happineſs conſiſted in being ſubject to uncontrouled power; that they were incapable of judging concerning the myſteries of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that it was their intereſt to deliver their eſtates, their liberties, and their lives, into the hands of an abſolute monarch.</p>

MITRED hypocrites, and cringing, baſe-fouled prieſts, have impiouſly dared to enliſt the oracles of GOD into the ſervice of deſpotiſm; to aſſert that, by the command of the ſupreme law-giver, we are bound to ſurrender our rights into the hands of the firſt bold tyrant who dares to ſeize them; and that when they are ſo ſeized, it is rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt GOD, and treaſon againſt the prince, for us to attempt to reſume them.</p>
                  <p>DEPRAVED as is the human underſtanding, it hath yet ſtrength enough to diſcern the ridiculous fallacy of theſe aſſertions: the votaries of ignorance and ſuperſtition may, indeed, be impoſed upon by them. When we place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited confidence in our civil or ſpiritual fathers, we can ſwallow, with eaſe, the moſt improbable dogmas: but there are feelings in the human heart, which compel men to recognize their own rights—to venerate the majeſty of the people—and to deſpiſe the inſult which is offered to their underſtandings, by theſe doating abſurdities. Had princes no other methods to accompliſh their purpoſes, could they not eſtabliſh their uſurpation, without convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing mens judgments of their utility? they would be more harmleſs to mankind than they have ever yet been. They might be ſurrounded with the faſcinating gewgaws of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal pomp; a few paraſites might bow the knee before theſe idols of their own creating; the weak and the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might obey their mandates; but the baneful influence which they now have upon the intereſts of individuals, and of ſociety, would come to a period: they would not revel in the ſpoils of nations, nor trample upon the ruins of public liberty.</p>
                  <p>CONSCIOUS of this, they have uſed arguments, and purſued methods, entirely different from theſe, to effect their deſigns; inſtead of convincing the underſtandings, they have addreſſed themſelves to the paſſions of men: the arts of bribery and corruption have been tried with a fatal
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:018997_0071_0FA912D182EBB610"/>ſucceſs: men, <hi>we</hi> know, have ſold their children, their country, and their GOD, for a ſmall quantity of painted dirt, <hi>which will periſh with the uſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>EXTENSIVE as are the revenues of princes, they are ſtill inadequate to the purpoſe of bribing large communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to ſubmit to their pleaſure; corrupting therefore a few, they have overawed the reſt; from ſmall beginnings, and under ſpecious pretenſes, they will raiſe a ſtanding military force, the moſt ſucceſsful engine ever yet weilded by the hand of lawleſs domination.</p>
                  <p>WITH ſuch a force, it is eaſy for an ambitious prince, poſſeſſed by nature of very ſlender abilities, to ſubvert every principle of liberty in the conſtitution of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to render his people the moſt abject of ſlaves: if any individual feels the injury done to his country, and wiſhes to reſtore it to a ſtate of happineſs, with a bayonet at his breaſt, a dragoon will compel him to ſilence: if the people, awakened to ſee their intereſt and their duty, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble for the ſame purpoſe, a military force is at hand to ſubdue them, and by leaden arguments, to convince them of their error.</p>
                  <p>AN eaſy taſk would it be to enlarge upon the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of keeping up ſuch a ſtanding army in time of peace, and of quartering a lawleſs body of men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the juſt reſtraints of civil authority, in free and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous cities: that no veſtige of freedom can remain in a ſtate where ſuch a force exiſted: that the morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will be gradually corrupted: that they will contract ſuch an habit of tame ſubmiſſion, as to become an eaſy prey to the brutal tyrant who rules them, hath been here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore largely and plainly demonſtrated, by perſons ſo much more capable of doing it, than he who is ſpeaking, that it would be preſumption in him to attempt it now.</p>

THERE is no need of recurring to the ancient hiſtories of Greece and Rome, for inſtances of theſe truths. The Britiſh nation, once famous for its attachment to freedom, and enthuſiaſtically jealous of its rights, is now become a great tame beaſt, which fetches and carries for any mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter who pleaſes to employ it.</p>
                  <p>ENGLISHMEN have been wont to boaſt of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of their conſtitution; to boaſt that it contained whatever was excellent in every form of government hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, by the wit of man, deviſed: in their king, whoſe power was limited, they have aſſerted that they enjoyed the advantages of monarchy, without fear of its evils: while their houſe of commons, choſen by the ſuffrages of the people, and dependant upon them, repreſented a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, their houſe of peers, forming a balance of power between the king and the people, gave them the benefit of an ariſtocracy. In theory, the Britiſh conſtitution is, on many accounts, excellent; but when we obſerve it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to practice, when we obſerve the Britiſh government, as it has been, for a long courſe of years, adminiſtered, we muſt be convinced that its boaſted advantages are not real: the management of the public revenue, the appointment of civil and military officers, are veſted in the king: improving theſe advantages which theſe powers give him, he hath found means to corrupt the other branches of the legiſlature; Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons pleaſe themſelves with the thought of being free; their tyrant ſuffers them to enjoy the ſhadow, whilſt he himſelf graſps the ſubſtance of power. Impoſſible would it have been for the kings of England to have acquired ſuch an exorbitant power, had they not had a ſtanding army under their command: with the officers of this army, they have bribed men to ſacrifice the rights of their country: having artfully got their arms out of the hands of the people, with their mercenary forces they have awed them into ſubmiſſion. When they have appeared, at any time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to aſſert their freedom, theſe troops have been ready
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018997_0073_0FA912D30546FF78"/>to obey the mandates of their ſovereign, to imbrue their hands in the blood of their brethren.</p>
                  <p>HAVING found the efficacy of this method to quell a ſpirit of liberty in the people of Great-Britain, the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> adminiſtration of the <hi>righteous</hi> king George the third, determined to try the experiment upon the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. To fright us into ſubmiſſion to their unjuſtifiable claims, they ſent a military force to the town of Boſton. This day leads us to reflect upon the fatal effects of the meaſure! by their intercourſe with troops, made up in general of the moſt abandoned of men, the morals of our youth were corrupted: the temples and the day of our GOD were ſcandalouſly prophaned: we experienced the moſt provoking inſults; and at length ſaw the ſtreets of Boſton ſtrewed with the corpſes of five of its inhabitants, murdered in cool blood, by the Britiſh mercenaries.</p>
                  <p>THE indignant rage which ſwelled your boſoms upon this occaſion—the fortitude and humanity which you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered—the anguiſh of the friends and relatives of the dead and wounded, with all the horrors of that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable night, have been painted in vivid colours by an HANCOCK and a WARREN: they have ſhewn the neceſſity of thoſe exertions made by the town, which defeated, at that time, the deſigns of the enemies to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican liberty, and preſerved us, for the preſent, from the calamities of war.</p>
                  <p>BUT the paſt year hath preſented us with a tragedy more ſtriking, becauſe more extenſive, than this: a tragedy, which more plainly proves the fatal effects of keeping up ſtanding armies in time of peace, than any arguments whatſoever: we have ſeen the ground crimſoned with the gore of hundreds of our fellow-citizens;—we have ſeen the firſt city in America, for wealth and extent, depopulated—
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018997_0074_0FA912D510123E18"/>—we have ſeen others deſtroyed, and heard our ſavage enemies breathing out thirſtings for our blood.</p>
                  <p>FINDING their arts inſufficient to flatter, or their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to bribe, the people of America out of their freedom, the Britiſh government determined, by force, to ſubjugate them to their arbitrary will; in conſequence of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, a large party of their troops marched from Boſton, on the morning of the ever-memorable nineteenth of April laſt: fluſhed with the hopes of certain victory, and defying the armies of the living GOD, they broke through every divine and political obligation; they wantoned in cruelty; they ſhed again American blood.</p>
                  <p>AROUSED by the unprovoked injury, like a lion awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his ſlumber, we ſprang to arms! we felt ourſelves inſpired with the ſpirit of our anceſtors; we heard our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren's blood crying to us for vengeance; we ruſhed into the midſt of battle: we compelled our enemies to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to diſgraceful flight; we purſued them with avidity, and deſiſted not till they took refuge in that city, of which, by fraud and treachery, they had poſſeſſed themſelves.</p>
                  <p>TRUSTING to the divine protection, from that hour we determined never to ſheathe the ſword, till we had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for our injuries; till we had ſecured our own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and the freedom of our poſterity: from that hour the den of enemies hath been ſurrounded by an American army, <hi>brave and determined:</hi> although they had before boaſted of their ſuperiority to all the troops in the world, they have ſcarcely dared to ſet their feet out of their ſtrong holds ſince that time; and inſtead of ravaging the American continent in a ſingle compaign, with a ſingle regiment, they have proceeded—<hi>one mile and an half</hi> in the conqueſt of it.</p>
                  <p>THE heights of Charleſtown witneſſed to the world, that Americans, fighting in the cauſe of freedom, were a
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018997_0075_0FA912D59DA45548"/>formidable foe: although they were ſurrounded by troops hitherto deemed invincible; although they ſaw the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations of their countrymen inveloped with flames; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though cannon roared on every quarter, and they beheld ſcenes of deſolation and bloodſhed, to which they were entirely unuſed, yet they retired not till they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled their enemy twice to retreat, and had expended the whole of their ammunition: the Britiſh forces gained the ground, but they loſt the flower of their army.</p>
                  <p>FROM one end of the continent to the other, a ſeries of ſucceſſes hath attended the American arms; inſtead of having troops of ſavages poured down to our frontiers (which the murderous policy of the tyrant of Britain induced him to attempt) we have, through the favour of heaven, carried our victorious arms into the very bowels of Canada; inſtead of having our ſtores and proviſions cut off by the enemy, we have made important captures from them: ſucceſs hath crowned our enterprizes, while diſappointment hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thoſe who oppoſe us.</p>
                  <p>THAT elation of ſpirit, which is excited by our victories, is damped by our feeling the calamities of war.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:018997_0076_0FA912D5F8241DB8"/>and eſteem! this audience, acquainted, in the moſt intimate manner, with his numberleſs virtues, muſt feel his loſs, and bemoan their beloved, their entruſted fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizen! ah! my countrymen, what tender, what excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating ſenſations ruſh at once upon our burdened minds, when we recall his lov'd idea! when we reflect upon the manner of his death; when we fancy that we ſee his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage enemies exulting o'er his corps, beautiful even in death; when we remember that, deſtitute of the rites of ſepulture, he was caſt into the ground, without the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction due to his rank and merit; we cannot reſtrain the ſtarting tear, we cannot repreſs the burſting ſigh! we mourn thine exit, illuſtrious ſhade, with undiſſembled grief; we venerate thine exalted character; we will erect a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument to thy memory in each of our grateful breaſts, and to the lateſt ages, will teach our tender infants to liſp the name of WARREN, with veneration and applauſe!</p>
                  <p>WHEN we traverſe the Canadian wilds, and come to the plains of Abraham, where WOLFE once fell, we are there again compelled to pay a tribute to exalted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and to lament the fall of the great MONTGOMERY! warmed with a ſpirit of patriotiſm, too little felt by his venal countrymen, he eſpouſed the cauſe of American free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: he left domeſtic eaſe and affluence: he girded on the ſword which he had long laid aſide, and <hi>jeoparded his life in the high places of the field:</hi> victory followed his ſtandard; ſhe hovered over his head, and crowned it with the laurel wreath: ſhe was juſt ready to hail him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of <hi>Canada,</hi> when the fatal ſiſters ſnapped, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the thread of life, and ſeized, from his eager graſp, the untaſted conqueſt!

THE tender feelings of the human heart are deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the fate of theſe and the other heroes who have bled and died, that their country may be free: but at the ſame time, ſenſations of indignant wrath, are excited in the breaſt of every friend to freedom: he will liſten to the voice of their blood, which cries aloud to heaven, and to him for vengeance! he will feel himſelf animated with new vigor in the glorious cauſe: nothing daunted by their untimely fate, he will ruſh into the midſt of danger, that he may ſhare their glory, and avenge their death! every idea which can warm and animate him to glorious deeds, will ruſh at once upon his mind; and, when engaged in the warmeſt battle, he will hear them, from their heaven, urging him to action; he will feel their ſpirits transfuſed into his breaſt; he will ſacrifice whole hecatombs of their murderers to their illuſtrious <hi>manes!</hi>

Formidable as was once the power of the Britiſh lion, he hath now loſt his teeth; univerſal diſſipation hath taken place of that ſimplicity of manners, and hardineſs of integrity, for which the nation was once remarkable: the officers of the Britiſh army, inſtead of inuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to diſcipline, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The legiſlature of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is totally corrupt; her adminiſtration is arbitrary and tyrannical; the people have loſt their ſpirit of reſentment; and, like the moſt contemptible of animals, <hi>how the ſhoulder to bear and become ſervants unto tribute.</hi> The national reſources are cut off; ſhe is loaded with an intolerable public dept; ſhe is become the ſcorn of thoſe foreigners, to whom ſhe was once terrible; and it is eaſy to ſee that her glory is in the wane.</p>
                  <p>How different from this is the preſent ſtate of our

Their ſtateſmen are equal to the taſk of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and defending a free and extenſive empire: their generals are brave and humane, intrepid and prudent. When I name a WASHINGTON, my audience will feel the juſtice of the remark, and acquit me of the charge of flattery.</p>

With determined bravery, let us reſiſt the attacks of her impudent raviſhers; by reſolution and firmneſs we may defend her from their power, and tranſmit her bleſſings to millions upon millions of our poſterity.

Marius, in new modelling the legions, and replacing the citizens who ſerved in them with foreign mercenaries, laid the horrid foundation.—The door was now open for one <hi>too powerful citizen</hi> after another, until <hi>Caeſar,</hi> loſing every check, and laughing at the impotent anathemas of the ſenate, with the diſtant legious march'd to Rome, and formed a new aera in their hiſtory. From this period we are charmed no more with illuſtrious actions, and the laſt remains of dignity, ſunk in the Roman world. So true is it, that when a people loſe their liberty, they at once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fit ſubjects of every thing baſe and infamous.</p>
                  <p>WE have thus far produced inſtances of the fatal effects of armies thus kept up, which have ended in the utter ſubverſion of the laws and government of two of the moſt memorable republics in antient ſtory. We will now ſhift the ſcene, and while we ſhow their dangerous tendency in ſtates of a more modern date, we will exhibit an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous example through what ſcenes of danger, hardſhips and blood, the determined ſpirit of honor, and attachment to freedom, will carry a people.</p>
                  <p>PREVIOUS to mentioning the ſituation <hi>of</hi> the <hi>United
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:018997_0098_0FA9118A979B0F70"/>Provintes,</hi> I muſt remark how very ſimilar their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were to our's. We ſhall ever find it an unalterable maxim of princes, who in time of peace kept up a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force, however they may call them the <hi>protectors of law,</hi> the end is <hi>to ſubvert</hi> thoſe laws and render the conſtitution uſeleſs. Such was the mode of conduct of <hi>Philip the ſecond,</hi> of Spain, to the low countries, and ſuch the procedure of a ſimilar character, <hi>George the third,</hi> of Britain, influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by as deſpicable a miniſtry. The former, as ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple obſerves, "thinking it not agreeing with his greatneſs," (an army being now in the bowels of their country) "to conſider their diſcontents, or be limited by their antient forms of government," proceeds to deſpiſe the one and overturn the other. New courts judicatory were appointed, new offices eſtabliſhed, <hi>depending abſolutely on the king.</hi>

                  <p>WHAT was the conſequence?—could it be ſuppoſed a generous people would ſit down tamely, and kiſs the rod that laſh'd them? a different mode of conduct enſued.— The duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was ſent with a powerful army, the very forcible plea of tyrants, and the moſt ſhocking cruelties were committed. Here let humanity ſpread her veil, nor let the tender breaſt heave with anguiſh at ſuch ſcenes. But ſhocking as they are, they flow as naturally from this curſed engine of oppreſſion, as beams of light from the ſun. For as the ſame ſenſible writer obſerves, "So great antipathy ever appears between citizens and ſoldiers; while one <hi>pretends to be ſafe</hi> under law, which the other pretends <hi>ſhall be ſubject</hi> to his ſword and his will."</p>
                  <p>But terrible as the many executions of their moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious patriots appeared to them, while the land was dreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its richeſt blood—however affecting the ſight of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcations,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:018997_0099_0FA9118F72028550"/>impriſonments, and the numberleſs cruelties that attended them, they were not daunted. That GOD who hateth oppreſſion, and delighteth in the happineſs of his creation, inſpired them with ſentiments, that carried them through innumerable hardſhips, 'till after having expended immenſe treaſures and blood for better than threeſcore years, they laid the foundation of a rich, free, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing people: Providence hereby giving an inſtructive leſſon to poſterity in every age, who are contending for all that is dear and ſacred, to purſue the glorious object un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted; knowing that, as liberty is a plant tranſplanted from the gardens of heavens, its divine parent will ſtill che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, and, in ſpite of oppoſition, it will flouriſh, it will live forever.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="unknown:018997_0101_0FA9119439500EE0"/>more directly affect other nations; and however we may pity the unhappy ſufferer, there is a kind of pleaſure we feel that we ourſelves are not immediately intereſted. And would to GOD, it had ever remained ſo. O my country! with what heart-felt ſatisfaction, ſhould I rejoice, if op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion had never ſtretched her baleful wings to this once happy clime! that that liberty which an illuſtrious ſet of men, of whom the world was not worthy, purchaſed at ſo dear a rate, might have deſcended unimpaired to lateſt poſterity. But is this the caſe? has this ſcourge of mankind, ſtanding armies, never interrupted our proſperity? if ſo, why is this deſk hung with the ſable covering of death! why am I ſurrounded by ſo many of my fellow-citizens, who liſten to the tale of woe! yes, my countrymen, we ourſelves are deeply intereſted; and this ſame engine of oppreſſion, which has thrown mighty republics from their foundations, has attempted and ſtill continues to ſpread the ſame horrid conſequences in America: and in its uſual mode of conduct, has been attended with every ſpecies of cruelty, ſome of them unheard of before; but which your firmneſs, under GOD, has hitherto, and I pray ever may, ſurmount.</p>
                  <p>THE ſhocking ſcene of that dreadful night, the fatal effects of which we are now ſtill weeping over, is beyond deſcription. No one, perhaps, if it is taken in every view, that was not a ſpectator, can conceive it. When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many inſults, abuſes and violences, this unhappy town was expoſed to for months previous to this melancholy tragedy, and when the tumult of contrary paſſions was thus naturally excited, to ſee a brutal ſoldiery, ſcattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous death through a defenceleſs, unarmed multitude, till yonder ſtreet was crimſoned with the blood of its ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, while a tender mother, frantic with grief, pours forth the anguiſh of her heart over a beloved ſon, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any returns of gratitude; all this exhibits a ſcene which the diſtreſſed heart may painfully feel, but
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:018997_0102_0FA91194595E4340"/>which the tongue cannot expreſs. Let the breaſt, then, ſtill continue to beat. Theſe, my friends, are virtuous, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous feelings, and do honor to humanity. May we ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. May this inſtitution, ſacred to the memory of our murdered brethren, be ever carefully preſerved. Yes, ye injured ſhades! we will ſtill weep over you, and if any thing can be more ſoothing, WE WILL REVENGE YOU.</p>
                  <p>THIS glaring ſpecimen of cruelty rouſed the citizens, and in convincing colors diſplayed the effects of ſtanding armies in time of peace. But however our exertions were then ſucceſsful, however the ſtorm ſubſided, it was but temporary. While the ſcales of juſtice were held in palſied hands, and the moſt ſhocking barbarities were the higheſt merit, an additional force only was neceſſary. That ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, the maſk was thrown off, and a ſtill greater ſcene of carnage and deſtruction, opened in our adjacent villages.</p>
                  <p>BUT ſuch proceedings, however alarming at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, were ſoon loſt in more dreadful and diſtreſſing ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. The heights of Charleſtown too awfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us of the melancholy truth, and poſterity, while with tears of compaſſion, they ponder the tranſactions of that day, muſt execrate the cauſes which produced them. In any ſituation, the relics of ſlaughtered citizens are objects of pity, and the ſympathizing ſpectator will ever drop a tear over them. But there may be inſtances, when the leſſer ſtreams of affection are abforbed in a ſtill greater ſea of woe. Such are the ſentiments that muſt ſtrike every breaſt, when we reflect, illuſtrious WARREN! on thy death—a death, which whole hecatombs of ſlaughtered enemies, ſtrowed around thy corpſe, can never repay. Here, ye minions of power! ye who are dead to the calls of honor and public virtue, are willing to wade to ſtation, through the blood of your brethren, here behold a ſpectacle that muſt harrow your inmoſt ſoul. You, my countrymen, with the moſt pleaſing ſenſations, have attentively liſtened, while, like us,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:018997_0103_0FA9119503D1B4F8"/>he was weeping over the unhappy fate of others. You have kindled into rage, while he has ſet before you the dangerous nature and conſequences of ſtanding armies, and prophetically pointed out to you ſtill greater events. How affecting! that he who could lament the fate of others, muſt be himſelf deplored; and that he who could ſo feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly paint the effects of this horrid meaſure, muſt himſelf fall one of the firſt ſacrifices to it.</p>
                  <p>BUT it is not ſufficient to drop a tranſient tear to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of departed heroes, or to pay an eulogy to their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. The happineſs of ſuch men, who, after having expired in the arms of liberty and virtue, are now ſharing the higheſt degree of felicity, cannot be increaſed by our praiſes: no, my friends, the beſt way to expreſs our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſuch great and good men, is to rouſe and revenge them. To hurl ſtill fiercer bolts of vengeance on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human ſoldiery, who, inſtead of affording the laſt honors, ſacred to the dead, and which a generous enemy will ever regard.—after grinning with heiliſh pleaſure on the mangled corpſe, which alive could ſtrike terror into their bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>ARE not ſuch inſtances, my countrymen, very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proofs of the fatal effects of ſtanding armies, in time of peace. In ſuch a period they originated, and from the fifth of March 1770, through every degree of violence and barbarity, to the preſent day, it is but one connected ſcene.</p>
                  <p>AFTER ſuch exhibitions of cruelty and carnage, what can we ſuppoſe too brutal, too infamous for ſuch an army? can we wonder to ſee our houſes in flames? our altars raſed to the ground, or converted to a much more horrid uſe,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:018997_0104_0FA91195CD925998"/>than the Jewiſh temple? if poſſible they have even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and the armies of Britain ſeem to be held up as a ſtanding evidence, how far the ſpirit of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion can operate.</p>
                  <p>WE ſhudder when the faithful page of hiſtory opens to our view the conduct of armies, fluſhed with victory, ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns, burning villages, and perpetrating murders, with all the other dreadful concomitants. But if we look into the conduct of the Britiſh army in the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> and ſome part of the ſtate of <hi>New-York,</hi> we ſhall find inſtances of all theſe crimes, and, perhaps, in ſome places, inſtances beyond them. To ſee the third city in a neighbouring ſtate, wantonly conſumed by an enemy, who not having ſpirit or ability, to meet us in the field, deſcend to theſe little mean methods of exciting terror—to ſee the ravages in the <hi>Jerſies,</hi> and the garden of America thus wantonly defaced—does not the blood beat high!—do we not preſs forward to exterminate ſuch barbarians from the face of the earth! but to mention ſtill greater ſcenes of cruelty—does not the ear tingle when it hears the ſhrieks of helpleſs vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, dreadful victims to luſt and barbarity; while the grey hairs and expreſſive groans of an aged parent, witneſs to his daughter's ſhame, plead in vain. Can any thing ſwell this complicated ſcene of woe? it <hi>can</hi> receive addition. Theſe monſters exceed even the moſt barbarous nations. With them the aſhes of the dead have ever been ſacred. But under the patronage of a Britiſh tyrant and his general, ſnuſſing the tainted gale, they have ranſacked the ſilent repoſitories, and the remains of one that was once amiable and captivating, flung about as food for the birds of the air

Can we then wiſh a re-union with ſuch a people? can we ever familiarly ſhake hands with a nation, who, leaping every barrier, are thus wantonly ſporting with our diſtreſſes, and bathing themſelves in the blood of our countrymen? may America never retain ſuch mean, daſtardly ſentiments! for my own part, if I may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, I would entreat, I would conjure every one, who as a parent feels for the welfare of his poſterity, to imitate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the renowned Carthagenian

                  <p>No one, I think, can ſuppoſe theſe thoughts proceed from rage or paſſion. They are the cool dictates of my heart. I love my country; her diſtreſſes affect me; nor, from this moment, do I ever wiſh a reconciliation with a

                  <p>I HAVE now, my countrymen, endeavored to exhibit the fatal effects of ſtanding armies in time of peace; not from abſtract reaſoning, but as they exiſt in fact, and now prevail in our diſtreſſed land. Here I would remark, that it is ſtanding armies in <hi>time of peace,</hi> and the <hi>conſequences</hi> thence reſulting, that we are now deprecating. Armies, in defence of our country, unjuſtly invaded, are neceſſary, and in the higheſt ſenſe juſtifiable. We, my friends, attacked by an arbitrary tyrant, under the ſanction of a force, the effects of which, we have attempted to illuſtrate, have been obliged to make the laſt ſolemn appeal. And I cannot but feel a pleaſing kind of tranſport, when I ſee America, undaunted by the many trying ſcenes that have attended her, ſtill baffling the efforts of the moſt formidable power in Europe, and exhibiting an inſtance, unknown in hiſtory. To ſee an army of veterans, who had fought and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in different quarters of the globe—headed by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tutored in the field of war, illuſtrious by former victories, and fluſhed with repeated ſucceſſes, threatning, with all the pomp of expreſſion, to ſpread havock, deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ruin around him; to ſee ſuch a ſoldiery and ſuch a general, yielding to an hardy race of men, new to the field of war; while on the one hand it exalts the character of the latter, convincingly proves the folly of thoſe, who, under pretence of having a body of troops, bred to war, and ever ready for action, adopt this dangerous ſyſtem, in ſubverſion of every principle of lawful government. Here, if after having depictured ſcenes of ſo diſtreſſing a nature, it may not appear too deſcending, I could not forbear ſmiling at the Britiſh general and his troops, who not willing to reflect on their preſent humiliating condition, affect the air of arrogant ſuperiority. But Americans have learnt them, that men, fighting on the principles of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and honor, deſpiſe the examples that have been ſet
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:018997_0107_0FA9119868F3F2A0"/>them by an enemy; and though, in the field, they can brave every danger in defence of thoſe principles, to a vanquiſhed enemy they know how to be generous; but that this is a generoſity not weak and unmeaning, but founded on juſt ſentiments, and if wantonly preſumed upon, will never interfere with that national juſtice, which ever ought, and lately has been properly exerted.</p>
                  <p>BUT while, with the warmeſt gratitude to heaven, we view our late ſucceſſes, and are at a loſs to expreſs our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to the illuſtrious hero, who was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtument, and whoſe name, to remoteſt ages, will be ever dear to theſe New-England ſtates, let us not forget our ſituation. There is an army, and a very powerful one, ſtill exiſting in the heart of America. Methinks the reputation of paſt ſucceſſes ſhould animate every inhabitant of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to fly to arms; and by one general exertion utterly expel this laſt, this only remaining power of Great-Britain on the continent. Ye, to whom the ſacred, the important ſyſtem of government is committed—ye men of ſenſe and virtue—ye patriots, who feel an affection for your country and poſterity, let me conjure you to ſeize the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, happier than we could ever have expected, and which once omitted may never be again in our power.</p>
                  <p>I WOULD not pretend to inſinuate, that this is the <hi>only</hi> point which ought to be under <hi>immediate</hi> conſideration, by a wiſe people or their <hi>delegates.</hi> But this I will venture to affirm, that unleſs this is the <hi>governing ſentiment,</hi> in every deliberation, every other thing is ſuperfluous. Let us then riſe ſuperior to every private local attachment. As we are embarked on one broad bottom of univerſal freedom, let us attend to this moſt preſſing occaſion; an occaſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially offered for future ſecurity and happineſs. If a royal army, tho' weak in its number, can thus inſult us unpuniſhed, the moſt ſlender imagination can eaſily foreſee what muſt be the effects of a ſtill greater force. I wiſh that
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:018997_0108_0FA9119DA57D3E88"/>the preſent generation, I wiſh that poſterity may not feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reproach our inactivity.</p>
                  <p>SHALL the frequent calls of our EXALTED GENERAL, who ſeems to have been raiſed up by heaven, to ſhow to what an height humanity may ſoar; who generouſly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing affluence and domeſtic eaſe, wiſhes to ſhare with you in every danger and diſtreſs, ſhall his frequent calls be in vain? remember, my countrymen, the eyes of the good and great, in every clime, are upon the preſent conteſt. Liberty, diſguſted at ſcenes of cruelty and oppreſſion, has left her ancient altars, and is now hovering to fix her laſt reſidence in America. Our exertions have hitherto been great and ſucceſsful. Let not the aſhes of WARREN, MONTGOMERY, and the illuſtrious roll of heroes, who died for freedom, reproach our inactivity and want of ſpirit, in not <hi>compleating</hi> this grand ſuperſtructure; the pillars of which have been cemented with the richeſt blood of America. May that ſame ardor, which has rendered America famous, ſtill continue, and looking forward to thoſe happy days of liberty and peace, which our poſterity ſhall enjoy, let us exalt at the thought, that future generations, while they reap the glorious fruits of our ſtruggles, will riſe up and call us bleſſed.</p>

                  <p>"THAT man was born to delude and be deluded; to believe whatever is taught, and bear whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is impoſed;" are political dogmas which have long afforded matter for exultation and ſecurity to dignified villains, from the ſceptered tyrant, to the meaneſt minion of power. But however confirmed they may have been, by the paſſive conduct of the greateſt part of mankind, you, my fellow-citizens, thank GOD, you are an exception to their truth. The numerous, the reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſembly which now croud this hallowed temple, are an exalted exception to maxims as diſgraceful as they are general. Ever vigilantly attentive to the ſacred, unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of man; equally ſtudious in the glorious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of liberty as intrepidly determined to preſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:018997_0110_0FA911A29E50B248"/>the ineſtimable previleges ſhe beſtows; you are now convened, not merely to commemorate this anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, but ſolemnly to renew the reſolves, which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wiſdom, virtue, honor inſpire: and not barely to reſolve, but I truſt, ſteadily to purſue the execution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions which have reſulted from deliberate inveſtigation and full conviction.</p>
                  <p>To ſo intelligent, ſo well informed an auditory, it muſt be unneceſſary to deduce the origin of civil ſociety, which founded in reciprocal advantage, and ſpringing from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial virtue, on the combined neceſſities and aſſiſtance of individuals built the general happineſs—a happineſs thus inſtituted, nothing but public ſpirit, and a union of force and of council can preſerve: I muſt therefore requeſt your indulgence whilſt I rather point out thoſe evils which the concurrent experience of ages and nations prove to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of every good propoſed from civil compact. Little ſolicitous of rhetorical applauſe, I ſhall offer you my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as they ariſe warm from a heart devoted to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of this my parent country, in language that becomes a freeman to uſe when addreſſing a free aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>SIMILAR cauſes will forever operate like effects in the political, moral, and phyſical world: thoſe vices which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the illuſtrious republics of Greece, and the mighty commonwealth of Rome, and which are now ruining Great-Britain, ſo late the firſt kingdom of Europe, muſt eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally overturn every State, where their deleterious influence is ſuffered to prevail. Need I add that luxury, corruption, and ſtanding armies are thoſe deſtructive efficients?</p>
                  <p>LUXURY, no ſooner finds admittance into a ſtate than ſhe becomes the parent of innumerable evils, public and domeſtic; her contagious influence is ſoon felt in ſociety, and her baneful effects diſcovered by a general diſſipation of manners and a declenſion of private virtue, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:018997_0111_0FA911A34DBB6D38"/>effeminate habits, and by a natural gradation a baſe pliability of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>LUXURY is ever the foe of independence, for at the ſame time that it creates artificial wants it precludes the means of ſatisfying them. It firſt makes men neceſſitous, and then dependant. It firſt unfits men for patriotic ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and ſoon teaches them to conſider <hi>public virtue as a public jeſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AT ſuch a period, corruption finds an eaſy acceſs to mens' hearts. To the promotion of intereſted purſuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wiſhes, a ready ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is made of the general good at the ſhrine of power. Then ſlumbers that virtuous jealouſy of public men and public meaſures, which was wont to ſcrutinize not only actions but motives: then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the conſtitution. Every day new inroads are made upon pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of reſiſtance decreaſes. Thus before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, ſhe muſt be fitted for ſlavery by her vices.</p>
                  <p>GENERALLY, but not always, for we have known a people ruled by a deſpot, who, from a private ſtation, roſe to uncontroled dominion, at a time when they were ſternly virtuous. And this mode of introducing bondage is ever to be apprehended at the cloſe of a ſucceſsful ſtruggle for liberty, when a triumphant army, elated with victories, and headed by a popular General, may become more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable than the tyrant that has been expelled. Witneſs the laſt century in the Engliſh hiſtory! witneſs the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring CROMWELL!</p>
                  <p>THIS audacious citizen, intruſted by his country with

With theſe mercenary aſſociates at his heels, he appeared in the ſynod of the State, and dared with force diſplace the moſt glorious band of patriots that ever led a tyrant from his throne to a ſcaffold. Not content with this enormous outrage upon the conſtitution, this annihilating ſtroke upon the tottering liberties of his country, for a time, to keep up the form of a popular government and to bring parliament into contempt, he convened an houſe of commons, conſtituted entirely of his own creatures. They met, and in a few months diſcovered that they were utterly unequal to the poſts they were raiſed to, they therefore petitioned their maſter to diſſolve them. Cromwell granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and became ſole tyrant of three kingdoms. Tyrant —for of what conſequence is it by what ſtyle or under what modification deſpotiſm operates to the public wrong— dictator, king, protector, it is not the appellation we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, though even that we ſhould guard againſt, but the thing. Who but muſt own that Cromwell, under the name of protector, was as abſolute a deſpot as he could have been with any other title?</p>

                  <p>IN a limited monarchy, where the prince as ſupreme ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive magiſtrate, and firſt branch of the legiſlature, is inveſted with the important prerogative of making peace and war; is conſtituted the ſole fountain of honor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the excluſive diſpoſer of every lucrative and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable appointment, civil, eccleſiaſtic, and military; his influence becomes too enormous to be compatible with the public liberty: but if to ſuch extravagant powers (by a fatal error in the conſtitution, placed in the hands of the prince) he ſhould ſuperadd a deteſtable ſyſtem of corruption to bribe the repreſentatives of the people (a ſyſtem which, during the reign of his preſent Britannic majeſty, hath been urged to its utmoſt poſſible extent) the worſt ſpecies of vaſſalage muſt enſue. That equipoiſe between the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective branches of the legiſlature (in which the ſeeming, the theoretic excellence of the Engliſh conſtitution conſiſts) will be totally deſtroyed; the executive will involve the powers of the legiſlative, and whilſt the letter and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:018997_0118_0FA911AD26B5CE28"/>of the conſtitution are retained, its ſpirit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment will be totally loſt. An <hi>abſolutely arbitrary,</hi> with the forms of a <hi>free</hi> government (that worſt and ſureſt of all tyrannies) will gradually ſucceed and be finally eſtabliſhed, unleſs a total revolution is happily effected by the timely exertions of the people, before the deſpot has ſtrengthened himſelf with a mercenary army, and forever cloſed their chains.</p>
                  <p>BUT this tyranny is already eſtabliſhed in Great-Britain, for what hopes can Britons entertain of effecting a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, whilſt the crown, by the multiplicity of gifts in its power, can maintain an infamous majority in each houſe of parliament, to legalize, and a ſtanding army to enforce its projects, however imperious, inhuman or unjuſt.

                  <p>IN 1764 the plan for raiſing a revenue from this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was reſolved on by the Britiſh miniſtry, and THEIR ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious parliament were inſtructed to paſs an act for that purpoſe. Not content with having for a century directed the entire commerce of America, and centered its profits in their own iſland; thereby deriving from the colonies every ſubſtantial advantage which the ſituation and tranſmarine diſtance of the country could afford them: not content with appointing the principal officers in the different go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, while the king had a negative upon every law that was enacted: not content with our ſupporting the whole charge of our municipal eſtabliſhments, although their own creatures held the chief poſts therein: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with laying external duties upon our mutilated and ſhackled commerce, they, by this ſtatute, attempted to rob us of even the curtailed property, the hard-earned peculium which ſtill remained to us—to create a revenue for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a fleet and army, in reality to overawe and ſecure our ſubjection, not (as they inſidiouſly pretended) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect our trade, or defend our frontiers; the firſt of which they annoyed, and the latter deſerted.</p>
                  <p>AFTER repealing this imperious edict, <hi>not</hi> becauſe it was unjuſt in principle, <hi>but</hi> inexpedient in exerciſe, they proceeded to declare, by a public act of the whole legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that we had no property but what was at their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and that Americans, in future, were to hold their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges and lives ſolely on the tenure of the good will and pleaſure of a Britiſh parliament. Acts ſoon followed cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to this righteous determination, which, not
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:018997_0121_0FA911B2454B9F10"/>quadrating with American ideas of right, juſtice and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a fleet and army were ſent to give them that force, which laws receive when promulgated from the mouths of cannon, or at the points of bayonets.</p>
                  <p>WE then firſt ſaw our harbour crowded with hoſtile ſhips, our ſtreets with ſoldiers—ſoldiers accuſtomed to conſider military proweſs as the ſtandard of excellence, and vain of the ſplended pomp attendant on regular armies, they contemptuouſly looked down on our peaceful orders of citizens.

MAN is formed with a conſtitution wonderfully adapted for ſocial converſe and connection. Scarcely uſhered into the world, but his wants teach him his inability, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to provide for them. Wrapt in aſtoniſhment, with an anxiety inexpreſſible, the ſolitary exiſtant looks around for the aid of ſome friendly neighbour, and ſhould he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance meet the deſired object; ſhould he find one, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with intellectual faculties, beſet with the ſame wants and weakneſſes, and in all reſpects the very image of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhould he find him with a heart open to mutual kind offices, and a hand ſtretched out to beſtow a proportion of his labor, with a boſom glowing with gratitude, his ſoul is on the wing to expreſs the ſenſe he entertains of the generous obligation.</p>
                  <p>A CONFIDENCE is eſtabliſhed between him and his benefactor, they fwear perpetual friendſhip, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact for mutual protection and aſſiſtance becomes imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably conſented to. Thus doubly armed, together they purſue their morning route to ſatisfy thoſe demands only which nature reminds them of, and while the ingenuity of the one is exerciſed to enſnare, the ſtrength of the other is, perhaps, employed to ſubdue their vigorous opponent.</p>
                  <p>THEIR little family ſoon encreaſes, and as their ſocial ring becomes gradually enlarged, their obligations to each other are equally circular. Honeſt induſtry early teaches them that a part only is ſufficient to provide for the whole, and that a portion of their time may be ſpared to cull the conveniences as well as appeaſe the wants of nature. Property and perſonal ſecurity appear to be among the firſt objects of their attention, and acknowledged merit receives the unanimous ſuffrage to preſide guardian over the rights and privileges of their infant ſociety. The advantages derived are in a moment experienced. Their little policy, erected upon the broad baſis of equality, they know of no ſuperiority but that which virtue and the love of the whole
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:018997_0125_0FA911B548081B48"/>demands; and while, with chearfulneſs, they entruſt to his care a certain part of their natural rights, to ſecure the remainder, the agreement is mutual, and the obligation upon his part equally ſolemn and binding to reſign them back, either at the inſtance and requeſt of their ſovereign pleaſure, or whenſoever the end ſhould be perverted for which he received them.</p>
                  <p>INTEGRITY of heart, benevolence of diſpoſition, the love of freedom and public ſpirit, are conſpicuous excellencies in this ſelect neighbourhood. Lawleſs ambition is without a friend, and the inſinuating profeſſional pleas of tyrants, ever accompanied by the magnificence and ſplendor of luxury

It was this that raiſed <hi>America</hi> from being the haunt of the ſavage, and the dwelling-place of the beaſt, to her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of civilization and opulence: it was this that hath ſupported her under the ſevereſt tryals: it was this that
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:018997_0129_0FA911C0A917B6E0"/>taught her ſons to fight, to conquer and to die in ſupport of freedom and its bleſſings; and what is it, but this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of liberty, that has induced you, my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citizens, to attend on this ſolemn occaſion, again to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the ſtreams of ſenſibility, and to liſten with ſo much attention and candor to one of the youngeſt of your fellow-citizens, whoſe youth and inability plead powerfully againſt him, while the annual tribute is paid to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of thoſe departed citizens, who fell the firſt ſacrifices to arbitrary power. Check not ſuch generous feelings. They are the fruits of virtue and humanity, and while the obligations you remain under to thoſe unhappy men, lead you to ſhed the ſympathetic tear, to dwell with pleaſure upon their memories, and execrate the cauſes of their death, remember that you can never repay them. Ever bear it in your minds, that ſo implicit was the confidence you willingly placed in that country, that owed to you her affection, that notwithſtanding the introduction of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human weapon of tyrants into the very heart of your peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful villages, you ſtill would fain rely on their deceitful aſſertions, and paint the deformed monſter to your ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations as the miniſter of peace and protection.

                  <p>PATRIOTISM is a virtue which will ever be univerſally admired, even by thoſe incapable of poſſeſſing it. Its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects are equally viſible in individuals as in ſtates, and if we beſtow a moment's reflection upon the heroes of antiquity, who have been deſervedly celebrated by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations, both for their abilities and conduct, we ſhall find that the true ſource of their greatneſs was this ſpirit of freedom, and their inviolable attachment to the intereſt of their country.</p>
                  <p>WITH an attentive ſilence we liſten to the hiſtorian while he relates to us the integrity of conduct, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible courage, the earneſt glow of ſoul, and the ardent love of liberty which was exhibited in the lives of thoſe illuſtrious men, and ſo great were their virtues that we are ſcarce able to credit them, but as the dreams of fancy, or the fictions of the ingenious.</p>
                  <p>IT is recorded of the celebrated Timoleon
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin.</note>, general of Corinth, that notwithſtanding he was bleſt with a temper ſingularly humane, and with feelings that were ever rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the miſeries of his fellow-men, he loved his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo paſſionately, that after making uſe of every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:018997_0131_0FA911C20899B8A0"/>in his power to convince an elder brother of his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for attempting to become the tyrant of it, he devoted him to death; a brother on whom he had previouſly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his affection, and whoſe life being expoſed to the fire of an enemy in a ſevere battle, he had before ſaved at the great riſque of his own. Even in old age, after a period of rigid retirement for twenty years, we are attracted by the diſintereſted conduct of this exalted patriot.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the Syracuſians, groaning under every ſpecies of cruelty, which luſt, avarice and ambition could inflict, ſupplicated their generous neighbours for aſſiſtance, to alleviate thoſe miſeries they themſelves had been expoſed to. Timoleon, urged to accept the command of the Corinthian auxiliaries, at firſt heſitated, his age, his manners, his private happineſs and the endearments of his family forbid it; but ſenſible that he was but a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the community, and ſtung by the cries of innocence, his inclinations were but of trivial moment in competition with his duty.</p>
                  <p>VIEW him at the head of his choſen army, aſſembled to plead the cauſe of ſuffering virtue. In poſſeſſion of arms and of power, if inclined to pervert them, are his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples changed with his ſtation? are his thoughts bept on conqueſt or on death? or does he entertain a ſecret wiſh to ſeize the moment of confidence, and build his greatneſs upon the ruin of the diſtreſſed, to remove one tyrant to reinſtate another? no, but fired with a generous glow of foul, fired with the manly ſentiments of freedom, with an implacable hatred to oppreſſion of all kinds, he marches his troops to the deliverance of his afflicted people, and with a firmneſs becoming ſoldiers, fighting under the ſtandard of liberty, after a ſeries of fatigue and toil, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing marches and fierce conflicts, he dethrones the tyrant, and is proclaimed the deliverer of Syracuſe.—Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored tranquility to this unhappy country, repeopled their
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:018997_0132_0FA911C2C7B52118"/>cities, revived their laws, and diſpenſed juſtice to all ranks and claſſes, he reſigned his command, and retreated once again to the private walks of life, accompanied with the grateful acknowledgments of millions as the patron of their liberty and the ſaviour of their country.—Happy man! endowed with ſuch a noble ſoul, prone to feel for the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and rejoice in the happineſs of his fellow-creatures.</p>
                  <p>BUT why need we reſort to diſtant ages to furniſh us with iſtances of the effects of patriotiſm upon individuals? will not the preſent day afford at leaſt one illuſtrious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to our purpoſe? yes, my fellow-countrymen, AME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICA, young AMERICA too, can boaſt her patriots and heroes, men who have ſaved their country by their virtues, whoſe characters poſterity will admire, and with a pleaſed attention, liſten on tiptoe to the ſtory of their glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions.

Nimrod commenced his prelude to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Fame was clamorous with the deeds of death.— Liberty heared and trembled—conſidered herſelf an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and has, on many times ſince, travelled up and down the world, forlorn, forſaken, majeſty in rags. Nor will ſhe, <hi>perhaps,</hi> until the millenium comes, if America does not now retain her, ever command that complete and <hi>permanent</hi> homage which is ſuitable to her nature. The old repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics may have been the moſt perfect ſeats of her reſidence while they laſted, and are often muſtered up from the tomb of empire to witneſs the adoration which they paid her. But even there ſhe received ſo frequent violence that the continuance of her reign was for the moſt part precarious; and when even at the ſummit of her glory, ſhe was only elevated that her fall might be more aſtoniſhing. Having paſſed all the degrees of fortune, thank GOD ſhe has found her way to theſe remote ſhores: and, if from effects we may judge, ſhe is well pleaſed with her new abode. O cheriſh the divine inhabitant! O let her not return to the courts above with a ſtory that ſhall fire the heavens againſt us—that <hi>ſhe</hi> had bleſſings for us, but that <hi>we</hi> were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them—that ſhe could find among us no laſting habitation; but that, like the dove after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, ſhe was ſcarce favoured with the top of ſome friendly mountain for a melancholy moment.</p>
                  <p>LIBERTY, my friends, is a palladium to the place of her dwelling, a rock and a ſure defence. Wherever ſhe is, every man has ſomething to protect. He knows what are his riches, and that while he liveth himſelf ſhall gather them. He views, with conſcious joy, his circumſtances. His ſocial affections ſhoot out and flouriſh. Even his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices are a ſource of ſatisfaction, and among them local attachment, a fault which leads to the ſide of patriotiſm.</p>
                  <p>SUPPORTED by and tenacious of theſe fruits of liberty,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:018997_0142_0FA911D28C599730"/>ſome little free ſtates, which the geographer in his map had <hi>otherways</hi> never noticed, have long ſtood uninjured by change, and ſome of them inacceſſible by the greateſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of power. There is now, in a diſtant quarter of the globe, a living illuſtration of this remark. Situate upon a venerable pile of rocks, in Italy, ſtands the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of St. Marino. It was founded by a holy man whoſe name it bears, and who fled to this romantic fairy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to enjoy religion and free air, unpurſued by power and the reſtleſs ſpirit of the world. His example was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the pious, the humane, and the lovers of freedom. And theſe, a favourite few, who were before ſcattered up and down through other parts of Italy; who had lived all their days under arbitrary rule, and whom nature had ſecretly taught that there was ſomewhere a happier inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for man—theſe hurried away to the ſnowy top of St. Marino: and having there firſt taſted thoſe rights which come down from GOD, made it their <hi>life</hi>'s <hi>labor</hi> to ſupport and hand them down in purity. There every man finds his proſperity in ſubmitting to thoſe laws which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe equality. There every man fee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So ſtands a conſtitution informed with the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of liberty. It has ſo ſtood, while other neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtates have been blackened and defaced with frequent revolution. And we propheſy that 'till the approach of ſome unforeſeen vice—till ſome degeneracy unknown to the fires creep upon the ſons, St. Marino muſt ſtand admired: as, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I conceive that the "moſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown" columns and broken arches of thoſe once-renowned empires are full with inſtruction as were the groves of Lyceum or the ſchool of Plato. Let Greece then be the ſubject of a moment's reflection. When liberty fled from the gloom of Egypt, ſhe ſought out and ſettled at infant Greece—there diſſeminated the ſeeds of greatneſs—there laid the ground-work of republican glory. Simplicity of manners, piety to the gods, generoſity and courage were her earlieſt character. "Human nature ſhot wild and free

Her maxims were drawn from nature, and one was "that nothing which bore the name of Greek was born for ſlavery." From this idea flowed an aſſiſtance to her ſiſter ſtates. From a like idea in her ſiſter ſtates that friendſhip was returned in grateful meaſure. This, had it continued, would have formed the link of empire, the charm that would have united and made Greece invulnerable.

The banners <hi>late</hi> of conquering freedom now adorn the triumphs of oppreſſion. Thoſe ſtates which lately ſtood in mighty concert, invincible, now breathe mutual jealouſy and fall piece-meal a prey to the common enemy. Attic wiſdom, Theban hardihood, Spartan valor, would not combine to ſave her. That very army, which Greece had bred and nouriſhed to reduce the oriental pride, is turned vulture upon her own vitals—a damnable parricide, the faction of a tyrant. Behold the great and GOD-like Greece, with all her battlements and towers about her, borne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from her giddy height—the ſhame, the pity of the world.</p>
                  <p>HAVING attempted ſome general ſketches of liberty, from the dawn of ſocial life to the fall of national glory, I would be ſomewhat more particular upon thoſe qualities to which her triumphs are chiefly indebted.</p>
                  <p>IN the vile oeconomy of depraved man, there appears an inclination to beſtow upon one part power and affluence, and to impoſe upon the other debility and woe. When that inclination is gratified, the majority being ſlaves, the remains of freedom are ſhared among the great; like the triumphal bridge at the Archipelago, ſo ſtrangely dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, by a decree of ſenate, none of the vulgar were ſuffered to enjoy it. When that inclination is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balanced by the laws; when the true intereſts of both thoſe parts are reconciled; when ſociety is conſidered as "a public combination for private protection
<note n="*" place="bottom">Earlo Abingdon.</note>,"—and the governed find their happineſs in their ſubmiſſion— there is the eſſence of all-powerful liberty. Not to wire-draw a ſentiment already graven upon the hearts of this audience, it is ſuch a liberty, as that every man who has once taſted it, becomes a temporary ſoldier,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:018997_0147_0FA911DE2D133AF8"/>as ſoon as it is invaded and reſents any violence offered it, as an attack upon his life—hence it is that, in free ſtates, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> there is no ſuch thing as a perpetual ſtanding army. For the whole body of the people, ever ready, flock to the general ſtandard upon emergency, and ſo preclude the uſe of that infernal engine. I ſay <hi>infernal</hi> engine, for the tongue "<hi>labors,</hi> and is at a loſs to expreſs," the hideous and frightful conſequences that flow wherever the powers of hell have procured its introduction. Turkey and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers are the delight of its vengeance. Denmark, once over-ſwarmed with the brave inhabitants of the north, has ſuffered depopulation, poverty, and the heavieſt bondage, from the quartering troops amongſt their peaſants in time of peace: <hi>if it can be called peace,</hi> when robbery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration, and murder are let looſe upon the ſons of men. Indeed, it is ſaid that no nation ever kept up an army in time of peace that did not loſe its liberties. I believe it. Athens, Corinth, Syracuſe, and Greece in general were all overturned by that tremendous power: and the ſame power has been long operating with other cauſes to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the creſt of Britain. Let us hear a paſſage from Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant! "If (ſays he, ſpeaking of ſtanding armies) if they who believed this eagle in the air frighted all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards liberty; if they who heretofore thought ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in time of peace, and our freedom inconſiſtent; if the ſame men ſhould throw off a whig principle ſo funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and thus come to clothe themſelves with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted garments of the tories, and if all that has been here diſcourſed on ſhould happen, then will the conſtitution of this country be utterly ſubverted

                  <p>THAT ſtanding mercenary troops muſt ſooner or later entail ſervitude and miſery upon their employers, is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth that appears from the nature of things.

The provocations of that night muſt be numbered among the maſter-ſprings which gave the firſt motion to a vaſt machinery, a noble and comprehenſive ſyſtem of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional independence. "The independence of America," ſays the writer under the ſignature of common ſenſe, "ſhould have been conſidered as dating its aera from the firſt muſquet that was fired againſt her."

From that night revolution became inevitable, and the occaſion commenced of the preſent moſt beautiful form of government. We often read of the original contract, and of mankind, in the early ages, paſſing from a ſtate of nature to immediate civilization.

AND yet the people of Maſſachuſetts have reduced to practice the wonderful theory. A numerous people have convened in a ſtate of nature, and, like <hi>our ideas</hi> of the patriarchs, have deputed a few fathers of the land to draw up for them a glorious covenant. It has been drawn. The people have ſigned it with rapture, and have, thereby, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, among themſelves, an eaſy degree of obedience for the higheſt poſſible civil happineſs. To render that covenant eternal, patriotiſm and political virtue muſt forever blaze— muſt blaze at the <hi>preſent day</hi> with ſuperlative luſtre; being watched, from <hi>different motives,</hi> by the eyes of all mankind. Nor muſt that patriotiſm be contracted to a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. A combination of the ſtates is requiſite to ſupport them individually. "Unite or die" is our indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable motto. Every ſtep from it is a ſtep nearer to the region of death. This idea was never more occaſional than at the preſent criſis—a criſis pregnant with fate and ready to burſt with calamity. I allude to that languor which, like a low hung cloud, overſhadows a great part of the thirteen ſtates. That the young, enterpriſing America, who ſtepped out in the cauſe of humankind, and, no other arm daring, lopped the branches of wide deſpotic empire—that the ſame America ſhould now ſuffer a few inſolent bands to ravage her borders with impunity—that her <hi>now tardy</hi> hand ſhould ſuſpend the finiſhing ſtroke of reſentment, and leave to her <hi>generous allies</hi> a labor which her own vigor ought to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; this muſt diſturb thoſe, illeſtrious, who ſell in her infant exertions; this muſt ſtab the peace of the dead, however it may affect the hearts of the living.

                  <p>WHEN I conſider the important occaſion from which this anniverſary derives its origin, and the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able characters that have exerted themſelves to perpetuate its hiſtory, I confeſs there is an unuſual ſecurity in my feelings; ſince no miſtaken effort of mine can injure an inſtitution, founded on ſo memorable an event, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by names ſo juſtly claiming the applauſe of poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>WHILE I rely, then, upon that honeſty of intention, which is itſelf the beſt apology for its errors, permit me to employ the preſent hour, which your united voices have annually made ſacred to the commemoration of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's wrong, in recapitulating the moſt injurious of her
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:018997_0155_0FA911E94701C320"/>ſufferings, among which that on the tragical fifth of <hi>March</hi> is by no means the leaſt, and in recounting the bleſſings which have followed from meaſures as really diſgraceful to thoſe who adopted them, as they were intentionally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to thoſe againſt whom they were levelled.</p>
                  <p>A NATION falling from thoſe great principles of juſtice and virtue which had made her reſpectable; ſubverting the boaſted improvements of her arts to the ſavage purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of revenge; with venality and corruption entrenched on her cabinet, affords a ſpectacle too ſerious for the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beholder. He turns for relief to the annals of thoſe people whoſe maſculine virtues have obſtinately, will he not ſay wifely, reſiſted the refinement of a civilized world. But from the misfortunes of ſuch a nation, much is to be learned. As ſhe is hurried onwards by the vortex of that immeaſurable gulph, in which empires ſink to riſe no more, let her ſerve us as a ſignal to avoid the firſt impulſe of its reſiſtleſs tide.</p>
                  <p>TO trace Great-Britain through the whole progreſs of her ambition in this country, would be to ſtep back to a very early period: for, long before ſhe avowed her ſyſtem of colonial ſlavery in the ſtamp-act, the liberties of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had endured the moſt alarming innovations from her throne. Without cauſe, and without notice, ſhe had invalidated their charters; laid impoſitions upon their trade; attempted a moſt dangerous influence over their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal government, by endeavouring to make it indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the people;—and all this with the ſame confidence, as though her policy and foreſight, and not her perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had ſettled them on this ſide the atlantic.</p>
                  <p>BUT the full diſplay of her deſpotic policy was reſerved to add accumulated diſgrace to the inglorious reign of the third George. Then, intoxicated with <hi>America,</hi> ſhe ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered upon the tottering pillars of her own conſtitution;
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:018997_0156_0FA911EC5D39A4C8"/>the hand of ſlavery rocked her as ſhe lay on the giddy height; falſhood gilded her viſions and bound her ſenſes with the enchantment of ſucceſs; while her blind ambition alone remained awake, to miſdirect the ordinary aſſiſtance of fortune, and to make her fall equally certain and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete.</p>
                  <p>THE genius of Britain once interred, the firſt ſpectre which ſhot from its tomb was the ſtamp-act. This promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a ſcheme ſo repugnant to the fundamental princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the late Engliſh conſtitution, announced the fall, but did not obliterate the memory of that much reſpected ſyſtem, in this country. <hi>America</hi> ſaw that the act bore not a ſingle feature of its reputed parent, and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected its illegitimacy, effectually reſiſted its operation. But, as though conviction muſt ever be productive of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, Britain deſiſted not to rend in pieces the charters of her colonies, which ſerved to remind her of the violence ſhe committed on her own. Her adminiſtration affecting to realize the fables

                  <p>WHERE was the citizen whoſe indignation did not flaſh at this undiſguiſed attack on his liberties? the ſoldiers pride too grew ſanguinary at the idea of contempt from the people he himſelf had been taught to deſpiſe; and, as though heaven deſigned to effect its greateſt purpoſes by the ſacrifice of what men conceive to be the deareſt objects

On ſuch principles aroſe the memorable declaration of <hi>July</hi> 1776.—A declaration which at once gave life and freedom to a nation; diſſolved a monopoly unnatural as unjuſt; and extended the embraces of our country to the univerſe.—A declaration which heaven has ſince ratified by the ſucceſsful event of her arms. For, when we conſider the number of her victories; the diſadvantages under which they were obtained; with the chain of important conſequences which depended upon the very moment of their deciſion, who but muſt acknowledge, after allowing to our military actors every thing heroiſm can claim, that there appeared pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar marks of more than human aſſiſtance? the ſurrender of entire armies to a power which they affected to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:018997_0159_0FA911EFD813CD98"/>on rather as an object of their chains than of their ſwords, was a degree of glory which no enemy that ever paſſed the Roman yoke afforded to that republic.

                  <p>AMERICA once unfettered, nobly relied upon the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of her cauſe and the bravery of her ſons. But, as though the virtues of one crown were to apologize for the mercileſs cruelty of another, a monarch, equally wiſe in council as brilliant and powerful in arms, met her in an alliance which muſt ever enliven her gratitude; exalt the honor of France; and, we truſt too, promote the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of both.</p>
                  <p>AMONG the advantages which have ariſen from theſe great events to the people of <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> that of ſecuring their lives, their liberties, and property, the great object of all civil government, by a conſtitution of their own framing, is not to be accounted the leaſt. Diſmembered from a government, which had long ſtood by the exacteſt balance of its powers, even againſt the corruption of its miniſters, they found themſelves accuſtomed to principles, which age had ſtamped with authority, and patriots ſealed with their blood. The cauſe of their ſeparation had taught them the avenues through which deſpotiſm inſinuates itſelf into the community, and pointed out the means of excluding it. Under theſe circumſtances they produced a ſyſtem which, we truſt, experience will evince to be an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

They are remedies which at beſt always diſcloſe and confeſs our evils. The body politic, once diſtempered, they may indeed be uſed as a crutch to ſupport it a-while, but they can never heal it. <hi>Rome,</hi> when her bravery conquered the neighbouring nations, and united them to her own empire, was free from all danger within, becauſe her armies, being urged on by a love for their country, would as readily ſuppreſs an internal as an external enemy. In thoſe times ſhe made no ſcruple to throw out her kings who had abuſed their power. But when her ſubjects fought not for the advantage of the commonwealth; when they thronged to the Aſiatic wars for the ſpoils they produced, and preferred proſtituting the rights of citizenſhip upon any barbarian that demanded them, to meeting him in the field for their ſupport; then <hi>Rome</hi> grew too modeſt to accept from the hands of a dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator thoſe rights, which ſhe ought to have impaled him for daring to invade. No alteration in her laws merely, could have effected this. Had ſhe remained virtuous, ſhe might as well have expelled her dictators as her kings. But what laws can ſave a people who, for the very purpoſe of enſlaving themſelves, chuſe to conſider them rather as councils which they may accept or refuſe, than as precepts which they are bound to obey?

THEY who follow the profeſſion of arms conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exempted from the uſeful occupations of life, and thence contract a habit of diſſipation; ſoldiers inured to exerciſe and labor in their duty, at leiſure to roam, will not be wholly inactive in a city, where the means of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification abound; purſuing the objects of pleaſure, with the ſame zeal with which they engaged in the toils and enterpriſes of the field, whole armies have, too late, found themſelves deſtroyed by the diſſolving power of luxury.</p>

                  <p>THE effects of luxury, though productive of the greateſt misfortunes to an army ſtationed in a city, are by no means confined to that claſs of men.

WHEN we conſider our own proſperous condition, and view of the ſtate of that nation, of which we were once a part, we even weep over our enemy, when we reflect that ſhe was once great; that her navies rode formidable upon the ocean; that her commerce was extended to every har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the globe; that her name was revered wherever it was known; that the wealth of nations was depoſited in her iſland; and that America was her friend, but by means of her ſtanding armies, an immenſe continent is ſeparated from her kingdom

IN the <hi>private</hi> walks of life, he was a pattern for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.—The tears of her, to whom the world is indebted for ſo much virtue, are ſilent heralds of his <hi>filial piety;</hi> while his tender offspring, in liſping out their father's care, proclaim his <hi>parential affection:</hi> and an ADAMS can witneſs with how much zeal he loved where he had formed the ſacred connexion of a <hi>friend:</hi>—their kindred ſouls were ſo cloſely twined, that both felt one joy, both one affliction. In converſation he had the happy talent of addreſſing his ſubject both to the underſtanding and the paſſions; from the one he forced conviction, from t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HE was bleſſed with a complacency of diſpoſition, and equanimity of temper, which peculiarly endeared him to his friends; and which, added to the deportment of the gentleman, commanded reverence and eſteem even from his enemies.</p>
                  <p>SUCH was the tender ſenſibility of his ſoul, that he need but ſee diſtreſs to feel it, and contribute to its relief. He was deaf to the calls of intereſt even in the courſe of his profeſſion: and wherever he beheld an indigent object, which claimed his healing ſkill, he adminiſtered it, without even the hope of any other reward than that which reſulted from the reflection of having ſo far promoted the happineſs of his fellow-men.</p>
                  <p>IN the <hi>ſocial</hi> departments of life, practiſing upon the ſtrength of that doctrine, he uſed ſo earneſtly to inculcate himſelf, that nothing ſo much conduced to enlighten man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and advance the great end of ſociety at large, as the frequent interchange of ſentiments, in friendly meetings; we find him conſtantly engaged in this eligible labor; but on none did he place ſo high a value, as on that <hi>moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable</hi> of all detached ſocieties, THE FREE AND AC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEPTED MASONS: into this fraternity he was early ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated; and after having given repeated proofs of a rapid
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:018997_0179_0FA9120B27059BD8"/>proficiency in the arts, and after evidencing by his life, the profeſſions of his lips—finally, as the reward of his merit, he was commiſſioned <hi>the moſt worſhipful</hi> GRAND<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MASTER of all the antient Maſons, through <hi>North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>—And you brethren, are living teſtimonies, with how much honor to himſelf, and benefit to the craft uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, he diſcharged the duties of his elevated truſt; with what ſweetened accents he courted your attention, while, with <hi>wiſdom, ſtrength, and beauty,</hi> he inſtructed his lodges in the ſecret arts of <hi>Freemaſonry;</hi> what perfect order and decorum he preſerved in the government of them; and in all his conduct, what a bright example he ſet us, <hi>to live within compaſs, and act upon the ſquare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WITH what pleaſure did he ſilence the wants of poor and pennyleſs brethren; yea, the neceſſitous every where, though ignorant of the myſteries of the craft, from his benefactions, felt the happy effects of that inſtitution which is founded on <hi>faith, hope, and charity.</hi> And the world may ceaſe to wonder, that he ſo readily offered up his life, on the altar of his country, when they are told, that the main pillar of <hi>maſonry,</hi> is the LOVE OF MANKIND.</p>
                  <p>THE fates, as though they would reveal, in the perſon of our GRAND-MASTER, thoſe myſteries, which have ſo long lain hid from the world, have ſuffered him, like the great maſter-builder in the temple of old, to fall by the hands of Ruffians, and be again raiſed in honor and authority: we ſearched in the field for the murdered ſon of a widow, and we four him, <hi>by the turf and the twig,</hi> buried on the brow of a hill, though not in a decent grave.—And tho' we muſt again commit his body to the tomb, yet out breaſts ſhall be the burying ſpot of his <hi>maſonic virtues,</hi> and there—

IN <hi>public</hi> life, the ſole object of his ambition was, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the conſcience of virtuous enterprizes; <hi>amor patriae</hi> was the ſpring of his actions, and <hi>mens conſcia recti</hi> was his guide.—And on this ſecurity he was, on every occaſion, ready to ſacrifice his health, his intereſt, and his eaſe, to the ſacred calls of his country. When the liberties of America were attacked, he appeared an early champion in the conteſt; and though his knowledge and abilities would have inſured riches and preferment (could he have ſtoop'd to proſtitution) yet he nobly withſtood the faſcinating charm, toſſed Fortune back her plume, and purſued the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible purpoſe of his ſoul, in guiltleſs competence.</p>
                  <p>HE ſought not the airy honors of a name, elſe, many of thoſe publications, which in the early period of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſerved to open the minds of the people, had not appeared anonymous. In every time of eminent danger, his fellow-citizens flew to him for advice; like the orator of Athens, he gave it, and diſpelled their fears:—twice did they call him to the roſtrum, to commemorate the maſſacre of their brethren; and from that inſtance, in perſuaſive language, he taught them, not only the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tendency, but the actual miſchief, of ſtationing a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force, in a free city, in a time of peace.—They learnt the profitable leſſon, and pen'd it among their grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>BUT his abilities were too great, his deliberations too much wanted, to be confined to the limits of a ſingle city, and at a time when our liberties were moſt critically in danger from the ſecret machinations and open aſſaults of our enemies, this town, to their laſting honor, elected him to take a part in the councils of the ſtate.—And with what faithfulneſs he diſcharged the important delegation, the neglect of his private concerns, and his unwearied atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE Congreſs of our colony could not obſerve ſo much virtue and greatneſs without honoring it with the higheſt mark of their favor; and by the free ſuffrages of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted body of freemen, he was ſoon called to preſide in the ſenate—where by his daily counſels and exertions, he was conſtantly promoting the great cauſe of <hi>general liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT when he found the tools of oppreſſion were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately bent on violence; when he found the vengeance of the Britiſh court muſt be glutted with blood; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that what he could not effect by his eloquence or his pen, he would bring to purpoſe by his ſword. And on the memorable 19th of April, he appeared in the field, under the united characters of the general, the ſoldier, and the phyſician. Here he was ſeen animating his countrymen to battle, and fighting by their ſide, and there he was found adminiſtering healing comforts to the wounded. And when he had repelled the unprovoked aſſaults of the enemy, and had driven them back into their ſtrong-holds, like the virtuous chief of Rome, he returned to the ſenate, and preſided again at the councils of the fathers.</p>
                  <p>WHEN the vanquiſhed foe had rallied their diſordered army, and by the acquiſition of freſh ſtrength, again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to fight againſt freemen: our patriot, ever anxious to be where he could do the moſt good, again put off the ſenator, and, in contempt of danger, flew to the field of battle, where, after a ſtern, and <hi>almoſt</hi> victorious reſiſtance, ah! too ſoon for his country! he ſealed his principles with his blood—then—

                     <hi>THE following maſterly piece of</hi> original compoſition <hi>is from the pen of</hi> JAMES ALLEN, <hi>of Boſton, in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and was writen when his feelings, like thoſe of every other</hi> free-born American, <hi>were all alive at the inhuman murders of our countrymen, in the ſtreets of that town, on the evening of the fifth of March,</hi> 1770, <hi>and which gave birth to ſeveral of the preceeding orations, in which that act of</hi> Britiſh <hi>violence and brutality is, in ſtrong colours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> depicted. Although this poem is now re-publiſhed without the previous knowledge or conſent of the author, the printer hopes he ſhall not incur the author's diſpleaſure hereby, eſpecially when it is made known to him, that the preſent re-publication is at the requeſt of ſeveral of the printer's cuſtomers, who are deſirous to convince the</hi> Britiſh <hi>that true</hi> claſſical Engliſh po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, <hi>may be produced in other parts of the world, as well as in their own little iſland.</hi>
