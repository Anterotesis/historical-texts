            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO All the BRAVE MEN, Whether OFFICERS or SOLDIERS, Who compoſe The ARMIES of the <hi>United States,</hi> This ADDRESS IS Moſt reſpectfully inſcribed, BY Their Brother Soldier AND Humble Servant, The AUTHOR.</p>

            <p>PERHAPS the following little Poem may be conſidered with the more indulgence by the Public, after it is known, that it was actually writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, at a period when the Army was in the field, and the Author ſo far engaged in the duties of his profeſſion, as to have but little leiſure for ſubjects of literature or amuſement. And it will not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to demonſtrate to thoſe who have the leaſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a military life, how unfavourable ſuch a a ſtate is to poetical contemplation. This, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, may pertinently be urged in excuſe for the ſlighter errors, and inaccuracies of the performance; and the Deſign muſt in ſome meaſure atone, for any of a different complexion.</p>
            <p>To inſpire our Countrymen now in arms, or who may hereafter be called into the field, with perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and fortitude, thro' every ſpecies of difficulty and danger, to continue their exertions for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their country, and the preſervation of its Liberties, is the object of this Addreſs.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, it was imagined, no conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons could be more effectual, than the recollection of the paſt, and the anticipation of the future. For where is the man to be found, who, after all that has been done and ſuffered; after ſuch a profuſion of blood, and treaſure has been expended; and ſuch important advantages have been obtained; would baſely relinquiſh, and leave unfiniſhed the illuſtrious taſk of <hi>rearing</hi> an EMPIRE, which from its ſituation, and circumſtances, muſt ſurpaſs all that ever have exiſted, in magnitude, felicity and duration?</p>
            <p>Altho' the Author entertains the moſt ſanguine expectations of the gratitude and liberality, with which the Continent will reward thoſe who have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016801_0004_0F9E79F9405382E8"/>
borne the heat and burden of the day of war; he has not inſiſted on thoſe pecuniary or ſlighter conſiderations: but has attempted, to turn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to the future grandeur, happineſs, and glory of the Country, for which we are now contending. —The lands already granted to the Army, firſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted the idea of a military ſettlement on the Ohio, or in ſome of thoſe Weſtern regions; whoſe beauties can never be ſufficiently diſplayed, much leſs exaggerated by deſcription. The mild tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and ſerenity of the air, the ſalubrity of the climate, the fertility of the ſoil, the luxuriance of its products, the extent of territory, and the amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inland navigation, which thoſe boundleſs lakes, and immeaſurable rivers will open; cannot fail one day, to equal that garden of the world to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation given of it, in the concluſion of the Poem. The poſſeſſion of ſuch a Country, (reſcued from the hand of invaſion) in a perfect ſtate of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſecurity, will be a glorious compenſation for all our toils and ſufferings, and a monument of the moſt unparalell'd bravery and patriotiſm to the remoteſt poſterity.—Stimulated with the love of glory, allured by theſe delightful proſpects, and animated with the pleaſing hope of the ſpeedy fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of thoſe rapturous ſcenes; there are thouſands who have drawn the ſword, with a reſolution never to ſheath it, until a happy period is put to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.—For himſelf, the Writer declares, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already devoted, whatever talents and abilities nature has conferred upon him, to the ſervice of his Country; no efforts that can be made with his voice, his pen, or his ſword, ſhall ever be wanting to confirm its LIBERTIES and INDEPENDENCE.</p>
