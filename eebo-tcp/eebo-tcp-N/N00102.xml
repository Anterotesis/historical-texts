            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>COncerning this Sermon which is now offering it self to thy hand and heart, I must say what I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of, <hi>viz.</hi> That it containeth words of uprightness and truth, and such as to many Auditors present at the publick Preaching of it, were very acceptable: when they came warm from the mouth and spirit of the speaker, I doubt not, but they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with them sweetness through the ear to the heart of each rightly prepared hearer. To receive with affection, is good, but not all the entertainment we owe to messages, sent by the God of Salvations to his Covenant-people. Words of wisdome must be <hi>as Nails fastened, Eccl. 12.11.</hi> the word of Christ must <hi>abide,</hi> Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>15.7.</hi> and <hi>dwell richly in us,</hi> Col. <hi>3.16.</hi> The helping forward of so good a work, hath occasioned a Person of Worth, eminently affected to thine, and this poor Countries best good, in subserviency to the glory of the blessed God of Truth, to adventure the publishing, of what the pious Author was well-nigh invincibly unwilling should ever have come forth. In hearing, the attention minde must hold pace with the speaker, following him through all particulars from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of his Message: but in reading we have this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that we may stay and dwell upon what we have first a minde to, and by serious thoughts and humble prayer, improve it to our good, without depriving our selves of opportunity of doing the like, with any other part of it afterward. Thou hast now a help to reminde thee of many useful (but possibly forgotten) passages. God, whose Providence hath brought this to thy hands, expecteth a sutable improvement: an awakening, humbling quickening, is the best use we can make of it. Visible benefit and fruit, is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IN this Chapter (to give you onely a very short view of the Context) you may take notice of these three parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An Interlocution or Dialogue between Christ and his Church, contained in the first six Verses. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected appearance of the Lord Jesus Christ, in his glorious works of Vengeance upon his peoples enemies, and of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Church, it draws forth the Churches earnest En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; and these her Enquiries they draw forth Christs distinct Answers, even as it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>romised <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Call upon me and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knewest not.</hi> Christ loves to be <hi>questioned</hi> with concerning his great works of Providence, because he desires to be <hi>known</hi> unto his people in them; and to acquaint them with the great designs he hath in hand, as here he is graciously pleased to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An Acknowledgement of Praise from the Church, in the recounting, and calling to minde of eminent passages of former mercy and kindness extended to her, from <hi>ver.</hi> 7. to <hi>ver.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Churches earnest Prayer and pleading with God hereupon, from <hi>v.</hi> 15. to the end: <hi>Look down from heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Verse read, comes under the second of these Heads. Christ having declared, not only his <hi>Person,</hi> but also his present <hi>design</hi> and work to be the wonderful destruction of his and his peoples enemies, and the salvation of his Redeemed ones; The Church is presently striking upon the same string of Mercy, and that her faith and hope might be further confirmed, and her heart enlarged, she presently ecchoes unto Christ, by telling o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the former stories of his loving kindness, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000156_0004_0FA2B76EC57333E0"/>
the loving kindnesses of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Now (as one aptly notes upon the place) As good Historians do not only relate meer naked matters of fact, but the persons also, and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations moving so or so, with the effects and resultances; so the Church, surveying here the loving kindnesses of the Lord from an ancient date, suggests in the words read, the <hi>Considerations</hi> upon which the Lord proceeded to be the Saviour of this people; <hi>For he said,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words of the Text may be thus divided. We have in them</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Lords just expectations of his people, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which he makes to himself of great things from them. <hi>He said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The influence of these things upon the Lords Saviourly undertakings with and for his people: <hi>So he was their Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or a little more largely the words hold forth to us</p>
            <p n="1">1. The best Relation wherein any people can stand, and that is to be the Lords people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That eminent Qualification which suits with such a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>To be children that will not lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Lords solemn Assertion and Consideration of such a Relation and Qualification in the people spoken of; <hi>For he said, Surely they are my people,</hi> &amp;c. He affirms such a Relation, and he solemnly expects and promiseth to himself such an answerable Qualification.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Lords Engagements and Actings as a Saviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this his peop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>God is here spoken of after the <hi>manner of men,</hi> as giving to himself the grounds and reasons of his own great undertaking; And therefore the expressions of the Text do no whit impeach the fore-knowledge of God, whereby he knew from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what the rebellions and backslidings of this people would

               </hi> judging of matters, and taking up his hopes, according to the visible and apparent just grounds and reasons of things, even as a <hi>prudent and wise man</hi> would in the like case have done: for who is there that would not have promised to himself great things from a people so engaged and circumstanced, in case so great mercy and salvation were shewn to them? Now that which the Lord promiseth to himself and expects from them, is, That they would prove <hi>Children that would not lie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To lie,</hi> in the sense of the Text, takes in <hi>deeds</hi> as well as <hi>words,</hi> yea matters of fact more especially. The Spirit of God means hereby <hi>all Vnsoundness, Perfidiousness, Prevarication with the Lord,</hi> whereby we go contrary to our <hi>Engagements,</hi> and prove unfaithful to him. The word is translated in other places to <hi>deal falsly,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23. and <hi>to fail,</hi> Psal. 89.33. It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto the matters of the <hi>Lords Covenant</hi> with his people.

All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, nor <hi>dealt falsly</hi> in thy Covenant: the word is the same with that in the Text; We have not <hi>lied</hi> unto thee in thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.

Now here there are these five particulars, briefly as the grounds of the Lords Expectations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The special Relation of a people unto God</hi>; or that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-relation whereinto the Lord brings a people that they may be His; Surely they are <hi>My people,</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that will not lie.</hi> The Lord founds his whole Law, in the giving of it to <hi>Israel,</hi> upon a Preface of <hi>Interest</hi> in them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> A Parent expects more from a <hi>Childe</hi> then from any other, because of the Relation. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.14. if <hi>Israel</hi> had been no more then <hi>a servant or a home-born slave,</hi> the Lord had not expected so great things from him; but now being a <hi>son,</hi> yea a <hi>first-born, Exod.</hi> 4.22. this makes the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God executed upon him for rebellions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings

to be, though more <hi>strange and astonishing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet most <hi>just and righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Extraction of a people,</hi> or their descent from such and such Parents and Progenitors; when they do not onely stand in relation to God, but are born and grow up into Covenant with him, as the seed and posterity of the Lords faithful ones. This is implied in that expression of <hi>Children</hi> in the Text; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> notes not onely their Relation unto <hi>God</hi> as a Father, but unto <hi>pious and religious Parents,</hi> the Lords faithful Covenanting Servants. Religious Parentage and Descent is of great moment with the Lord; hence he calls and names his people so often in Scripture from their pious Ancestors. Thus the whole <hi>Race</hi> is called <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> the <hi>seed of Jacob and of Israel,</hi> Psal. 22.23. Isa. 45.19. the <hi>Posterity of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Covenanting holy Parents, they are a <hi>holy Root</hi> unto their Seed, and the Lord may well expect that the <hi>Branches</hi> should be answerable unto the Root.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> Hence the Lord solemnly calls upon his people to <hi>look to the Rock whence they were hewen, and to the hole of the Pit whence they were digged</hi>; to <hi>look unto Abraham their father, and to Sarah that bare them,</hi> Isa. 51.1, 2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The solemn actual Restipulations of a people unto God,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they do more explicitly binde themselves, and come under voluntary deliberate Engagements unto God. When God hath the Vows and Promises, the Hands and Seals, the solemn Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Deeds of a people, now he may well expect that from such a time they will never <hi>fail</hi> him more, but abide <hi>faithful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</hi> Thus it was with Israel, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17. <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.21, 22.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Advantages and Priviledges of a people.</hi> A people in Covenant, are a people of many Advantages, and the Lord builds his Expectations upon these, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.4, 5. God looked for grapes from his vineyard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. because he had <hi>fenced it, and gathered out the stones, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and made a wine-press therein,</hi> ver. 1, 2. When the rain cometh <hi>oft</hi> upon the ground, the Husbandman expecteth <hi>meet fruit</hi>; and good reason, because of this advantage: <hi>fruitful seasons</hi> afforded, make us to expect a <hi>plentiful Harvest.</hi> If God be not wanting in Ordinances, in sending Messengers one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in setting up Lights in the Candlesticks, in holding forth
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000156_0009_0FA2B77808480690"/>
the Rule unto a people, and discovering the Pattern of his house to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he will certainly expect and require singular things from them: <hi>for unto whom much is given, from them shall much be required,</hi> Luk. 12.48. Psal. 147.19, 20. Mat. 11.20, 21, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The primitive Constitution of a people, and their first wayes of walking with God according unto such a Constitution.</hi> When God made man at first, he made him <hi>upright</hi>; when God doth in a more then ordinary way of Providence <hi>form a people,</hi> and <hi>settle</hi> them to be a people to himself, there is ever that which is eminent in the <hi>primitive frame of things amongst them,</hi> which God expects that they should keep to, and never make defection from. Thus God speaks of his Vineyard, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5.2. it was planted with the <hi>choicest vine.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Yet I planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed.</hi> Thus also God speaks of <hi>Judges as at the first, and Counsellors as at the beginning,</hi> Isa. 1.26. <hi>David</hi> had his <hi>first wayes,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.3. and so Churches have their first wayes, when they newly come out of the <hi>forming hand</hi> of God: Now the Lord expresseth not onely great <hi>disappointment,</hi> when these first wayes are neglected, or quite altered and cast off, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</hi> but great <hi>displeasure</hi> also, and <hi>threats</hi> of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. hence are those cutting Interrogatories, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, A second thing in this Doctrine is, <hi>The nature and tenour</hi> of this dispensation of God, to <hi>try and prove</hi> a people with Mercies and Salvation under his just Expectations of them, and promises concerning them. This we may take in three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When the Lord enters into Covenant with any people, this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of his is a Covenant with Conditions. Foedus est promiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> sub certâ conditione.</hi> Hence there are the <hi>Laws,</hi> as well as the <hi>Promises</hi> of the Covenant. As the Lord <hi>obligeth</hi> himself <hi>to us,</hi> so he <hi>requires</hi> something <hi>from us,</hi> and thus the <hi>Commandments &amp; Statutes</hi> of God are frequently called his <hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 25.10. &amp; 103.18.</note> 
               <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. The Lord doth not binde himself but upon <hi>terms</hi> to any people. In the purely spiritual Covenant, establish'd with <hi>Believers onely,</hi> as there are the <hi>Laws of it,</hi> 1 Cor 9.21. so there is a <hi>sufficiency of grace</hi> provided, and absolutely engaged, that there may be a <hi>performance</hi> and obedience unto the end, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000156_0010_0FA2B778DBF355A0"/>
so that Covenant can never be made void or disannulled to any that are ever brought into the bond thereof, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32, 33, 34. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32.20. But as to that external political Covenant, which takes in <hi>A Body of People,</hi> here there is no such engagement of grace sufficient, infallibly to be bestowed for the keeping of the same; and therefore it may be and is most frequently <hi>broken and made void.</hi> God threatens to <hi>remove the Candlestick,</hi> Rev. 2.5. and often hath he done it. <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were in the issue cast off, for breaking the Lords Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God never is, nor can he be the first that fails in his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a people.</hi> Their desertion or dereliction never <hi>begins</hi> with God, but themselves, <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.9. You know the common and stated Rule in this case. Acts of pure Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty they begin with God, &amp; proceed wholly from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. but acts of Justice must have the demerit of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be founded upon; such is Gods forsaking of a people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.17. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence there is a Probation-time belonging to the Covenant-state of a people.</hi> The Lord will make a <hi>triall</hi> whether they will keep and be stedfast in his Covenant, yea or no. He will not fail on his part, but he will be that unto a people which he hath <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> himself to be by <hi>Covenant</hi>; He will nourish and cherish, He will instruct and teach, He will save and shine upon a people, and keep the path of a gracious Covenant, without turning aside from the same, and in such a course and way as this he will make a <hi>full proof</hi> and trial of them. He will <hi>afflict in mercy</hi> whilest his hopes of them continue; He will bring many <hi>special hours of temptation</hi> upon them one way or another; He will <hi>nourish and keep up his hopes and expectations</hi> as long as may be, untill he hath a full proof of them; and now if they <hi>fail him,</hi> there is a critical season of altering and changing the course and way of his Providences towards them. From such <hi>an hour, or day, or year,</hi> is such a person or people forsaken of God; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation-time ceaseth, and blinding, hardning, ruining time comes in the room of it: <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>O that thou hadst known! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> Jer. 6.27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>Reprobate silver shall men call them, for the Lord hath rejected them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The third thing is the Reason, which shall be onely this one. Because in such a way as this <hi>the Lord, doth wonderfully
<pb n="12"
                      facs="unknown:000156_0011_0FA2B77987946A18"

glorifie the wisdome, and sweetness, and righteousness of his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration and Government</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Cords of such a dispensation are the <hi>cords of a man,</hi> Hos. 11.4. The Lord acts towards us in a sutable way, as we are intelligent creatures, made after the image of God, capable of judging and discerning the Reason and Equity of things, and of arguing one thing from another, and choosing and preferring one thing before another. <hi>As to his Elect,</hi> the Lord reacheth their Souls with effectual grace in this way: <hi>As to others,</hi> the Wisdome and Justice and Holiness of God, shine forth in their hardning and preparation before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to destruction. This is a way wherein there can be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception laid against the Lord by any, but he alone shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in judgement. When the Lord shall triumph most in the utter ruine of a gainsaying, backsliding, despising people, yet he shall also retain the name and glory of a gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God, because <hi>He often would have gathered Jerusalem,</hi> Matth. 23.37. and <hi>there was nothing more to be done to his vineyard which he did not do,</hi> Isa. 5.4.</p>

For many a day and year, even from our first beginnings hath this word of the Lord been verified concerning us in this Wilderness; <hi>The Lord hath said of</hi> New-England, <hi>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lie, so hath he been our Saviour.</hi> Upon this Basis have all the <hi>Saviourly Vndertakings</hi> of the Lord been founded in the midst of us, and upon this bottom do we unto this day abide.</p>
            <p>The solemn work of this day is <hi>Foundation-work</hi>; not to lay a new Foundation, but to continue and strengthen, and beautifie, and build upon that which hath been laid. Give me leave therefore, Honoured and Beloved, to awaken, and call upon you, in the Name of him who sends me, with reference unto those <hi>Foundations</hi> that are held forth to us in the Text, for if these should be <hi>out of course,</hi> what could the Righteous do? If we should so frustrate and deceive the Lords Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that his Covenant-interest in us, and the Workings of his Salvation be made to cease, then All were lost indeed; Ruine upon Ruine, Destruction upon Destruction would come, until one stone were not left upon another.</p>

If I should say that the very world, or common ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors expect great things from us at this day, there is a great deal of weight in it; If I say that the faithful precious suffering Saints of God in all other places, that have heard of the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>As for special Relation unto God</hi>; whom hath the Lord more signally exalted then his people in this Wilderness? The Name and Interest of God, and Covenant-relation to him, it hath been written upon us in Capital Letters from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. God had his <hi>Creatures</hi> in this Wilderness before we came, and his <hi>Rational Creatures</hi> too, a multitude of them; but as to <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> that are Covenant-born unto God, Are not we the <hi>first</hi> in such a Relation? in this respect we are surely the Lords <hi>first-born</hi> in this Wilderness. Of the poor Natives before we came we may say as <hi>Isa.</hi> 63.19. <hi>They were not called by the Lords Name, he bear not Rule over them</hi>: But we have been from the beginning, and we are the <hi>Lords.</hi>

Hath not a great part of the world been a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of these things, even of our explicite ownings of, and Covenantings with the Lord as our God, laying this as a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-stone in our Building; and of this we may say, It hath been a special Exasperation unto Adversaries and Ill-willers, that despised <hi>New-England</hi> hath laid claim to, and publickly avouched and challenged a special Interest in God above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for our Advantages and Priviledges</hi> in a Covenant-state here time and strength would fail to reckon up what we have enjoyed of this kinde; if any people in the world have been lifted up to heaven as to Advantages and Priviledges, we are the people. Name what you will under this Head, and we have had it.

And it is a solemn Conviction and Charge against us, to have it spoken, as it must be spoken in the Name of the Lord this day, <hi>O New-England,</hi> thy God did expect better things from thee and thy Children; not Worldliness, and an insatiable desire after perishing things; not Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Fornications; not Revellings and Drunkenness; not Oaths &amp; false Swearings; not Exactions and Oppressions; not Slanderings and Backbitings; not Rudeness and Incivility, a degeneracy from the good Manners of the Christian world; not Formality and Profaneness, to loath Manna, to despise holy things, to grow Sermon-proof and Ordinance proof; not Contentions and Disorders; not an Itching after new things and wayes; not a rigid Pharisaical Spirit; not a Contempt of Superiours; not Unthankfulness and disrespect to Instruments of choice Service; not a growing weary of Government, and a drawing loose in the Yoke of God: Not these things, but better things, O <hi>New England,</hi> hath thy God expected from thee. But what hath the Lord found? Do not you who are our <hi>Fathers in the Common-wealth</hi> know? or cannot those <hi>Watchmen</hi> of the Lord tell us, whom he hath set for a <hi>Tower <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Certainly all these false and evil things, and that not by <hi>secret search onely,</hi> but openly and in the view of the world, hath the Lord found. Alas! how is <hi>New-England</hi> in danger this day to be lost even in <hi>New-England?</hi> to be buried in its own Ruines? How sadly may we lament it that <hi>All are not Israel that are now of Israel?</hi> How is the good grain diminished, and the chaff in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased? The first generation have been ripened time after time, and the most of them gathered in as <hi>shocks of corn in their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; But we who rise up to tread out the footsteps of them that are gone before us, alas! what are we? It is a sad name to be styled <hi>Children that are corrupters</hi>;<note place="margin">Isa. 1.4.</note> but are we not indeed many of us <hi>corrupted,</hi> and which is far worse <hi>Corrupters?</hi> How is our <hi>wine mixed with water?</hi> what coolings and abatements are there to be charged upon us in the things that are good, and that have been our glory? We have abated in our esteem of Ordinances, in our hungring and thirsting after the rich provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the House of God; in our good stomacks to all that which is set before us upon the Table of the Gospel. We have abated in our Love and Zeal, in our wise, tender and faithful management of that great duty of mutual watchfulness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p>There are many among us that have even <hi>suffered many things in vain</hi>; many that having <hi>begun in the spirit,</hi> do now walk as if they were to be <hi>made perfect by the flesh</hi>; many that are gone off from God in point of dependance, looking out to secure some other friends and hiding-places to themselves besides the Lord, against those changes of times that may come; many (as we may justly fear) that would but too soon and too easily in a day of trial entertain a <hi>Lie</hi> in the Worship of God, and return to the <hi>onyons and garlick of Egypt again.</hi> How hath that evil work of Strife and Division sprung up almost every where amongst us? in which it is solemnly to be noted, that there is ever a <hi>mixture of sin and punishment</hi> going tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

attainty, walk by the same rule, and minde the same thing.</hi> Strict and impartial Examination would yield large matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlable Conviction as to such things as these. Alas! what way of God with us is there, that hath not issued in the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Lie</hi> amongst us? The Answers of Prayer that we have so often, and so eminently received, these have discovered <hi>our Lie,</hi> for we have as often <hi>returned again to folly.</hi> Our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions removed, these also have discovered the <hi>Lie,</hi> for with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> we have not <hi>returned according to the benefit done unto us.</hi> The Death and Removal of the Lords eminent Servants in one Rank and in another, this also hath manifested the <hi>Lie</hi> in many of us. Whilest they lived their Piety and Zeal, their Light and Life, their Counsels and Authority, their Examples and Awe kept us right, and drew us on in the good wayes of God, to profess and practise the best things; but now that they are dead and gone, Ah how doth the unsoundness, the rottenness and hypocrisie of too many amongst us make it self known, as it was with <hi>Joash</hi> after the death of <hi>Jehojadah.</hi> In a word, we that stand before the Lord this day, we have gone less with God then we did at first engage and bid him for all his kindness, and then we began at first to yield him, for all the Mercies, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Liberties of this Place. You that have tender and gracious hearts, suffer these things to affect and afflict them day by day. Verily if the load of them be not taken up and born by a considerable number amongst us in such a way, there is great fear lest it crack and sink us without remedy.</p>
