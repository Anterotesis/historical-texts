            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>While thus resum'd his yet undaunted strain,</l>

With hasty steps straight from his seat he rose,</l>

               <l>And all the scene seems acted o'er again,</l>
               <l>LYONS and GRISWOLDS in dreadful contest rise,</l>
               <l>And sleep forsakes my sorrow flowing eyes."</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Again, O MUSE, thy aid I now implore,</l>
               <l>While I rehearse Sir Dayton's thunder o'er.</l>
               <l>A feeling man, <note n="*" place="bottom">R. WILLIAMS.</note> whom all good men shall bless,</l>
               <l>Whose praise may each indulgent Muse express,</l>
               <l>Expulsion he as too severe oppos'd,</l>
               <l>And in its stead a reprimand propos'd:</l>
               <l>'A reprimand! quoth Dayton, 'trifling doom!</l>
               <l>I'd sooner see him in the silent tomb:</l>
               <l>Grant me thy bolt, O father of the world,</l>
               <l>With vengeance pointed, and with fury hurl'd;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:035052_0018_0FFFFA3FE58E2E78"/>
Red hot from Vulcan's furnace let it come,</l>
               <l>Grant me thy strength to point my vengeance home,</l>
               <l>And strike the vile detested rascal dumb!'</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus spake the man (or thus at least he thought,)</l>
               <l>With anger bloated, and with vengeance fraught.</l>
               <l>But now the Muse demands a short repose,</l>
               <l>That she a tale more dreadful may disclose.</l>

               <l>THE Muse, awaken'd, now renews her fire,</l>
               <l>Once more she deigns to touch th' obedient lyre.</l>
               <l>Attend, while I relate in song sublime,</l>
               <l>A tale, whose fame shall e'en outlive old Time.</l>

               <l>When Griswold heard the thund'ring Speaker roar</l>
               <l>His soul expanded and escap'd the floor.</l>
               <l>High o'er the azure void his spirit flew,</l>
               <l>And from the earth his deathless part withdrew;</l>

High on his throne, old HERCULES he spy'd,</l>
               <l>Then bow'd submissive, and thus trembling cry'd;</l>

               <l>'Father of might, indulge my small request,</l>
               <l>A Lyon doth my mortal frame infest;</l>
               <l>Lend me thy club, or one small part at least,</l>
               <l>That I may fly to kill the angry beast."</l>
               <l>The nervous god, with much contempt, reply'd;</l>
               <l>'Thou wield my club! what vain presumptuous pride!</l>
               <l>Vain mortal, know my club is not so small,</l>
               <l>It weighs as much as thou dost, guts and all:</l>
               <l>But, to content thee, if thou hast a knife.</l>
               <l>I'll split enough to take the Lyon's life."</l>
               <l>Th' indulgent god, cut, while he dreamt no harm,</l>
               <l>A stick as big, almost, as Griswold's arm.</l>
               <l>(But had he known what Lyon 'twas he meant,</l>
               <l>To PLUTO's realms Sir Griswold had been sent,</l>

               <l>As good a whig as ever wore a head.)</l>
               <l>With gratitude he bow'd, and grimly smil'd,</l>
               <l>Pursu'd his journey through the trackless wild;</l>
               <l>Arriv'd on earth, the heav'n-wro't club he twirl'd</l>
               <l>Around his head, and banter'd all the world.</l>

Tow'rds Congress hall his hasty steps he bent,</l>
               <l>To give the storm within its dreadful vent;</l>
               <l>The happy chance now met his watchful eye,</l>

               <l>His head uncover'd, and his cane aside.</l>

               <l>His lifted arm with tenfold vigor grasp'd,</l>

               <l>Thus unprepar'd: th' astonish'd Lyon rose,</l>

               <l>To find himself thus beaten, bruis'd and vex'd,</l>

               <l>Fortune ere long revers'd the former scene,</l>

               <l>And brac'd the arm which ne'er in vain had wro't,</l>

               <l>Escap'd the field and from the battle ran;</l>
