            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Narrative &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AT the <hi>Great-Meadow-Fort</hi> fourteen Miles above <hi>Fort-Dummer, October</hi> 11th 1745, where I was an Inhabitant, I went out from the Fort about 50 Rods to our Wood; and when I had done, I walk'd towards the Fort, but in my Way heard the crackling of Fences behind me, &amp; turning about, ſaw 12 or 13 Indians, with red painted Heads, running after me: On which I cry'd to God for Help, and ran, and hollow'd as I ran, to alarm the Fort; but by that I had ran ten Rods, the Indians came up with me and took hold of me: At the ſame Time the Men at the Fort ſhot at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and kill'd one on the Spot, wounded another, who died fourteen Days after he got Home, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhot a Bullet thro' the Powder-Horn of one that had hold of me. They then led me into the Swamp and pinion'd me. I then committed my Caſe to God, and pray'd, that ſince it was his Will to deliver me into the Hands of theſe cruel Men, I might find Favour in their Eyes: Which Requeſt, God of his infinite Mercy was pleaſed to grant; for they were generally kind to me while I was with 'em: Some of the Indians, at that Time, took the Charge of

me, others ran into the Field to kill Cattle. They led me about half a Mile; where we ſtaid in open Sight of the Fort, 'till the Indians who were killing Cattle came to us laden with Beef: Then they went a little further to a Houſe, where they ſtay'd to cut the Meat from the Bones, and cut the Helve off my Ax, and ſtuck it into the Ground, pointing the Way we went.</p>
            <p>Then we travel'd along by the River Side; and when we had got about three Miles, I eſpied a Canoe coming down on the further Side the River, with <hi>David Rugg</hi> and <hi>Robert Baker</hi> belonging to our Fort. I made as much Noiſe as I could, by Hamming &amp;c. that they might ſee us before the Indians ſaw them, and ſo get aſhore, and happily eſcape; but the Indians ſaw them, and ſhot a-croſs the River twenty or thirty Guns at them, and kill'd the firſt mention'd Perſon, viz <hi>David Rugg,</hi> but <hi>Robert Baker</hi> the other Perſon got aſhore, and eſcaped. Then ſome of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſwam over the River, &amp; bro't the Canoe over the River, ſcalp'd &amp; ſtript the dead Man, and then went about a Mile further, when we came to another Houſe, where we ſtop'd; while there, we heard Men running by the Bank of the River, whom I knew to be <hi>Jonathan Thayer, Samuel Nutting,</hi> &amp; my Son <hi>Caleb How:</hi> Five of the Indians ran to head them. My Heart ak'd for them, &amp; pray'd to God to ſave them from the Hands of the Enemy. I ſuppoſe they hid under the Bank of the River; for the Indians were gone ſome Time, but came back without them, bleſſed be God.</p>
            <p>We went about a Mile further, where we lodg'd that Night, and roaſted the Meat they had got. The next Day we travel'd very ſlow, by Reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian

Then they bid me ſing and dance again, which I did with them, and they with me, ſhouting as before. Then two French Men took me under each Arm, and run ſo faſt that the Indians could not keep up with us to hurt me: We ran about 40 Rods to another Houſe; where a Chair was bro't for me to ſet down: The Houſe was ſoon full of French &amp; Indians, and round the Houſe they were looking in at the Windows. A French Gentleman came to me, took me by the Hand, and led me into a ſmall Room, where none came in but ſuch as he admitted: He gave me Victuals and Drink: Several French Gentlemen and Indians came in, and were civil to me.

            <p>After this we were ſent to Priſon, where I found one <hi>James Kinlade,</hi> who was taken 14 Days before I was, at <hi>Sheepſcot</hi> at the Eaſtward in <hi>New-England:</hi> I was much pleaſed with his Converſation, eſteeming him a Man of true Piety: We were kept in Priſon eight Days, with Liberty to keep in the Room with the Priſon-keeper.

We had Proviſion ſufficient, viz. two Pound of good Wheat Bread, one Pound of Beef, and Peas anſwerable, to each Man ready dreſs'd every Day.</p>
            <p>When I had been there a few Days the Captives deſir'd me to lead them in carrying on Morning and Evening Devotion, which I was willing to do: We had a Bible, a Pſalm-Book, and ſome other good Books; our conſtant Practice was to read a Chapter in the Bible, and ſing Part of a Pſalm, and to pray, Night and Morning.</p>
            <p>When I was at the firſt Priſon I was ſtript of all my old and louſey Cloaths, and had other Cloathing given me from Head to Foot, and had many Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſhewn me by thoſe that liv'd thereabouts, more eſpecially by one Mr. <hi>Corby</hi> and his Wife, who gave me Money there, and brought me many good Things at the other Priſon.
