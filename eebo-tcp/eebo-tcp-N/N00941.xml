            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

falling into Tears. I was now going to say. <hi>Tears, where are you?</hi> But something better I am to call for. There is no concern of our <hi>Inward</hi> or <hi>Outward</hi> man, wherein our <hi>Faith</hi> is not necessary, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, advantageous.

But by his <hi>Faith.</hi> Behold our <hi>Inward man:</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> 'tis that we are to <hi>receive the gift of Righteousness through Jesus Christ:</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> it is that we get <hi>power to become the Children of God:</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> it is that our <hi>hearts are purified:</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> it is that we have a <hi>Victory over the World:</hi> And by <hi>Faith</hi> it is that we come to the <hi>End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</hi> Behold our <hi>Outward man!</hi> By <hi>Faith</hi> it is that we are to <hi>bear</hi> all that God layes upon us; and by Faith it is that we are to <hi>gain</hi> by what we bear. Nothing is to be done without <hi>Faith;</hi> No <hi>Living</hi> without it, nor any <hi>Dying</hi> without it. Admire not that it is in this Chapter so very admirably recommended unto us. It was a very true assertion of a Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, that the <hi>meanest action done in

What it <hi>can do,</hi> is demonstrated, from what it <hi>hath done</hi> already. The Chapter is a <hi>Chronicle</hi> of Christian <hi>Faith;</hi> and an History of the <hi>Heroical</hi> Acts produced &amp; performed by such a <hi>Faith.</hi> After the Apostle had mentioned the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> in Common, as famous for their <hi>Faith,</hi> he comes to instance <hi>Abraham</hi> in particular. There were many tryals given to the Faith of <hi>Abraham;</hi> The <hi>Tenth</hi> (as they use to fancy of the Waves) was the biggest and hardest of them all; a <hi>tryal</hi> in <hi>Isaac</hi> his <hi>only Son.</hi> There are three things in the Text before us.</p>

An instance thereof we have in the words newly read

unto us. In the Context, we have the Story of <hi>Abraham</hi> offering up his <hi>Isaac</hi> unto God, at the <hi>Call</hi> of the Lord. Our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> underwent Nine very Famous Tryals from the alwise God; But he was now brought unto a <hi>Tenth.</hi> We have our Father <hi>Abraham</hi> here <hi>Tryed,</hi> every vein of his heart; and it was under the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Father,</hi> that he underwent the <hi>Tryal.</hi> The <hi>Tryal</hi> ordered for that great <hi>man of God,</hi> was a most afflictive <hi>Tryal.</hi> It was that of parting with a <hi>Child</hi> singularly dear unto him. You shall hear the demand of God, are hear so many claps of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in every article of that Command; seven or eight very penetrating stings me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks aculeate it. Cen. 22. 2 <hi>Take now thy Son, thine only Son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, &amp; get thee into the Land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the Mountains which I will tell thee of.</hi> Here was the demand. There follow in the Story especially two things.</p>

We have the good mans <hi>Obedience.</hi> This is more largely repeated in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but more <hi>briefly</hi> in that Chapter on a passage whereof some of you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we discoursed a few Mon his ago.

Let us design for the Name of God, as much as ever we can. It may be God will permit us to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish our designs; yet if he do not, they shan't be <hi>lost.</hi>

Honours</hi> from below, they do, <hi>Indicare virum,</hi> or <hi>Try</hi> what mettal the man is made of; they Try whether the man can bear Sail without <hi>Over set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and have power to oppress without growing absolutely <hi>mad:</hi> So <hi>Mercies</hi> from above, do the like. In our <hi>Mercies,</hi> God deals with us as with the Soldiers of <hi>Gideon</hi> at the <hi>Waters;</hi> as God carried the Souldiers to the <hi>Waters,</hi> and said, <hi>Now I will try them there;</hi> so does our God bring us to the Rivers of plenty, and says, <hi>I will Try them there. By Prosperity</hi> our God is <hi>trying</hi> of us whether we will <hi>hear him speaking to us in our Prosperity:</hi> and,

Here is the <hi>Tryal</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi> Thus we read, I Pet. 1 6, 7, <hi>Ye are in heaviness if need be through manifold Temptations, that the Tryal of your Faith which is much more precious than Gold might be found unto praise at the appearing of Jesus Christ. Our Afflictions</hi> are our <hi>Tryals</hi> we are thrown into a <hi>fiery Furnace</hi> when Tryed by God with Afflictions.

3. Any man and particularly any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted man, that has the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> may upon <hi>Tryal</hi> know that he has that <hi>Fear.</hi> He that has in him the <hi>Grace</hi> of God may come to <hi>know</hi> that he has it. The <hi>Grace</hi> of God is a <hi>discernible</hi> thing. Tis resembled unto <hi>Light:</hi> a man may see that <hi>Light:</hi> unto <hi>Fire,</hi> a man may feel that <hi>Fire.</hi> It is the Precept of our God unto us, 2 Pet. I. 10. <hi>Make your Calling and Election sure.</hi> That argues that it may be perceived. A man may come to be <hi>sure,</hi> that God has <hi>called</hi> him to Himself, and that therefore he may call God his own God. A man may <hi>know</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> to God and Christ. <hi>Peter</hi> did so, when he said, Joh. 21. 17. <hi>Thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I Love thee.</hi> Surely then he may know his <hi>Fear</hi> of God, and <hi>Fear</hi> of Christ. A man may <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of God and Christ unto him. So <hi>Paul</hi> did, when he said, Gal 2 20. <hi>He hath Loved me and given himself for me.</hi> Now we know, that this peculiar <hi>Love</hi> of the Lord, is towards one but such as <hi>Fear <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> that Lord. A man may come to <hi>know</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001127_0049_0FB05F0C29473708"/>
my Redeemer Lives.</hi> But how shall a man come to know it? Take by the way, this General Direction! Beware of proceeding by <hi>Wrong Rules,</hi> in our <hi>Self-Examination;</hi> else we shall <hi>Wrong</hi> our selves. When we <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, Whether we have the Fear of God or no?</hi> We should not make the meer <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> or <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>Other men,</hi> the <hi>Rules</hi> by which we shall pass an Judgment on our selves. As the <hi>Fear of God is not to be Taught,</hi> So neither is it to be <hi>Tryed</hi> by the <hi>Precepts of men.</hi> The <hi>Rules,</hi> the <hi>Marks,</hi> the <hi>Signs,</hi> by which we are to <hi>Examine</hi> our <hi>Fear of God,</hi> must be <hi>Scriptural</hi> Ones. And <hi>the whole Scripture is profitable,</hi> for our <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in this Devotion; to <hi>Instruct</hi> us for <hi>Self-Examination.</hi> And especially the <hi>First E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> seems to be special portion of Scripture, for <hi>Self Examination;</hi> That Epistle may well be our <hi>Vade Mecum,</hi> when we go to <hi>Examine our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, that I may approach a Little closer to the point that lies before us. Would we know, <hi>Whether we have the Fear of God, or no?</hi> There are many <hi>Tokens</hi> to help us in our <hi>Tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> but that which is mostly to be pressed on us is, <hi>What is our behaviour under Afflictive Tryals?</hi> There we come to the 
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001127_0050_0FB05F0ECBFFAF90"/>
Case that lyes before us. In all our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions our <hi>Flesh</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> yea but when we encounter the Cross handsomely, and Christianly, and Piously, <hi>that</hi> shews that we have more than <hi>Flesh</hi> in us. They that are all <hi>Flesh</hi> can't bear what contradicts the <hi>Flesh.</hi> But when we can patiently have our <hi>Flesh</hi> crossed by the <hi>Hand</hi> of God, and the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Sight</hi> of God enable us to bear it, there is more than <hi>Flesh</hi> in such a man.</p>
                  <p>The Case is This.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What is that behaviour under Afflictive Tryals, which may be a comfortable Argument and Evidence of our having the Fear of God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For answer, in General,</p>
                  <p>To shew the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> we must have <hi>another sort of Behaviour,</hi> than what is in the most of man, when under their <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Nehemiah</hi> spoke at this rate, Others did so and so, Neh. 5. 15. <hi>But so did not I because of the Fear of God</hi> Others in their Afflictions are <hi>froward;</hi> but, <hi>so must not we be because of the Fear of God.</hi> Others under their Afflictions are <hi>hopeless;</hi> but, <hi>so must not we be because of the Fear of God.</hi> Others under their Afflictions <hi>got nothing</hi> by them; they that were <hi>Ungodly</hi> are so still, they that were Carnal, and Worldly, and Profane

do still continue so; but, <hi>so must not we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Fear of God.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> under our Afflictions, is to make us <hi>do more than others.</hi> Our Lord sayes to us in our Afflictions, What do you <hi>more than others?</hi> Except we <hi>do more,</hi> we can't prove that we have the <hi>Fear of God.</hi> I shall offer a few <hi>Questions</hi> in <hi>Answer</hi> to this Case: <hi>Try</hi> your selves by those Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the <hi>Fear of God,</hi> I beseech you, I entreat you.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Under our <hi>Tryals,</hi> is the <hi>Hand of God</hi> very sensible unto us in the ordering of our Tryals? Tis said of the Impious, Isa. 26. 11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not see:</hi> They charge all on the <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> or the <hi>malice</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> or on the concurrence of <hi>second Causes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>It is the Lord that hath taken away, blessed be his name.</hi> Under our <hi>Calamities,</hi> do we say with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam 16. 10. <hi>It is the Lord that hath bidden it</hi> Does the <hi>First Cause</hi> of all take up all our Thoughts?

Are we in all our <hi>Tryals</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry studious to learn, to mind, to mend, whatever may be the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of our <hi>Tryals?</hi> Probably, when afflictions come, there is a <hi>Controversy</hi> which the God, who afflicts us, is therein managing with us. God may say to us, <hi>What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</hi> Well then, In Afflictions are we duly inquisitive after the <hi>Cause</hi> of all? When a Child was taken away from an Excellent person, she said, <hi>O man of God, sin is now brought unto Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance!</hi> Accordingly when any <hi>Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> comes on us, do we set our selves to
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:001127_0055_0FB05F1AC1EFC210"/>
consider what <hi>Sin</hi> we can <hi>Remember</hi> as the <hi>Cause</hi> of this? Do we resolve in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Lam. 3 40. <hi>Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord?</hi> In Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do we go to God, Job 10. 22. <hi>Oh shew me wherefore thou contendest with me?</hi> And, Job 34. 21. <hi>I have born Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will not offend any more!</hi> Do our Afflictions cause us to set before our selves all the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God, and out of these Commandments do we search and judge, and loath our selves, according to the <hi>Cause</hi> which we may there find for our Afflictions! Are we <hi>Impartial</hi> in our finding wherein we are <hi>guilty,</hi> and then studious in our purposes, to Repent &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form? 'Tis said of some, <hi>Their Scum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains:</hi> When God sets us over that <hi>Fire</hi> of Affliction, does our <hi>Scum</hi> come away or does it remain in us! Are we like the <hi>Fool in the mortar?</hi> Or are we more careful to make our <hi>Peace</hi> with God? to quicken our <hi>pace</hi> in the Race set before us? to grow more diligent in working out our own Salvation? now I know that thou fearest God.</p>

That God who may do what he will with his own?</hi> One said, <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi> Is this enough to stop our <hi>mouths</hi> in every affliction, <hi>It' is the doing of God, that God who does all things well, though we don't know what He does, nor why He does it?</hi> Our Lord used that <hi>Prayer, Not my will, but thy will be done!</hi> A Pattern for us.

Do none of our <hi>Tryals</hi> hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from adoring the <hi>Goodness</hi> where with we are very much attended, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our <hi>Tryals?</hi> It is a strange Folly in us, that in <hi>one Grave</hi> we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bury all our <hi>Comforts.</hi> Though God has given us thousands of <hi>Comforts,</hi> yet, it we open <hi>one Grave</hi> to lay one of them there, we foolishly throw in all the rest. <hi>Oh foolish people and unwise!</hi> But instead of <hi>that,</hi> say we like the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting</hi> Church, Lam. 3. 27. <hi>It is of the Lords Mercies, that we are not consumed!</hi> We have many <hi>Mercies</hi> round about us, under our Afflictions? Do we see them, and own them? or, Do we make fit <hi>Comparisons</hi> of our Condition? Do we say, <hi>Though it be bad with me, it may be
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001127_0058_0FB05F22AE32B4B8"/>
'tis worse with them that are better than I? Though things go bad with me, yet there are those that never Sinned as I have done, I should be loth to change with them</hi> Says <hi>Job, Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and shall we not receive evil?</hi> In our Afflictions do we think, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more <hi>good</hi> than <hi>evil,</hi> and we have more <hi>Delights</hi> about us than we, have <hi>Sorrows?</hi> And do we think, That we don't know when we receive <hi>Good</hi> and when <hi>Evil?</hi> Our Lord said to him of old, <hi>What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter,</hi> So, <hi>It may be hereafter I may know that this is best. Jacob</hi> egregiously mistook when he said, <hi>Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, all those things are against me.</hi> Instead of saying, <hi>all these things are against me,</hi> we should say, <hi>It may be God intends them all for my good.</hi> If it be thus, now I know that thou fearest God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> VII. In our <hi>Tryals</hi> what are our <hi>Supports,</hi> and where do we go to make up that we have lost in our <hi>Tryals?</hi> The most of men in Afflictions are like <hi>Ahaze</hi> Chr. 28, 21, 23. <hi>Ahaz goes first to the Kings of</hi> Assyria, but they help, him not, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sacrificed unto the gods of <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> and they were the ruine of him. So many a man when afflicted will say, <hi>I have something left still!</hi> And there is all the <hi>Refreshment</hi> he has If we are visited with Death after Death, how do we Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our selves? Is it by thinking, <hi>The Lord lives, and blessed be my Rock!</hi> Like <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>Though God break my House, yet he has made with me an Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant, ordered in all thing, and sure, This is all my Salvation and all my desire, though he make it not to grow.</hi> Suppose God will not let our Houses <hi>grow,</hi> Is this the <hi>Consolation</hi> of our Soul, that God hath made a <hi>New Covenant</hi> with us? Do we comfort our selves with this, <hi>We have Christ in the New Covenant, where there is Grace and Glory, and every good Thing?</hi> Are the <hi>Promises</hi> of God our Consolation at our <hi>Funerals?</hi> can we say, <hi>I had perished in mine affliction, unless I had had the Word of God</hi> now I know that thou fearest God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu</hi> VIII. Under our <hi>Tryals,</hi> What value have we for the <hi>Spiritual &amp; Eternal Benefits</hi> that are to be gained by our <hi>Tryals?</hi> Do we say, Psal. 119 71. <hi>It is good for me that I have
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001127_0060_0FB05F25506AF8F0"/>
been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> This is <hi>Good,</hi> even to <hi>do justice, to love mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to walk humbly with our God.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Good</hi> for us to <hi>Draw near to God.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Good</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> to be odious, and Christ precious, and <hi>God</hi> glorious to us, and <hi>Heaven</hi> better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by us than ever, and to be weaned from the <hi>world</hi> and all things below, and our <hi>Affections</hi> more set on <hi>things above:</hi> To bring <hi>forth much of that fruit whereby our Heavenly Father may be glorified.</hi> Does the Thought of getting this good by our Afflictions make them all easy to us? Do we say, <hi>It is better for me that I should be partaker of this Good, than to have my Riches and Children all about me! and a Soul pining away in Iniquity, or leanness in my Soul? It is better for me to have the Grace of God, then all the good things of this world about me.</hi> If it be thus, now I know that thou fearest God.</p>
                  <p>Well then, For the Conclusion of all; Oh Let not the <hi>Consolation of God be small</hi> unto you that have attained and practised this right behaviour. If under your afflictive Tryals you behave your selves agreeably to the Expectation of God, what follows but this, I know
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001127_0061_0FB05F26C63AA290"/>
that thou fearest God? Suppose God should Commission one of His Angels to Speak that unto us, as to <hi>Abraham, Now I know thou Fearest God;</hi> would not that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly make amends for all that we have undergone, under our Tryals?</p>
                  <p>Oh! Should the blessed God Say to us, <hi>Now I know, that thou fearest me,</hi> what could we feel after this, either of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments</hi> or the <hi>Distresses</hi> of this World? Let me speak the word of the <hi>Angel</hi> to those that sincerely thus endeavour; <hi>Now I know that thou fearest God;</hi> and tell you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Now I know that there is a great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness laid up for thee.</hi> Tis said, Psal 31. 19. <hi>Oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee.</hi> Yea, shall we take it home to our selves; <hi>Now we know that we fear God:</hi> but what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

keep <hi>us in Integrity,</hi> and <hi>Set us before his face for ever; Now we know,</hi> that the <hi>Lines are fallen to us in pleasant places,</hi> that God will shew us the <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If you have these <hi>Marks,</hi> they are the <hi>Marks of the Lamb;</hi> I may Invite you to the <hi>Supper of the Lamb.</hi> Oh, come to this <hi>Lamb of God</hi> at His Table; That <hi>Lamb which takes away the Sin of the World.</hi> There all that <hi>Goodness</hi> that is <hi>laid up</hi> for them that <hi>Fear God,</hi> shall be <hi>Sealed</hi> unto you, inasmuch as <hi>now you know that you fear God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how can I dismiss you, O my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, without an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> To make tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row work in a <hi>Self Examination</hi> upon that Important point, <hi>Whether we have the Fear of God, or no?</hi> Christians, That famous Exercise of Christianity, even, Self Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, is to be now press'd upon you, <hi>in the fear of God;</hi> and, a Self Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, whether you have it?

even, Self Examination, our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together</hi> will be to good purpose. Alas my Hearers; The <hi>Stupidity</hi> of the World, so generally neglecting all <hi>Self Examination</hi> is as just a ground of Horror, and of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as any in the World. It was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, Jer. 8 6. <hi>I hearkened and heard, and no man Repented saying, What have I done?</hi> May not the Complaint be now made, Ah, Lord, <hi>Thou hast Hearkened, and Heard;</hi> but how few are there any where <hi>Examining</hi> themselves, and saying, <hi>What have I been?</hi> Oh, how Rare a thing is it, for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men to call themselves unto a Strict Account, <hi>O my Soul, Dost thou really fear God? What is thy State? What is thy Frame? Whither art thou going? And where art thou like to be lodg'd throughout Eternal Ages?</hi> Mens being so indisposed unto this Action, I tell you truely, tis an horrible and a wonderful thing!</p>
                  <p>Sirs, Deny not unto your own Souls, this piece of <hi>Duty,</hi> of Prudence, and of Justice. But shall I know describe to you, the <hi>Process of the Work,</hi> whereto I Exhort you? Give your Attention, and Hear, how you should proceed, in your Self Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination First, When you set about it,

Oh, Let it be, with very great Solemnity, with very great Sollicitude. It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, Psal. 4 4 <hi>Commune with your own Hearts, and stand in Awe. Self Examination</hi> is a very <hi>Awful</hi> Service of Religion. When you go to <hi>Commune</hi> with your selves, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have the Fear of God, you must <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider</hi> with your selves, How <hi>Easy</hi> a thing, and how <hi>fearful</hi> a thing tis for you, to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> your selves. Oh, <hi>Consider</hi> this, and <hi>Stand in Awe!</hi> When you are <hi>Examining</hi> your selves, you are about the most <hi>Weighty Undertaking</hi> that ever you took in hand. Affect your own Hearts, with the <hi>Weight</hi> of the undertaking. The case to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered is no less than this; <hi>What is like to become of me throughout Eternal Ages?</hi> You never had a case of such moment under Consideration!

                  <p>
                     <hi>What is that Glorious HEAVEN, where to Heavenly Spirits, do go away?</hi>

                  <p>Now the <hi>First Answer</hi> which I have to give you, and the <hi>Fit Answer,</hi> is, That on this side of <hi>Heaven</hi> you must not Expect a <hi>Full Answer.</hi> The Things of <hi>Heaven</hi> are such as are pronounced by one that had been there; a Cor 12.4 <hi>Unutterable Things.</hi> Our Notions of Things, while we are on

We must confess, 1 Cor. 2 9 <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that Love Him.</hi> They are, as one well sayes, <hi>Far more above the highest Ascent of our Thoughts than the Marriage Feast of a King, exceeds in magnificence, the Imagination of one that has alwayes lived in an obscure Village, that never saw any ornaments of State, nor tasted wine in his life.</hi> The most Effectual, and the most compendious way, to learn what <hi>Heaven</hi> is, will be, by <hi>Religion</hi> to walk in the way to <hi>Heaven. Scies cum Fies.</hi> Let us make sure of <hi>Heaven,</hi> by the methods plainly enough described in the Word of God, &amp; it will not be long before we shall have a very comfortable Description of <hi>Heaven</hi> made unto us; even in our own Admissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Comforts of it.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless, we do know something a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Heaven;</hi> and the Sum of what we know, is thus much.</p>

In general: The principal Character of <hi>Heaven</hi> to be considered with us, is, The most intimate and eternal Consummation of that <hi>Union,</hi> with God, into which He has pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We shall there <hi>Behold the Face of God in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and be Satisfied with His Likeness.</hi> The <hi>New Testament</hi> has told us.

Let is gaze a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the several <hi>Stars</hi> that Glitter in this our Scriptural Account of it.</p>
                  <p>First, In <hi>Heaven</hi> there is granted a very Immediate <hi>Sight</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. God in His Everlasting <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> that a <hi>Man</hi> should be personally, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

unto His own Second Person forever, did also Decree, that certain <hi>other men</hi> should be given unto this most Glorious <hi>Man,</hi> to be with Hi <hi>Angels,</hi> the Spectators and partakers of His <hi>Glory.</hi> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST now mentions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Heaven</hi> then, they <hi>see</hi> that Man, who is <hi>God</hi> as well as <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>in whom there dwells the Fulness of the Godhead Bodily</hi> a They <hi>see</hi> that <hi>Man,</hi> who once appeared in the <hi>Form of a Servant,</hi> but now is <hi>Highly Exalted with a Name about every Name:</hi> They <hi>see</hi> that <hi>Man,</hi> who Sits <hi>down at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High, Sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>Scepter</hi> of the Universe. They <hi>see</hi> Him, with Eternal Transport! And as it is in the Enjoying of the <hi>Light,</hi> the Enjoyment that one man has of it, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not, abates not the Enjoyment of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; So in this <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> the Sight of the <hi>altogether Lovely</hi> Lord JESUS CHRIST Enjoy'd by one Saint, is no Hindrance to the <hi>Sight</hi> which

another <hi>Saint</hi> has of Him, or to his <hi>Joy</hi> in the <hi>Sight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, In and by the <hi>Sight</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD communicates of HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELF unto His Chosen, with never-ending <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <hi>Sun</hi> of that <hi>Heaven,</hi> which we are hoping for; It is said of Him, Mal.4 2. He is the <hi>Sun of Righteousness, that has Healing in His Wings.</hi> Now all <hi>Heaven</hi> is Irradiated with that <hi>Sun of Righteousness.</hi> The Rayes of that <hi>Sun</hi> are darted all over the Vast Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Realms of Bliss, and all the Saints of Heaven, do greedily take in those <hi>Rayes,</hi> with <hi>Joy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> The Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in the Oracles of the Sacred Scripture, is, <hi>

When we come near to our Lord JESUS CHRIST in <hi>Heaven,</hi> we shall in Him see the <hi>Face of God;</hi> and see the <hi>Face of God</hi> shining with a Lustre infinitely beyond that on the <hi>Face of Moses:</hi> the <hi>Face of Moses</hi> coming down from the Mount, was a dark Thing in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison

of it. Hence we read, 2 Cor. 4 6 <hi>There is Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi> No <hi>mortal</hi> Eye were able to behold a Sight so full of Majesty: The Disciple who lay next Him at His Table while He was on Earth, after He was gone to Heaven Swoon'd away at the sight of Him: <hi>His Countenance was as the Sum shining is his meridian.</hi> But is this all?

It is the Lord JESUS CHRIST, that is the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> in the <hi>midst of that paradise;</hi> as the famous Tree so called at the Beginning, was, in the midst of the <hi>Innocent stand of Eden:</hi> And indeed, wherever <hi>He</hi> is, His being there, is enough to make <hi>Paradise.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly; Those bright Regions, that are the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> are the very <hi>best Rooms</hi> of the whose Creation, though the <hi>Upper Stories</hi> of is. <hi>Heaven</hi> for this cause is called, <hi>The Throne of God.</hi> We read, Psal. 11 4. <hi>The Lords Throne is in Heaven.</hi> Certainly, <hi>The Throne of God</hi> must be the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001127_0091_0FB064CB5D921D38"/>
most Glorious Place that can be! Of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> it is said, <hi>It was the Glory of all Lands,</hi> Much more, may it be said of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Yea, Tis the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> where our Lord JESUS CHRIST fits upon His Throne that is. The most Excellent <hi>Heaven</hi> of all Indeed, the <hi>Heaven</hi> of the Blessed, contains vast <hi>Regions</hi> in it: <hi>There are many Mansions,</hi> yea, there are <hi>many Regions,</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly Country.</hi> The <hi>Earth,</hi> although it be above one and twenty Thousand Miles in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, is but a small Point, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto <hi>Heaven;</hi> perhaps t'would be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible to one Station'd there.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly; The Chosen of God shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their <hi>Heaven,</hi> in <hi>more than One Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Place.</hi> For, there will a Time come, when our <hi>Heaven</hi> shall be within our <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosphere,</hi> in the Higher parts of this <hi>Air,</hi> and nor many miles from this <hi>Earth,</hi> for at least, a <hi>Thousand years</hi> together. It will be thus, during the <hi>Day of Judgment;</hi> yea, if that <hi>Thousand years,</hi> (which <hi>according to the promise, we look for!)</hi> make but the <hi>Morning</hi> to the <hi>Day of Judgment,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say, How long we may see <hi>Heaven</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue within this our <hi>Atmosphere.</hi> Tis said, 2 Pet. 3. 13. <hi>We look for New Heavens.</hi>
                     <pb n="87" facs="unknown:001127_0092_0FB064CE7301C8F8"/>
as well as <hi>New Earth;</hi> which will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently be after the Descent of our Lord. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, will then with His <hi>Holy Myriads,</hi> dispossess the <hi>Devils</hi> of the <hi>high places,</hi> which are at present occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by the <hi>power of the Air.</hi> These <hi>high places</hi> will then be possessed by our Lord Jesus Christ, having the <hi>City of God come down</hi> thither with Him, where the Saints then Living will all be <hi>caught up to meet Him Heaven</hi> will then be <hi>there,</hi> dispensing of <hi>Heavenly Influences,</hi> to the <hi>New World,</hi> until the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall carry His <hi>Armies</hi> away from thence, Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self marching in the Head of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto His other <hi>Heavens.</hi>

                     <hi>Who are the</hi> HEAVENLY SPIRITS, <hi>that go away to this Heaven?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tis to be thus Answered</p>
                  <p>First, The ANGELS of the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>Revisit Heaven.</hi> when they have dispatched the <hi>particular Services</hi> which they have to do for Him on <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> are the <hi>Natives</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> those <hi>Morning Stars</hi> have <hi>their own Habitation</hi> there; those <hi>Sons of God</hi> are Lodg'd in that their <hi>Fathers House.</hi> Where the <hi>

                  <p>Secondly; The SOULS of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful among the Children of men, having <hi>Finished the Work,</hi> which the Lord Jesus Christ has ordered them to do on <hi>Earth,</hi> do then also <hi>Ascend into Heaven.</hi> There are some among the Children of men, whom the powerful Spirit of God hath overcome, to <hi>Believe</hi> on the Influences of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for their safe Arrival to <hi>Heaven</hi> at the last. Those that have thus given themselves unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in <hi>Believing</hi> on Him, have a <hi>Work</hi> to do, in gratitude unto their Lord Redeemer, before they come to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Such <hi>Believers</hi> are by the <hi>Sanctifying Grace</hi> of the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>male meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> And when these Holy Believers Dy, the <hi>Angels</hi> of the Lord carry and convoy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their <hi>Spirits</hi> to be with Him in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> They are no sooner <hi>Departed</hi> but, Phil. 1 23 <hi>They are with Christ, where to be is by far the best of all</hi> There were mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Angels,</hi> that upon a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, were Banished from Heaven.</p>

Oh! methinks, I see the <hi>Angels</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> waiting for the Saints that are coming in; When the Soul of any one gets in, all <hi>Heaven</hi> is in Musick, and there is <hi>Joy among the Angels of God</hi> There is a <hi>shout for Joy</hi> among them, <hi>Welcome, O Soul Victorious over all the Enemies that would have kept thee cut of Heaven!

of it. And the Express word of the Lord JESUS CHRIST assures us, <hi>There is no Killing of the Soul.</hi> [See also, Luk. 16. 9. &amp; Rom 8 10. The <hi>Consent of Souls</hi> in all sensible Nations, unto the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> is nothing else, but an Impression which the Maker of the <hi>Soul</hi> has made upon it; and it is infallible. And the <hi>presage</hi> which the <hi>Spirits</hi> of men often have of their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Bodies,</hi> at such or such a Time, very punctually &amp; marvellously accomplished, plainly argues, that they out live the <hi>Bodies.</hi> Now, the <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> upon a Godly <hi>Soul,</hi> bespeaks an <hi>Heavenly World</hi> for such a <hi>Soul,</hi> at its Departure. The <hi>Grace</hi> wrought in a Godly Soul, shall never Dy; No, It abides for ever. But if the <hi>Soul</hi> Dy, the Work of <hi>Grace</hi> upon it, would also Dy. It is a great principle of Christianity, <hi>That when we are Absent from the Body, we shall be Present with the Lord.</hi> Now, to demonstrate this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, what a proof does the Apostle bring? 2 Cor. 5. 5. <hi>He that hath wrought us for this self same thing, is God.</hi> A <hi>Soul,</hi> that has a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> upon it, is, <hi>A Vessel prepared for Glory</hi> And shall not this <hi>Vessel</hi> now be <hi>received up to Glory?</hi> A <hi>Soul</hi> having been by the rare <hi>Workmanship of God Created unto

good Works,</hi> He will not throw by this <hi>Workmanship,</hi> into the useless Rubbish of <hi>Non Entity,</hi> we may be sure of it.

They don't Remember, <hi>Who made</hi> them, and <hi>why</hi> He <hi>made</hi> them, nor consider the <hi>Errand</hi> which He that <hi>made</hi> them, sent them into the

World upon; and they don't Return to their <hi>Maker</hi> from those wayes of Sin, for which they feel Him chastising of them.</p>
                  <p>There now follows a Clause, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it, a mighty Encouragement unto <hi>Repentance</hi> under <hi>Affliction;</hi> He <hi>giveth Songs in the Night.</hi> By the <hi>Night</hi> seems to be meant, A Time of <hi>Affliction:</hi> And by, <hi>the Songs</hi> given in this <hi>Night,</hi> seem to be meant, Matters of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which God has provided. But for whom are they provided? Even for those that under <hi>Affliction,</hi> say, <hi>Where is God my Maker?</hi> i. e. That Seek Him, and Serve Him, as their <hi>Maker,</hi> and seriously <hi>Repent</hi> of all their Wandrings from Him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men forget the <hi>Law of their Creation.</hi> In the Original 'tis, <hi>My Makers;</hi> A Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intimation of the <hi>Trinity</hi> in God E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>As now;</p>
                  <p>First; A <hi>Time of Affliction,</hi> is very suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly called, <hi>A</hi> night <hi>of Affliction.</hi> The <hi>Trouble</hi> and the <hi>Terror,</hi> which the <hi>Night</hi> brings with it, is but a <hi>Shadow</hi> of That which by <hi>Affliction</hi> comes upon us.

It was of old said, <hi>if He give Quietness, who can make Trouble?</hi> If there be any <hi>Trouble</hi> upon us, it could not have come without His Direction.

                  </p>
                  <p>We may now Enquire.</p>
                  <p>First, What <hi>Affliction</hi> it is, that may make a <hi>Night</hi> unto the Children of God?</p>
                  <p>Now, tis plain; That the <hi>Withdraw</hi> of our <hi>Comfortable Enjoyments,</hi> is Enough to make a <hi>Night</hi> for us. When God brings upon us any Lamentable Bereavements of our <hi>Comfortable Enjoyments,</hi> we may say; Lam 3 6 <hi>He hath set me in dark places.</hi> It was a <hi>Night</hi> with <hi>Jacob,</hi> it was a <hi>Night</hi> with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it was a <hi>Night</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> when his <hi>Children</hi> were taken from him, and it was a <hi>Night</hi> with <hi>Job,</hi> when his <hi>Riches</hi> as well as his <hi>Children</hi> were taken from him, and <hi>Sickness</hi> within, and <hi>Censure</hi> abroad, was also hard upon him.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but it adds unto the Circumstances of the <hi>Night</hi> with us, when we are utterly <hi>at a Loss,</hi> which way to take, what course to steer; when we <hi>Grope as in the Dark,</hi> to find the methods of our Safety. Tis a <hi>Night</hi> with us, when we are <hi>in the Dark,</hi>
                     <pb n="116" facs="unknown:001127_0121_0FB06787EDA17908"/>
and <hi>at a Loss,</hi> what we shall do, that we may not <hi>Stumble into Mischief.</hi> How full of <hi>Night,</hi> is that <hi>Affliction,</hi> wherein a man must say, Job 19. 8. <hi>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and He hath set Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in my pathes!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Night</hi> is yet more <hi>Night some</hi> unto us, when we are Surrounded and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with cruel <hi>Enemies,</hi> on every side of us. We read, Psal. 104 20, 21. <hi>Thou mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Darkness, and it is Night, wherein all the Beasts of the Forest do creep forth; The young Lions roar after their Prey.</hi> It is a <hi>Night</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when God lets loose <hi>Wild Beasts</hi> upon us, to Worry us, with fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ous and raging Persecutions. It was a <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Egyptian Darkness,</hi> when <hi>Evil Spirits</hi> were let loose, to molest and affright the Objects of their <hi>Indignation.</hi> What is it, when men mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly filled with, and acted by <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> are let loose to buffet us, with all the Effects of a most Venemous Malice against us?</p>
                  <p>But, finally, That which will make our <hi>Night,</hi> as <hi>Dark</hi> as the <hi>Shadow of Death</hi> it self, will be, If God withdraw the <hi>Light of His Countenance</hi> from us, and withold from us the Influences of His <hi>Grace,</hi> which are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Support and Quicken us. <hi>God is
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:001127_0122_0FB0678950DAF100"/>
Light;</hi> and the Gracious Presence of <hi>God,</hi> would make <hi>Day</hi> for His People at <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night.</hi> But if <hi>God hide his Face,</hi> then, then Indeed we have a dismal <hi>Night</hi> of it. We then truly, <hi>Walk in Darkness, and see no Light.</hi> Our Groans may then, if ever, be those; Psal. 88. 6. 7. Lord, <hi>Thou hast laid me in Darkness; Thy wrath lieth hard upon me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We may Enquire,</p>
                  <p>Next; Why the Holy God, will bring <hi>Night of Affliction</hi> upon any of His Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                  <p>In one Word; It is to give us Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for our <hi>Songs in the Night.</hi> God will <hi>Glorify</hi> Himself, in and by, every <hi>Night of Affliction</hi> that He sends upon us. And God is never more <hi>Glorified,</hi> than by have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Graces</hi> of His Children Exercised in their Affliction. But the <hi>Graces</hi> of good men are Exercised, in their <hi>Singing the Songs</hi> that God has given them. This therefore brings us to a further Entertainment.</p>
                  <p n="2">II There are glorious Matters of <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> and <hi>Consolation,</hi> which the Children of God are to make their Songs in the <hi>Night</hi> of their <hi>Affliction.</hi> There are the <hi>Songs of Zion,</hi> which are prepared by God
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001127_0123_0FB0678C964AFC48"/>
for the <hi>Sons of Zion;</hi> and some of them are peculiarly calculated for the <hi>Night.</hi> As it was said, Psal. 119. 54. <hi>Thy Statutes have been my Songs, in the House of my Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage:</hi> Thus, the <hi>Statutes</hi> of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, of matters for our <hi>Songs,</hi> in the <hi>Night of our Affliction. Davids</hi> Harp never founded better than in the <hi>Night</hi> and upon the <hi>Water.</hi> More particularly.</p>
                  <p>First, It is a Song to be Sung in the <hi>Night</hi> of our Affliction, <hi>That the Great God is the First Cause of our Affliction.</hi> This was the <hi>Song</hi> of that Excellent man, Job 5. 6. 8. <hi>Affliction cometh not forth of the Dust, neither doth Trouble spring out of the Ground: I would seek unto God,</hi> when it comes. Who is it that sends upon us all our <hi>Darkness?</hi> Tis that God, of whom we have that <hi>Song,</hi> Amos 4. 13. <hi>Lo, Tis He that makes the morning Darkness, the LORD, the God of Hosts is His Name.</hi> We are too prone, in the <hi>Night</hi> of our Affliction, to look upon <hi>Second Causes;</hi> and especially if Rational and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious <hi>Instruments</hi> have been concerned in our <hi>Affliction.</hi> But it will be a very <hi>dark Night</hi> indeed with us, if we can't see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Second Causes.</hi> Oh, Let us look thro' all the <hi>Darkness,</hi> unto the Great GOD, as
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:001127_0124_0FB0678EE91FF440"/>
the <hi>First Cause</hi> of all; And let this be our <hi>Song</hi> in the <hi>Night: Though Clouds and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be round about Him, yet Righteousness &amp; Judgment are the Habitation of His Throne.</hi> Though <hi>Instruments</hi> be very deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in our Affliction, yet the <hi>Song</hi> of a <hi>Job</hi> will be, <hi>The Lord has taken away!</hi> the <hi>Song</hi> of a <hi>David</hi> will be, <hi>The Lord has bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them!</hi> It is an admirably well tuned <hi>Song,</hi> that we find with the <hi>Sweet singer of Israel:</hi> Psal. 39. 9. Lord, <hi>I was Dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, this is a <hi>Song,</hi> which has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable matters of Satisfaction in it. There are many <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Song.</hi> We are with particular Descants to <hi>Sing</hi> upon the several <hi>Glories</hi> of our <hi>Maker;</hi> the <hi>maker</hi> who has <hi>given us our Songs!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sovereignty of God, must be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> This was the <hi>Song,</hi> of one who had his lovely Children taken away from him; Job 9. 12. <hi>Behold, He taketh away; who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him, what doest thou?</hi> We strangely Multiply and Aggravate our <hi>Griefs,</hi> while we resolve to call Things, <hi>Our own.</hi> Tis to make them our <hi>Idols;</hi> &amp; <hi>Idols</hi> will be <hi>Griefs.</hi> In the <hi>Night,</hi> let us
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001127_0125_0FB0679000D8B490"/>
come to See and <hi>Sing,</hi> Who is the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, Unlimited, Uncontrourable <hi>Owner</hi> of us, and all that we have. Our <hi>Song</hi> most be This: <q>I am absolutely at the Dispose of the Soveraign God! I and mine are in His Hands, as Clay before the Porter: Oh! Let not me, a sorry Potsherd of the Earth, strive with my Maker, the God of Heaven. Let my Will submit, and be for ever melted and moulded into the Will of God: O my Soul, Be thou in Subjection unto the Father of Spirits, and Live!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again; The Righteousness of God, must be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> This was the <hi>Song</hi> of an afflicted Prophet, Dan. 9. 14. <hi>The Lord hath brought the Evil upon us; the Lord our God is Righteous in all the works which He doeth; for we have not obey'd His voice.</hi> If a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his <hi>Night,</hi> could say, <hi>The Lord is Righteous, and I am Wicked;</hi> much more will a Christian, who is less <hi>Wicked,</hi> say so. We should come to be of a Thoughtful Temper, when God is Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stising of us, and think, <hi>He does it not for nothing!</hi> Our <hi>Song</hi> should now be of this Tenour; <hi>Since the most Righteous One is Laying His Hand upon me, Oh, Let me Search
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:001127_0126_0FB06792B816E300"/>
and Try my wayes and Humble my self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him and obtain the pardon of my Sins, and Reform all that is amiss! And why should I now complain for the punishment of my Sins? Lord, my wayes are not equal, but thy wayes are always equal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more; The Power of God, must be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> This was the <hi>Song</hi> of that Great Saint in his Affliction; Job 42. 2. <hi>I know, that thou canst do every thing.</hi> What can better be Realized in the <hi>Night,</hi> than the <hi>Power</hi> of that Almighty Creator, who first of all <hi>divided the Light from the Darkness, and called the Darkness Night.</hi> He that could Raise a <hi>Job</hi> from a Dunghil; He that could Raise an <hi>Hezekiah</hi> from a Sick-bed; He that could give unto an <hi>Amaziah,</hi> much <hi>more than all that he Lost;</hi> What can't He do for us, in the <hi>Night</hi> that is come upon us? Our <hi>Song</hi> should now be of this Purport, <q>That Powerful God, who hath caused my Sun to go down at Noon, can cause it also to Rise at midnight with me. My God can make me glad, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Dayes wherein He hath afflicted me, and the Years wherein
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001127_0127_0FB06793BB421EC8"/>
I have seen Evil. Be my Case never so Dark, the Lord my God can En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten my Darkness. Be my Case ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so Hard, there is nothing too Hard for the Lord. Be I brought never so Low, the Lord that Raises the Dead, can Raise me up.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Once more; the wisdom of God, must be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> You may hear that <hi>Song</hi> in the mouth of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Saint; Psal. 119 75. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are Right, and that thou in Faithfulness hast afflicted me.</hi> In the <hi>Night,</hi> we are in the <hi>Dark,</hi> about the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the <hi>Design,</hi> and the <hi>Issue</hi> of our Troubles. But the <hi>Wisdom of God</hi> sees all things in a <hi>True Light.</hi> It is <hi>Wisely</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that in the Division of <hi>Time,</hi> there should be <hi>Night</hi> as well as <hi>Day.</hi> How cheerfully may we refer and resign every thing, to that God, whose <hi>Understanding is Infinite!</hi> Our <hi>Song</hi> then should run much upon such <hi>Notes</hi> as these; <q>The All wise God sees, that some Night, and not all Day, is best for me. O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in thy Dealings with me? In wisdom hast thou done them all. Thou knowest,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001127_0128_0FB0679764E269D0"/>
when I want Affliction, and what Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is fittest for me. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, When, and How to deliver me out of my Affliction. And thou knowest, How and Where to make my Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on profitable.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore; The Merry of God should be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> You may hear that <hi>Song,</hi> in the mouth of the Afflicted Church; Lam 3. 22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause His Compassions fail not.</hi> In the <hi>Night</hi> we are easily Terrified. How apt are we to take up Terrible Apprehensions, when the <hi>Night</hi> comes upon us: <hi>Has the Lord forgotten to be gracious? Is His Mercy clean gone? Hath He shut up His Tender Mercies in Anger?</hi> But let us not make <hi>rash conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> from our <hi>Sharp Corrections.</hi> Our <hi>Song</hi> should be of such a strain as this; <q>The merciful God punishes me far less than my Iniquities have deserved; and tho' He bereave me of some Comforts, yet He leaves me still a thousand more Comforts than Sorrows. Nor does my Affliction by God, argue my Rejection from God: No, my Affliction ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Finally; The fullness of God should be our <hi>Song in the Night.</hi> It was the <hi>Song</hi> of the Prophet; Hab. 3. 18. <hi>Though the Fields shall yield no meat, yet I will Rejoyce in the Lord, I will Joy in the God of my Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> When every thing else has left us, and by leaving us, hath made a <hi>Night</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, <hi>Now</hi> 'tis a Time for us to Sing, <hi>The Lord is my Light,</hi> The <hi>Alsufficiency</hi> of God, should be the Retreat, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of our Souls, in the <hi>Night;</hi> when we Lose the Sight of all Creatures &amp; can see nothing of them except their <hi>Insufficiency.</hi> Now strike up for such a <hi>Song</hi> as this; <q>I know, that my Redeemer Lives; What tho' I see a Death upon all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Enjoyments? The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul, and I will hope in Him, when all other things do fail me. While I have God and Christ for my Portion, I have a Goodly Heritage. Whatever be taken away from me. Here,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:001127_0130_0FB0679C0E526D78"/>
Here I have a Good part that cannot be taken away! Why should I be so troubled for the breaking and spilling of my little Earthen Cups! I have a Living Fountain still to repair unto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then, Secondly; It is a Song to be Sung in the <hi>Night</hi> of our Affliction; <hi>That no little Good will be the Effect of our Affliction.</hi> This was the <hi>Song</hi> of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man; Psal. 119 71. <hi>Tis Good for me that I should be Afflicted.</hi> When we are in the <hi>Night</hi> of our Affliction, we are much in the <hi>Dark</hi> oftentimes about the meaning of it. But let no Darkness hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from that <hi>Construction</hi> of all Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Gen 50. 20. <hi>God has meant it unto Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST has brought us into a <hi>New Covenant:</hi> The <hi>New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> hath in it <hi>very great and precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises.</hi> These <hi>Promises</hi> are to be our <hi>Songs in the Night.</hi> Is it not <hi>promised? The Lord will not suffer us to be Tempted above what we are Able.</hi> Is it not <hi>promised? All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; unto such as keep His Covenant, and His Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Is it not <hi>promised? They that Sow in Tears, shall Reap in Joy;</hi> And, <hi>Light is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:001127_0131_0FB0679F1972A218"/>
sown for the Righteous, and Joy for the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righ in Heart.</hi> These, even such as These, are to be our <hi>Songs, all the Night long.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Gain</hi> of our Affliction, is a <hi>Song</hi> that hath considerable matters of Consolation in it. Let us make a brief <hi>Descant</hi> upon some of them.</p>
                  <p>First, We may make it our <hi>Song in the Night; That our God Loves us too well, to burt us in the worst that He shall do unto us.</hi> We have such a <hi>Song</hi> prepared for us; Heb 12 6. <hi>Whom the Lord Loveth, He Chasteneth.</hi> What are the most afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dispensations, but <hi>Fatherly,</hi> but <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal?</hi> When we can sigh perhaps with the Psalmist, <hi> I am afflicted very much:</hi> Yet let us also <hi>Sing, In whose Hands am I all this while? In the Hands of the best Friend that ever I had! In the Hands of a God, that hath Loved me very much; a God that hath for me, an Everlasting Love, and is now but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting for me the purposes of His Love.</hi> Our Afflictions may be with a <hi>Song;</hi> Why, Because they are without a <hi>Sting.</hi> The <hi>Curse</hi> and the <hi>Sting</hi> of all our Afflictions, hath fallen upon our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Day when <hi>God laid upon Him the Iniquity of us all,</hi> and when He cried out,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:001127_0132_0FB067A253E66028"/>
                     <hi>I am the man that hath seen Affliction by the Rod of His wrath.</hi> We may <hi>Sing</hi> under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our <hi>Disgrace; My Lord Jesus Christ we despised and rejected of men</hi> We may <hi>Sing</hi> under all our <hi>Straits; My Lord Jesus Christ had not an House where to lay His Head.</hi> We may <hi>Sing</hi> under all our <hi>Pains; My Lord Jesus Christ was feeble and sorely broken.</hi> Under all our <hi>Temptations,</hi> We may Sing, <hi>My Lord Jesus Christ was in all points Tempted like unto us; except only in sin.</hi> We may behold our Lord Jesus Christ, as by all these His <hi>Expiatory Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> taking upon Himself the Vengeance of God, which was due to us for our <hi>Sins;</hi> &amp; hence it comes to pass that there is not that vengeance now to Embitter <hi>our Sufferings.</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ hath <hi>Reconciled</hi> God unto us; and so none of His Dispensations are now the Blows of an <hi>Enemy</hi> and a <hi>Revenger.</hi> It may then be our <hi>Song;</hi> 
                     <q>Lord, I will praise thee; for though thou wast Angry with me, thine Anger is turned away; and this doth comfort me, even when thou dost Afflict me. My Lord JESUS CHRIST hath given me to stand before God, in His perfect and spotless Righteousness,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001127_0133_0FB067A38E493618"/>
and no Evil shall happen to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again; We may make it our <hi>Song in the Night, That the worst that ever happens unto us, will be</hi> for our Good. We have such a <hi>Song</hi> prepared for us; Rom 8. 28. <hi>All things shall work together for Good, unto them that Love God.</hi> See and Sing the <hi>Mystery of Providence!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most certainly, 'Tis <hi>Good</hi> for us to be made Acquainted with the Concerns of <hi>Experimental Religion.</hi> Well; Our <hi>Night</hi> comes, that we may see the bright <hi>Stars</hi> of Christianity. Our God will shut us up in the <hi>Dark,</hi> that He may cure our <hi>Madness.</hi> It was the <hi>Song;</hi> Psal 94. 12. <hi>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. Let it be <hi>Our Song in the Night;</hi> 
                     <q>God is now making me a better infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Christian than ever I was in my Life; God is making me more thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand, that Christ is precious, and Sin is odious, and my Heart is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, and all things here below are but Vanities and Vexations.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most certainly, Tis <hi>Good</hi> for us to be Restrained from <hi>Sin,</hi> and have <hi>Sin</hi> Destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:001127_0134_0FB067A9E83CFAC8"/>
in us. Well; our <hi>Night</hi> comes upon us, to keep us from the <hi>Works of Darkness.</hi> God sends our <hi>Night</hi> upon us, to make us <hi>Children of the Day.</hi> It was the <hi>Song;</hi> Isa. 27. 9. <hi>By this will Iniquity be purged, and all the Fruit is to take away sin.</hi> Accordingly, let it be our <hi>Song in the Night;</hi> 
                     <q>God is now making my Sin bitter to me; All this Bitterness comes upon me, that so my Sin may be the more Embittered. God Kills my little Delights; Tis that my Sin may dye, and that my soul may live.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Most certainly, Tis <hi>Good</hi> for us to be made more <hi>Gracious,</hi> and in the acting of <hi>Grace</hi> to be made more <hi>Fruitful.</hi> Well, our <hi>Night</hi> comes upon us, that so, the <hi>Dowes of Heaven</hi> may more fall upon our Souls. God visits us with a <hi>Night;</hi> but it is that so He may <hi>Awake</hi> us out of our <hi>Sleep.</hi> It was the <hi>Song;</hi> Heb. 12 10. <hi>He chastens us for our profit, that we might be partakers of His Holiness.</hi> Accordingly, Let it be our <hi>Song in the Night;</hi> 
                     <q>What is my God now a doing? He is now making my Faith more Assur'd, my Hope more Lively my Love more Ardent, my Prayer more Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, my Patience more Confirm'd, and
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001127_0135_0FB067AB00C7C888"/>
my whole Obedience more Exact. God is hewing and squaring of me, to render me a more Serviceable Stone in His Temple, and throwing me into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, that I may come out a vessel of more Honour to Himself.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally; The <hi>Songs of Deliverance;</hi> why should not they be heard with us? We may make it our <hi>Song in the Night, That it will</hi> not always <hi>be Night; the Night will</hi> not always <hi>last.</hi> We have such a <hi>Song</hi> prepared for us; Psal. 30. 5. <hi>Weeping may Endure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning.</hi> Be the <hi>Night</hi> never so tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it won't be long before <hi>the Day break, and the Dark shadows flee away.</hi> Of <hi>Heaven</hi> we read, <hi>There is no Night in that City of God.</hi> In all our <hi>Nights</hi> on <hi>Earth,</hi> we should Solace our selves with the <hi>Songs</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Yea, we should count it alwayes <hi>Night</hi> with us, till we come to <hi>Heaven.</hi> In this passage, <hi>Where is God my Maker, who giveth Songs in the Night?</hi> some have thought a special Reference to the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which the Dead <hi>Saints</hi> are with <hi>Songs</hi> waiting for. In the <hi>Night</hi> of our Afflictions, what fitter <hi>Songs</hi> can we have, than the Blessedness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for us in the <hi>Resurrection World!</hi> Be
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:001127_0136_0FB067AD2883FE78"/>
our Afflictions never so long, they are <hi>but for a Moment;</hi> The Thought of this may procure it, That be they never so <hi>heavy,</hi> they shall be <hi>but Light Afflictions.</hi> It may then be our <hi>Song;</hi> 
                     <q>O Lord. How long! Yet a little while, and He that shall come, will come. It won't be long! My God is by my Troubles now fitting me for the Rest which remains for His People. All the Discipline that my God uses upon me, is only to ripen me for my Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Heavenly State. In a little while, I shall pass from the Bread of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, to the Feast in the Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of God; I shall pass from the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Adversity, to the River of Gods pleasure; I shall pass from the Annoyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Devils, to the Entertainments of Angels; and from the Shadow of Death, to that Favour of God which is better than Life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We will proceed no farther; who can proceed any farther? Let these things Expire in this</p>

                        <q>Lord, Thou art He, who hast Chosen me before the Foundation of the World, and predestinated me to an Inheritance among thy Children, world without End. <hi>Lord,</hi> Thou art He who hast so Loved the World, as to give thy only Begotten Son, for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them whom thou hast Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen out of it. <hi>Lord,</hi> Thou art He, that hast Created all things, and for thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they are and were Created: Thou art my Maker too, and thou shalt be my Father.</q> Let our Thoughts more distinctly Converse with God the SON; and let these be our <hi>Songs: Lord,</hi> 
                        <q>Thou art He, who art God manifest in Flesh, and in that Flesh hast thou died for me, and Rison from the Dead, and art Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to Glory. <hi>Lord,</hi> Thou art He, who being the Son of God, and

equal with God, hast appeared in the Form of a Servant, and tho' thou didst make the Law, yet thou hast for us yielded Obedience to the Law. <hi>Lord,</hi> Thou art my Redeemer, who taking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy self my Guiltiness, when thou didst know no Sin, hast given thy Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness to me, who am nothing but Sin: Thou art able to Save unto the uttermost, and thou shalt be my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</q> Once more; Let our Thoughts more distinctly Converse with God the SPIRIT; and let our <hi>Songs</hi> be these <hi>Lord.</hi>

A Friend, that saw the word, Enquired, <hi>Who?</hi> and he so answered the Enquiry, CHRIST LIVETH! <hi>And if He did not, I should not my self one minute longer desire to Live.</hi> Well thought, and like a <hi>Christian!</hi> It is a Thought which I am this Day to manage among you; and if some <hi>Dying</hi> Circumstances in my own Family do <hi>Quicken</hi> me to manage it, with a more <hi>Lively</hi> Inculcation, 'twill be some Ease to me, that my <hi>Sorrow</hi> proves in any measure a <hi>Service</hi> unto others, and that my <hi>Ministry</hi> receives any Advantage by my <hi>Affliction.</hi>

                  <p>An unknown <hi>Penman</hi> hath in a curious <hi>Poem,</hi> drawn up for us, a Real and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous<hi> History,</hi> of the unusual <hi>Calamities,</hi> and amazing <hi>Deliverances,</hi> that befel an Excellent Person in <hi>Arabia,</hi> some Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of years ago. Some Conferences between this Renowned person, and some of his Friends that gave him a Friendly Visit, in his Calamities, are in this Book related. Their unkind Censures of him, and bitter Speeches to him, were not the least part of his Calamities; but in this Chapter we have something of his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.

One thing in their Charge upon him, was, That <hi>he knew not God:</hi> &amp; now, to vindicate himself against so unjust a Charge, he declares his Belief, not only in GOD, but also in His promised <hi>Messi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> by whom he Expected a <hi>Resurrection from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Words now before us, are accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly a short and sweet <hi>Confession of Faith,</hi> whereto I am sure, you will all Subscribe, O <hi>Faithful</hi> people of God! It was wished concerning them, <hi>O that they were Printed in a Book!</hi> They are so, and blessed be our Great Lord <hi>Redeemer,</hi> that they are so!</p>
                  <p>Indeed, there are some Interpreters, not only <hi>Jewish,</hi> but also <hi>Christian,</hi> who, to their shame we may speak it, are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as bad as the <hi>Jewish,</hi> that go to fix a Signification of meer <hi>Temporal Benefits,</hi> on that Expectation of <hi>Job,</hi> which we are here Entertained withal. But it is from <hi>Ignorance</hi> of Antiquity, to say no worse of it, that such Interpreters, go to rob us, of the <hi>Evangelical Mysteries,</hi> in these ancient Oracles of God. And we know they do directly contradict the plain Expressions of <hi>Job.</hi> whom we find every where utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Despairing of ever being Restored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to the <hi>Temporal Benefits</hi> of his Family in this world any more. They would Rob our <hi>Job,</hi> it seems, of his <hi>Faith</hi> too; worse <hi>Robbers</hi> then the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> who only plundered him of his Cattel. No, It was long ago, the just Admiration of <hi>Jerom, That</hi> Job <hi>long before the coming of the Messiah, spoke as clearly of Him, as they that Liv'd after His Coming.</hi> Holy <hi>Job</hi> was no Stranger to that Illustrious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, Gen. 3. 15. <hi>The Seed of the Woman shall break the Serpents Head.</hi> And he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, That <hi>God</hi> would one Day be <hi>Manifest in Flesh,</hi> for the <hi>Redemption,</hi> of Sinful man, from the wretchedness that Sin had brought upon him.

                  <p>But the Notions of, <hi>A Redeemer,</hi> implied in the Hebrew Name here used by the Holy Spirit, have a peculiar Elegancy in them.

not do? to rescue us from our Miseries!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Know,</hi> Next; That our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath paid the <hi>price</hi> of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> from the Enemies of our Souls. We had all of us made our selves <hi>Prisoners; Prisoners</hi> we were too in an horrible Gaol that was on a light Fire over us. The Doom which we were continually wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, was that, Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>The Soul that Sins, it shall Dy.</hi> The dreadful <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> of God, had put us over into the Hands of terrible <hi>Destroyers;</hi> a <hi>Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God,</hi> which might justly be a <hi>Terrour</hi> unto unto us, was going to be inflicted on us, by their Hands. There was no way for us to escape it, but by Laying down a <hi>price,</hi> which might make a Compensation for the wrong done by our Sin unto the Infinite GOD There needed a <hi>price,</hi> to buy off our Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to suffer the vengeance of Heaven, and to repair those Apprehensions of a <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi> God Engraved on the minds of men, which we had gone to deface. Now we are informed, I Cor. 6. 20. <hi>We are bought with a price.</hi> But, what and whose was the <hi>price</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> thus paid for us? We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, I Pet. 1. 18. <hi>Ye are Redeemed with

the precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> And we are informed, Tit. 2. 14. <hi>Jesus Christ gave Himself for us, that He might Redeem us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Know Thirdly; That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, by His Mighty <hi>Power</hi> does pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute, and accomplish our <hi>Redemption</hi> from the reach of those Enemies. Not only the <hi>Merit,</hi> of our Lord, is tendered for our <hi>Redemption,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Vertue,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of our Lord, is used, for the <hi>Application</hi> of the <hi>Redemption.</hi> We read, Col. 2. 15. <hi>He hath spoiled Powers.</hi> Our Lord <hi>Redeemer,</hi> hath, like an Illustrious Conqueror, come into the black Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, where the <hi>Powers of Darkness</hi> held us in <hi>Chains of Darkness;</hi> Whereupon there follows, <hi>A Liberty, a Liberty for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, an Opening of the Prison doors for them that were bound.</hi> By the powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Sin,</hi> upon the <hi>Wills</hi> of the <hi>Elect</hi> are taken off; they are brought out of the <hi>Unbelief,</hi> wherein they were <hi>Shut up:</hi> there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Faith</hi> wrought in their Hearts, by which they are made the actual partakers of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;</hi> &amp; so they are <hi>turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to Light, and from Satan to God,</hi> By

the <hi>Conversion</hi> of Sinners, in the <hi>Day of our Lords Power</hi> Exerted for them, there comes to pass that astonishing Things Isa 49. 24 <hi>The prey is taken from the mighty, and the lawful Captive is delivered.</hi> The <hi>Power</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is put forth, to bring the <hi>Redeemed,</hi> out of their forlorn Estate, their thraldome in <hi>Sin,</hi> their Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to <hi>Satan,</hi> their Lying under the <hi>Curse;</hi> tis done. in <hi>Converting</hi> them to God.</p>
                  <p>Know, Fourthly, That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, accomplishing of our <hi>Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> does also <hi>Revenge</hi> our Cause upon our Enemies. Our Lord most Emphatically does the part of a <hi>Redeemer</hi> for us, in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging</hi> the mischiefs, which have been done to our Souls, by our mischievous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. Have our Souls been murdered by <hi>Sin? O Sin,</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ will take a thorough <hi>Revenge</hi> upon thee. <hi>Sin</hi> that has been our <hi>Death,</hi> does it self undergo <hi>Death,</hi> by the Blood and Grace of our <hi>Lord Redeemer.</hi> We read this; Rom 6. 6. <hi>Knowing this, that the Old man is Crucifyed with Him, that the Body of Sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin.</hi> And shall <hi>Satan</hi> escape? <hi>Satan,</hi> who hath deceived us, enslaved us,

ruined us! No. <hi>Satan,</hi> thou shalt not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape the <hi>Revenge</hi> of our Great <hi>Lord Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi> We read this: Heb 2. 14. <hi>He hath destroyed him that had the power of Death, that is the Devil; and delivered us.</hi> O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>Know Fifthly; That at and by a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Resurrection from the Dead,</hi> our Lord JESUS CHRIST will bestow upon us a full <hi>Redemption</hi> from all Evils and Enemies. What means our <hi>Job,</hi> when he says, <hi>I know my Redeemer?</hi> He means, <hi>I know, that the Messiah will Raise me from the Dead at the latter Day, tho' my Reins be consumed within me, and I know, that at the Resurrection. I shall be fully Redeemed from all that may be grievous to me</hi> Indeed, a considerable Degree of <hi>Redemption</hi> is gain'd by the Saint at his <hi>Death.</hi> A <hi>Redemption</hi> from a world of Evil, is received by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Soul</hi> of the Saint, at its leaving of the world.

                  </p>
                  <p>Christians, We are to Know all this when we say, <hi>I know that there is a Redeemer.</hi>

                  <p n="2">II. We may infallibly <hi>Know,</hi> That this <hi>our Lord Redeemer Lives</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are <hi>Two Natures</hi> in the <hi>Person</hi> of our <hi>Lord Redeemer;</hi> and with Respect unto <hi>both</hi> of them, we may say, <hi>He Lives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First; Our Lord Jesus Christ is GOD; and thus, tis one of His Attributes, <hi>He Lives for ever and ever. Immortality</hi> is one of His Perfections: He is <hi>from Everlasting to Everlasting.</hi> The <hi>Deity</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Belief of every True Believer.

of JEHOVAH is given to our Lord JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, all the Bible over; A Name Incommunicable to any but GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Name which implies, That He is the <hi>Everliving God,</hi> the <hi>Ever Being</hi> one.

                     <p>First; Most certainly, you want a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:</hi> Though none more than they that least feel it, or think it!

No <hi>Mountains</hi> can hide thee; no <hi>Rocks</hi> can co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee. Oh!

Secondly; You have an Offer of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:</hi> Horrible your madness, if you slight it!

It is a Question, which I wish, you would all take into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but neither you, nor all the Angels in Heaven can answer it!

Oh! such will be the Confusions, that you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, if you miss of His R<hi>edemption!</hi> In short, Impenitent Sinners will find the Lord Jesus Christ such a R<hi>edeemer,</hi> as that, Isa. 63. 3. <hi>A Saviour,</hi> One <hi>Mighty to Save;</hi> but One that will <hi>tread them in His Anger, and trample them in His Fury, when the year of His</hi> R<hi>edeemed is come.</hi>

It is said, <hi>The God of Peace hath brought again from the Dead our</hi> L<hi>ord Jesus Christ.</hi> If God had not been <hi>at Peace,</hi> and if the Death of our Lord had not made a full Attonement, He would not have <hi>brought Him again from the Dead.</hi> When we say, <hi>My</hi> R<hi>edeemer</hi> L<hi>ives,</hi> God sayes, <hi>By the</hi> R<hi>ighteousness of that</hi> R<hi>edeemer I am well pleased.</hi> If one farthing demanded for the R<hi>ansome</hi> of Souls had been Left unpaid, our L<hi>ord-Redeemer</hi> had

                     <p>Conclude, Thirdly; I know, that my Redeemer Lives; <hi>And I Know, that I have the Intercession of my</hi> R<hi>edeemer Employ'd for me before the Throne of God.</hi> Our L<hi>ord.</hi> R<hi>edeemer</hi> L<hi>ives;</hi> But what for? We are told Heb 7. 25. He ever L<hi>ives to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for us.</hi> It is as our <hi>High Priest,</hi> that our Lord works out R<hi>edemption</hi> for us. Having dispatch'd the first part of His <hi>Priest hood</hi> in making <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us, He passes unto the other part of it; and in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> in the <hi>Heaven of Heavens,</hi> He makes <hi>Intercession</hi> for us. There He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents before the Eternal God, what He has done to make <hi>Expiation</hi> for our Sins. There He <hi>Sollicits,</hi> that what has been <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased</hi> for us, may be <hi>Bestowed</hi> on us. Our <hi>Prayers</hi> are all of them Sorry <hi>Chatt'rings:</hi> we are prone to Suspect, That they signify nothing. But now Remember, <hi>My</hi> R<hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer</hi> L<hi>ives, and He is concerned for me in the Court of Heaven, and now surely, the God and Father of my</hi> R<hi>edeemer, will give me Grace, and give me Glory, and withold no good

                     <p>Conclude, Fourthly; I know that my Redemer Lives: <hi>And I know that my</hi> R<hi>edeemer will at last, and e're long bring me to Live with Him.</hi> Does our R<hi>edeemer Live?</hi> True; But His Character is also that of our F<hi>orerunner.</hi> We are taught, Heb. 6. 20 <hi>He is a Forerunner for us, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within the Vail.</hi> He L<hi>ives;</hi> and it is, that He may <hi>prepare Mansions,</hi> blessed Chambers and Lodgings for us, in the <hi>Temple</hi> of His God.

                  <p>I Am this Day <hi>my self</hi> a sad Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary upon <hi>my Text.</hi> The Holy God hath, in my <hi>Deadly Calamity,</hi> given you its <hi>Lively Commentary.</hi> Your <hi>Eyes</hi> do <hi>behold,</hi> What it is for the God of Heaven, to <hi>take away from a Son of Man the Desire of his Eyes with a Stroks.</hi>

                  <p>That one of so little Use or Worth as I am, and one who-hath so much deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Displeasure of Heaven, should feel such a <hi>Stroke</hi> from God, no body may wonder at it. But why must such an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Man of God,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> be thus dealt withal? The Blessed God

would not only Try the <hi>vertue</hi> of His Holy Servant, but also make the Trial of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> a thing <hi>Prophetical</hi> of what was to come upon all the <hi>People.</hi> It is often so, that the things befalling of one Considerable person, who hath been much concerned for the Welfare of a people, are <hi>Ominous</hi> of what is to befal all the people for whom he hath been concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Case of <hi>David,</hi> in the Fifty first Psalm; the Fate of <hi>Miriam,</hi> in her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosy and Exclusion; &amp; many more such Things, were Types of what was to befal the <hi>Israelitish</hi> Nation. The <hi>Angels</hi> of the Seven Churches, had in their Condition, that of their Churches. Tho' this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of God, our <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> was a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported <hi>Liver,</hi> and a most excellent <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and his Hearers would also confess him to be so, yet he had <hi>Enemies</hi> among them: Heaven took Notice of it, with much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at it. <hi>Son of Man, The Children of thy people are still talking against thee.</hi> It may be, some of these would be so malignant, as to Rejoice in the <hi>Affliction</hi> that now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel him. <hi>Rejoyce not against me, O mine Enemies,</hi> (might our Prophet now say;) <hi>for the Affliction upon my Family, is but a sign

of a greater Confusion to come upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> When God was going to cast off a people, whom He had once Espoused and <hi>Married</hi> unto Himself, He does by Death cut off the happy <hi>Marriage,</hi> which there had been between His Prophet &amp; a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Israel.</hi> When God was going to deprive the people of the <hi>Dear Enjoyments,</hi> which their <hi>Hearts</hi> were most of all set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He takes away from His Prophet the <hi>Dearest Thing</hi> he had in the world. And, because the Judgments coming upon that people, would be such, that they should not have liberty to <hi>Mourn</hi> with due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and Solemnity for one another, therefore the Lord forbids now unto His Prophet, the solemn Rites of <hi>Mourning,</hi> which else on this <hi>mournful</hi> Occasion had been proper for him. <hi>Thus Ezekiel, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you a Sign, saith the Lord.</hi>

Familiarity with the <hi>Angels</hi> of God: The <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven flew down to them in their Studies, and ravished them with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and most Heavenly Communications.

Son of Man! Accordingly, we find them at the very mention of that word, sometimes fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down into the Dust, before the glorious <hi>Angels</hi> of the Lord. The <hi>Angels</hi> of God would have this brave man feel, That he was but a <hi>Son of Man;</hi> And surely, there would soon arrive Mortifications enough in that one point, <hi>I take away the Desire of thine Eyes with a Stroke,</hi> to convince him of his being so.</p>

I. The <hi>Children of men</hi> are sometimes Blessed with such <hi>Desirable Relatives,</hi> as may be very justly called, The Desire of their Eyes. The <hi>Blessed</hi> God makes a various Distribution of His <hi>Blessings</hi> among the <hi>Children of men.</hi> But not the least of those <hi>Blessings</hi> are Enwrapped in the <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which the <hi>Children of men</hi> bear to one another. Inasmuch as we are the <hi>Children of men,</hi> we are in divers respects <hi>Related</hi> unto one another; &amp; the All wise <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Ruler</hi> of the World has made a manifold provision for our mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in those <hi>Relations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, 'tis a <hi>Special Favour</hi> of God, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>some,</hi> among the <hi>Children of men,</hi> that <hi>Relatives</hi> can take much Delight in one another. Indeed sometimes 'tis other wise; and it is a fearful <hi>Curse</hi> upon the <hi>Children of men</hi> when 'tis otherwise. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives</hi> there are, who have no <hi>Desire,</hi> but rather a <hi>Distaste</hi> of one another; so little do they <hi>Desire,</hi> that they can't <hi>Endure</hi> one another. Their <hi>Persons</hi> their <hi>Tempers,</hi> their <hi>Manners</hi> make them so Disagreeable to one another, that they do not <hi>Love,</hi> but <hi>Loath</hi> each other. It is not altogether unusual in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

only <hi>Weary of each other,</hi> but also make each other <hi>weary of the World</hi> Thus the Lady of old, made that complaint about her Daughters in Law; Gen 27 46. <hi>I am weary of my Life because of them.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, there are many Instances of that Compassion in our Good God upon the un worthy <hi>Children of men;</hi> That <hi>Relatives</hi> are made highly <hi>Desirable</hi> and <hi>Agreeable</hi> to one another.</p>
                  <p>And it is especially thus in the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Relation. The <hi>God of Love</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Disposes them, whom He has made <hi>Consorts</hi> in the <hi>Conjugal Relation,</hi> greatly to love and prize one another. The <hi>Consorts</hi> are to each other, the <hi>Desire of their Eyes;</hi> &amp; they so Love each other, that they Love to be as much as may be in the <hi>Sight</hi> of each other. About the one of these Relatives, tis said, Prov. 18. 22. <hi>He that findeth it, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Good Thing, and obtaineth Favour of the Lord.</hi> And that is the opinion which <hi>both</hi> of them have of each other: <hi>This is a Good and a Great Gift of God unto me! Highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured of God was I, in His Giving of it.</hi> It may be, before they were first Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they humbly Cried unto God, that He would Choose for them, what <hi>

of our Eyes.</hi> When our Hearts are <hi>inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> set upon any thing, we pay for our <hi>Inordinateness,</hi> by our having that Thing <hi>Taken</hi> from us.

                  <p n="3">III. When <hi>Desireable Relatives</hi> are <hi>taken away</hi> from us, tis God that has taken them.

                     <hi>Providence</hi> of God, ordering and inflicting all the Afflictions, that befall the Children of men. As it was said, Amos 3. 6 <hi>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> So we may say, <hi>Shall there be Evil in a Family, and it not be the Lords doing?</hi> To have <hi>Desireable Relatives</hi> taken away, is an Affliction of so much Consequence, that we had need think seriously, <hi>What Hand is it that Layes this Affliction upon us?</hi> Oh, Let us awfully think with our selves, <hi>I have to do with God, in this Dispensation.</hi> There is nothing to be ascribed unto <hi>Hap,</hi> &amp; <hi>Chance,</hi> and <hi>Fortune;</hi> Tis <hi>blind Paganism,</hi> to see no further than such a <hi>blind Original,</hi> for the loss of <hi>Desireable Relatives.</hi> Nor must we consider <hi>Diseases,</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> as being in any higher Form, than that of <hi>Second Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi> God the Great GOD, is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the <hi>First Cause</hi> of all. When any of our <hi>Desireable Relatives</hi> are taken away, we must say with him, Job 1. 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.</hi> It is a vile Stupidity and Profanity, to be insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a <hi>Divine Hand,</hi> Ordering, Disposing, Directing our loss of <hi>Desireable Relatives,</hi> when it comes upon us. When our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are wounded, by having <hi>Desireable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives</hi> taken out of them, if we <hi>Regard not

the works of the Lord, not the Operation of His Hands,</hi> we may fear, that He will go on in wounding of us; yea, that <hi>He will destroy us, and not build us up.</hi>

Enjoy Him, when the finest <hi>Creature</hi> dyes. Tho' a <hi>Lovely Creature</hi> be Snatch'd from us, have we not a <hi>Lovely Jesus</hi> lest us for our Consolation? When the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> is gone, we may still converse with Him, who should be the <hi>Desire of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Why say we not now with him, Psal. 73 25. Lord, <hi>There is none upon Earth, that I desire besides thee?</hi> When <hi>David</hi> had lost the <hi>Desire of his Eyes,</hi> we read, <hi>He Encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</hi> Oh, Let this <hi>Encouragement</hi> make us very Patient; we still have <hi>the Lord for our God!</hi> In the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Persecution, there was a Woman brought before the bloody Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> on the Score of the Gospel. He threatened her to take away her <hi>Husband</hi> from her; said the, <hi>Christ is my Husband.</hi> He threatned her to take away her <hi>Child</hi> from her; said she, <hi>Christ is better to me than ten Sons.</hi> He said, He would Strip her, of all her outward Comforts; Her answer was, <hi>But Christ is mine, and you cannot Strip me of Him.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably Spoken! Let <hi>my Sex</hi> too, learn of that admirable Woman, how to <hi>Encourage</hi> our selves under the worst of our Bereave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly; It is the <hi>Hand of God</hi> which

takes away our <hi>Desireable Relatives:</hi> But let us Hear the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> in that work of His <hi>Hand.</hi> Oh, <hi>Hear the Rod;</hi> for there is a <hi>Voice</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Voice</hi> of God unto us, in taking away the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> is, <hi>Humble thy self under the mighty Hand of God.</hi> It is now, if ever, a Seaton for that Practice; Lam 3 40. <hi>Let us Search and Try our wayes, and Turn again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</hi> Let us now, <hi>Search and Try,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Just God have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Controversy</hi> with us. Now <hi>Search and Try,</hi> what may be the Sins, by which the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> has been Confiscated. <hi>Search and Try,</hi> whether we did carry towards the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> as we ought to do. Let this our <hi>Self Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> issue in a deep <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of our selves, and a True <hi>Repentance</hi> of our Sins That, That is the Right <hi>Mourning,</hi> which is a <hi>Sorrowing to Repentance,</hi> and a being <hi>Sorry after a Godly manner.</hi> But now, by fresh Applications with Faith, to the <hi>Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, which cleanses from all Sin</hi> obtain the <hi>Pardon</hi> of all the Sins, whereof we do thus <hi>Repent.</hi> And, Oh, be very cautious of again calling into the Sins, or being like that man, of whom it is said, <hi>In the Time of His Distress, He Trespassed yet more against the Lord.</hi>

Another <hi>Voice</hi> of God unto us, is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strongly convinced of Humane Weakness and Frailty</hi> We read it in the Divine <hi>Oracle,</hi> Psal. 103 15, 16. <hi>As for man, his Days are as Grass, as a Flower of the Field, so he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth: For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.</hi> Do we not now read it in our own <hi>Experience?</hi> When we see <hi>Beauty</hi> turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ashes, Loveliness</hi> become <hi>Loathsomeness,</hi> the Greatest <hi>Charms</hi> become a prey to <hi>Worms,</hi> and the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> become the <hi>Horror of our Eyes,</hi> how can we forbear crying out <hi>Lord, What Fading Flowers are these that we most of all dote upon! Lord When thou dost correct us with thy Rebukes, thou dost make our Beauty consume away like a moth, surely we are vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Third <hi>Voice</hi> of God unto us, is, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to Follow.</hi> When the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> is taken away, the Language of it is, that; Mat. 24 44 <hi>Be ye also Ready.</hi> They that are gone from us, were a <hi>part of our selves,</hi> &amp; it may be not so <hi>Old as our selves.</hi> How inexcusable are we, if we do not say with our selves, <hi>I shall not be long after them?</hi> 'Twas the manner of old, for 'em to Lay and Leave their Friends in their

Graves, with these words, <hi>Vale, Vale, nos te sequemur:</hi> farewell, farewell, we shall quickly follow! What? Is one <hi>Half</hi> of us already in a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssin?</hi> Surely it becomes us to expect that the <hi>Rest</hi> of us will soon be there. They that are gone <hi>from us,</hi> are gone but a very little <hi>before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh! That we might <hi>now to Day hear the voice of God, and not harden our Hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly; It is the <hi>Hand of God,</hi> which takes away our <hi>Desirable Relatives:</hi> Well then, <hi>watch</hi> very much against all the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Satan,</hi> which may be likely to assault us under this <hi>Hand of God.</hi> Is the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> taken away? It may now be said unto us; Luk. 22 31. <hi>Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may Sift you as Wheat.</hi> All <hi>New Conditions</hi> have some <hi>New Temptations.</hi> When any Irksome Thing befals us, and especially when we are deprived of the <hi>Desire of our Eyes,</hi> than which, what can be more I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is some? We may be sure, <hi>Satan</hi> will take advantage from it. For to have the <hi>Desire of our Eyes</hi> taken away, brings a <hi>Dark Time</hi> upon us. The <hi>Powers of Darkness</hi> may e're we are aware, hurry us on to unaccountable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies. <hi>Now</hi> more than ever is
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:001127_0225_0FB067132E2CA5F0"/>
that Counsel seasonable; Mat. 26. 41. <hi>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</hi> If God by taking away the <hi>Desire of our Eyes,</hi> being us particularly into a State of <hi>Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> Oh! how sollicitous ought we to be, of an <hi>Holy Widowhood!</hi> But that, it may be so, it should be a very <hi>Prayerful</hi> one. The very <hi>First Thing</hi> we are to do, as soon as we can Look about us, methinks it should be to <hi>Pray,</hi> and <hi>Fast,</hi> and <hi>Weep</hi> in secret places before the Lord, and beg of God, that He would pardon all our miscarriages in our <hi>Former Condition,</hi> and preserve us from all further miscarriages in the New, and Sad <hi>Condition</hi> that is now come upon us. Alas, what <hi>wrong steps,</hi> what foolish ones, and what satal ones, are commonly taken in that State; by them who being <hi>Desolate, Continue not in Supplications &amp; Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers night and day!</hi> And they are never more unhappily taken, man in precipitated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, unto <hi>Second Marriages.</hi> For tho' it were an indefensible <hi>Severity</hi> in many of the Ancients, absolutely to forbid them, nevertheless, tis a Dishonourable <hi>Levity</hi> to make <hi>too much Haste</hi> unto them, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for those <hi>Aged</hi> men, to whom a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> would say, <hi>Cogita te quotidie moriturum,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:001127_0226_0FB0671536A1EE70"/>
et de Secundie Nuptiis nunquam Cogitabis:</hi> It were fitter for thee to think of <hi>Dying</hi> than of <hi>Wedding.</hi> The Dutchess of <hi>Millain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a <hi>Widow,</hi> Stamp'd that Motto on her Coin, <hi>Sola facta, Solum Deum Sequor;</hi> Being Left alone, I Converse with God alone. It becomes both Sexes, when the State of <hi>Widowhood</hi> is come upon them, to <hi>Converse with God,</hi> more than ever they did in their Lives before.</p>
                  <p>Lastly. It is the <hi>Hand of God,</hi> which takes away our <hi>Desirable Relatives:</hi> But let it be a very rich Anodyne and Cordial unto us, to think unto <hi>whom</hi> and <hi>what</hi> He has taken them. Were the <hi>Relatives</hi> rendred prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the Fear and Grace of God, the <hi>Desire of our Eyes?</hi> The God, who has <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them away,</hi> has then <hi>Taken them to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> Were they <hi>In Christ?</hi> They are now <hi>With Christ where to be is by far the best of all:</hi> And as well as they Loved us, they would be loth to return from Him unto us. They were the <hi>Desire of our Eyes;</hi> but will it have no pacifying Influence upon us to think. They are gone, Where <hi>all Tears are wiped from their Eyes?</hi> The <hi>Relation</hi> between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us</hi> is Lost, but the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the <hi>Relation</hi> may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:001127_0227_0FB067176577D7B8"/>
more with <hi>them</hi> than with <hi>us.</hi> And when we <hi>meet</hi> them again in the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly World,</hi> there will doubtless be some Rapturous Expressions of Gladness agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Heavenly State,</hi> upon the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such as have been Instrumental to being each other unto it.</p>
                  <p>In fine; We Encounter many Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>this present Evil World.</hi> Our <hi>Desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relatives</hi> have got the Start of us, to the <hi>Blessedness</hi> of a <hi>Better World! We</hi> shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see the Period of all our Grievances, as well as they, and in the Society of them, that are got before us. And give me leave, to Conclude my Sermon, with the Words, wherewith the <hi>Desire of my Eyes,</hi> has newly Concluded her Life; Words, which I Pray God, help me to make the Solace of Mine: Heaven, Heaven will make Amends for all.</p>
