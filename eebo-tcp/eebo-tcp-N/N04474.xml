            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is one of the moſt ſublime and noble Pieces of the Old Teſtament, whether we conſider the Force of Thought, the Magnificence of the Deſcriptions, or the Majeſty and Importance of the Subjects with which they abound. Among the latter of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Subjects, there are none that ſhow with a diviner Brightneſs, or caſt a more radiant Luſtre thro' the Book, than thoſe which concern the Advent of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the illuſtrious Tranſactions that ſhould attend it.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005550_0004_10185BAA96422A78"/>
This is a Theme that the Prophet delights to dwell upon, and introduces throughout the whole of his lofty Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Chapter before us is of this Kind, in which the inſpired Man gives us the Character of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and deſcribes his powerful and happy Kingdom. This is done with an Eloquence and Beauty peculiar to himſelf. At the 10th Verſe, our Saviour is deſcribed as lifted up as an Enſign, and the Gentiles ſeeking to him, while he thus purchaſes a Reſt for them. <hi>And in that Day there ſhall be a Root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>which ſhall ſtand for an Enſign of the People; to it ſhall the Gentiles ſeek, and his Reſt ſhall be glorious.</hi> That is, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who is the Root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> ſhall by his being lifted up on his Croſs, obtain a bleſſed Reſt for his choſen People; among whom ſhall be the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who ſhall ſeek to him for it. The Diſpenſation he brings is a Reſt compared with the Yoke of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies. It brings with it a Reſt of Mind, an <hi>Heart fixed truſting in the Lord.</hi> There is alſo a glorious Reſt for the Church upon Earth in the latter Day: <hi>The new Earth, wherein ſhall dwell Righteouſneſs.</hi> And there is beyond and above all, the Reſt that remains for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, in the heavenly World.</p>
            <p>The Text that is under our Conſideration, includes in it, all the Reſts that the bleſſed Jeſus beſtows on true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, whether in this World, or the World to come; for Time, or for Eternity; to the Soul, or to the Body. However, we will, if you pleaſe, confine it to the Reſt after this Life, in the heavenly World. That <hi>Reſt will be glorious</hi> without diſpute; and the Words contain a very juſt Deſcription of it. It is call'd a <hi>Reſt,</hi> which is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Deſcription; and excludes all manner of Uneaſineſs or Diſturbance. It is called a <hi>glorious Reſt;</hi> which is a poſitive Deſcription, and implies all poſſible and real Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005550_0005_10185BAC1D2A4F00"/>
And it is called <hi>His Reſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt's Reſt, inaſmuch as he is the Owner of it: For <hi>the Son of Man is Lord alſo of the Sabbath.</hi> The Doctrine that the Words preſent us with, is this,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>
                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The Reſt of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which he has laid up in the heavenly World for his People, will be a glorious Reſt.</head>
               <p>There are three Propoſitions contained in the Doctrine.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>There is a Reſt laid up for the People of God, in the heavenly World.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>This Reſt will be a glorious Reſt.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>That it is the Reſt of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; he is the Owner of it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>There is a Reſt laid up for the People of God, in the heavenly World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking to this Head, I ſhall ſhow, what the Reſt is not, what it is, and endeavour at a Scripture Proof of it, as I go along.</p>
               <p>It may here be premiſed then, That by this Reſt, <hi>We are not to underſtand an idle Ceſſation from all Employment.</hi> The holy Souls in the heavenly World, do not ſpend their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in a drowſy Indolence. They are not waſting thoſe golden Ages in a ſupine Negligence and Idleneſs. No, in this Senſe, they are never unactive, but we read of them, Rev. iv. 8. <hi>They reſt not Day nor Night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come.</hi> That is, they are never idle, but always diligent in glorifying and admiring the Perfections of God. Not one Hour of their happy Duration rolls unuſeful
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005550_0006_10185BAF4DB1C490"/>
away; not one Moment is loſt to them in that endleſs Succeſſion of Ages.</p>
               <p>But as a poſitive Anſwer, we ſhall ſay, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Paradiſe above, reſt from all <hi>painful Labours.</hi> Tho' they do not ceaſe from acting, yet their Induſtry is not labourious and difficult to them. It is true, they are conſtantly taken up with the Buſineſs of Heaven, but it is no longer arduous and uneaſy. They perform the moſt exalted Services, with the cloſeſt Application, and without Intermiſſion; and at the ſame Time enjoy the ſereneſt Tranquility, and Compoſure of Mind. The Works of former Years, when they lived upon our Earth, are now no longer able to perplex and moleſt them. No longer will they <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> when they are already poſſeſſed of the Happineſs of the Kingdom. No more will they <hi>give Diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure;</hi> when their Faith is turned into Viſion, and their Hope concluded in Enjoyment. Never will they again weary and tire themſelves in the Exerciſes of Religion, or the Duties of their ſecular Employments; but will inhabit a Quietneſs and Peace, without the leaſt Moleſtation or Diſturbance. Heb. iv. 10. <hi>He that is entred into his Reſt, hath ceaſed from his own Works, as God did from his.</hi> Nay, they are gone to the Reward of their paſt Actions, and have their Labours crowned with an ample Retribution and Recompence. Rev. xiv. 13. <hi>I heard a Voice from Heaven, ſaying unto me, Write, Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the bleſſed Spirits of the Juſt in Heaven, reſt from all <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Affliction.</hi> In this World, all Men meet with Griefs and Woes, and every Child of <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005550_0007_10185BB0D42EB3C8"/>And as all Men in general are ſubject to the unhappy Incidents of humane Life; ſo the pious Man in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is peculiarly obnoxious to many ſupernumerary Tryals, which a <hi>Stranger</hi> to true Piety <hi>intermeddles not with.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and Abuſes from a degenerate World, are no ſmall Part of the Pains that encompaſs him. He has an Awe of that Eternity upon his Mind, which the ſecure Sinner never ſuffers to give him an uneaſy Reflection. He is grieved at the Withdraw of God from him, and when his Saviour <hi>hides his Face he is troubled;</hi> while the unregenerate Wretch goes quietly on, and glides ſmoothly to the End of his Journey, unruffled with ſuch Cares, and entirely ignorant of every Fear and Concern of ſuch a Nature. In a Word, the good Man <hi>thro' much Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enters into the Kingdom of God,</hi> beſides the Sorrows common to all Men in <hi>this preſent evil World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Condition of the Children of God here, but in the heavenly World, they are removed at an infinite Diſtance from every uneaſy Thought; and they leave all the Anguiſh of their temporal Life behind them, when they enter that Place of Reſt. And not only do good Men when they die, go to a World where there is <hi>no more</hi> Affliction, but they receive a Reward for the former Anxieties that they have met with, and have born with a decent Reſignation and Patience. That Beatitude is fully accompliſhed unto them, Pſal. xciv. 12, 13. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whom thou chaſteneſt, O Lord, and teacheſt him out of thy Law: That thou mayeſt give him Reſt from the Days of Adverſity.</hi> And agreeable to this is that magnificent Deſcription of the Paradiſe of God, in <hi>Rev.</hi> vii. from the 9th Verſe, where the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> gives us an Account of a glorious Viſion he had of it. And he tells us expreſly, that the happy Inhabitants of it came out of great Tribulation, Verſe 14. And he concludes the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005550_0008_10185BB26A732060"/>
ſublime Narration, Rev. vii. 16, 17. <hi>They ſhall Hunger no more, neither Thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat.—And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</hi> And in the ſame beautiful Manner, is the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> repreſented, Rev. xxi. 4. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes; and there ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow, nor Crying, neither ſhall there be any more Pain; for the former Things are paſſed away.</hi> Thus do the bleſſed Spirits in Heaven, reſt from all Sorrow, and every afflictive Evil.</p>
               <p>Again, The <hi>Spirits of juſt Men made perfect,</hi> reſt from <hi>Sin,</hi> and are entirely freed from the Guilt and Power of that Worſt of all Evils.</p>
               <p>In this World, the beſt of Men are full of Imperfection and Sin; and have Cauſe to go Mourning all the Day, becauſe of the Oppreſſion of that great Enemy. The holy <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, under a ſad Conviction of it, cries out, Rom. vii. 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</hi> Thus that bleſſed Apoſtle complains of the Tyranny of original Sin. And even in the moſt ſincere and devout Frames of his Mind, when he was engaging in the ſolemneſt Exerciſes of Religion, he laments it, that he was ſtill infeſted by his innate Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, verſe 11. <hi>When I would do Good, Evil is preſent with me.</hi> And thus it is with every good Man, while he lives in this World of Sin and Miſery.</p>
               <p>But in the heavenly World, there is no more Sin. Rev. xxi. 17. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any Thing that defileth, or worketh Abomination.</hi> There is no Guilt in thoſe pure and deathleſs Regions, to blaſt the Beauty of the Place, or caſt a Gloom over the immortal Day that crowns it. Not one <hi>Action</hi> performed in that Mountain of Holineſs, has the leaſt Mixture of Sin to ſtain or ſully it: Not one <hi>idle Word</hi> intrudes it ſelf into
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005550_0009_10185BB91F5CA020"/>
the raviſhing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> that inceſſantly echo there: Nay, not ſo much as one <hi>vain Thought</hi> pollutes or diſcompoſes the Minds of the Saints in thoſe ſpotleſs Realms of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>We might add here, That the Spirits in Paradiſe, are not only entirely free from Sin, but they are alſo at Reſt from every <hi>Temptation</hi> to Sin. They have no Luſts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ſollicit them; no enſnaring Trifles from without to allure and ſeduce them. The Devil, their grand Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, cannot come at them, to uſe his Fraud and Subtilty, when once they are removed to that ſinleſs Kingdom: Nor can his fiery Darts reach to thoſe glorious Heights that they are advanced to, in thoſe lofty Abodes. Tho' the pious Soul, while it is linked to the Body, is hurried and buffeted with a numberleſs Variety of Suggeſtions from <hi>Satan;</hi> yet, no ſooner has it enter'd into thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Doors, but it has an eternal Deliverance from them; it ſhall never be diſtracted with one of them more. The dying Believer may ſay to Sin, and Satan, and all his Temptations, as our Saviour ſaid to the <hi>Jews,</hi> John vii. 33, 34. <hi>Yet a little while and I am with you, and then I go to him that ſent me,—and whither I go, ye cannot come.</hi> In this Manner may the pious Man ſing in the laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Life: His failing Pulſe, and decreaſing Breath, may inſpire a new Delight into his Soul; and he may kindle with a heavenly Tranſport, at the Approaches of his own Mortality.</p>
               <p>Thus we have ſeen what that Reſt is, that the Children of God have prepared for them, beyond the Confines of the Grave. We have ſhewn that they have a Diſmiſſion from all painful Labour, from all afflictive Evil, from all Sin, and from every Temptation. We come now to the ſecond Thing in the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:005550_0010_10185BBC24E70198"/>II. <hi>The Reſt that is laid up for gracious Souls in another World, will be a glorious Reſt.</hi> This will appear if we conſider the following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Place of Heaven is a glorious Place.</hi> Where this glorious and divine Place is, perhaps may not abſolutely be determined; nor will it be ſafe and decent for us to aſſign any determinate Space in the Fields of Immenſity, as the Spot where the Souls of good Men are made happy, when they leave this World. Whether we ſuppoſe that theſe dazling Courts of Immortality lie within the Limits of the blew Sky, that eludes the Penetration of our Sight; and to be diſpoſed ſomewhere in that Firmament of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries; or whether we imagine that happy City to ſpread it ſelf beyond the Circumference of our Creation; yet be it where it will, it is a Place of inconceivable Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The very Heathen had a Notion of the Glory and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Regions to which good Men were carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death; and they uſed to be very gay and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in their Deſcriptions of it. They ſpeak of it in their Writings as having all the Charms of Art and Nature to furniſh and ſet it off. They tell us the Fields are in perpetual Verdure; the Hills are forever crown'd with Flowers; and the Trees at one Time bloſſom and bear Fruit: While the Meads are refreſhed with an innumerable Variety of cool and flowing Springs. Thus the heathen World uſed to dreſs their Paradiſe, and paint it with all the Luxuriance of a lively Imagination. But how vaſtly ſhort are theſe Repreſentations to thoſe which we find made uſe of in the holy Writings, that give us a Proſpect of the heavenly World?</p>
               <p>If we conſider what the ſacred Scriptures relate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Receptacle of the departed Spirits of the Saints, we ſhall find ſufficient to convince us of the Truth of this.

It is called a <hi>Houſe of many Manſions.</hi> John xiv. 2. <hi>A Building of God, an Houſe not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. v. i. <hi>A City which hath Foundations, whoſe Builder and whoſe Maker is God,</hi> Heb. xi. 10. But the moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime and finiſh'd Deſcription of it, we have in the xxi ſt. Chapter of the Revelations, in which the holy City blazes in its greateſt Strength and Perfection. It is there built up after a moſt exquiſite Manner, and ſparkles with Gold and Jewels. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of it, as ſhining without the Aid of the Sun; as adorned with every Glory and Splendor: And indeed the Pomp and Riches of that City, is carried as far as our Imaginations can reach, in the Word of God; and the <hi>Reſt</hi> is glorious, becauſe the <hi>Place</hi> of it is glorious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Company of Heaven is glorious Company.</hi> Heb. xii. 22, 23, 24. <hi>But ye are come to Mount Sion, and unto the City of the living God, the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Company of Angels, to the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born, which are written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, and to Jeſus the Mediator of the new Covenant.</hi> There is ſomething very beautiful and natural in this divine Rapture of the Apoſtle, that expreſſes more of the noble Tranſport he was in, than one would at firſt imagine. He is ſo taken up with the Theme, that he quite forgets the little Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Method and Order, and produces the Images as they come to his Mind, without a ſtrict Regularity of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement. He is raviſh'd with the Thoughts of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and is born away with the Current of Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that pours down upon him in his Contemplations. He begins his Deſcription with the <hi>innumerable Company of Angels:</hi> Then he takes the whole Hoſt of Heaven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and calls them, <hi>the general Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born:</hi> Next he riſes to the great God himſelf, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005550_0012_10185BC2A96D1270"/>
adores him as <hi>Judge of all:</hi> Then deſcends and tells of the <hi>Spirits of juſt Men made perfect:</hi> Laſtly, he again ſoars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſings of <hi>Jeſus the Mediator.</hi> Thus the bleſſed Apoſtle is ſo full of the Matter, that he is hurried along with a holy Violence; and gives a more ſtrong and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime Account of that glorious Company, by an artleſs and rapid Run of Thoughts, than if he had obſerved the moſt ſcrupulous and exact Order of Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>And ſurely the <hi>Reſt</hi> that is fill'd with ſuch divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, muſt be a glorious <hi>Reſt;</hi> and it is certainly no little Satisfaction that they afford one to another. What big Delight will it be, to go to that World, where we ſhall ſee all the truly great and good Men that ever have lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth! When <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſaw <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> at the Transfiguration of our Lord, how were they overpowered with the Extacy of the Viſion? Mark ix. 5. <hi>And</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid, Maſter, it is good for us to be here: And let us make three Tabernacles, one for thee, and one for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and one for</hi> Elias. If the Sight of one or two glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints upon Earth, could cauſe the Hearts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to beat with ſuch a ſolemn Delight, what will be the Satisfaction to go to the numerous Aſſembly of Heaven, and ſee that dazling Company all glitter together.</p>
               <p>But then, if the Sight of the holy Souls, will adminiſter ſuch Joy, ſurely the beholding ſuch a radiant innumerable Company of Angels, muſt fill us with a proportionable Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Felicity. In the heavenly World, we ſhall have a View of thoſe very Angels that we read of in the Scriptures, as deſcending on the Earth, with Meſſages from God, and for the Service of his Children. There we ſhall behold the Angel, that ſwift as Lightning, ſlew <hi>Senacharib</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in one Night. There we ſhall ſee thoſe Convoys that roll'd the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> up the Skies in a fiery Chariot. <hi>Gabriel,</hi> who clap'd his Wings, and ſhot away like a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005550_0013_10185BC42FD5E150"/>
Ray of Light with the News of our Saviours Birth, will there attend upon the Throne of the bleſſed Jeſus: While <hi>Michael,</hi> who drove down the rebel Angels thunder-ſtruck from the Battlements of Heaven, into the deep Abyſs of Damnation, will there move along thro' the Ranks of Seraphim, with the Port and Aſpect of the Warriour Arch-angel. The Sight of ſuch glorious Company as this, will be a bleſſed and raviſhing Sight indeed.</p>
               <p>But O where ſhall we find Words to expreſs the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick Viſion of Chriſt? How raviſhing, and glorious, and unutterable will that bleſſed Lord appear, who is the <hi>Brightneſs of his Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon; and in whom dwelleth the Fullneſs of the God-head bodily!</hi> When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> look'd upon Death in this Light, as only the Meſſenger that would call him to his dear Lord Jeſus, how does he even pant, with an holy Impatience, for the pale Monarch to come on. No more is he afraid of that King of Terrors; no more does he ſhrink back at his Approaches. He looks upon the Face of his Chriſt, and forgets the Horrors of Death: His Sting is blunted, his Darts broken; and that grim Tyrant of the Grave wears the Aſpect of an Angel. 2 Cor. v. 6, 8. <hi>Wherefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at Home in the Body, we are abſent from the Lord. — We are confident, I ſay, and willing rather to be abſent from the Body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Phil. i. 23. —<hi>Having a Deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is by far better.</hi> Now if the Faith of going to Jeſus, can inſpire ſuch a Courage and Joy into the Mind of the good Man, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Shades from the Vale of Death; ſurely the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Sight of that Glory will be tranſporting beyond Conception.</p>
               <p>And indeed 'tis no little Part of the Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that there we ſhall behold the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005550_0014_10185BC747FD0370"/>
unveil'd, in the full Bloom of heavenly Glory. This adds a Force and a Rapture to <hi>John</hi>'s Deſcription of it, in the xxiſt and xxiid Chapters of the Revelations, <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein: For the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb, are the Temple of it. And the City had no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it: For the Glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. — And there ſhall be no more Curſe, but the Throne of God and of the Lamb ſhall be in it, and his Servants ſhall ſerve him. And they ſhall ſee his Face, and his Name ſhall be in their Foreheads. And there ſhall be no Night there, and they need no Candle, neither Light of the Sun, for the Lord God giveth them Light, and they ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi> Thus divinely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious is the Company of Heaven: Holy Souls departed; Holy Angels, and God reveal'd in the Face of the holy Jeſus, all conſpire to adorn the Kingdom, and ſpread a Felicity over the whole Place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Employment of Heaven is glorious Employment.</hi> As the Company is ſo excellent and illuſtrious, ſo no leſs is the Converſation with which they gratify and entertain one another, in thoſe delightful Habitations. Doubtleſs thoſe happy Spirits will diſcourſe together, on the Actions of their paſt Lives; the Bleſſings they were favour'd with, the Miſeries they are eſcaped from; and Glory that they now poſſeſs. Thoſe that knew one another upon Earth, will be much better acquainted there; and where any have been inſtrumental in forwarding and helping on one another in their Way to Heaven, they will be mutual Joys to one another when they meet there. How bleſſed and pleaſing an Intercourſe muſt it be, for Friends to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the Arrival of Friends, to that holy World; to talk over the Prayers they have perhaps formerly made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the pious Converſation they have carried on upon Earth; and the ſerious Religion they promoted in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005550_0015_10185BCA5DB7B638"/>
Minds, by their Word, and their Examples. It will certainly be no little Satisfaction, for them there to renew to one another, the Thoughts and Diſcourſes they once entertained concerning the Glory and Happineſs of the Kingdom where they will then reign. They will ſay one to another, How dark and obſcure were our Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Felicity! How low and mean the Talk we formerly had about it! How inadequate and trifling the moſt exalted Strokes of our mortal Diſcourſes to theſe ſublime Enjoyments!</p>
               <p>And as the Converſation we ſhall have with thoſe which we were familiar with on Earth, will be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and happy, ſo no leſs will that delight us, which we ſhall have with thoſe who have gone to Heaven before us. To mix in the divine and ſinleſs Companies there, to hear the improving Expreſſions of their Tongues, and attend to the ſoft Perſwaſion that ſits upon their Lips, this will be a very noble Entertainment. How glad ſhall we be, to hear <hi>Paul</hi> give us an Account of his Converſion with his own Mouth; or <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf be the Relator of the Flood which bore him up in his Ark, over the Tops of the Mountains! To hear <hi>Moſes,</hi> in an improved Sublimity of Style, tell of the Wonders of the Creation, and relate the Pomp and Terror of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> when its Summit blaz'd with Fire unto the midſt of Heaven; and the black Smoke aroſe like the Smoke of a Furnace, and roll'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thro' the Air; while the Voice of the Trumpet echo'd louder and louder, and the whole Mountain ſhook to its Foundations. And will not JESUS himſelf tell us of his own Love, and Sufferings for us, in <hi>Words which it is not lawful or poſſible for a Man to utter.</hi> Theſe noble Themes will without Doubt, employ much of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Heaven; and gratify and enlarge the Minds of the glorified Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005550_0016_10185BCEF9D16828"/>They will there alſo conſider the ſeveral Works of God, and admire the ſurprizing Diſplays of the Godhead in them. The <hi>Creation</hi> throughout its vaſt Extent, will be a Field on which they will expatiate, and aſcribe due Praiſes to the infinite Contriver and Author of ſo aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Piece of Workmanſhip. Rev. iv. 10, 11. <hi>The four and twenty Elders fall down before him that ſat on the Throne, and worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their Crowns before the Throne, ſaying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive Glory, Honour, and Power, for thou haſt created all Things, and for thy Pleaſure they are, and were created.</hi> To trace the Mazes of <hi>Providence,</hi> with exalted Strains of Rapture and Devotion, will be another Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the heavenly World. The ſupream Lord who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages the Wheels full of Eyes, will be adored as his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous Works to the Children of Men, come to have the Clouds taken off, and appear in all their Harmony and Beauty.</p>
               <p>In ſome Deſcriptions that the holy Writings give us of Heaven, we find the glorified Spirits celebrating the Praiſes of God, for his Judgments on Earth. Thus the Deſtruction of Antichriſt tunes their Harps, Rev. xix. 1,— 6. <hi>And after theſe Things I heard a great Voice of much Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Heaven, ſaying, Alleluia, Salvation, and Glory, and Honour, and Power unto the Lord our God; for true and righteous are his Judgments, for he hath judged the great Whore, which did corrupt the Air with her Fornication, and hath avenged the Blood of his Servants at her Hand. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain they ſaid Alleluia, and her Smoke roſe up for ever and ever. And the four and twenty Elders, and the four Beaſts fell down and worſhipped God that ſat on the Throne, ſaying, Amen, Alleluia. And a Voice came out of the Throne: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Praiſe our God all ye his Servants, and ye that fear him, both ſmall and great. And I heard as it were the Voice of a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005550_0017_10185BD273D29A00"/>
great Multitude, and as the Voice of many Waters, and as the Voice of mighty Thundrings; ſaying, Alleluia; for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</hi> To be ſure in the heavenly World, the Wonders of our <hi>Redemption,</hi> will be the Subject of the higheſt Delight and Praiſe. We ſhall there be ſwallow'd up with the Contemplation of that myſterious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Production. Rev. v. 8, 9. <hi>The four living Creatures, and four and twenty Elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them Harps, and golden Vials full of Odours, which are the Prayers of Saints. And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Thing we ſhall take Notice of under this Head, ſhall be, That one principal Part of the heavenly Bleſſedneſs will conſiſt in the beholding of GOD. This will be no ſmall Article of the Employment and Felicity of the Saints in Glory; but will improve and brighten every other Delight. Not that we are to ſuppoſe it poſſible to have a Sight of the divine Eſſence it ſelf; but ſuch a Conſciouſneſs of his Preſence, and ſuch Communications from him, as may in ſome Senſe be eſteemed Sight; and this is what is called <hi>the beatifick Viſion.</hi> It is in this Senſe that thoſe Texts of the holy Scriptures are to be underſtood, that ſpeak of <hi>beholding the Face of God,</hi> and <hi>ſeeing him as he is.</hi> The Eye of the Underſtanding, has a View of the glorious God, and graſps in as much of the glorious Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, as it can poſſibly wiſh. Thus divine and happy are the Exerciſes of the heavenly World.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Progreſſion and Increaſe of that celeſtial Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will add perpetually to its tranſcendant Glory.</hi> The Saints do not immediately upon their Entrance into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, ſhoot up to the higheſt Point of Felicity and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005550_0018_10185BD409D26B68"/>
but go on continually making new Aquiſitions in Knowledge, and enlarging their Capacities for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This may be proved by plain and evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and particularly from the Make and Conſtitution of the humane Soul. The Mind of Man is like a Fire, which ſpreads and encreaſes as it finds Materials to feed and ſupply it. So that tho' the Spirit of a Believer, as ſoon as it arrives to thoſe Realms of Tranquility, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives as much Joy and Bleſſedneſs as it is then capable of, yet it is not happy in ſo great a Degree, as it will be afterwards, becauſe it will then be able to ſupport, and bear up under, a larger Proportion of Glory. When the Soul of a good Man has enjoy'd the Felicity of Heaven for ſome long Period of Duration, every Faculty will be widen'd, and many additional Advantages will neceſſarily ariſe, as the Soul ſpreads it ſelf into more ample Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Tho' the Spirit of the Believer is made perfect in Holineſs and Glory, as ſoon as it leaves the Body, yet it does not arrive to thoſe <hi>greater Degrees</hi> of Perfection, that it will ſtill go on to acquire, as it ſinks further into the Depths of Eternity. The Memory will then be an inexhauſtible Magazine of Delight, as they paſs onward thro' the vaſt Variety of Satisfactions that they meet with in the heavenly World: And they will be able to look back, and reflect with renewed Joy upon that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Train of Pleaſures, which has extended it ſelf in ſuch a beautiful Order, and to ſo immenſe a Diſtance. And to think over ſuch a mighty Round of Years, and renew in our Minds all the pleaſing Scenes of Felicity, which paſs'd in a gay Succeſſion before us, in ſo great a Space of Duration, muſt needs be an Happineſs which will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably great; and impoſſible to be enjoy'd at our firſt Entrance into Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:005550_0019_10185BD58F0D0ED0"/>But to diſmiſs a Speculation ſo abſtracted, we may here take Notice of two Steps of Progreſſion, which every one will allow at firſt Sight, that the Souls of good Men take in their glorious Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, At their Death. They no ſooner leave their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies, but they are borne upon the Wings of holy Angels to the Paradiſe of God. A Flight of thoſe ſhining Spirits attend the Death-Bed of the Saints, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon the laſt Gaſp, receive the departing Soul, and convoy it to the World of Glory. If our Minds could but follow them as they fly along, what a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scene of Delight would open to us? How does a Soul juſt freed from a Body of Sin and Death, exult as it tow'rs away, in the Midſt of ſuch bright Attendants? How do the reſplendent Angel-Guards ſing round it, as they bear it thro' the Regions of the Air, and the Ether, to the Habitations of unfading Bliſs and Triumph! And when it enters the orient Gates of that City, what are the Acclamations and Hallelujahs that congratulate its ſafe Arrival! Here it joins its Brethren of the Skies, in their immortal Anthems of Rapture and Praiſe, in a joyful Hope and Expectation of the Reſurrection of the Dead at the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>And this is a ſecond Step of the Believer's Progreſſion in Glory, which is acknowledged by all, without Heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Pauſe. When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt makes his ſecond Appearing, <hi>the Dead in Chriſt ſhall ariſe,</hi> and thoſe Souls who have been many Ages happy in the Paradiſe of God, ſhall now attain to a more compleat and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Felicity at the Reſurrection of their reſpective Bodies; which will be glorified and adorn'd for the Habitation of ſo ſinleſs Spirits. It will without Diſpute, be a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Advancement in Bleſſedneſs, for the raiſed Bodies of the Saints, to be again united to the Soul, and become
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005550_0020_10185BD720CE73E8"/>
more intimate and inſeparable Companions than ever they were before. How will the raviſh'd Soul of the good Man triumph, when he hears the Voice of the Son of God, <hi>Ariſe ye Dead!</hi> How will his quickning Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, at the new Entry of the Spirit into it! The whole Man will be ſwallowed up in an unknown Delight: His Heart will leap with Tranſport in his Boſom, and beat Time to the ſounding Echo's of the laſt Trumpet. Thus when our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall <hi>come, to be glorified in his Saints, and admired of all them that believe,</hi> the Language of the holy Soul, as it flies down to the Grave that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains its Duſt, will be, <hi>Ariſe, O my</hi> Body, <hi>ariſe and ſhine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add to theſe two Steps in the Throne of Glory, a Third, <hi>viz.</hi> that after the final Judgment, the deathleſs Bodies and Souls of the Children of God, will in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble Union, aſcend to the heavenly World, with new Additions of Splendor, and Pomp, and Happineſs. But, alas! What Words can bear up under this <hi>Weight of Glory.</hi> What Conceptions are equal to this dazling Solemnity, and Magnificence. When the Judge of the World, riſes from his laſt Sentence on the Righteous and the Wicked, and returns to his Throne in the Heavens, who can tell the Joys of the glorified Saints, and the Songs of Thankſgiving that hang on their Lips? They will ſhout round his Chariot Wheels, as they roll along, and all Heaven will reſound with their Acclamations. Thus will they enter the Place of their holy and glorious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodes, and receive a higher Degree of Bleſſedneſs, than ever they were before capable of imagining.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee there is a Progreſſion of Bleſſedneſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd by the Saints in Glory. At Death they are made perfect in Happineſs; At the Reſurrection they arrive at
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005550_0021_10185BDD8569C5D0"/>
an additional Felicity, by a Re-union to their glorified Bodies; At their Aſcenſion to the Manſions of Delights, after the Concluſion of the great Day, they arrive at ſtill higher and nobler Degrees of Perfection; and they then go on adding Joy to Joy, and one Degree of Glory to another to interminable Ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The Duration of the Reſt remaining for the People of God in the heavenly World, will be an inconceivable Addition to the Glory of it.</hi> And what is this Duration but even Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf? Had it been but a few Years, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints were to enjoy the Bleſſedneſs of Heaven, yet even then it would beyond Expreſſion have ſurpaſs'd all the Pleaſures of this Earth. But what an infinite Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Happineſs is given to the tranſported Souls there, by the Conſtancy and Laſtingneſs of the Glory! What ſtrange Delight does that Reflection ſtrike into the Mind of theſe Bleſſed? Eternity! How does it employ their Thoughts, how does it even overwhelm and ſwallow up all their Contemplations, in Delight and Wonder! It not only continues the Felicity without Ceſſation, but it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes it every Moment. For when the Soul aſſures it ſelf, that the Happineſs it enjoys ſhall endure forever, that very Thought doubles every Delight which tolls in upon it; and gives a new and an unknown Bleſſedneſs to every Pleaſure of Heaven. Were the happy Spirits in Paradiſe to know that their Joys were in ſome Period of Duration to be finiſhed; and that the they muſt leave their Glory, how would it damp their Felicity, and caſt a Veil and a Cloud upon all their Raptures? How diſtant ſoever the End might be, it would methinks ſtill be preſent to their Minds; and, like a Man poſſeſs'd of an invaluable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the very Fear of looſing it, would in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure obſtruct the preſent Comfort it might otherwiſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. In a Word, Did the bleſſed Saints know that the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005550_0022_10185BE269F6C858"/>
Time would arrive, in which he muſt part with all his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, the very Thought would blunt the fine Edge of his Delight; and would ſpread a Gloom, never before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd in thoſe Realms of immortal Day. Our Lord Jeſus himſelf cried out at his Father's Withdraw from him. And in like Manner, on the other Hand, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the Eternity of the Enjoyments of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly World, infuſes new Satisfaction in every Moment that rolls thro' thoſe golden Ages. It doubles every Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they taſte; and gives an additional Splendor to every Gem in the Crown of Glory. Dan. xii. 3. <hi>They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, as the Stars forever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we have conſider'd the heavenly Reſt, and ſhown, in ſome Meaſure, how it was glorious. That every Thing we could ſay of it, was to its Advantage and its Honour. That the <hi>Place,</hi> the <hi>Company,</hi> the <hi>Employment,</hi> the <hi>Progreſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Duration,</hi> all unite their Beauties together, and conſpire to ſet it off with the utmoſt Pomp and Magnificence. But alas, how little a Portion is known of it. To ſpeak of the Glories of Heaven fully, who is ſufficient for theſe Things! What the Perfection of it will be, we know not now, we ſhall know here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Fitter are theſe Themes for the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of a Seraph, than the faultring Tongue of a Mortal; better to be admired than deſcribed; to dwell forever in an holy Meditation upon our Hearts, to influence every Action we perform, and at laſt, to make our very <hi>Deaths</hi> the moſt delightful and raviſhing Moment of our <hi>Lives. Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard; neither hath the Heart of Man aſcended to conceive the Glory which God hath prepared for them who love him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005550_0023_10185BE3EFCC4460"/>III. The third Thing was to have evinced, That <hi>the Reſt of Heaven is Chriſt's Reſt: He is the Lord of that Sabbath.</hi> This we might have proved in ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as, That he <hi>made</hi> it; That he is the <hi>Heir</hi> of it, and it is the <hi>Gift</hi> of his Father to him: That he has <hi>bought</hi> it, and paid his own Blood the Price for it: That he has <hi>aſcended</hi> and taken <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of it: That he has <hi>promiſed</hi> it; and muſt ſurely therefore be its Owner. And finally, that he has <hi>actually beſtowed</hi> it upon many of his Saints already. But theſe Things I muſt at preſent omit. I haſten to the Application.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, Is there a <hi>Reſt to come,</hi> let us <hi>Labour Now.</hi> Our Text ſpeaks of ſomething future, <hi>His Reſt</hi> SHALL BE <hi>glorious:</hi> And what more forcible Motive can there be for preſent Labour, than a ſucceeding Reſt. Do we not ſee People about us ſpending their Time, their Strength, and their Lives in the Labours and Fatigues of this World, and all in Hopes to have their old Age eaſy, and in their declining Years to ſet down and reſt? And ſhall theſe earthly and procraſtinating Souls, be thus aſſiduous in ſcraping their Dirt together, in the vain and empty Expectation of an idle Old Age: And ſhall the Chriſtian do no more to prepare himſelf for the Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Reſt that remains for the People of God? What a Shame is it, that ſo trifling and tranſient a Reſt in this World, ſhould have ſtronger Allurements than the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Tranquility of Paradiſe? Can the Chriſtian bear the Thoughts of This: To be thus out-done in Labour, upon ſo ſlender a Foundation, ſo trifling a Reward?</p>
               <p>Let every Soul of us then receive the Exhortation of the Apoſtle, Heb. iv. 11. <hi>Let us Labour therefore to enter into that Reſt.</hi> And let every <hi>pious Soul</hi> in particular,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005550_0024_10185BE80F3D17B0"/>
labour more earneſtly, and aſſiduouſly, and give Diligence to make our Calling and Election ſure, and do with our Might what our Hands find to do, as knowing that our Labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Inf. II. Is <hi>this Reſt</hi> a <hi>glorious Reſt,</hi> let us <hi>rejoice in the Hope of the Glory of God.</hi> What is there that can rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtruct or diminiſh the Believer's Joy, when he knows that this glorious Reſt is laid up for him! Why do we not long to be poſſeſs'd of that everlaſting Glory? Why are we not impatient for our Tranſlation to that better that diviner World of Bliſs? Whence is it, that the good Man can even content himſelf till Death invites him to his Inheritance! But Oh! whence, that inſtead of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent he is ſo ſupinely Indolent, and has ſuch ſmall and glimmering Notions of the Glory of that State! Inſtead of the holy Flames of Deſire, there is the heavy Smoke of Unbelief; and while he ſhould be aſpiring on eager Wings up to that World, he is link'd to Earth; and grovels in the low and contemptible Enjoyments of Time and Senſe! The Exhortation to you is that in Micah ii. 10. <hi>Ariſe ye, and depart; for this is not your Reſt.</hi> Happy would it be, could we all look up to the heavenly Glory, and ſee the glittering Preparations made for us there; and <hi>happy,</hi> could we hear the Bleſſed there pronounce to us, 2 Theſ. i. 6, 7. <hi>God ſhall render Tribulation to them which trouble you. And to you who are troubled reſt with us.</hi> If we could look on this World, as full of Labour and Sorrow; and turn our Eyes upon the World where God is, and where our bleſſed Jeſus invites <hi>us</hi> to be, and wiſh, and break out, <hi>O that I had Wings like a Dove! then would I fly away, and be at Reſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Inf. III. Does this <hi>Reſt</hi> remain for the <hi>People of God,</hi> what will become of thoſe who are <hi>not his People?</hi> If the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005550_0025_10185BEB3718D7D8"/>
Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where will the Ungodly and the Sinner appear? <hi>The Wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot Reſt; whoſe Waters caſt up Mire and Dirt. There is no Peace,</hi> no Reſt, <hi>ſaith my God, to the Wicked,</hi> Iſai. lvii. 20, 21. This is their State both in this World and the World to come. In this World, they are ſtill purſuing imaginary Fantoms of Happineſs, with conſtant Pains and Application; till at laſt Death ſeizes them in the Midſt of their eager Purſuits, and conſigns them over to the World of Fire and Torment.</p>
               <p>Tis in this miſerable Place, that Sleep flies their aching Eye-lids; and Reſt and Eaſe are utter Strangers. Alas! What Hope of a peaceful Lodging in a Bed of Flames? What Expectation of a quiet Abode in thoſe diſmal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Sorrow! If they caſt their Eyes towards Heaven, they do but Curſe God and look upwards. <hi>They ſee</hi> the beauteous Realms of <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and the Doors of the holy City cloſed againſt them with everlaſting Bars. <hi>They feel</hi> the kindling Torment inflame their impious Tongues; and plead in vain for a Drop of Water. <hi>They hear</hi> the Sentence thundred from the Mouth of the great God himſelf, <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill. He that is filthy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> Their unſufferable Condition has a very awful Deſcription, Rev. xiv. 10, 11. <hi>They ſhall drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which is poured out without Mixture, into the Cup of his Indignation, and they ſhall be tormented with Fire and Brimſtone, in the Preſence of the holy Angels, and in the Preſence of the Lamb: And the Smoke of their Torment aſcendeth up forever and ever: And they have</hi> NO REST <hi>Day nor Night.</hi> Darkneſs is indeed a Seaſon for Reſt; But tho' they are baniſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter Darkneſs; into Blackneſs of Darkneſs forever; yet are they ignorant of any Reſt; they know no Ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005550_0026_10185BECC34474D0"/>
to their Deſpair and Anguiſh. As their Flames give them no Light, their eternal Night affords them no Sleep. They ſpend the gloomy Ages that roll over them in Lamentation and Woe: They rore, loud as the Fires that wave about them; and are unquiet and reſtleſs as they.</p>
               <p>There is a dreadful Diſparity between the Puniſhments of Damnation, and the Glories of Heaven, and this will ſerve to ſhow the Wretchedneſs of the Wicked there. Is the <hi>Place</hi> of Heaven ſo bleſſed and divine, Hell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Priſon, to a bottomleſs Pit, to a Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a horrible Furnace, and to a burning Oven. Iſai. xxx. 33. <hi>The Lord hath prepared Tophet of old,—He hath made it deep and large: The Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood, the Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, doth kindle it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like Manner, the <hi>Company</hi> of Hell alſo, what a hideous and infernal <hi>Company!</hi> Nothing to converſe with, but Devils and the Damned. Their Fellow-Sinners upon the Earth, will be their Fellow-Sufferers in Hell; and thoſe who formerly were Partners in Guilt, will now become Sharers in Torment. Satan who once tempted them, and their Companions who harden'd them in Sin, will add to their future Miſery, and blow up the Flames to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vigour upon them. The Sentence that will break upon them from the Mouth of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that will ſweep them down to Perdition, will be that, Matth. xxv. 41. <hi>Depart from me ye Curſed, into everlaſting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Miſerable Souls! to be <hi>conſumed from the Preſence of the Lord, and the Glory of his Power.</hi> To be baniſhed from the bleſſed Company of Heaven, and of Jeſus the Glory of Heaven; while a Portion is aſſigned unto them with <hi>Hypocrites and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005550_0027_10185BEFC6CAA1D8"/>
Unbelievers,</hi> where is <hi>Weeping, and Wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth,</hi> without Remedy, without Meaſure, and without End. The unhappy Company is deſcribed, Rev. xxi. 8. <hi>But the Fearful, and Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Idolators, and all Liars, ſhall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, The <hi>Employment</hi> of Hell, what is it, but the keen Reflections of their paſt Lives, and a future Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? What but bitter Out-cries and Execrations, while they curſe one another, and blaſpheme God? Inſtead of the Anthems of Heaven, they pour out Groans, and Shrieks, and Ejulations. They gnaw their Tongues for Pain; and howling ſupplies the Place of Hallelujah.</p>
               <p>Again, The Pains of Hell have a horrible <hi>Progreſſion:</hi> and as a Fire kindles by Degrees, and at laſt Blazes with the largeſt Expanſion, and the intenſeſt Heat; ſo it will be with the Flames of Hell. We ſee great Pains, the longer they laſt, become the more intollerable. Where then will be the Sinner's Patience, after Millions of Ages ſpent in thoſe tremendous Agonies! How will his <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Faithful Tormentor!</hi> look back into the paſt Periods of Deſpair, and renew all the dreadful Laſhes of that vaſt Duration. How will he eſſay to meaſure the never-end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succeſſion to come, as the Line of preceeding Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries lengthens out further and further. His <hi>Underſtanding</hi> will be a wider Affliction, as he comes by the dire Experiment better to <hi>know the Power of almighty Anger.</hi> His <hi>Affections,</hi> particularly that of <hi>Fear,</hi> will be a more ſtinging Anxiety, after he has felt in ſome Sort, what he will hereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be more violent and inſupportable. His <hi>Will</hi> will grow more deſperate and hardened, as he ſtill uſes himſelf to unpardonable Blaſphemies. Finally, His <hi>Imagination</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005550_0028_10185BF3EF6A7D20"/>
will grow more unhappily capacious &amp; artfull, to repreſent his Condition of paſt, preſent, &amp; to come, in the moſt lively and amazing Colours. But to draw on to a Concluſion, in the laſt Place the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Torments of Hell, is, <hi>All Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> What a boundleſs and overpowering Conception is here! The Miſeries of the Damned will laſt for ever. Never will thoſe undone Souls be able to break Priſon; never will their Agonies ceaſe, or the Wrath of God give over raging againſt them. The Day of the Fierceneſs of almighty Anger being come, it will remain, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God will ruſh down reſiſtleſs and inceſſant upon the guilty Rebels, and beat upon them in an eternal Tempeſt. Eternity! it adds Weight to every Chain, Heat to every Coal, and Gloom to every Cloud in that doleful Vault. It not only continues their Anguiſh with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out End, but encreaſes it every Moment. When they look forward into its unſearchable Mazes, and looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſtrange Extenſion, O the Lamentation! O the Deſpair! it is impoſſible for us to form any equal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of it.</p>
               <p>Inf. IV. And I have done, Is <hi>this Reſt Chriſt</hi>'s Reſt, as I have hinted, O let us all go to him for it. If we refuſe to do this, we ſhall be miſerable forever. <hi>For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be ſaved.</hi> He is the mighty Saviour. But <hi>how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation.</hi> All Things elſe will fail us. We may wander among the Creatures, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove along the Surface of the Flood, but like her ſhall find no REST <hi>to the Sole of our Foot,</hi> till we return to this Ark. <hi>Gen.</hi> viii. 9. But if we repair to him by an humble Faith, we ſhall there have Reſt in the Day of Trouble. The greateſt Sinner of us all is Welcome here; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our Unbelief can hinder our Acceptance with
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005550_0029_10185BF581948698"/>
him. Our eternal <hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Torment</hi> depends then upon this one Thing, whether we are willing to give our ſelves to Chriſt or no. If we believe on his Name, we ſhall have ſuch Diſpoſitions infuſed into our own Souls, as will be a Heaven begun; and an Earneſt of the Reſt to follow. If not, we ſhall not be qualified for it; nor can we enjoy it. For without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Reſt of his People. How fooliſh are thoſe miſerable Souls, who after ſo many Invitations to accept of the Reſt of Heaven, go away unreſolved whether to ſtrive for it or no; refuſe it, and deſpiſe it? Who can ſay but if you now think to put it off, and delay your Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after it, an angry God may for ever baniſh you from it. Are you ſure you ſhall ever have another Opportunity to ſue for Mercy? Nay, Death may ſtrip you of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore To-morrow. What is the Language of the holy God upon ſuch Procraſtination? Heb. iii. 7, 8, 10, 11. <hi>Wherefore ſaith the holy Ghoſt, To day, if ye will hear his Voice harden not your Hearts.— They do always err in their Hearts, and they have not known my Ways. So I ſware in my Wrath, they ſhall not enter into my Reſt.</hi> But to thoſe who with penitent Eyes, and awakened Souls enquire, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved; to be delivered from this Wrath to come,</hi> and obtain this glorious Reſt? To thoſe I anſwer (yet not I, but the Lord JESUS CHRIST himſelf) in that moſt divine and affecting Language, Matth. xi. 28, 29. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt. Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye ſhall find Reſt unto your Souls.</hi> And will you not echo to the dear Voice, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto thy Reſt, O my Soul.</hi>
