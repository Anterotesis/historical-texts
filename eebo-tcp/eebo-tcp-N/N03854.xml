            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>My</hi> FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is with no ſmall Uneaſineſs that I find myſelf concerned to apply thus to this Meeting: But as I have been longer and more deeply engaged in Affairs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and I believe I may ſafely ſay, have conſidered the Nature of it more cloſely than any Man beſides in this Province; as I have alſo from my Infancy been educated in the Way that I have ever ſince walked in, and I hope without Blemiſh to the Profeſſion; I conceive and hope you will think I have a Right to lay before you, the heavy Preſſure of Mind that ſome late Tranſactions in this ſmall Government of ours have given me, through an Apprehenſion, that not only the Reputation of Friends, as a People, but our Liberties and Privileges in general may be deeply affected by them.</p>
            <p>But on this Head I think fit to mention, in the firſt Place, That when, above <hi>Forty-two</hi> Years ſince, our late Proprietor propoſed to me at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to come over with him as his Secretary; after I had, agreeably to his Advice, taken Time to conſider of it, which I did very cloſely before I engaged, I had no Scruple to accept of that, or of any other Poſt I have ſince held: Being ſenſible, that as Government is abſolutely neceſſary amongſt Mankind, ſo, tho' all Government, as I had clearly ſeen long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is founded on Force, there muſt be ſome proper Perſons to adminiſter it; I was therefore the more ſurpriſed, when I found my Maſter, on a particular Occaſion in our Voyage hither, tho' coming over to exerciſe the Powers of it here in his own Perſon, ſhew'd his Sentiments were otherwiſe. But as I have ever endeavoured to think and act conſiſtently myſelf, obſerving Friends had laid it down as their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, That Bearing of Arms, even for Self-Defence, is unlawful; being of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinion in this Reſpect, tho' I ever condemned offenſive War, I therefore, in a great Meaſure, declined that due Attendance on their Meetings of Buſineſs, which I might otherwiſe have given. I muſt here nevertheleſs add further, that I propoſe not, in offering this, to advance Arguments in Support of the Lawfulneſs of Self-Defence; which, amongſt thoſe, who, for Conſcience Sake, continue in a Condition to put ſtrictly in Practice the Precepts of our Saviour, would be altogether needleſs; but where-ever there is private Property, and Meaſures taken to increaſe it, by amaſſing Wealth, according to our Practice, to a Degree that may tempt others to invade it, it has always appeared to me, to be full as juſtifiable to uſe Means to defend it when got, as to acquire it. Notwithſtanding which, I am ſenſible our <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have ſo openly and repeatedly profeſſed their Principles on that Head to the Government, and they have thereupon been ſo much diſtinguiſhed by its Favours, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> peaceable People, from whom no Plots or Machinations of any Kind are to be <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that I ſhall conſider this, as I have ſaid, to be their ſtanding and avowed Principle, and only offer to your Conſideration, what I conceive to be a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that all Civil Government, as well as Military, is founded on Force; and therefore, that Friends, as ſuch, in the Strictneſs of their Principles, ought in no manner to engage in it: As alſo that as we are a ſubordinate Government, and therefore accountable to a ſuperiour One for our Conduct, it is expected by that Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004740_0002_100DD181521CB030"/>that this Province, as well as all the other <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, ſhall make the beſt Defence, againſt a foreign Enemy, in its Power, as it was ſtrictly required to do by the late Queen, in the laſt <hi>French</hi> War, upon which the then Governor raiſed a Militia of three Companies of Voluntiers, but for Want of a Law for its Support, it dropt in about two Years after; and the like Orders may undoubtedly <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Law for it, as there is in all the other <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, I think, without Exception.</p>
            <p>That all Government is founded on Force, and ours as well as others, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably evident from this: King <hi>Charles</hi> II. in his Grant of this Province to our Proprietor, directed, that the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> for the Deſcent of Lands, and for the Preſervation of the Peace, ſhould continue the ſame till alter'd by the Legiſlative Authority; and our Government continues ſtill on the ſame Plan, with Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs, Coroners, Clerks, Juries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all of whom, who act by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, have them from the Governor in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Form; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all our Courts, and our Practitioners copy, as near as they can, after the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> By that Law, when the Peace is commanded, even by a Conſtable, all Obedience to that Command manifeſtly ariſes from a Senſe in the Perſon or Perſons commanded, that his Reſiſtance would be puniſhed, and therefore they chuſe to avoid it: But in Civil Caſes of more Importance, the Sheriff, who is the principal executive Officer, executes the Judgments of the Courts upon thoſe they were given againſt, which they are obliged to comply with, how much ſoever againſt their Will; for here alſo they know Reſiſtance would be in vain; or if they attempt any, the Sheriff is obliged by the Law, without any Manner of Excuſe, to find a ſufficient Force, if to be had in his County, to compel to a Compliance. And in the Pleas of the Crown, beſides that he is obliged to put to Death ſuch Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals as by the Law have been condemned to it, he, as general Conſervator of the Peace, is likewiſe inveſted, by the ſame Law, with proper Powers for ſuppreſſing all Tumults, Riots, Inſurrections and Rebellions, on whatſoever Occaſion they may ariſe, as far as the whole Poſſe or Force of his County will enable him; and for this End he receives, together with his Commiſſion, the King's Writ of Aſſiſtance, requiring all Perſons within his Diſtrict to be aiding to him, in theſe and all other Caſes; by which, if Need be, they may freely uſe Fire-Arms, and all Manner of deſtructive Weapons; and are not at all accountable, by the Law, for any Lives they may take of thoſe in the Oppoſition, any more than a Man is, on the High-Road, for killing another who attempts to rob him; and ſuch as refuſe to aſſiſt the Sheriff, are, by the ſame Law, liable to Fine and Impriſonment: From whence it is evident, there is no Difference, in the laſt Reſort, between Civil and Military Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that the Diſtinction that ſome affect to make, between the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the one and of the other, is altogether groundleſs. As no Man is kill'd in the Field, ſo none are puniſhed, with their Good-will; a ſuperiour Force is employed in the one Caſe as well as in the other; and the only Difference that I <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ever able to diſcover in their Eſſentials, is, that the Sheriff being but one <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004740_0003_100DD182D73A9FF0"/>
But further it is alledged, that King <hi>Charles</hi> II. very well knew our Proprietor's Principles when he granted him theſe Powers of Government, contained in the Charter: To which 'tis anſwer'd, that amongſt the other Powers granted to the Proprietor and his Deputies, He is created by the Charter a Captain General, with Power to levy War on any People not in Amity with the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> which in caſe he was not free to do by himſelf, he might by his Deputies; and if he were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Powers to make an invaſive War, much more it was to be expected that he ſhould defend his Country againſt all Invaders. And I am a Witneſs, that in thoſe two Years, or ſomewhat leſs, that the Proprietor took the Adminiſtration on himſelf, when laſt here, He found himſelf ſo embaraſſed between the indiſpenſable Duties of Government on the one Hand, and his Profeſſion on the other, that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, if he had ſtaid, to act by a Deputy. It is further alledged, by our Friends, that no other was expected than that this ſhould be a Colony of <hi>Quakers,</hi> and it is ſo reputed to this Day; that they are willing themſelves to rely on the ſole Protection of of divine Providence, and others who would not do the ſame ſhould have kept out of it, for no-body called or invited them. But it is anſwered to this, That the King's Charter gives free Leave to all his Subjects, without Diſtinction, to repair to the Country and ſettle in it, and more particularly, the Proprietor's own Invitation was general and without Exception; and by the Laws he had paſs'd himſelf, no Country, no Profeſſion whatever, provided they own'd a God, were to be excluded. That 'tis true our Friends at firſt made a large Majority in the Province; yet they are ſaid now to make, on a moderate Computation, not above one Third of the Inhabitants. That altho' they alledge they cannot for Conſcience-ſake bear Arms, as being contrary to the peaceable Doctrine of JESUS (whoſe own Diſciples nevertheleſs are known to have carried Weapons) yet, without Regard to others of CHRIST's Precepts, full as expreſs, againſt laying up Treaſure in this World, and not caring for to-morrow, they are as intent as any others whatever in amaſſing Riches, the great Bait and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to our Enemies to come and plunder the Place; in which Friends would be far from being the only Sufferers, for their Neighbours muſt equally partake with them who therefore, by all means deſire a Law for a Militia, in a regular Manner to defend themſelves and the Country, as they have in the other Colonies. That in the laſt <hi>French</hi> War, <hi>Penſilvania</hi> was but an inconſiderable Colony; but now, by its extended Commerce, it has acquired a very great Reputation; and particularly that <hi>Philadelphia</hi> has the Name of a rich City, is known to have no manner of Fortification, and is, as has been ſaid, a tempting Bait by Water from the Sea; and by Land, the whole Country lies expoſed to the <hi>French,</hi> with whom a War is daily expected: That in their laſt War with <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> were ſo greatly diſtreſs'd, by a Current of yearly Loſſes, that they were glad to ſit quiet where they might; but now 'tis much otherwiſe, as they appear rather in a Condition to give Laws to all their Neighbours: That our own <hi>Indians</hi> unhappily retiring Weſtward, have open'd a ready R<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

For the which Reaſons, our numerous back Inhabitants, as well as others, ought to be obliged to furniſh themſelves with Arms, and to be diſciplined as in other Colonies for their own proper Defence, which would be no manner of Charge to the Publick, and but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            <p>Theſe, I think, are the principal Arguments adduced by thoſe who plead for a Law for Self-Defence: To which I ſhall add theſe other weighty Conſiderations, that may more
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004740_0004_100DD18494948A18"/>particularly affect Friends as a People; The Government at Home, and particularly the Parliament, appear to have this preſent War very much at Heart, in which they ſpare no Charge in fitting out large Fleets, with Land-Forces, and expect that all their Colonies will in the ſame Manner exert themſelves, as the Aſſemblies of all the others have in ſome Meaſure done, ours excepted, not only in their Contributions, but they have alſo generally a regular Militia for their Defence.</p>
            <p>Our Friends have recommended themſelves to the Government in <hi>Britain,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their peaceable Deportment, as has been already obſerved, but by complying with its Demands, in chearfully contributing by the Payment of their Taxes towards every War; yet they are admitted into no Offices of the Government above thoſe of the reſpective Pariſhes where they live, except that ſome have undertaken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Publick Money; and tho' tolerated in their Opinions, as they interfere not with the Adminiſtration, yet theſe Opinions are ſo far from being approved by the Government, that when they ſhall be urged as a Negative to putting ſo valuable a Country as this, and ſcituate, as has been mentioned, in a proper Poſture of Defence, thoſe who plead their Privileges for ſuch a Negative, may undoubtedly expect to be diveſted of them, either by Act of Parliament, or a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> from the King againſt their Charters; for it will be accounted equal to betraying it. And this, beſides the irreparable Loſs to ourſelves, muſt prove a Reproach, and vaſt Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Profeſſion every where.</p>
            <p>'Tis alledged, the Governor made a falſe Step laſt Year in Encouraging or Suffering our Servants to inliſt; for which he has been abridged by the Aſſembly of the Salary, for a Year and a half, that has for many Years before been allowed to our Governors. But as this is interpreted by the Miniſtry in <hi>Britain,</hi> as a Proof of an extraordinary Zeal for the King's Service, his Conduct herein, as alſo his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Board of Trade, however diſpleaſing to us, will undoubtedly recommend him the more to the Regard of our Superiors, in whoſe Power we are; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we may expect to hear of it.</p>
            <p>Our Province is now rent into Parties, and in a moſt unchriſtian Manner <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">

               </gap> Love and Charity, the great Characteriſticks of the Chriſtian Religion, are in a great Meaſure baniſhed from amongſt the People, and Contention too generally prevails. But, for the weighty Reaſons that have been mentioned in this Paper, it is not to be doubted but that thoſe who are for a Law for Defence, if the War continues, and the Country be not ruin'd by an Enemy before, muſt in Time obtain it: It is therefore propoſed to the ſerious and moſt weighty Conſideration of this Meeting, Whether it may not, at this Time, be adviſeable, that all ſuch who for Conſcience-ſake cannot join in any Law for Self-Defence, ſhould not only decline ſtanding Candidates at the enſuing Election for Repreſentatives themſelves, but alſo adviſe all others who are equally ſcrupulous, to do the ſame; and as Animoſities and Faction have greatly prevailed amongſt us of late, and at all Times there prevails with too many an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, parſimonious Diſpoſition, who <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
