            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>CUSTOMS</hi> generally approved, and <hi>Opinions</hi> received by Youth from their Superiors, become like the natural Produce of a Soil, eſpecially when they are ſuited to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Inclinations: But as the Judgments of God are without Partiality, by which the State of the Soul muſt be tried, it would be the higheſt Wiſdom to forego Cuſtoms and popular Opinions, and try the Treaſures of the Soul by the infallible Standard <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NATURAL Affection</hi> needs a careful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: Operating upon us in a ſoft Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>it</hi> kindles Deſires of Love and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and there is Danger of taking it for ſomething higher. To me it appears an Inſtinct like that which inferior Creatures have; each of them, we ſee, by the Ties of Nature, love <hi>Self</hi> by; that which is a Part of <hi>Self</hi> they
<pb facs="unknown:007341_0003_102B5B98E35B6C10"/>
love by the ſame Tie or Inſtinct. In them it in ſome Meaſure does the Offices of Reaſon, by which, among other Things, they watchfully keep, and orderly feed their helpleſs Offspring. Thus <hi>Natural Affection</hi> appears to be a Branch of <hi>Self-love,</hi> good in the Animal Race, in us likewiſe, with proper Limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but otherwiſe is productive of Evil, by exciting Deſires to promote <hi>ſome</hi> by Means prejudicial to <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>OUR</hi> Bleſſed Saviour ſeems to give a Check to this irregular Fondneſs in Nature, and, at the ſame Time, a Preſident for us: <hi>Who is my Mother, and who are my Brethren?</hi> Thereby intimating, that the earthly Ties of Relationſhip, are, comparatively, inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to ſuch who, thro' a ſteady Courſe of Obedience, have come to the happy Experience of the Spirit of God bearing witneſs with their Spirits that they are his Children:—<hi>And he ſtretched forth his Hands towards his Diſciples, and ſaid, Behold my Mother and my Brethren: For whoſoever ſhall do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven</hi> (arrives at the more noble Part of true Relationſhip) <hi>the ſame is my Brother, and Siſter, and Mother,</hi> Mat. <hi>xii. 48.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:007341_0004_102B5B9A673B22F8"/>
               <hi>THIS</hi> Doctrine agrees well with a State truly compleat, where <hi>Love</hi> neceſſarily operates according to the Agreeableneſs of Things on Principles unalterable and in themſelves perfect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF</hi> endeavouring to have my Children emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent amongſt Men after my Death, be that which no Reaſons grounded on thoſe Principles can be brought to ſupport; then to be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in my Purſuit after Gain, and to keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways within the Bounds of thoſe Principles, is an indiſpenſable Duty, and to depart from it, a dark unfruitful Toil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IN</hi> our preſent Condition, to <hi>love</hi> our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is needful; but except this <hi>Love</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the true heavenly Principle which ſees beyond earthly Treaſures, it will rather be injurious than of any real Advantage to them: Where the Fountain is corrupt, the Streams muſt neceſſarily be impure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT</hi> important Injunction of our Saviour, <hi>Mat. vi. 33.</hi> with the Promiſe annexed, contains a ſhort but comprehenſive View of our Duty and Happineſs:—If then the Buſineſs of Mankind in this Life, is, to firſt ſeek an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; if this cannot be done, but by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Means; if a Summary of the Means is, <hi>Not to do that to another
<pb facs="unknown:007341_0005_102B5B9BEB49BDC8"/>
which, in like Circumſtances, we would not have done unto us,</hi> then theſe are Points of Moment, and worthy of our moſt ſerious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WHAT</hi> I write on this Subject is with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, and the Hints given are in as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Terms as my Concern would allow: I knew it is a Point about which in all its Branches Men that appear to aim well are not generally agreed, and for that Reaſon I choſe to avoid being very particular:—If I may happily have let drop any Thing that may excite ſuch as are concerned in the Practice to a close Thinking on the Subject treated of, the Cand<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="2 letters">

            <p>AS Many Times there are different Motives to the ſame Actions; and one does that from a generous Heart, which another does for ſelfiſh Ends:—The like may be ſaid in this Caſe.</p>
            <p>THERE are various Circumſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that keep <hi>Negroes,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007341_0007_102B5BA12C8BB790"/>
Ways by which they fall under their Care; and, I doubt not, there are many well diſpoſed Perſons amongſt them who deſire rather to manage wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſtly in this difficult Matter, than to make Gain of it.</p>
            <p>BUT the general Diſadvantage which theſe poor <hi>Africans</hi> lie under in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light'ned Chriſtian Country, having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fill'd me with real Sadneſs, and been like undigeſted Matter on my Mind, I now think it my Duty, through Divine Aid, to offer ſome Thoughts thereon to the Conſideration of others.</p>
            <p>WHEN we remember that all Nations are of one Blood, <hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 20. that in this World we are but Sojourners, that we are ſubject to the like Afflictions and Infirmities of Body, the like Diſorders and Frailties in Mind, the like Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſame Death, and the ſame Judgment, and, that the Alwiſe Being is Judge and Lord over us all, it ſeems to raiſe an Idea of a general Brother<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hood, and a Diſpoſition eaſy to be touch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed with a Feeling of each others Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons: But when we forget thoſe Thing and look chiefly at our outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007341_0008_102B5BA34A8A9008"/>
in this and ſome Ages paſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly retaining in our Minds the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt us and them, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our Knowledge and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Things divine, natural and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ificial, our Breaſts being apt to be filled with fond Notions of Superiority; there is Danger of erring in our Conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</p>
            <p>WE allow them to be of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with ourſelves, the Odds is, we are in a higher Station, and enjoy greater Favours than they: And when it is thus, that our heavenly Father endoweth ſome of his Children with diſtinguiſhed Gifts, they are intended for good Ends; but if thoſe thus gifted are thereby lifted up above their Brethren, not conſidering themſelves as Debtors to the Weak, nor behaving themſelves as faithful Stewards, none who judge impartially can ſuppoſe them free from Ingratitude.</p>
            <p>WHEN a People dwell under the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſtribution of Favours from Heaven, it behoves them carefully to inſpect their Ways, and conſider the Purpoſes for which thoſe Favours were beſtowed, leſt, through Forgetfulneſs of God, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007341_0009_102B5BA5AF2949B8"/>
Miſuſing his Gifts, they incur his heavy Diſpleaſure, whoſe Judgments are juſt and equal, who exalteth and humbleth to the Duſt as he ſeeth meet.</p>
            <p>IT appears by Holy Record that Men under high Favours have been apt to err in their Opinions concerning others. Thus <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to Deſcription of the Prophet, <hi>Isai.</hi> lxv. 5. when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly corrupted and degenerated, yet remembred they were the choſen People of God, and could ſay, <hi>Stand by thyſelf, come not near me, for I am belier than thou.</hi> That this was no chance Language, but their common Opinion of other People, more fully appears by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Circumſtances which attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when God was beginning to fulfil his precious Promiſes concerning the Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Moſt High, in a Viſion, undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Peter,</hi> firſt prepared his Heart to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and, at the Houſe of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> ſhewed him of a Certainty that God was no Reſpector of Perſons.</p>
            <p>THE Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt upon a People with whom they, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, would not ſo much as cat,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007341_0010_102B5BA8EEBB8810"/>
was ſtrange to them: All they of the Cirqumciſion were aſtoniſhed to ſee it; and the Apoſtles and Brethren of <hi>Judea</hi> contended with <hi>Peter</hi> about it, till he, having rehearſed the whole Matter, and fully ſhewn that the Father's Love was unlimited, they are thereat ſttuck with Admiration, and cry out; <hi>Then hath God alſo to the</hi> Gentiles <hi>granted Repentance unto Life!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Opinion of peculiar Favours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined to them, was deeply rooted, or elſe the above Inſtance had been leſs ſtrange to them, for theſe Reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> They were generally acquainted with the Writings of the Prophets, by whom this Time was repeatedly ſpoken of, and pointed at. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Our Bleſſed Lord ſhortly before expreſly ſaid, <hi>I have other Sheep, not of this Fold, them alſo muſt I bring,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> His Words to them after his Reſurrection, at the very Time of his Aſcention, <hi>Ye ſhall be Witneſſes, to me, not only in</hi> Jeruſalem, Judea, <hi>and</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, <hi>but to the uttermoſt Parts of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE concuring Circumſtances, one would think, might have raiſed a ſtrong
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007341_0011_102B5BAA713EEF00"/>
Expectation of ſeeing ſuch a Time; yet; when it came, it proved Matter of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Aſtoniſhment.</p>
            <p>To conſider Mankind otherwiſe than Brethren, to think Favours are peculiar to one Nation, and exclude others, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſes a Darkneſs in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: For as God's Love is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſo where the Mind is ſufficiently influenced by it, it begets a Likeneſs of itſelf, and the Heart is enlarged towards all Men. Again, to conclude a People froward, perverſe, and worſe by Nature than others (who ungratefully receive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and apply them to bad Ends) this will excite a Behaviour toward them unbecoming the Excellence of true Religion.</p>
            <p>To prevent ſuch Error, let us calmly conſider their Circumſtance; and, the better to do it, make their Caſe ours.

Superiors ſeldom took Notice of us, that while others, in Eaſe, have plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully heap'd up the Fruit of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we had receiv'd barely enough to relieve Nature, and being wholly at the Command of others, had generally been treated as a contemptible, ignorant Part of Mankind: Should we, in that Caſe, be leſs abject than they now are? Again, If Oppreſſion be ſo hard to bear, that a wiſe Man is made mad by it, <hi>Eccl.</hi> vii. 7. then a Series of thoſe Things alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Behaviour and Manners of a People, is what may reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
            <p>WHEN our Property is taken contrary to our Mind, by Means appearing to us unjuſt, it is only through divine Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Enlargement of Heart from thence proceeding, that we can love our reputed Oppreſſors: If the <hi>Negroes</hi> fall ſhort in this, an uneaſy, if not a diſconſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Diſpoſition, will be awak'ned, and remain like Seeds in their Minds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Sloth and many other Habits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing odious to us, with which being free Men, they, perhaps, had not been chargeable. Theſe, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,

rightly conſidered, will leſſen that too great Diſparity, which ſome make between us and them.</p>
            <p>INTEGRITY of Heart hath appeared in ſome of them; ſo that if we continue in the Word of Chriſt (previous to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipleſhip, <hi>John</hi> viii. 31.) and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards them be ſeaſoned with his Love, we may hope to ſee the good Effect of it: The which, in a good De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is the Caſe with ſome into whoſe Hands they have fallen: But that too many treat them otherwiſe, not ſeeming concious of any Neglect, is, alas! too evident.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Self-love</hi> preſides in our Minds, our Opinions are bias'd in our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; in this Condition, being concerned with a People ſo ſituated, that they have no Voice to plead their own Cauſe, there's Danger of uſing ourſelves to an undiſturbed Partiality, till, by long Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, the Mind becomes reconciled with it, and the Judgment itſelf infected.</p>
            <p>To humbly apply to God for Wiſdom, that we may thereby be enabled to ſee Things as they are, and ought to be, is very needful; hereby the hidden

Things of Darkneſs may be brought to light, and the Judgment made clear: We ſhall then conſider Mankind as Brethren: Though different Degrees and a Variety of Qualifications and Abilities, one dependant on another, be admitted, yet high Thoughts will be laid aſide, and all Men treated as becometh the Sons of one Father, agreeable to the Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>
               <q>HE hath laid down the beſt Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, by which Mankind ought to judge of their own Conduct, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers judge for them of theirs, one towards another, <hi>viz. Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> I take it, that all Men by Nature, are equally entituled to the Equity of this Rule, and under the indiſpenſable Obligations of it. One Man ought not to look upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man, or Society of Men, as ſo far beneath him, but that he ſhould put himſelf in their Place, in all his Actions towards them, and bring all to this Teſt, <hi>viz.</hi> How ſhould I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of this Conduct, were I in their Circumſtance and they in mine?</q>

Had theſe People come voluntarily and dwelt amongſt us, to have called them Strangers would be proper and their being brought by Force, with Regret, and a languiſhing Mind, may well raiſe Compaſſion in a Heart rightly diſpoſed: But there is Nothing in ſuch Treatment, which upon a wiſe and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Conſideration, will any Ways leſſer their Right of being treated as Strangers.

            <p>WE may further conſider, that they are now amongſt us, and thoſe of our Nation the Cauſe of their being here; that whatſoever Difficulty accrues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we are juſtly chargeable with, and to bear all Inconveniencies attending it, with a ſerious and weighty Concern of

            <p>HOW deeply ſoever Men are involved in the moſt exquiſite Difficulties, Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart, and upright Walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, freely ſubmitting to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, is the moſt ſure Remedy: He only is able to relieve, not only Perſons, but Nations, in their greateſt Calamities.</p>
            <p>DAVID, in a great Strait, when the Senſe of his paſt Error, and the full Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an impending Calamity, as the Reward of it, were united to the agravating his Diſtreſs, after ſome Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, ſaith, <hi>Let me fall now into the Hands of the Lord, for very great are his Mercies; let me not fall into the Hand of Man,</hi> 1 Chron. xxi. 13.</p>
            <p>TO act continually with Integrity of Heart, above all narrow or ſelfiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, is a ſure Token of our being Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that Salvation which <hi>God hath appointed for Walls and Bulwarks,</hi> Iſa. v. 26.

Contradiction, a more happy Situation than can ever be promiſed by the utmoſt Reach of Art and Power united, not proceeding from heavenly Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>A SUPPLY to Nature's lawful Wants, joined with a peaceful, humble Mind, is the trueſt Happineſs in this Life; and if here we arrive to this, and remain to walk in the Path of the Juſt, our Caſe will be truly happy: And though herein we may part with, or miſs of ſome glaring Shews of Riches, and leave our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren little elſe but wiſe Inſtructions, a good Example, and the Knowledge of ſome honeſt Employment, theſe, with the Bleſſing of Providence, are ſufficient for their Happineſs, and are more likely to prove ſo, than laying up Treaſures for them, which are often rather a Snare, than any real Benefit; eſpecially to them, who, inſtead of being exampled to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, are in all Things taught to prefer the getting of Riches, and to eye the temporal Diſtinctions they give, as the principal Buſineſs of this Life. Theſe readily overlook the true Happineſs of Man, as it reſults from the Enjoyment of all Things in the Fear of

God, and, miſerably ſubſtituting an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Good, dangerous in the Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and uncertain in the Fruition, they are ſubject to many Diſappointments, and every Sweet carries its Sting.</p>
            <p>IT is the Concluſion of our bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles, as appears by their Lives and Doctrines, that the higheſt Delights of Senſe, or moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Objects viſible, ought ever to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted infinitely inferior to that real intellectual Happineſs ſuited to Man in his primitive Innocence, and now to be found in true Renovation of Mind; and that the Comforts of our preſent Life, the Things moſt grateful to us, ought always to be receiv'd with Temperance, and never made the chief Objects of our Deſire, Hope, or Love: But that our whole Heart and Affections be princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally looking to that <hi>City, which hath Foundations, whoſe Maker and Builder is God.</hi> Did we ſo improve the Gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, that our Children might have an Education ſuited to theſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and our Example to confirm it, we might rejoice in Hopes of their being Heirs of an Inheritance incorruptible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007341_0020_102B5BBE13727848"/>THIS Inheritance as Chriſtians, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the moſt valuable; and how then can we fail to deſire it for our Children? O that we were conſiſtent with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in purſuing Means neceſſary to obtain it!</p>
            <p>IT appears, by Experience, that where Children are educated in Fulneſs, Eaſe and Idleneſs, evil Habits are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, than in common amongſt ſuch who are prudently employed in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Affairs of Life: And if Children are not only educated in the Way of ſo great Temptation, but have alſo the Opportunity of lording it over their Fellow Creatures, and being Maſters of Men in their Childhood, how can we hope otherwiſe than that their tender Minds will be poſſeſſed with Thoughts too high for them? Which, by Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, gaining Strength, will prove, like a ſlow Current, gradually ſeparating them from (or keeping from Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with) that Humility and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which alone laſting Happineſs can be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>MAN is born to labour, and Experience abundantly ſheweth, that it is for our

Good: But where the Powerful lay the Burthen on the Inferior, without afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian Education, and ſuitable Opportunity of improving the Mind, and a Treatment which we, in their Caſe, ſhould approve, that themſelves may live at Eaſe, and fare ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and lay up Riches for their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, this ſeems to concradict the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Providence, and, I doubt, is ſometimes the Effect of a perverted Mind: For while the Life of one is made grievous by the Rigour of another, it entails Miſery on both.</p>
            <p>AMONGST the manifold Works of Providence, diſplayed in the different Ages of the World, theſe which follow (with many others) may afford Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>ABRAHAM was called of God to leave his Country and Kindred, to ſojourn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſt Strangers: Through Famine, and Danger of Death, he was forced to flee from one Kingdom to another: He, at length, not only had Aſſurance of being the Father of many Nations, but became a mighty Prince, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxiii. 6.</p>
            <p>REMARKABLE was the Dealings of God with <hi>Jacob</hi> in a low Eſtate, the

juſt Senſe he retained of them after his Advancement, appears by his Words; <hi>I am not worthy of the Leaſt of all thy Mercies,</hi> Gen. xxxii. 10. xlviii. 15.</p>
            <p>THE numerous Afflictions of <hi>Joseph,</hi> are very ſingular; the particular Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God therein, no leſs manifeſt: He, at length, became Governor of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> and famous for Wiſdom and Virtue.</p>
            <p>THE Series of Troubles <hi>David</hi> paſſed through, few amongſt us are ignorant of; and yet he afterwards became as one of the great Men of the Earth.</p>
            <p>SOME Evidences of the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom appears in thoſe Things, in that ſuch who are intended for high Stations, have firſt been very low and dejected, that Truth might be ſealed on their Hearts, and that the Characters there imprinted by Bitterneſs and Adverſity, might in after Years remain, ſuggeſting compaſſionate Ideas, and, in their Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, quicken their Regard to thoſe in the like Condition: Which yet further appears in the Caſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> They were well acquainted with grievous Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, a long and rigorous Servitude, then, through many notable Events, were

made Chief amongſt the Nations: To them we find a Repetition of Precepts to the Purpoſe aboveſaid: Though, for Ends agreeable to infinite Wiſdom, they were choſe as a peculiar People for a Time; yet the Moſt High acquaints them, that his Love is not confined, but extends to the Stranger; and, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite their Compaſſion, reminds them of Times paſt, <hi>Ye were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt, Deut. x. 19. Again, <hi>Thou ſhalt not oppreſs a Stranger, for ye know the Heart of a Stranger, ſeeing ye were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in the Land of</hi> Egypt, Exod. xxiii. 9.</p>
            <p>IF we call to Mind our Beginning, ſome of us may find a Time, wherein our Fathers were under Afflictions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and manifold Sufferings.</p>
            <p>RESPECTING our Progreſs in this Land, the Time is ſhort ſince our Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was ſmall and Number few, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the native Inhabitants.

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007341_0024_102B5BC92A979468"/>THE Wilderneſs and ſolitary Deſarts in which our Fathers paſſed the Days of their Pilgrimage, are now turned into pleaſant Fields; the Natives are gone from before us, and we eſtabliſhed peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the Poſſeſſsion of the Land, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying our civil and religious Liberties; and, while many Parts of the World have groaned under the heavy Calamities of War, our Habitation remains quiet, and our Land fruitful.</p>
            <p>WHEN we trace back the Steps we have trodden, and ſee how the Lord hath opened a Way in the Wilderneſs for us, to the Wiſe it will eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that all this was not done to be buried in Oblivion; but to prepare a People for more fruitful Returns, and the Remembrance thereof, ought to humble us in Proſperity, and excite in us a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Benevolence towards our Inferiors.</p>
            <p>IF we do not conſider theſe Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, but, through a ſtupid Indolence, conceive Views of Intereſt, ſeparate from the general Good of the great Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and, in Purſuance thereof, treat our Inferiors with Rigour, to increaſe our Wealth, and gain Riches for our

            <p>TO our great Maſter we ſtand or fall, to judge or condemn is moſt ſuitable to his Wiſdom and Authority; my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is to perſuade, and intreat, and ſimply give Hints of my Way of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

            <p>ARE we the People thus favoured Are we they whoſe Minds are opened influenced, and govern'd by the Spirit of Chriſt, and thereby made Sons of God?

of, at leaſt, our whole Families, and more, if thereto capacitated?</p>
            <p>IF we, by the Operation of the Spirit of Chriſt, become Heirs with him in the Kingdom of his Father, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the alluring counterfeit Joys of this World, and the Joy of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in us, to ſuppoſe that One remaining in this happy Condition, can for the Sake of earthly Riches, not only deprive his Fellow Creatures of the Sweetneſs of Freedom (which, rightly uſed, is one of the greateſt temporal Bleſſings) but therewith neglect uſing proper Means, for their Acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures, and the Advantage of true Religion, ſeems, at leaſt, a Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Reaſon.</p>
            <p>WHOEVER rightly advocates the Cauſe of ſome, thereby promotes the Good of all. The State of Mankind was harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious in the Beginning, and tho' Sin hath introduced Diſcord, yet, through the wonderful Love of God, in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, the Way is open for our Redemption, and Means appointed to reſtore us to primitive Harmony.

That if one ſuffer, by the Unfaithfulneſs of another, the Mind, the moſt noble Part of him that occaſions the Diſcord, is thereby alienated from its true and real Happineſs.</p>
            <p>OUR Duty and Intereſt is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly united, and when we neglect or miſuſe our Talents, we neceſſarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the heavenly Fellowſhip, and are in the Way to the greateſt of Evils.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, to examine and prove ourſelves, to find what Harmony the Power preſiding in us bears with the Divine Nature, is a Duty not more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent and neceſſary, than it would be beneficial.</p>
            <p>IN Holy Writ the Divine Being ſaith of himſelf, <hi>I am the Lord, which exerciſe Loving Kindneſs, Judgment and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Earth; for in thoſe Things I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. ix. 24.
