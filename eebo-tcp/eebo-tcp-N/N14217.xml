            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO form the minds of youth to the principles of uſeful knowledge, and to the eſteem and practice of virtue, is at once to communicate the greateſt benevolence to mankind, and to receive the moſt rational ſatisfaction of which a generous mind is capable.</p>
            <p>At the auſpicious Aera of the birth of an inſtitution, founded here, to promote piety, virtue and literature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to ſolicit your attention to this pleaſing theme— A theme on which I cannot flatter myſelf, that I ſhall offer any thing new, ſince it has received its deſerved Eulogies, from the enlightened of all ages, in which learning has flouriſhed.</p>
            <p>Were I to ſpeak of the importance of the good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth, in order to their paſſing through life with decency, reputation and uſefulneſs, and acting their part well on the theatre of the world; or in praiſe of the various branches of academic ſcience; or of the ſucceſs which has attended the pious labors of thoſe who have laid the foundations of ſuch inſtitutions, in which the gentle hand of inſtruction has led the ſteps of expanding genius, in the path of virtue and of knowledge; or were I to ſhew
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018006_0003_0FA45464701A8B70"/>that the virtuous education of the riſing generation, lays the ſure foundation of that <hi>righteouſneſs which exalteth a nation;</hi> my attempt would be anticipated by the celebrated maſters of inſtruction, not only of <hi>Athens</hi> and of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of theſe more enlightned days.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding the ſubject has not novelty to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it, the occaſion muſt apologize for me, generous audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, while I ſhall attempt, for your entertainment, to offer a few thoughts on the advantage derived to mankind from the improvement of the underſtanding in knowledge, and the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</p>
            <p>The divine architect, in the creation of the world, has pour'd abroad in rich profuſion his benignity among the countleſs variety of beings, its inhabitants; each repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his omnipotence, his knowledge, his wiſdom and his goodneſs. To <hi>man,</hi> the favorite of heaven, is given a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence; in that it hath pleaſed the ſovereign goodneſs, to endue him with the powers of reaſon; uniting to the divine workmanſhip of the body, an immortal ſpirit, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thought and reflection, and of everlaſting improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in knowledge and virtue; and ſo wiſely conſtituting thoſe, that the animal powers and ſenſes ſhall be happily ſubſervient to the rational improvement of the mind.</p>
            <p>It is by the cultivation of this noble power, that man attains to ſuperior dignity among his fellow men. by this he is brought to the knowledge of his end, and of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018006_0004_0FA454652DE04B10"/>of that being, to whom, true ſcience teaches him to refer, with unceaſing gratitude, the tribute of ſublime praiſe. This is the glorious end of all ſcience, and for which the father of ſpirits confered the gift of reaſon on man.— The cultivation then, of our rational powers in knowledge and in virtue, is a duty as profitable as it is binding, and as pleaſing as it is profitable.</p>
            <p>If we confine our proſpect to thoſe great characters which have roſe to eminence and glory on the ſtage of life, we ſhall find that they have attained that greatneſs by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of their minds in knowledge and virtue, and in the application of their attainments to the public good. I join the eſteem and practice of virtue with uſeful knowledge, becauſe there can be no true greatneſs without goodneſs; and deeds however illuſtrious that originate not in ſolid vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, are but the ſplendor of falſe greatneſs; it is virtue that gives them conſiſtancy, dignity and merit.</p>
            <p>From the dawn of life the mind gradually expands to receive the rays of truth, preſented by an endleſs variety of objects, which, if neglected by ſalutary inſtruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a ſordid ſelfiſhneſs, and is abſobed in ignorance; and by ſuch neglect, deprived of receiving and communicating that rational happineſs of which it is capable.</p>
            <p>Senſible of the vaſt importance of education, that the proſperity and happineſs of individuals, of families and of nations, depend upon it; wiſe legiſlators, heathen as well
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018006_0005_0FA454660146C070"/>as chriſtian, have paid particular attention to it, and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported inſtitutions of learning. They have ſought for, and maintained, in this honorable employment, men qualified to guide the youth to knowledge and virtue; hence colleges and ſchools of learning have been founded and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed in early days; and the encouragement and ſupport of literature and of the arts and ſciences interwoven with their ſyſtems of government and laws.</p>
            <p>This was the caſe with the wiſer heathen of <hi>Greece</hi> and of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in their public ſchools were formed thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned ſtateſmen, patriots, orators, poets, philoſophers and heroes; who by their abilities and generous labours, raiſed their reſpective republics to eminence and glory in the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of mankind. They roſe to opulence and dominion, more by the aids of ſuperior knowledge, than martial bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. By informing the minds of their youth with the knowledge of the rights of mankind, and warming them with patriotic virtue, they were animated to ſuch active deeds as rendered them great in the eſtimation of mankind, and reflected at the ſame time, the higheſt honor on the wiſdom of their government. Great and good men in all ages, have ever eſteemed it their honor and felicity to encourage and ſupport inſtitutions of learning.</p>
            <p>Juſtneſs of thinking and propriety of reaſoning on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects within the ken of human comprehenſion, with a ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table application of the principles of knowledge to the great purpoſes of living, are the happy fruits of a well regulated
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018006_0006_0FA4546794F30980"/>education: and in this conſiſts the dignity and glory of man.</p>
            <p>By learning and virtue the civilized man is diſtinguiſhed from the ſavage, and raiſed as far above the uncultivated part of his ſpecies, as they are above the animal. Learning enlarges the mind—frees it from its "native barrenneſs and ruſticity"—collects and ſtrengthens the mental powers— reduces the paſſions to a proper ſubordination to the law of reaſon, and reſtores harmony to the ſoul. It cheriſhes a manlineſs of ſpirit—it flouriſhes under the ſhield of virtuous freedom—it is the enemy of ſlavery—the ſupport and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every profeſſion of the gown, the ſword, the bar and the pulpit. It is the delight of our youthful days; an agreeable and profitable companion in active life; and the ſolace of advanced age.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cicero</note>
            </p>
            <p>To a mind engaged in the ſearch of truth, time imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly paſſes away—and is regaled with the repaſt of angels. On the wings of virtue and knowledge, it ſoars towards perfection, and with the ſteadineſs of the eagle, enjoys the beams of ſcience, unclouded by prejudice or error.</p>
            <p>Learning expands the heart with univerſal philanthropy—ſtimulates the ſoul to a generous emulation—the good of mankind is the noble rule of its conduct —it is the light of human life. Happy the people whoſe ſons purſue the paths of knowledge and of virtue! They will attain the purpoſes of life, by cultivating the arts of peace, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018006_0007_0FA454682B3FC318"/>agriculture and commerce; and by the practice of that righteouſneſs which conſiſts in juſtice, mercy and truth, reach the ſummit of human greatneſs.</p>
            <p>On the contrary; ignorance degrades the ſoul—the man is loſt in the uncultivated ſavage—and the "human form divine" but little ſuperior to the irrational creation. By <hi>ignorance</hi> the mind is not only deprived of <hi>thoſe enlarged</hi> improvements in knowledge, and of that perfection of which it is made ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, but it is the ſlave of the ſenſitive paſſions, and like a ſhip without a pilot, overwhelmed and loſt in the ſtorms of life.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"<hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>"In conſort foul agree, each heigt'ning each,</l>
               <l>"While <hi>virtue</hi> draws from <hi>knowledge,</hi> brighter fire."</l>
            </q>
            <p>The ſavage tribes of our weſtern wilderneſs, in their mode of life, exhibit a ſtriking contraſt to the advantages and felicity of a civilized people. Deſtitute of any regular forms of government, life and property are not ſecure; while no laws reſtrain the licentious, or protect the peaceable ſubject. They are the perpetual ſlaves of fierce and cruel paſſions and gloomy imaginations; the paſſive votaries of the <hi>prince of darkneſs,</hi> who rules uncontrouled in thoſe dark corners of the earth. But, what a happy change even among ſavages, is made by the introduction of knowledge! Their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tempers are ſoftened by the genial warmth of ſcience; darkneſs no longer obſtructs the mental ray. There, "witchcraft, magic and ſorcery," and the anſwers of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018006_0008_0FA4546A5CD370B8"/>oracles of demons diſappear— to the ſhades of ignorance they fly—they flouriſh only in thoſe dark regions of the earth, where the light of ſcience never ſhines.</p>
            <p>To ignorance, as the prolific cauſe, muſt be attributed, the complication of miſeries which tyranny and perſecution have brought upon mankind in the different ages of the world.</p>
            <p>Deteſtable ignorance! thou, offspring of ſin, and fruitful parent of evil! with foul aſſiduity thou nouriſheſt blind bigotry, gloomy ſuperſtition, unreſiſting ſlavery, and bloody perſecution! too long haſt thou held mankind in thy chains. Thy charm ſhall be broken. In thy ruin ſhall ſcience, liberty and virtue triumph!</p>
            <p>The introduction of knowledge opens the minds of a people to comprehend the great purpoſes of living; and to purſue the means of attaining happineſs. It diſpoſes them to ſuppreſs lawleſs ambition and revenge; which, among the uncivilized, ſpeedily kindle the flames of war—for mankind, uncultivated, are prone to commence hoſtilities at every injury; having little to looſe by the ravages of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Far different is the caſe with thoſe nations with whom manufactures, trade and commerce have made a progreſs: their intereſt and happineſs are ſecured by a peaceable conduct. Great indeed have been the changes which have been made among mankind by the introduction of the arts of civil and ſocial life, and the happy ſyſtem of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018006_0009_0FA4546BE5AA9018"/>evangelical truth—by the lighth of theſe the nations of <hi>Europe</hi> have emerged from gothic ignorance and barbariſm; and roſe to greatneſs and refinement, both in a political and religious view. Hence, the vaſt difference between the manners of theſe, and thoſe of the wandering herds of <hi>Tartars,</hi> the plundering tribes of <hi>Arabia</hi> and the ſavage nations of <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By improving the human underſtanding, great diſcoveries have been made, tending to the common utility and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>Inriched with the knowledge of the ancients, the moderns have excelled them in many valuable arts and manufactures. In profitable branches of ſcience they have alſo excelled.— As the ſuperior luſtre of the ſun eclipſes the rays of inferior orbs, ſo ſhines the genius of a <hi>Newton,</hi> among philoſophers of former times. Admitted to pry into the <hi>arcana</hi> of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by which the heavenly bodies are regulated, with a force of penetration peculiar to himſelf, he has ſtruck out new paths for ſucceeding geniuſes, and reaching the zenith of human ſcience, attained the glorious end, to which all knowledge is directed—to acknowledge and adore the allwiſe ruler of this ſtupendious frame! In the contemplation of the univerſe the mind is enraptured, and anticipates the period which ſhall diſingage it from matter and open a field for everlaſting advancement towards perfection.</p>
            <p>Great improvements have been made in later days in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018006_0010_0FA4546D5E056CC0"/>ſcience of geography. The leſſer diviſions only of the earth were known to the ancients; their geographical knowledge was bounded by <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Ganges;</hi> all beſides was to them a <hi>Terra incognita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The polar property of the magnet, and its uſes in navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, was to them unknown: hence their knowledge of diſtant regions and nations was very imperfect, and their ideas of them viſionary and romantic: and without this moſt uſeful diſcovery, we muſt have continued in the ſame igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and like the ancient <hi>Phoenicians</hi> performed our voyages only along the ſhores, and by the guidance of the ſtars. But by the aid of this invention, the ſkilful mariner can now find his way thro' the pathleſs deſerts of the ocean in ſtorms and darkneſs, to the wiſhed-for port: by this, trade and commerce, the great ſources of national opulence and power, are carried on, the nations ſpread over the face of the globe become acquainted, and are no longer ſtrangers or enemies, but friends, allies and brethren of one univerſal family. Commerce gives life and motion to the world; the ſpirit of induſtry is hereby excited, the treaſures and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of various climates diſtributed round the earth, and the general happineſs promoted. Far different from this, was the intercourſe of nations in the darker ages; <hi>then</hi> they fought each other to plunder or deſtroy; and were known only as victors and vanquiſhed, tyrants and ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Thus, from a few inſtances, we may diſcover the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs derived to mankind from the improvement of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>

Were we to trace the various and almoſt endleſs branches of the arts and manufactures to their ſource, each of them would afford a pleaſing topic of panegyric in favour of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſince they all owe their origin and perfection to the application of the principles of philoſophy and the powers of mechanics: but our time will not indulge a further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the agreeable theme.</p>
            <p>Come we now to ſpeak of the importance of the virtuous education of youth.</p>
            <p>From the acknowledged advantages which are enjoyed by thoſe nations who cultivate the arts and ſciences, and train up their youth in uſeful knowledge, and the practice of moral virtue, the neceſſity of education muſt ſtrike every mind with conviction: and learning can have no enemies, the "ignorant excepted."<note n="*" place="bottom">Reflections on learning.</note> No man, reſpected auditors, can be truly great, who is not a friend to learning; ſince no man can be truly great without an enlightned underſtanding and a benevolent heart. The importance then of the propoſition which I would attempt to illuſtrate, muſt, by the wiſe and good, be univerſally acknowledged.</p>
            <p>As the ſkill of the Artiſt gives beauty and luſtre to the rude diamond taken from the mine; ſo does the poliſh of education diſcover <hi>the juſt value of the</hi> rational immortal mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:018006_0012_0FA4546E2D52DC08"/>
The deſign of education is to qualify youth for an active, <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>virtuous life;</hi> and to direct them into the path of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>endleſs felicity.</hi> Theſe are the great ends for which this inſtitution is founded; which ordains, that the youth be initiated into ſuch branches of human ſcience, as ſhall lay a foundation for their after improvement; and above all, that ſuch impreſſions of moral obligation, and the great principles of natural and revealed religion, be made on their minds; as, by the divine bleſſing, may make them truly good; as well as uſeful in life.</p>
            <p>Youth is a ſuſceptible age; free from prejudice, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the purſuit of knowledge; inſtruction obtains a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come admittance to their minds; the heart receives it by an eaſy tranſition; and from thence it flows, in all the various actions of riper days.</p>
            <p>Thoſe impreſſions which are made upon the mind in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and youth are moſt laſting; as a new veſſel long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a tincture of the liquor which it firſt receives: theſe form the manners, and regulate the temper thro' life; agreeable to the obſervation of the wiſeſt of men. <hi>Train up a child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As education opens the mind to receive the light of revelation, it is hand-maid of religion; and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful parent of the whole family of <hi>Adam,</hi> is pleaſed to cheriſh the ſeeds of pious inſtruction planted in the youthful
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018006_0013_0FA4546FB46C2698"/>breaſt, with heavenly influence; and from thoſe families and inſtitutions, in which religion is inforced by examples of goodneſs, and inſtructions of early peity, have thoſe perſons uſually been taken, whom GOD hath honored with diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed uſefulneſs in the world.</p>
            <p>As without application, knowledge is not to be acquired; and the mind gradually expands to receive it; the ſkilful hand of inſtruction is neceſſary to rear it to valuable attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. As the fertile ſoil by proper cultivation ſends forth a rich harveſt, but if neglected by the hand of induſtry, yields nought but weeds and briers; ſo the minds of youth, well inſtructed, will ſend forth generous and ſalutary fruit, to reward the labor.</p>
            <p>In a public ſchool, youth engaged in the ſame ſtudies, will be excited by a laudable ambition to excel. The knowledge diffuſed among the whole, will become in a degree the property of each individual. There the unhappineſs of ſome diſpoſitions will be cured by a conſtant aſſociation with thoſe that are pleaſant and amiable—they will poliſh one another. And, under the direction of the faithful precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the vicious paſſions will be checked as ſoon as they appear; and the laudable, encouraged, protected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</p>
            <p>Our venerable anceſtors, impreſſed with the importance of improving this early period of life, founded colleges and ſchools; by which they have left us a monument of their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018006_0014_0FA45470838E9948"/>wiſdom, their piety and their patriotiſm, as laſting as time. This good work of theirs, it hath pleaſed GOD remarkably to bleſs;—into thoſe fountains he has caſt the ſalt of divine grace; and the ſalutary ſtreams have made glad the city of GOD. This generous part of that rightouſneſs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a zealous purſuit of duty towards the riſing genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we this day experience the bleſſed fruits of, from the great father of mankind, whoſe <hi>gentleneſs hath made us great.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us bow the knee, my highly favoured auditors, to the GOD of our fathers and of our ſalvation, with never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gratitude, that it is our happy lot to draw the vital air, and flouriſh in this land of knowledge, of liberty and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic virtue! That we are individual members of theſe States, which Heaven has crowned with the bleſſings of INDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENDENCE and PEACE; and rendered proſperous in population, commerce and wealth, and above all, that we enjoy the light of the goſpel of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er purity than any people on <hi>Earth!</hi> May it be the ſubject of our daily ſolicitude—<hi>what ſhall we render to the Lord for all his benefits!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this happy age, and even ſince the commencement of our ſucceſsful ſtruggle to be free, we behold a ſpirit of enquiry on the great ſubject of the natural rights of mankind, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly ſpreading over the earth; and the eyes of deſpotic princes and of their oppreſſed ſubjects opening to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of liberty and juſtice; national prejudices diſappearing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018006_0015_0FA4547131C28A68"/>before the dawn of ſcience; error dropping the maſk; and diſmiſſing bigotry and perſecution from her train; and mankind embracing each other as brethren. No more ſhall the ſuſpicion of hereſy condemn the innocent victim to the torture; the weapons of infernal revenge ſhall forever ſleep; and the blind votaries of deluſion receive the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light of heavenly PEACE.</p>
            <p>On the wide theatre of this new world, upon the threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of which we are juſt entering, what chearing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects open before us! Here, virtuous freedom crowned with the laurels of victory ever oppoſing ambition, will cheriſh future geniuſes that will ariſe, to eclipſe the glory of former ages! This prodigious continent, extending thro' various climates and regions, luxuriant in ſoil, will crown the arts and ſciences with the productions of her worthy ſons.— Empire having reached the limits of the globe, will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>here</hi> reſt, after it's long travel from the eaſtern hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere; and the arts and ſciences attain their laſt poliſh of perfection.<note n="*" place="bottom">A growing taſte for uſeful knowledge is an important characteriſtic of the people of this new world;—and ſeems to be the happy effect of that well regulated freedom and equality, enjoyed by them; and a pleaſing omen of future advances, to that perfection of knowledge and ſocial happineſs, which may be attained by the united exertions of the human powers. This taſte for literature has laid the foundations of ten colleges, ſeveral of them well endowed, in theſe thirteen ſtates; in which there are reſident, from 800 to 1000 ſtudents: beſides a number of public academies, which are deſigned to prepare youth for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into thoſe colleges; and to give a good engliſh education, to thoſe whoſe circumſtances may forbid their paſſing thro' a courſe of claſſic learning.
<p>There are alſo formed, ſeveral ſocieties of the <hi>literati,</hi> for advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of knowledge; and thoſe inſtitutions have been eſtabliſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the diſadvantages attending the ſettlement of a new country; and ſeveral of them, even while our enemies, tho' undeſigned by them, were aſſiſting, in laying the foundations of the auguſt edifice of a riſing empire, cemented by the blood of our countrymen!</p>

A happy preſage of future glorious days, yet to open on this continent, ſeems afforded, by the rapid progreſs of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, and of the arts and ſciences, in the courſe of a century and a half paſt: Long concealed from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mankind, and happily ſequeſtered from the old world deluged in ignorance and ſlavery—may we not indulge the pleaſing thought, that Heaven hath reſerved it, for the ſtage, on which the laſt and moſt glorious diſplays of the divine goodneſs to the children of men, ſhall be uſhered in — when, in a ſublime and perfect ſenſe, there ſhall be given to the inhabitants, a pure language—the language of PEACE and everlaſting love! <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> long loſt to the children of Adam, ſhall be found in this weſtern world; and become the reſidence of the favorites of Heaven!</p>
            <p>Hail, happy days! we congratulate you, O ye people, yet unborn, in the joyful proſpects, when the wilderneſs of <hi>America</hi> ſhall become cultivated; and the foreſt which now conceal the murderous Indian, watching for his prey, ſhall adorn the banks of yonder majeſtic lakes and rivers; and the ſails of merchantmen, whiten the watery proſpect; and the muſes flouriſh under the protection of FREEDOM and

            <p>Then ſhall thoſe glorious events, long purpoſed in the eternal mind, obtain their full accompliſhment!

They <hi>wiſely</hi> thought, that the moſt valuable <hi>legacy</hi> they could leave their <hi>children,</hi> was a <hi>virtuous education.</hi> And the happy effects of our conteſt for FREEDOM and INDEPENDENCE, under the auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſmiles of Providence, have been owing to men of ſuperior talents and enlightned genius, who roſe to ſtand foremoſt in the ſtorm; and by whom our <hi>Republic,</hi> long toſt on the warring element, is now moored in the harbour of PEACE!</p>
            <p>While we revere the character of our illuſtrious <hi>Chief,</hi> as wiſe in council, glorious in the field, and amiable in every moral and ſocial virtue, with warmeſt ſentiments of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
