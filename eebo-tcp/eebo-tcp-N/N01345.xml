            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is obſerved by the Learned, that in the earlieſt Ages of the World, thoſe who had the greateſt Authority Civil, had likewiſe the Sacred conjoyned with it: That as Civil Society's are no other than a Combination of particular Family's, ſo before Family's aſſociated into thoſe larger Society's, the Maſter of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was the Prieſt of it.</p>
            <p>And that hence it is that we read of <hi>Noah, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> that they Sacrificed; and of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Inſtructing his Family. Every Head of a Family was both King and Prieſt in his Houſe, and performed the reſpective Functions belonging to each. Afterward (as moſt conceive) the Firſt-born in Family's had the poſſeſſion of the Prieſthood, and were

exerciſed in it till the giving of the Law. To Confirm which Opinion, that Text (with ſome others) is alledged; which we have, Numb. 3. 11, 12. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>inſtead of all the Firſt-born that openeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

But whether this was ſo or not, yet moſt certain it is, that the Civil and Sacred Powers were united in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and that not only in the Morning of the World, before Family's (for mutual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages) aſſociated together; but we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it alſo afterward, even till by Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws the power of the Prieſthood was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi> Thus (as the Sacred Oracles inform us) <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was both King and Prieſt in <hi>Salem;</hi> and upon the acount of his two-fold Office (as well as in other reſpects) was an Eminent Type of Chriſt, <hi>who is a Prieſt upon a Throne.</hi> So we find <hi>Moſes</hi> (in like manner) exerciſing both theſe Powers, till <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were Conſecrated to the latter of them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29. 35.

the <hi>Gentile</hi> World (after the diſperſion) as there were Sacrifices and other Solemnity's of Sacred eſtimation, attended in Honour of their Gods, ſo the Power of the Prieſthood was often poſſeſſed by thoſe of Royal Dignity among them. Profane Story furniſhes us with inſtances of this nature; particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Egyptians, Lacaedemonians</hi> &amp; <hi>Romans,</hi> divers of whoſe Emperors (even after theſe Powers were ſeparated among them) are ſaid to retain the Title of <hi>Pontifex Maximus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of their Imperial Honours.</p>
            <p>Tis not to be doubted, but that the exerciſe of theſe two Offices by thoſe holy Perſons of old, was very agreeable to the mind of God. As for <hi>Moſes,</hi> what he did in either of them, was by expreſs Warrant from God: And altho' we find not the like as to others, yet there is no reaſon to doubt, but they acted by a like Divine Authority therein.</p>
            <p>Now this Union of theſe two Powers in the ſame Perſons in thoſe Ages of the World, as its otherwiſe Inſtructive, ſo particularly it Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts to us the Mutual Serviceableneſs of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government and Religion each to other. Civil Government duly Adminiſtred, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes not a little to the Well-being, Growth &amp; Progreſs of Religion in Society's; and this on the other hand, is highly conducive to the due and ſucceſsful Adminiſtration of Civil
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001598_0005_0FB3E7F8577FCEE0"/>
Government. Of ſuch importance is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to theſe ends, that where it is not, there is little reaſon to hope for or expect them. In this caſe, as Government is not likely to be duly Adminiſtred, ſo neither to be attended with Succeſs in its Adminiſtrations: Religion being as neceſſary to a due Obſervance of Good Laws, as to the Making and due Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them.</p>
            <p>So depraved is the Nature of Man in his fallen State, and ſuch is the mighty Power &amp; Influence of Sin in him, that where the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful influences &amp; reſtraints of Religion are wanting, there is little reaſon to hope that either Rulers or Ruled, will adorn their Places by a due diſcharge of the Duty's of either of them. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeems to have been very ſenſible of the truth of this, when he reply's to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> as in our Text; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thought, Surely the Fear of God is not in this Place; and they will Slay me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Verſe of this Chapter, we have an account of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s remove from <hi>Mamre</hi> to <hi>Gerar; And</hi> Abraham <hi>journey'd from thence toward the</hi> South-<hi>countrey, and dwelled between</hi> Kadeſh &amp; Shur, <hi>and ſojourned in</hi> Gerar. He had dwelt in the Plain of <hi>Mamre</hi> about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years, and now removes (as is conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) becauſe of the nearneſs of the ſtinking Lake of <hi>Sodom</hi> thereto. This is follow'd with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001598_0006_0FB3E7F9C0D64F48"/>
an account of <hi>Abimelech'</hi>s taking <hi>Sarah</hi> his Wife, thinking ſhe had been his Siſter; ver. 2. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid of</hi> Sarah <hi>his Wife, She is my Siſter: and</hi> Abimelech <hi>King of</hi> Gerar, <hi>ſent &amp; took</hi> Sarah. Whereupon God appears to <hi>Abimelech</hi> in a Dream, admoniſhes him of his Sin and Danger in what he had done, and Charges him to reſtore her again, <hi>Ver.</hi>3,—8. Tis obſervable, that God in the Charge He here gives to <hi>Abimelech,</hi> ſtyles <hi>Abraham</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; ver. 7. <hi>Now therefore reſtore the man his Wife; for he is a Prophet, and he ſhall Pray for thee,</hi> &amp;c. From which Text (with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) I may obſerve to you by the way, its inferred by ſome; That the true Notion of a Prophet, lies not in foretelling future events, but in declaring &amp; interpreting to the World the Mind of God received by immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from Him: That a Perſons receiving that which he makes known to others by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation from God, is that which formally Conſtitutes a Prophet; and that its wholly extrinſecal what time his Propheſy reſpects, whether that which is paſt, preſent, or to come: And that therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> here has this Title given to him; and he with <hi>Iſaac</hi> &amp; <hi>Jacob</hi> are called Prophets, Pſal. 105. 15. <hi>Touch not mine Anointed, &amp; do my Prophets no harm.</hi> Not becauſe of any Predictions uttered by them, but becauſe of the frequency of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

Revelations to them. Conſonant to which we find, that thoſe in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who Expounded the Scriptures by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inſpiration, are called Prophets, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abimelech</hi> being thus admoniſhed of God, and acquainted that <hi>Sarah</hi> was the Wife of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> reſolves to reſtore her; ſends for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and Expoſtulates with him, for his ſo dealing with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. Hereupon <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Apologiſes for himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 11,—14. Our Text is a part of this Apology; <hi>Becauſe I thought, Surely,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p n="2">2.

The Term [<hi>Religion</hi>] in our Doctrine, is wont to be variouſly apply'd &amp; taken: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Subjectively, for the internal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Acts of it: Sometimes Objectively, for the Word of God, or Rule of Religion: Sometimes for the particular Form or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhip in Society's: Tis to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here in the former of theſe Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And in this ſenſe, ſo neceſſary is it to theſe ends, that where it is wanting (even in Society's that are otherwiſe under the beſt Regulations) there is little reaſon to hope that either Government ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ely Adminiſtred, or any of the ends of it Obtained: That good Order, Peace, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility ſhould flouriſh in them.</p>
            <p>That Religion (in general) is very Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the deſigns of Government, ſeems to be a Principle which Nature furniſhes men withal. Hence we find, that thoſe who in former Ages have introduced particular Forms of Government among theſe &amp; thoſe in the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, have therewith been careful to introduce Religion likewiſe. Thus thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Law-givers, <hi>Hormes, Solon, Lycurgus, Numa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And moſt certain it is, that of ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the deſigns of Government, was even the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion in many Places, that

an <hi>Heathen</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Plutarch.</hi>
               </note> could make this <hi>Remark,</hi> viz. <hi>That Religion is a Foundation that limits and joyns So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's together.</hi> And again; <hi>That it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a Common-Wealth to Subſiſt without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as a City without Foundations.</hi> But what Virtue ſoever it might have this way, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that as none of the Vanity's of the <hi>Heathen</hi> may compare with the true GOD; ſo neither, the Influences of their Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with thoſe of the true Religion in this point.</p>
            <p>He that rightly Conſiders this, and withal the Influences of it upon the Minds of men, will ſoon be convinc'd of this, and ſay, That nothing is equally Serviceable with this to promote theſe Ends: And that this of all things moſt powerfully Obliges men to act in a due obſervance of the ſeveral Obligations they lie under to God, themſelves, and one another. In a word; What was wont to be ſaid of the imaginary Soul of the World, may be ſaid of true Religion in Society's, it ty's each part to it ſelf, and one to another; and diſpoſes of every thing for the good and advantage of the Whole. And this truth is in part at laſt Confeſſed by the greateſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's of it, when they tell us of Religion (Objectively taken,) that its a thing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001598_0012_0FB3E802B8E25CD8"/>
Original, the Politick Device of Princes the better to awe and keep their Subjects in Obedience: Which altho' it be a moſt unjuſt Imputation upon it, yet ſuppoſes the Truth now aſſerted. And accordingly, this and all other means proper to Maintain, Secure and Advance it, are wont to be Commended (by the greateſt Maſters of Civil Policy) to the particular Care and Regard of Society's, as things which are likely to be fruitful in the beſt Conſequents.</p>
            <p>There are Two <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> the one ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the other expreſs'd in the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>Tis ſuppoſed, that Religion is not of the Eſſence of Civil Government: Or that Civil Government may be in Society's</hi> (in ſome ſort at leaſt) <hi>without it.</hi> It is eaſy to diſtinguiſh, between Government in the abſtracted Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and the due Conſtitution, regular Succeſsful Exerciſe or Adminiſtration of it. The difference between theſe is very great, and the Propoſition intends the former; not the latter. Religion is not Eſſential to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to Perſons a right to Rule; [Dominion is not founded in Grace] nor yet to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Material part of the Duty's, either of the Ruler or the Ruled. Theſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion, and Government in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety's, tho' they are very Eſſential, &amp; highly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001598_0013_0FB3E8045423F1E0"/>
Contribute to the Well-being each of other, yet are not ſo inſeparably Connected, that we may ſay of them as of Relates, <hi>That they take each other; and can in no wiſe Subſiſt alone.</hi> Theſe things are not only mentally ſeparable, but really &amp; in fact are ſo. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>Tho' this be ſo, yet Religion is not only Conſiſtent with, but highly Serviceable to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the due and ſucceſsful Exerciſe of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> There are different Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; various Modifications of theſe Forms, wherein the Power of Rulers is laid under different Limitations or Reſtraints, and the Liberty or Priviledge of the Ruled various in Degree. Moreover, There are various Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders or Ranks of Perſons in the Seat of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: Some acting in an higher, others in a lower Sphere, having different Titles &amp; Powers annex'd to them. But whatever Form of Government may be in any Society's, and however Regulated, &amp; whatever Orders or Ranks of Perſons may be Employ'd in the Adminiſtration of Rule in them, (be they Supream or Subordinate) yet Religion is of the laſt Conſequence to theſe Ends.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to this, the Wiſdom of Chriſtian Nations has always directed them to ſhew particular Regard to this, Countenance and Encourage it, and all proper Methods for the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001598_0014_0FB3E805B033AD08"/>
Propagation of it; and this as for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo particularly becauſe of its benign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences upon the Civil Concerns of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's.</p>
            <p>Under this <hi>Propoſition,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how, or by what means Religion becomes ſo Serviceable to theſe Ends; and that I may not exceed the Bounds of your Patience, ſhall endeavour to reduce the ſeveral Ways by which it does ſo, unto the Five following more General Heads.[<hi>I.</hi>] It Contributes to theſe Ends as it Eſtabliſhes Good Principles. [<hi>II.</hi>] As it Directs and Influences Rulers to purſue the beſt Maxims or Rules of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.[<hi>III.</hi>] As it Influences them in all Adminiſtrations, carefully to Obſerve the proper Extent and Limits of their Power. [<hi>IV.</hi>] As it lays the moſt forcible Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, both upon Rulers &amp; Ruled, to be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their reſpective Duty's. [<hi>V.</hi>] As it Reſtrains &amp; Subdues thoſe Luſts that are the Cauſes of all Irregularity and Unſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Government in its Adminiſtrations. There ſeems not to be any way wherein Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is Serviceable to theſe Ends, but what may be reduc'd to one or other of theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>It Contributes to theſe Ends, as it Eſtabliſhes Good Principles: Aſſerts the Divine Original of Government, and Founds it in Divine Inſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tion.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001598_0015_0FB3E8074FCD9BC8"/>
That however Particular Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (with the various Regulations they are under) can't (as ſuch) lay Claim to a Divine Right, yet that Government in General, Civil Subordination and Power is the Ordinance of Heaven. Moſt certain it is, that whether there be Government among Men yea or not, is not a matter left to Humane Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but it's already Reſolved by the Moſt High, <hi>That there be a Rule over Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath Said it, the Rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>has E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed it.</hi> And the Power of thoſe who are Exalted to the Seats of Government, is from Him. Whatever the particular Inſtruments or Means of Conveying this Power, and Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in theſe and thoſe particular Perſons (that Sway the Scepter over a People) may be, yet the Power it ſelf is from God; a Ray of His. In Elective States, where Perſons are Advanc'd by the Suffrage of others to Places of Rule, and Veſted with Civil Power, the Perſons Chuſing give not the Power, but GOD. They are but the Inſtruments of Conveyance, and do but Deſign the Perſons that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from Him. And hence it is, that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws bind the Conſcience: Not ſimply as Humane, but as made by that Authority which is Divine in its Original, and to which Obedience is Commanded in the Divine Law. Now with this uſeful point of Knowledge
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001598_0016_0FB3E808C5BCE710"/>
Chriſtianity furniſhes Perſons: It inſtills and eſtabliſhes ſuch Principles as theſe, viz. <hi>The Powers that be, are Ordained of God; and there is no Power but of God,</hi> Rom. 13. 1. <hi>By Him Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth,</hi> Prov. 8. 16. <hi>Rulers are His Miniſters for Good,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. And by this means become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to theſe ends. Such Principles as theſe reſpecting Government, greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Rectitude &amp; Succeſs of it. They greatly promote Fidelity in Rulers, by a due exerciſe of their Authority.</p>
            <p>When Rulers are Eſtabliſhed in this, and duely Conſider that they are Gods by deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Miniſters of the Moſt High, Arm'd and Veſted with His Power, &amp; that with this deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> That they may be as Gods to thoſe over whom they Rule, by a due imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Excellency's appearing in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Government, it will entertain them with many ſtrong and forcible Motives to utmoſt Application in endeavours to anſwer the end of their Creation, by a due Exerciſe of the Authority Veſted in them.</p>
            <p>And as for thoſe who are in a ſtate of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, or under Rule, ſuch will be the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theſe tho'ts upon them, as will have a good tendency to give Succeſs to thoſe Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>Where theſe Principles of Chriſtianity have
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001598_0017_0FB3E80A33087018"/>
not obtain'd in Society's, Perſons are ignorant of them: Or any Principles of a contrary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are advanc'd; by reaſon whereof Civil Subordination or Rule, is look'd upon as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; a thing without Divine Warrant, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Sovereign Inſtitution of God, tis fatally Prejudicial to theſe ends. Leveliſm directly tends at once to deſtroy both the Rectitude &amp; Succeſs of Government; to make Rulers betray their Truſt, proſtitute their Authority to the worſt deſigns, and to ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the Force of all their Adminiſtrations. Whereas theſe rectify'd tho'ts concerning it, render it Sacred &amp; Venerable in the eyes of all, inſpire Rulers with the moſt Noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and the Ruled with a due Fear and Reverence of it.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>As it directs and influences Rulers, in all Adminiſtrations to purſue, or yield up themſelves to the Guidance of the beſt Maxims or Rules of Government.</hi> This Fear of God, as it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in them an Abhorrence of ſuch Rules of Government, which altho' they are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by ſome as Healthful to a State, yet are really Prejudicial to whatever is deſirable therein, ſo in the whole of their Conduct to yield up themſelves to the Government of thoſe that are of a contrary tendency. The due and ſucceſsful Exerciſe of Government,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001598_0018_0FB3E80C824D1898"/>
has a neceſſary dependance upon this; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that where ſuch wholeſome Rules are wanting in Society's, or Rulers govern not themſelves by them, but by unaccountable Humours, &amp; arbitrary Will, which are never Steady and Conſtant; and do not in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle labour to imitate the Divine Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is manag'd by fixed and ſteady Rules, there is no hope that either of theſe Ends will be obtain'd. Government agrees with all other Arts in this, that its manag'd by certain fix'd Rules or Precepts, and the Rectitude &amp; Succeſs of it may no further be expected than thoſe Rules are attended. By theſe and the wiſe and prudent Application of them, a State is Upheld and Perpetuated, the Beauty, Order, Proportion, Strength and Unity of it Maintain'd; and all hurtful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers that threaten the Ruine of it, either Prevented or Purged out.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to this, there are no Regular Well-order'd Society's where theſe things are not to be found. Indeed theſe Precepts of this Divine Art (as to all of them) are not the ſame in all Society's, but various according to the different Conſtitutions of them.</p>
            <p>As the ſame Applications in Phyſick will not ſuit with all Body's, but due regard is wont to be had to the difference of Temper or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo neither the ſame Syſtem of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001598_0019_0FB3E80E06162AA0"/>
with all Body's Politick, nor yet with the ſame at all Times, and under all Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency's; and accordingly they are wont to be diverſify'd with a Prudent Regard to the difference of Conſtitutions and Times.</p>
            <p>Now whatever Rules of this Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are recommended, either in the Sacred Oracles, or by the beſt Maſters of Civil Policy (agreeably thereto) as Healthful to a State (be they more general, or of a more reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature) Religion will influence Rulers to act &amp; do all things in their reſpective Stations, under the Direction and Influence of them. And not only ſo, but will very much Fortify them againſt the dangerous impreſſions of any Temptations (alluring or terrible) tending to turn em aſide from them: And by this means alſo, becomes Serviceable to theſe Ends.</p>
            <p>Suffer me here, by the way, but to Suggeſt two or three of theſe, inſtead of many, that might be more largely inſiſted upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<hi>'Twill influence Rulers in the whole of their Conduct, to appear with a diſtinguiſhing Zeal for the things God has put a peculiar Honour upon and Dignify'd with His Name.</hi> I mean, His Word, Worſhip, Ordinances, Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Zeal for God &amp; the things wherein His Glory is peculiarly concerned, is inſeparable from the Fear of God. <hi>Elijah</hi> ſays, 1 King. 19. 10. <hi>I have been very Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Lord of Hoſts; for the Children of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael

               <hi>have forſaken thy Covenant, thrown down thine Altars,</hi> &amp;c. Wherever it is, it will produce a due Concern&amp;Care that the Name of God be Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd, His Worſhip Maintain'd, His Ordinances &amp; Day Obſerv'd &amp; Reverenc'd, together with an inflam'd Indignation againſt whatever is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to theſe things Now due Care &amp; Zeal in Rulers to preſerve theſe things in due Eſteem &amp; Veneration in Society's, is a Rule of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Healthful Nature of which to all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's, both God &amp; Man concur in aſſerting.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Rule, not only many ways recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the Word of God, but moreover by the greateſt Maſters of Tho't, and that to all Society's however Conſtituted or Diſtinguiſh'd in their Formal Natures. I may inſert here the words of one,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Machiavell.</hi>
               </note> who has deſervedly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a place among thoſe of the firſt Rank for Wiſdom; who treating of things tending to the Proſperity and Welfare of Civil Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety's, ſays of theſe things; <hi>That were they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by Rulers according to the Precepts &amp; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of Him that firſt gave &amp; appointed them, the States and Common-Wealths of</hi> Chriſtendom, <hi>would be much more Happy and Firm.</hi> There needs no uncommon Sagacity to ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this Rule to the ends for which its wont to be recommended. He that believes
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001598_0021_0FB3E811C8F6D0A8"/>
the truth aſſerted in our Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and withal conſiders that the deſign of God in theſe things, and in requiring our Reverent Obſervance of them, is our Conformity to Him; that by theſe things as Means, we might be made partakers of the Divine Nature, &amp; transform'd into His Likeneſs. In a word, That this Fear of Him might be inſtill'd into the hearts of Sinners, preſerv'd &amp; flouriſh there, and that the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Contempt of theſe things is utterly inconſiſtent with theſe deſigns, can't but ſee it to be a Rule of the laſt Conſequence to the Civil Good of Society's, and in particular to the Ends mention'd in our Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will influence Rulers to employ their Wiſdom &amp; Power</hi> (as far as they may) <hi>to Rectify what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in the State is Prejudicial to theſe Ends.</hi> As Religion&amp;Reaſon joyntly concur in aſſerting it as a good Rule of Policy, that Rulers to their utmoſt aſſert&amp;maintain whatever in the State apparently tends to advance theſe ends; ſo no leſs that their Wiſdom &amp; Power be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently employ'd to rectify whatever therein ſtands in the way of them; and that whether it be in the main frame of their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or any thing elſe. Among the ſeveral Forms of Government in the World, there are ſome apparently unſuitable to theſe ends; they are proportion'd not to Advance any deſigns of Government, but to gratify Pride, Tyranny &amp; Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:001598_0022_0FB3E8135C768F60"/>
Others, altho' they are more adapted to theſe ends, yet not all equally ſo; ſome are more advantagiouſly ſuited to the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than others. And hence doubtleſs, it is in a great meaſure that the Succeſs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its Adminiſtrations in different Places is ſo Various. The greateſt Sagacity &amp; Prudence is neceſſary in founding States, and drawing the Plan or Scheme of Government in Society's: And many times notwithſtanding the beſt Prudence &amp; Conduct, great Errors are committed in the management of that Affair.</p>
            <p>Sometimes again in Governments of the moſt perfect Model, or advantagious Form, the due &amp; ſucceſsful Exerciſe of it is otherwiſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed. Tis difficult to enumerate the many things in Society's which many times concur to hinder the due Exerciſe of Government, &amp; obſtruct its Succeſs. But whatever it be that ſtands in the way of theſe things, this will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Rulers to uſe all due and proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods for the removal of it. As for what may be amiſs in the main frame of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, they will be hereby led to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, &amp; as far as is in their Power, &amp; may be done with Safety to the State, they will endeavour to reduce all things to the moſt perfect Model.</p>
            <p>And as for whatever elſe may prejudice theſe things, they will take care to remove them. Men of Corrupt Principles &amp; Practices,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001598_0023_0FB3E814EFE0D600"/>
who many times (by managing their Private views &amp; deſigns) put all things out of Order in Society's, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſuggeſts, <hi>Prov.25.5.</hi>) They will be hereby influenc'd to diſcard &amp; put from them. And whatever Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may have been made, &amp; prove really diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to theſe ends, they will reverſe, or ſo alter as to make them Contribute to the carrying on theſe good Deſigns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Where &amp; as far as Places of Truſt &amp; Power are at the diſpoſe of Rulers, this will influence them in preferring Perſons to them, to have entire regard to their Merits, or thoſe ſuitable Qualifications, that juſtly recommend them thereto.</hi> In the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this affair, it will diſpoſe them to lay aſide Faction, Intereſt, Affection, &amp; all thoſe Private Views which too often are wont to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in affairs of that Nature, and to regard thoſe Natural &amp; Divine Qualifications men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Word of God as neceſſary in thoſe who are to Rule over Men.

King, and his Throne ſhall be eſtabliſhed in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> And 20. 28. <hi>Mercy and Truth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King, &amp; his Throne is upholden by Mercy.</hi> And 28.16. <hi>The Prince that wanteth Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is a great Oppreſſor: but he that hateth Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſhall prolong his Days.</hi> Concerning all which (with others) as we may ſay they ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt excellent Precepts, very neceſſary to be obſerved by Rulers (of what Rank or Degree ſoever) in their Publick Capacity, ſo Religion will influence them, not only to View them in Idea, but Exemplify them in their Conduct.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>As it influences Rulers in all Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carefully to obſerve the proper Extent &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their Power.</hi> This Particular Properly belongs to the forementioned General; and might have been there mentioned as a Rule of Civil Policy, which this Fear of God will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence Rulers (in their Conduct) to obſerve; but I chuſe to Conſider it by it ſelf. As all Civil Power is a Derivative, comes from God, and is a Ray of His, ſo is it His Prerogative to impart it in what Degrees He pleaſes, and to fix the Bounds &amp; Limits of it; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly He has done in His Word. As He has therein Ordained a Subordination among Men, that ſome have a right to Rule over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo likewiſe has He given Laws to their Authority, and not left them at Liberty to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001598_0025_0FB3E8188E2BB368"/>
Purſue and Accompliſh their own Deſires.</p>
            <p>And as for the various Degrees of Perſons, that may be Employ'd in the exerciſe of Rule, and the reſpective Limitations of their Power, tho' it be a matter left to Humane determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet muſt be Manag'd with due regard to thoſe General Laws God has given, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing &amp; determining the Bounds of Humane Authority.</p>
            <p>In the Management of this Affair, as due Care muſt be taken to Veſt ſuch Powers in Men as by a due Exerciſe of which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ends of Government may be provided for, ſo likewiſe that no Authority be Veſted in them, that is not Proportioned to thoſe Ends. Now I ſay, whatever Powers may by the Poſitive Laws of Society's, be ſettled upon theſe and thoſe (be they Supreme or Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate in the Seat of Government) in Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to thoſe Laws of God before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; Religion will influence them in the whole of their Conduct, to have due regard to the proper Extent and Limits of it. As it will oblige them to exerciſe the Utmoſt of their Authority, to further the deſigns of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſo on the other hand, to be very Cautious how they encounter and bear down the Laws with their Prerogative. And that this Fear of God in this way Contributes not a little to the ends mention'd in our Doctrine,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001598_0026_0FB3E81A05D95850"/>
will be very evident in two or three Articles.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Power Veſted by God in Rulers, is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Power.</hi> As it is a Power Subordinate to God's, ſo Limited by Him. This is true, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſpeak of Power Supreme or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. We find, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19. God giving this Solemn Charge to him who ſhould firſt be advanc'd to Royal Dignity over His People; <hi>That he ſhould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, out of that which was before the Prieſts and Levites; that it ſhould be with him, that he ſhould Read therein all the days of his Life;</hi> and that for theſe Ends, viz. <hi>That he might learn to Fear the Lord his God; and to keep all the Words of this Law; that his Heart might not be lift up above his Brethren; and that he turn not aſide from the Commandment to the Right hand, or to the Left.</hi> And its obſerved by Interpreters, upon 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 25. Where it is ſaid upon <hi>Saul'</hi>s Election to be King, <hi>that</hi> Samuel <hi>told the People the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Kingdom, &amp; Wrote it in a Book, &amp; Laid it up before the Lord.</hi> Its obſerved I ſay, that when that People would not be Satisfy'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a King, that <hi>Samuel</hi> did by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, write the Manner of the Kingdom in a Book; <hi>i. e.</hi> Thoſe Fundamental Laws or Rules, by which that Form of Government ſhould be Regulated among them. So we find <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the Direction of the Unerring Spirit, giving it in Charge to the Subordinate

Rulers, the Judges among that People; Deut. 1. 16, 17. <hi>That they ſhould Hear the Cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Brethren, and Judge Righteouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween every Man &amp; his Brother, and the Stranger that was with them. That they ſhould not reſpect Perſons in Judgment; but hear the Small as well as the Great; that they ſhould not be afraid of the Face of Man, and that becauſe the Judgment was God's.</hi> Much to the ſame purpoſe, we find that worthy King <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> Charging the Succeeding Judges afterward; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 6,7,9. And who knows not, that God gave to His People of old Laws Political, by which Rulers were oblig'd to proceed in Affairs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; many of which being founded on Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Equity, and not immediately reſpecting the Common-wealth of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as ſuch are of Common and Perpetual Obligation.</p>
            <p>The declared deſign of God in Veſting Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Power in any, carry's in it Evidence to this Truth; <hi>This is</hi> (as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.) <hi>that they may be the Miniſters of Good.</hi> And by Conſequence, their Power is ſo limited as to be proportion'd to that End. Its not in the Power of Rulers to make what Laws they pleaſe, Suſpend, Abrogate or Diſanul them at pleaſure. It was the Saying of an <hi>Heathen,</hi>

&amp; Subordinate) <hi>that under the influence of their Adminiſtrations, we may lead Quiet and Peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs &amp; Honeſty.</hi> In which words, he gives us to underſtand, that the Protection of Perſons in the Undiſturbed Enjoyment of thoſe two grand Intereſts, [viz. <hi>Religion &amp; Property</hi>] is the Deſign or End of it. Rulers are deſign'd by God to be a Shield &amp; Defence to thoſe under them in their juſt Rights and Liberty's; ſuch as by the Laws of GOD &amp; their Own (conſonant thereto) are ſettled upon them: And when by their Wiſe and Prudent Adminiſtrations, they Skreen &amp; Protect thoſe under them in theſe two grand Intereſts; when their Religion is Secured to them againſt the Invaſions of Error, Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Superſtition; and their other juſt Rights againſt the Attempts of any whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: When with <hi>Job</hi> they deliver <hi>the Pour &amp; the Fatherleſs, &amp; him that hath none to help him,</hi> Job 29. 12. <hi>Break the Jaws of the Wicked, and pluck the Spoil out of his Teeth,</hi> ver. 17.

Now I ſay, ſuch Laws are given by God to the Authority of Rulers, that are wiſely Suited to theſe Ends; and when thoſe Limitations are duly obſerv'd by 'em in their Adminiſtrations, 'twill Contribute wholly to further the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:001598_0030_0FB3E81FF926C490"/>
Rulers may not do any thing to the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or Hurt of theſe Intereſts of a People. This will be Evident, if the true Extent of their Authority, with relation to this Two-fold Object of it be Conſider'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As for Mens Civil Rights, as Life, Liberty, Eſtate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God has not Subjected theſe to the Will &amp; Pleaſure of Rulers; nor may they</hi> (either by Secret Practices, or Open Violence) <hi>Invade or Diſturb their Free Enjoyment of them.</hi> They may not Enact any Laws to the Prejudice of them, nor Diſanul ſuch Laws of the State as tend to Secure theſe Intereſts. The whole Power of Legiſlation is to be Employ'd either in Determining things not Determin'd in the Divine Law, (Natural or Poſitive) or elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things already Determin'd in thoſe Laws. And in both Rulers are bound to act and do all things in Subordination (and with due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) to thoſe Laws of God, deſign'd to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Perſons in the Undiſturbed Enjoyment of theſe things. Tis already Determin'd in the Divine Law (with relation to theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of a People) that the Enjoyment of them be free &amp; undiſturb'd: And Rulers may not make any Determinations repugnant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Or if they do, they are of no force. No Law of the Civil Magiſtrate can bind in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Divine. For God when He gives to Men a Power of Legiſlation, He does
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001598_0031_0FB3E82182D6AB58"/>
it <hi>Cumulative,</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>non Privative;</hi> not ſo as to deprive Himſelf of it. The whole therefore that is left to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Powers, with relation to theſe things, ſeems to be to Enforce what GOD has already Determined concerning them: By ſuitable Rewards and Penalty's to endeavour to further &amp; ſecure Obedience thereto. And as for ſuch things as being indifferent in their own Nature, not already Determin'd in the Law of God, nor by Principles deducible therefrom, altho' they are ſubject to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Humane Authority, yet all muſt be done in due Subordination to thoſe Laws of God that have made it a Sin in any to invade theſe Rights of a People.</p>
            <p n="2">2.<hi>In like manner, if the true Extent of the Power of Rulers with relation to that other Intereſt of a People [I mean,</hi> Religion;] <hi>be Conſider'd, 'twill appear ſo far limited as to be in all Reſpects wiſely adapted to the End before mentioned.</hi> That Religion (Conſider'd as Publickly Profeſs'd in Society's) is a part of the Care &amp; Charge of the Civil Magiſtrate, none can in reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Tis an old and true Saying, <hi>Eccleſia in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica, non Reſpublica in Eccleſia:</hi> The Church is in the State, not the State in the Church. But tho' it be ſo, it is not ſubjected to his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Will: but here alſo Humane Authority is laid under wiſe Regulations. Tis a Power Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001598_0032_0FB3E8242AA38AE8"/>
&amp; Dependant, &amp; Regulated by an higher Law. This will appear in a few Hints.</p>
            <p>It's not left as a matter of Liberty with Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, to determine whether Religion ſhall be Publickly Profeſs'd, or God Publickly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd, yea or not. Its in their Power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Religion into Society's, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it with the Laws of them, which when it is once done, they have not a like Power to diſcard it again. Even that Heathen Prince <hi>Darius,</hi> Sinned &amp; Tranſgreſſed the limits of his Authority, in that Profane part of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, Dan. 6. 7,—<hi>That no man ſhould ask any Petition of any God for thirty days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it left to the Determination of Rulers, whether due Care be taken by them for the ſuitable Support of it, yea or not. Tis already determin'd in the Law of God, That they ſhall do ſo. This as it has made the Worſhip of God an indiſpenſible Duty, &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd of the ſeveral parts of that Worſhip, and that a certain Order of Men be ſet apart to that Service, (who ſhall devote &amp; give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it) ſo likewiſe, that a ſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue be ſettled upon them. Indeed, there ſeems not to be any determination in the law of God of any particular Proportion of mens Eſtates for this end or uſe. That ancient Law that ſtated the <hi>Tithe,</hi> ſeems to be a Law <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> on reaſons peculiar to the Common-Wealth
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001598_0033_0FB3E82533971B88"/>
of the <hi>Jews</hi> as ſuch; and not upon reaſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Places. The Prieſts and Levites under the Law, as they made up a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of that People, (ordinarily a Thirti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth part, as is obſerv'd) ſo much was the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Bleſſing of God upon their Labours in Tilling the Earth, that the common Returns of it were very great: Sometimes Thirty, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Sixty, &amp; ſometimes an Hundred-fold; as may be gather'd from the Parable of the good Ground, in the Goſpel. And it being ſo, it ſeems unreaſonable to extend that Law to other Nations, where thoſe that Miniſtred in Holy Things bear not that proportion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; the Soyl is not ſo rich in its Returns.</p>
            <p>But tho' it be thus, yet that a ſuitable Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port be always continu'd to thoſe who Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Sacred Things, the Law of God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, and that as due by a Natural Equity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> IX. And to determine otherwiſe, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are without Power.</p>
            <p>Nor yet may Humane Authority Ordain what it pleaſes in the Worſhip of God. <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> (who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to Sin) <hi>Ahab, Ahaz</hi> and others who did, ſo, tranſgreſſed the lines of their Authority. As for the Parts or Means of Worſhip, they are already Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; Stated in the Word of God; and from the Obligation of the Second Commandment muſt be fetch'd and warranted from thence.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001598_0034_0FB3E826BB8D5898"/>
They may not appoint what Ordinances or Ceremony's they pleaſe, in the Worſhip of God. The ſame Principles that will Warrant their Appointment of any thing, (tho' in it ſelf never ſo innocent) will equally bear them out in Introducing the whole Maſs of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Superſtition into the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Nor finally, may they Uſurp the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Function, and Perform the Acts peculiar thereto. <hi>It appertaineth not to them to burn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe unto the Lord, but to the Prieſts,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.18. In a word; The Power of Rulers with reſpect to the Object of it, ſeems to be reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theſe Heads: They are to ſee that God be Worſhipped; and that the ſeveral parts of Worſhip be attended according to the Rule of the Word, <hi>in Decency and Order:</hi> That the True Doctrine of the Goſpel be Taught; and the Sacraments Rightly Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. Tho' they are not (as One<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet.</hi>
               </note> ſays) <hi>Imperata facere;</hi> yet they are <hi>Imperare facienda.</hi> And ſee that they are ſo according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel. And a People thus Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the true Religion they are to Protect &amp; Defend: And to Oppoſe every thing Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly tending to the Subverſion of it. They are to Secure them againſt the invaſions of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, Heraeſy and Profaneſs. We have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001598_0035_0FB3E829656EE6A8"/>
of diverſe Good Kings, thus Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Power: As <hi>Aſa, Jehoſaphat, Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Joſiah,</hi> &amp;c. They ſtand obliged in theſe Points, as they are <hi>Cuſtodes &amp; Vindices Legis Divinae.</hi> From all which 'tis Evident, that the Power of Rulers is in all reſpects ſuited to the foremention'd deſign of Government; &amp; that when the proper Limits of it are duely obſerv'd by them, 'twill Contribute wholly thereto. With <hi>David</hi> they will become <hi>the Feeders of their People; the Shields of the Earth; and Nurſing Fathers to the Church, Pſal.</hi>78.71,72. &amp; 47.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. &amp; 49. 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It being ſo, it neceſſarily follows, that the Rectitude and Succeſs of Government has a great Dependance upon due Care &amp; Caution in this Point.</hi> The Power of Rulers being a Subordinate, Limited Power, and thus wiſely ſuited to the End of Government, all Errors in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, (as in the Defect, ſo in the Exceſs) muſt be very Prejudicial thereto.</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>As it lays the moſt binding Obligations both upon Rulers &amp; Ruled, to be Faithful in their reſpective Duty's.</hi> There is a Civil Relation between the Rulers and the Ruled; and as all other Relations among Men have peculiar Duty's annex'd to them, ſo 'tis with this What the Duty of the Ruler is, we have in the general heard. On the part of the Ruled,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001598_0036_0FB3E82A8EDC9890"/>
there is Honour of Reverence, Tribute and Obedience due. There is a peculiar Reſpect and Honour due to Rulers: They are ſtyled Dignity's, with reference to the place of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority they ſtand in above others: And that Honourable Name they are Dignify'd with [<hi>I ſaid, Ye are Gods:</hi>] And as they are ſo, ſo there are peculiar degrees of Deference, and Reſpect due to them above others. <hi>David</hi> tho' unjuſtly and cruelly Perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> yet becauſe of his Dignity, (he being the Lord's Anointed) one Dignify'd with the Name &amp; Authority of GOD, he ſhews a peculiar Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reſpect to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.6. Again, Tribute and Obedience to all Lawful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, are due from the Ruled: Rom. 13.5,6. <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be Subject, not only for Wrath but alſo for Conſcience ſake. For, for this cauſe Pay you Tribute alſo: For they are God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> And thoſe are ſtyled Children of <hi>Belial,</hi> who bro't no Preſents to <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 27. The word in the Original, [Mincha,] ſignifies a Gift, Oblation, or Offering; and is commonly apply'd to the Sacrifices which were offer'd to the Lord. Its rendred alſo a Preſent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 13. Which ſeems to ſuggeſt it to be the Duty of the Ruled, not only to Acknowledge them by Paying that Tribute which may Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence their Labours in Government;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001598_0037_0FB3E82C0847C810"/>
(which is an act of Juſtice) but moreover to manifeſt their peculiar Reſpect, by Preſenting them with their Gifts. Now I ſay, Whatever Duty's belong to this Relation, (whether on the part of the Ruler, or the Ruled) Religion has a diſtinguiſhing influence to promote Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity in them.</p>
            <p>As to Rulers, it preſents them with the moſt powerful inducements to Faithfulneſs. It is no leſs proper to prevent Errors in the Defect, than in the Exceſs. Thus it is, as by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> her Means, ſo particularly by unveiling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ion it carry's with it. An Oath in general, is a Solemn Invocating GOD to Witneſs for the Confirmation of the Truth, and Sincerity of what we Say or Promiſe. Hereby an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Honour is given to God: He is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the Author, Lover &amp; Rewarder of Truth; and as one that Sees and Knows all things. It's a part of Natural Worſhip, and reduceable to the Firſt Commandment of the Law, in regard of the Object Invocated, <hi>viz.</hi> GOD. But in reſpect of the Reverend Uſe of it, (or the Name of God in it) ſo its to be referr'd to the Third Commandment. Tis either Aſſertory, or Promiſſory; and as in the former, we do in the moſt Solemn Manner Call upon God in theſe (or the like) words, <hi>Let the All-ſeeing GOD, the Fountain and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001598_0038_0FB3E82DE5E0DE70"/>
of Truth, that GOD that ponders the Spirits, and is the Righteous Judge of the World, come down and Witneſs to the Truth of what I Aſſert; and let Him take Vengeance on me, if I Aſſert that which is Falſe.</hi> So in like manner, we do in the Promiſſory Oathes. We Invocate Him in like manner to Witneſs to the Truth or Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Promiſes, and Imprecate the like Vengeance upon our ſelves, in caſe of In-ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. In every Oath, there is evermore an Imprecation expreſs'd or imply'd. This in ſhort is the Nature of it, as might be ſhew'd at large. And from hence tis evident, it is a thing of the moſt Solemn Obligation, and to be inviolably kept, tho' we Sware to our Hurt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. And by laying open the Nature of this, and the Solemn Obligation of it, Religion becomes (not only otherwiſe) Serviceable to Government, but particularly as it promotes Fidelity in Rulers. Again, It is very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful this way, as it gives to and maintains in them, a Rectify'd Senſe of their State: That however (in other reſpects) they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others, yet in this they ſtand upon a Level, viz. <hi>That they are liable to Death, and the Conſequents of it.</hi> Hereby they will be led often to revolve in their Minds, that they are as liable to Death, and the cruel Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of a guilty Conſcience in their laſt Hours, and the dreadful Condemnation of the Judge
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001598_0039_0FB3E82F0AFCD208"/>
at laſt, as others, in caſe of Unfaithfulneſs. It will be often reminding them of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Memento</hi> of their Mortality which we have, Pſal. 82.6,7. <hi>I ſaid, Ye are Gods: but ye ſhall Die like Men.</hi> In a word; It will be often removing the Vail that is drawn over the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible World, and making thoſe lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations both of the Joys &amp; Horrors of it; which will powerfully incite to ſuch a Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves in their Places, that now they may have, &amp; at laſt ſhare in the Felicity of an Unreproaching Conſcience, &amp; be filled with Hope and Confidence toward God.</p>
            <p>Again, Religion is equally powerful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Fidelity in the Ruled. It is no leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make Good Subjects, than Good Rulers. It is obſerv'd by the<note n="*" place="bottom">

There would have been no propenſity in either to invade the Rights each of other, nor any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy againſt, nor irregularity in the performance of the reſpective Duty's incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them. They would have been under the Governing influence of thoſe good Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which would have diſpoſed every one to a due Obſervance of his Province, and a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; regular diſcharge of the Duty's belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto.

that Bleſſed Image, has loſt his Primitive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude, and Sin has invaded &amp; taken Poſſeſſion of his Nature, he is chang'd to Amazement. There is now no good Propenſity in him, and he is willingly Subject, and yields a chearful Obedience to the Vileſt Luſts and Paſſions. Tis thus with all Ranks and Degrees of Men whatever. The Rebellion of our Common Parent, was a Sin of Univerſal Efficacy, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a Guilt and Corruption to all Mankind, in all Ages of the World. However Men may be diſtinguiſh'd upon other accounts, yet in this Article they agree, <hi>viz.</hi> That an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Corruption is thereby diffuſed into them. Superiors &amp; Inferiors (of what kind ſoever) in this ſtand upon a Level. Sin has equally Invaded them, Marr'd the Rectitude of their Faculty's, and Subjected them to the Empire of Luſt and Paſſion. Pride, Envy, Covetouſneſs, Senſuality are Naturally the Guides of our Lives, &amp; to the Dictates of theſe we are very Obſequious. And from hence (as the proper Fountain) all the Diſorder &amp; Confuſion in the World takes its riſe. Hence tis that the Good Order, Beauty and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Society's is ſo often defac'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd. That Rulers either neglect their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or fail in the Diſcharge of it; caſt of all Care of thoſe under 'em, or ſet up a Deſpotick Power, paramount to all Law, and diſcard the

Juſtice (&amp; other Vertues) that ſhould ſhine out in all their Adminiſtrations. And on the other hand, Hence tis that the wiſeſt Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations are many times ſo Unſucceſsful, the Ruled Murmur, refuſe Submiſſion to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Conſtitutions, and invade the Rights of thoſe that are over them. In a word; From hence Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Rebellion, Fraud, Violence, and whatever elſe in Superiors, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors or Equals is deſtructive to the good Order and Tranquility of Society's reſults &amp; flows. And unleſs theſe imperious Luſts be reſtrain'd or rooted out, there can be neither Rectitude, nor Succeſs in any Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Now, this Fear of God (of all things) is the moſt Effectual for this end: And whatever Virtue may be in any thing elſe tending this way, it is deriv'd from hence. This lays the moſt powerful Reſtraints upon the Luſts of all, and caſts thoſe Blocks in the way to all Sinful Gratifications, which it is hard to ſurmount or get over: And not only ſo, but extirpates &amp; roots them out. It not only prevents the Act, but kills the Principle, and implants the contrary Habits. It bridles all thoſe Vicious Propenſity's in Men, that are inſuperable by other Means, &amp; miraculouſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the Underſtanding, Will &amp; Affections, the Sources of Action.

III. thoſe Perilous Times which he there aſſures him ſhould overtake the Church before the end, gives him a black Liſt of the Evils which (he aſſures him) ſhould then be prevalent among Profeſſors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>ver.</hi>—6. Certainly this heavy Prophecy is to a ſad degree fulfilled in our Days, theſe
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001598_0054_0FB3E84877474690"/>
Perilous Times are far advanc'd upon us, the Spirit and Temper of the generality of men among us is drawn to the Life in thoſe Verſes. Now it being ſo, and the Reforming growing Evils belonging to your Province, You will give me leave, Humbly to Call upon you to beſtir your Selves in this matter; and as the Eminency of your Station gives you ſingular Advantages, ſo that you would Apply your Selves hereto. May I not ſay to you, as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decai</hi> to <hi>Eſther,</hi> upon another Occaſion; <hi>Who knows whether God has not raiſed you for ſuch a Time as this?</hi> Be ſure this is what God expects from you in the preſent Day &amp; Seaſon. You are not inſenſible, of the Worthy's Recorded in Scripture, who have gone before you in this Work; who by a Zealous aſſerting the Cauſe of GOD in Degenerate Times, &amp; diſpenſing a Vigorous Influence to the Suppreſſing growing Evils, have added to that Crown that is now plac'd on their Heads. Not to mention others, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Signaliz'd himſelf in this Work. The Holy Spirit gives us this account of him, viz. <hi>That he was a man ſent to ſeek the Welfare of the Children of</hi> Iſrael. This was the deſign of his Miſſion and coming among them: And this with unwearied Applications he purſued and failed not to anſwer. And this he did, (as by other means, ſo particularly) by Stemming the Tide of Profaneneſs, &amp; Reforming grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001598_0055_0FB3E84930E77C48"/>
Evils among them. I may add further, (what you very well know) That the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation you lie under to the Civil Intereſts of this People (ſimply Conſider'd) is not the only thing urging this Duty upon you; but there are other Motives of a Nobler Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which (becauſe your Wiſdom ſuggeſts them to you) I forbear to mention.</p>

Unacceptable to you, to be put in mind of what you know to be our common Duty; and that you will ſuffer the word of Exhortation. <hi>Religion</hi> being a thing of ſuch Benign Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Civil Concerns of all Society's, it ly's indiſpenſibly upon us alſo to beſtir our Selves, imploy all our Talents, and unite our beſt Endeavours to further this Good Deſign.

If we conſider our ſelves in our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Capacity, as Members of the State, who expect Protection from the Laws of it, and to ſhare in the Happineſs ariſing from the good Order, Peace and Proſperity of it, ſo we ſtand bound to this Duty; but if we conſider our ſelves as <hi>the Miniſters of CHRIST,</hi> who by Office are Co-workers with Him in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of His Royal &amp; Prophetick Offices, &amp; by a ſolemn Conſecration have been ſet apart thereto; the ſtrict Charge we lie under, to be Faithful in our Work, &amp; the ſolemn Account which in a very <hi>ſhort Time</hi> we muſt give of our Stewardſhips, tis evident we lie under pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

Bonds, the higheſt Obligations imaginable, to rouſe &amp; ſtir up our ſelves, &amp; with utmoſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to engage in this affair. Certainly, there never was a day wherein there was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er need of Zeal &amp; Warmth in this affair, than in the preſent; wherein even the vileſt Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity's have eſtabliſh'd a Reputation in the World, are Legitimated by common Practice, have loſt that Fear &amp; Shame that was wont to attend 'em, walk in the day-light; and as its wont to be ſaid, <hi>Non querunt angulos.</hi> And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, ſhall we ſhut our Eyes, &amp; fold our Hands? And that we may be Succeſsful Inſtruments, and really Contribute to this good deſign, ſuffer me here in a few Hints.</p>
               <p>Let us often endeavour to recommend <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> to the Reaſon &amp; Conſciences of our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Religion <hi>is a reaſonable Service,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. The Faith &amp; Obſervance of which it conſiſts, are both grounded on the <hi>higheſt Reaſon.</hi> Faith in aſſenting to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of it, proceeds upon rational grounds; and all the <hi>Duty's</hi> of it are moſt equal &amp; juſt. Let us make it a principal part of our Work, to impreſs a ſenſe of this. Let us not account it eno' to make Addreſſes to the <hi>Affections</hi> of our Hearers; this is but to Storm the Out-works, &amp; leave the main Strong-holds of Sin Untouch'd. The impreſſions made on the <hi>Affections,</hi> are eaſily ras'd out; whereas <hi>due Conviction of the reaſonableneſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:001598_0058_0FB3E84DC49AAA48"/>
will abide with &amp; have a permanent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Let us often ſet before them the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent &amp; Future World,</hi> ſo vaſtly different in their Quality's, the kind &amp; duration of the Good &amp; Evil things of them. This is a proper Mean to wound the intereſt of Sin at the heart, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to Sinners the Folly of their Choice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to their end, &amp; by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhall be convinc'd thereof. Tis a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of our work, to ſet theſe things before Sinners in a true light: To unmask the Preſent World, and remove the Vail that is drawn over the Future &amp; Inviſible; and make lively diſcover<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the vaſt diſparity between the Good and Evil things of Each.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> Let a due Zeal appear in all <hi>our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations:</hi> Particularly in diſpenſing the Word of Life. As we ſhou'd therein appear <hi>Shining,</hi> ſo no leſs <hi>Burning Lights:</hi> And to this end, let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour our ſelves to have a ſenſe &amp; feeling of the Truths we deliver. This will enable us in a ſuitable manner to apply our ſelves to <hi>our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> &amp; very much further our Succeſs therein. <hi>Tis the Mind that convinces the Mind, &amp; the Heart perſwades the Heart.</hi> He that ſpeaks from a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred fire in his own boſom, will inflame others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Further,</hi> Let us as far as is poſſible, give our ſelves to <hi>our Work.</hi> Suffer that Addreſs of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy;</hi> 1 Tim 4. 13. <hi>Give attendance to Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001598_0059_0FB3E84F518DA318"/>
to Exhortation, to Doctrine.</hi> Indeed, ſuch are the Circumſtances of many of us, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire applications to our work are impoſſible: Yet are all of us guiltleſs in this Point? Are we as far as we may devoted to our work, and not needleſly turn'd aſide from it? Oh! Let us make it appear in the whole of our Conduct that the <hi>Saving of Souls is our principal aim.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of this, will be a ſufficient Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the enlightned Tribunal of our JUDGE at laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> Give me leave further to add, That due ſtrictneſs in the Trial of <hi>Candidates for the Miniſtry,</hi> and Care that none but ſuch whoſe merits recommend thereto, be admitted into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> will doubtleſs contribute well to this good deſign. Tis a part of that <hi>Solemn Charge</hi> that lies upon us as Miniſters, <hi>That we lay Hands ſuddenly on no man.</hi> And conſequently, that care be taken that the way of Perſons admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into the <hi>Pulpit</hi> be not too wide and eaſy. And moſt certain it is, that as a worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry is the only Means (<hi>ſince Miracles are ceaſed</hi>) to Maintain &amp; Propagate true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo due ſtrictneſs in the Examination of Perſons for &amp; Admiſſion of them to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, is the moſt proper means imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for the attaining ſuch a Bleſſing.</p>
               <p>In a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us labour in all reſpects to be Faithful, and <hi>Fulfil the Miniſtry we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001598_0060_0FB3E850C1F455F0"/>
of the Lord.</hi> So only may we hope here to enjoy the Peace &amp; Comfort reſulting from an Unreproaching Conſcience, and hereafter (<hi>when the great Shepherd of the Sheep ſhall appear</hi>) to receive a Crown of Glory that fades not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p>III. I ſhall now Direct my ſelf to ſuch Gentlemen as are here preſent, the REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES of this Colony. Such are our Circumſtances under the preſent Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, (which thro' the indulgent Providence of GOD, &amp; the Royal Favour is yet continu'd) that the Welfare of Chriſtianity has a great dependance upon your ſuitable Diſcharge of the Truſt Repoſed in you. And as you are now met together, to Conſult &amp; Do ſuch things as to your Wiſdom ſhall appear to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Welfare of this People, ſo 'tis to be hoped, that what has now been ſaid may ſo far obtain in you, that you will allow <hi>Religion</hi> a ſhare in your Conſultations, manifeſt a due Concern for the Languiſhing State of it among us, and chearfully Concur to eſtabliſh all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods proper for the Recovery thereof. It can't be deny'd, that worthy Deeds have been done (for this end) by thoſe in whoſe Hands the <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> has been lodg'd among us: Yet in as much as notwithſtanding what has been heretofore done of that Nature, this Intereſt continues ſtill to Languiſh among us,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001598_0061_0FB3E8523996C088"/>
tis evident that you are call'd to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſſay in that matter.</p>
               <p>Where the Methods Eſtabliſh'd among a People to prevent a growing Apoſtacy, and to ſecure and advance the Cauſe of God among them, are apparently Ineffectual, (whether it be thro' the manifeſt Unſuitableneſs of thoſe Methods for this end, or thro' Defect in the Proſecution of them) there ly's an indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obligation upon <hi>Rulers</hi> to take theſe things into their <hi>Conſideration,</hi> &amp; to endeavour to <hi>Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> or <hi>Mend</hi> what is wanting or amiſs in them.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent piece of Advice (&amp; very neceſſary to be obſerv'd by all Perſons how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever imploy'd) which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gives, 1 Theſ. 4. 11. <hi>Study—to do your own Buſineſs.</hi> None ſhould go beyond their Line, &amp; meddle with things foreign to their Province. Yet I think I ſhall not exceed the Bounds of my Commiſſion, nor incur the Cenſure of any that are Wiſe, if I tell you, that it is not a matter of Liberty whether you will take this matter into your ſerious Conſideration, and make a Trial what may be done in it, yea or not. Such is the State of Religion among us, &amp; ſuch Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Symptoms appear upon it, that nothing is more evident, than that if a Remedy be not ſpeedily Apply'd, the Diſeaſe will be paſt Cure. Certainly, This is an Intereſt ſo Valuable, as to deſerve your moſt deliberate Tho't &amp; Care for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001598_0062_0FB3E853C69E84E0"/>
the Securing of it. There needs no more to beget in any a Veneration of it, than impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to View it. Its own internal Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy's are ſufficient to recommend it to every impartial eye; and (which ſeems to be <hi>Peculiar to Chriſtianity</hi>) it may be further ſaid to the Praiſe of it; <hi>That the more we Know, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably greater will our Veneration be.</hi> To Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this particular, Let me tell you, That from what we have heard tis very evident, that you can't be Faithful in your <hi>Truſt,</hi> &amp; duly aſſert &amp; ſeek to Maintain the <hi>Civil Intereſts</hi> of this People whom you Repreſent, in a Neglect of the Advice now given. <hi>In a word;</hi> When the Ways of God are Deſerted, and Religion runs Low among a People, this is a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any Service we do for it, is peculiarly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God. As a Prince Dethron'd by his Subjects, retains a moſt tender Affection for thoſe who continue Loyal to him in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Revolt, &amp; ſeek to Re-inthrone him again: So we may reaſonably Conclude, that GOD will ever regard thoſe with a <hi>Peculiar Goodneſs,</hi> that ſtand for Him in Declining Times and to their Utmoſt endeavour to retrieve His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Honour and Intereſt. I ſhall take the Liberty here of Suggeſting a word or two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let the Inferiour Poſts &amp; Stations in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, be fill'd with Men of Zeal &amp; Piety.</hi> As the determination of the Perſons who ſhall be
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:001598_0063_0FB3E85533668DD8"/>
imploy'd in Subordinate Places of Truſt in the Government, is much in your Power, ſo the Intereſt of Religion ought to have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Influence upon you in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that part of <hi>your Truſt,</hi> and <hi>your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Determinations</hi> in that matter, ſhould be manag'd with particular Regards thereto. <hi>'Jethro'</hi>s Advice to <hi>Moſes,</hi> is Obligatory as to all Ranks or Degrees of Rulers Supreme or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate. And whatever Good Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made, or now, or hereafter may be, for the Service of this intereſt among us, yet if the Proſecution of them be intruſted in the hands of Perſons void of theſe <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> they are never likely to do any Good. <hi>A Sword in a Coward's hand will never Atchieve any thing, nor yet in the hands of one that is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly averſe to the Uſe of it.</hi> Common Reaſon will dictate to every man, that as for ſuch as are ſo far under the influence of Senſe, as to be falſe to their own Souls (<hi>that choiceſt Depoſitum</hi>) in the everlaſting Concerns of them, will not ſcruple to Betray a more <hi>Publick Truſt</hi> that may be Repoſed in them. Where theſe Divine Qualifications are in Perſons, they will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably produce a dear Concern that this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt may Flouriſh, and a Vigorous Proſecution of all Methods proper for that end; but where they are wanting, there will be a wretched in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of Spirit with reſpect thereto, and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001598_0064_0FB3E856B3E67020"/>
whatever diſtinguiſhing Advantages ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may enjoy to be Serviceable to this Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, yet they will never improve them. Let the intereſt of <hi>Religion</hi> therefore have a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning influence in the Management of this Affair; lay aſide all <hi>Affection, Intereſt,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Siniſter Views</hi> (which poſſibly may ſometimes have too much influenc'd herein) and let <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> be your Guide &amp; Counſellor therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Such an, Eſtabliſhment for the Support of the Goſpel, as might make Miniſters in general to give themſelves to their Work; and Settle the Worſhip of God in New Plantations, and ſuch Settlements in Towns as lie remote from the place of Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and can't (without intolerable difficulty) at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon it; would doubtleſs Contribute well to this good Deſign.</hi> I muſt Confeſs, I was at a ſtand with my ſelf, whether I had beſt recommend this Particular, yea or not; knowing how Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable any thing of this Nature is to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and being ſure of not eſcaping a Cenſure for it: However, if a ſolemn Declaration that the intereſt of <hi>Religion</hi> is the main thing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encing hereto, will excuſe me from it; I can freely make it. I plead not for the <hi>Wealth &amp; Grandure of thoſe in the Miniſtry.</hi> They are men of the ſame Make with others, and with them liable to be Corrupted by theſe things. And doubtleſs it was not without reaſon that it was ſaid of old, <hi>That when the Chalices were
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001598_0065_0FB3E8584AA3C910"/>
of Wood, the Prieſts were of Gold; but when the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices grew to be of Gold, the Prieſts became Wooden.</hi> But yet, ſuch a Support of the Miniſtry as may enable them to live ſeparate from the World, &amp; devoted to their Work, is of abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the deſign of their Office. And moſt certain it is, <hi>That however the preſent Method E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd for this End among us, may ſecure ſuch Incomes to ſome Miniſters as that they are happily advantag'd to give themſelves to Contemplation; yet as for others, they are left under miſerable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, &amp; that without remedy, by any thing as yet done for this End among us.</hi> Tis the ſolemn Charge of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy;</hi> and in him to us all, wherever diſpoſed of by the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, 1 Tim. 4. 14,15. <hi>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</hi> This Charge ly's in common upon us all: But with how many is this impoſſible? I know no reaſon to believe, but that the generality of thoſe in the Miniſtry among us, would eſteem it an happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be devoted to their Work; but with many of us this is impoſſible. As we are not Statues without Souls, ſo neither Angels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Body's: We are compounded of Fleſh &amp; Spirit as well as others, live the ſame Animal life, &amp; are incident to the ſame common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity's

We would carry into the Sanctuary with us, &amp; there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our Hearers with Diſcourſes <hi>Pertinent, Clear, Diſtinct, Nervous &amp; Well-Labour'd,</hi> like the <hi>Well-beaten Oyl of the Sanctuary;</hi> we would Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit our Flocks, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> But we can't do it: Our Places are poor, &amp; not able to Subſiſt us; and our <hi>own Hands are forc'd to miniſter to our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity's.</hi> And hereby (beſides a Thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inconveniency's of a leſſer nature) the Cauſe of God ſuffers, beyond what it is eaſy to conceive of. Miniſters are compar'd to the <hi>Luminary's of Heaven,</hi> that by their <hi>Light, Heat and Influences,</hi> are ſo Beneficial to this <hi>Lower World.</hi> The Metaphor points out to us the grand deſigns of their <hi>Office;</hi> that it is to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <hi>Light, Heat &amp; Influence</hi> to others: But if they are <hi>Clouded with ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Eclipſed by the interpoſition of Earthly things,</hi> they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (at leaſt comparitively) <hi>Uſeleſs</hi> and not capable to promote theſe good deſigns of their <hi>Office,</hi> as otherwiſe they might be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
