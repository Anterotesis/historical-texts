            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THROUGH the exceeding deceitfulneſs of ſin, wicked people are inſenſible of what they are doing againſt GOD, and the dreadful miſchief they are bringing upon themſelves. "<hi>Their fooliſh heart is darkened—they will not come to the light—they know not, neither will they underſtand—they walk on in darkneſs.</hi>" It muſt give every one much pain who has come to himſelf, and has ſuitable feelings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards GOD and his law, to ſee multitudes of his fellow creatures around him living in their ſins, and at eaſe in open rebellion againſt JEHOVAH, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imagining that it is very eaſy for them, by and by, to move the divine compaſſion, by their cries and profeſſions of ſorrow; or flatter themſelves that their wickedneſs is rather a calamity, than an evil infinitely hateful and odious to GOD; and renders them juſtly deſerving of his eternal wrath. What is more difficult for any of us to do, than to make wicked people believe that they hate GOD—ere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies to him—are continually heaping up miſchief
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020955_0004_0FB14CF1D1F68E78"/>
upon themſelves, and in effect love hell (for they love the way to it exceedingly) although HE that cannot lie, ſays in my text,—<hi>he that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul: all they that hate me, love death.</hi> Our text preſents to view two obſervations, which merit our attention at this time.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The great evil of ſinners lies in their oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to GOD, and enmity againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Sinners by their oppoſition to GOD, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly wrong themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The great evil of ſinners lies in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to GOD, and enmity againſt him. This is very evident from the holy ſcriptures, and eſpecially from the following texts. "<hi>Wherefore do the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contemn GOD—The carnal mind is enmity againſt GOD—If when we were enemies we were reconcil'd to GOD by the death of his ſon.</hi>" It is further evident that the great evil of ſinners lies in oppoſition to GOD, from the confeſſion and declaration of true penitents recorded in the divine oracles, ſays Joſeph, <hi>how ſhall I do this great evil and ſin againſt GOD?</hi>—ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>againſt thee, and thee only, have I ſinned, and done this evil.</hi> And furthermore, on the account of the wicked being oppoſed to GOD, and unlike him, they are often called ungodly in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is further evident that the evil of ſinners lies in oppoſition to GOD, becauſe ſin is a violation of the divine law. All ſins whatever that people commit, are a violation of GOD's law; therefore, a contempt of his authority, and wholly oppoſed to him. All ſins againſt ſociety, againſt rulers, parents, Maſters, and guardians; yea all ſins of thought, word and deed, are violations of GOD's holy law; therefore expreſs oppoſition, and enmity againſt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That ſinners are oppoſed to GOD, and hate him, is evident from plain facts.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020955_0005_0FB14CF347FF0AF8"/>1. It is evident that ſinners hate GOD, becauſe they will not believe what he ſays to them. "<hi>He ſpeaks once, yea twice, but they regard him not.</hi>" GOD ſpeaks excellent and important things, very often to ſinners, for a long ſeaſon, but they will not believe a word he ſays. "<hi>He that believeth not GOD hath made him a liar.</hi>" Now, what great evidence of diſlike do we ſhew to a fellow creature, when we make him a liar? and how exceeding worthleſs, do we view him, whoſe word is not worth regarding? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what greater evidence of enmity, can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit againſt GOD, than to pay no regard to what he ſays?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another evidence of hating GOD, is, their being unwilling to have him do as he pleaſes.— They diſlike what he does and are unwilling to truſt him. GOD wills many things which ſinners are diſpleaſed with. They had rather have the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of all matters which reſpect them, than to have GOD manage them. They had rather truſt themſelves, than truſt GOD. They have a better opinion of themſelves, than they have of GOD; and think that they can manage affairs better than he does. Hence it is, that ſinners are ſo often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining as we read in the Proverbs of Solomon,— <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another evidence of ſinners hating GOD, is their being ſo exceeding averſe to an acquaintance with him. They chuſe to keep at a diſtance from GOD; and are not fond of his company. Their language is, (as we read in the lively oracles,) <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from us, we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</hi> Wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed people are not fond of admitting thoughts of GOD, and his character. They are fond of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting vain, fooliſh, covetous, and unclean thoughts,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020955_0006_0FB14CF4D5B5EC20"/>
they are fond of letting ſuch thoughts dwell within them: but they will reject ſerious, godly, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious thoughts, and can't endure them. They are fond of knowing many things which are exceeding hurtful and dangerous to them; but are not fond of knowing GOD, JESUS CHRIST and the way to heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. They will not take proper pains to know theſe things. Thoughts of GOD, his ways, and doings are a burden to them; but they delight exceedingly in evil thoughts, and in evil companions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another evidence of ſinners hating GOD, is their being averſe to ſpeaking in his praiſe. They can eaſily ſpeak in praiſe of GOD's enemies; they can eaſily ſpeak in favour of them that do wickedly: But, when they ſee the holy name of GOD pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, and his honour trampled in the duſt, they can't find it in their hearts to ſay any thing for him. They are willing to ſtand up for evil doers; but are not willing to ſtand up for GOD againſt evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. When perſons are not diſpoſed to ſay any thing in favour of a neighbour, or ever to take his part, although they ſee him deſpiſed and moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abuſed; it is an evidence that they are deſtitute of all true love for him, even ſo when people will ſay nothing in GOD's praiſe—will never take his part againſt evil doers, when he is awfully and dreadfully diſhonoured—it is an evidence that they have no true love for him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another evidence of ſinners hating GOD, is, their being ſo exceedingly averſe to ſerving him, and doing that which is pleaſing in his ſight. The ſervice of GOD, is ſuch a burden to wicked people that they can't bear it. They <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ll not pray to GOD —they can't endure this part of divine ſervice—they can ſee no pleaſure, or no profit in religious ſervices. Hence, we read in the divine oracles—<hi>The wicked
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020955_0007_0FB14CF6504757D8"/>
through the pride of his countenance will not ſeek after GOD. Who is the Lord that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit is it if we pray unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, when a ſervant is exceedingly averſe to the ſervice of his maſter, can't bear it, and will not try to pleaſe him; this is an evidence that he hates him. Even ſo, when wicked people hate the ſervice of GOD, hate to pleaſe him, and even delight in doing what is very diſpleaſing to him; it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that they have enmity againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another evidence of ſinners hating GOD, is, their holding faſt their ſins, and refuſing to repent, and turn to him; although he gives them many calls and invitations, and uſes bleſſed means with them to promote their eternal ſalvation. He tells them what a great evil ſin is—that it is the troubler of the whole creation—that it brings temporal and eternal miſery. He alſo tells them what ſinners they are —that they have treaſured up much ſin, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves exceedingly vile, and deſerve to be eternally baniſhed from his preſence. Yet aſſures them, "<hi>that there is forgiveneſs, and plenteous redemption, if they will put away the evil of their doings from before his eyes—that he has la<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> help on one mighty to ſave, whoſe blood cleanſes from all ſin.</hi>" He alſo aſſures them that they are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to come to Chriſt by faith, and have pardon, peace and eternal life. He gives them repeated calls and warnings. He reaſons with them—Wilt thou never be made clean, when ſhall it once be?— turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die? forſake the fooliſh and live, and go in the way of underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The bleſſed Lord exerciſeth great patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſinners, therefore ſays, behold I ſtand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come unto him and ſup with him and he with me. Yet, "<hi>after all, they ſet at nought his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020955_0008_0FB14CF7CF849090"/>
and will none of his reproofs.</hi>" They have ſuch a love for their luſts that they will not part with them. They chuſe to hold communion and fellowſhip with GOD's enemies—they will nouriſh and ſupport them—they will have their ſins, let GOD do as he pleaſes. They make nothing of all the good which GOD holds up to their view: they ſet at nought his love, faithfulneſs and moſt tender compaſſions.— From ſuch conduct as this it is very apparent that ſinners hate GOD.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The enmity of ſinners againſt GOD is manifeſt from their conduct towards the Lord JESUS CHRIST who is GOD, and was manifeſt in the fleſh. The Lord JESUS is the illuſtious perſonage, who ſpeaks in my text; and one whom ſinners hated ſo much while upon earth, that they would not ſuffer him to live. They hated him to ſuch a degree, that they prefered a murderer before him; and would not be eaſy till they had put him to the accurſed death of the croſs, between two thieves. But let it be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſerved, that nothing can be ſo vile and baſe as the enmity of ſinners againſt GOD, and JESUS CHRIST the expreſs image of the Father's perſon: Therefore, he ſays to ſinners, this cometh to paſs that it might be fulfilled that is written in their law, they hated me without a cauſe.</p>
            <p>Sinners don't hate GOD, becauſe he has injured them, or done them the leaſt injuſtice, or given them the leaſt provocation. But they hate him for the ſame reaſon that St. Paul's hearers hated him, viz. becauſe he told them the truth. GOD tells ſinners the truth which they can't endure, therefore they hate him. GOD abhors the wicked works of ſinners and oppoſes them; and on this account they hate him. GOD can't bear with their "<hi>whoriſh heart which departs from him; and their eyes which go whoring
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020955_0009_0FB14CF9472112C0"/>
after their idols</hi>;" therefore oppoſes them and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens their deſtruction: on this account they hate him. GOD is an exceeding good maſter, full of love, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, juſtice and the moſt tender compaſſions: but ſinners ſay that he is a hard maſter, and they will not have him to rule over them. The ſervice of GOD is an exceeding good ſervice; pleaſant and reaſonable; calculated to make us comfortable and happy in time, and to eternity. But wicked people hate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn GOD, becauſe he requires them to ſerve him. Upon the whole, it appears from the holy word, from ſinners not believing GOD—diſliking what he does —averſion to an acquaintance with him—not ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his praiſe—unwilling to ſerve him—not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting—and their cruel treatment of the LORD of GLORY, that they hate him, and that their great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil lies in oppoſition to him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to ſhew that ſinners by their oppoſition to GOD, do exceedingly wrong themſelves. Sin and puniſhment are inſeparably connected. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by their enmity againſt GOD, and oppoſition to him, procure much miſchief to themſelves: for they greatly incenſe the divine wrath, and move the righteous GOVERNOUR of the world to viſit their tranſgreſſions with the rod, and their iniquities with ſtripes. By the holy appointment of Him who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways does right, evil purſues ſinners in this world, and without true repentance to all eternity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners by their oppoſition to GOD, deſtroy the peace of their own minds, and procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves terrors. Sinners are haunted with a guilty conſcience, which produces fear where no fear is.— They know in their conſciences that they deſerve puniſhment for their unreaſonable oppoſition to the great and holy GOD; no wonder then, that they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel in pain, and are like the troubled ſea, whoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

caſt forth mire and dirt. Can a ſoul abide in ſacred peace when defiled with fleſhly luſts? Will a life of irreligion, and debauchery, produce ſolid peace and quietneſs of mind?—Will covetouſneſs, pride, envy, malice, hatred, deceit, hypocriſy, and a whoriſh heart produce ſweet peace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of ſoul? We may as well expect to gather grapes of thorns and figs of thiſtles, or that a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will ſend forth at the ſame place ſweet water and bitter.</p>
            <p>What injury then do ſinners do to themſelves by their oppoſition to GOD? What a life of bondage do they lead? how are they conſumed with terrors.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Diſtreſſing pain, and bodily ſickneſs, are the productions of ſin. Sinners by the gratification of their luſts, and the works of the fleſh, bring painful and dangerous diſeaſes upon themſelves. Hence we read in the lively oracles, that men are chaſtened with pain upon their beds; and the multitude of their bones with ſtrong pain, till their fleſh conſumes away, and their bones ſtick out—and for this cauſe many are ſickly and weakly among you, and many fallen aſleep. How many by their unclean practices and intemperate living procure to themſelves loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and dangerous diſeaſes, and weariſome days and nights; Both ſcripture, and obſervation teaches us, that a life filled up with God-provoking ſins is not favourable to health and length of days.</p>

               </gap>. Poverty and ſhame, are often the productions of a wicked life, or a life of rebellion againſt GOD. How many by riotous living, waſte their ſubſtance and by unclean practiſes are brought to a morſel of bread and, by ſuch a line of conduct how many plunge into ſhame and diſgrace? How many by their fondneſs for evil companions, and the counſels
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020955_0011_0FB14CFC46B5C218"/>
of the wicked become exceeding poor and deſpicable in the world? Hence, ſaith Solomon, he that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after vain perſons ſhall have poverty enough.— Poverty and ſhame ſhall be to him that refuſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction—The drunkard and the glutton ſhall come to poverty. How many by a ſlothful, indolent and ſtupid way of living, are inſnared and reduced to beggary? Many there are among mankind who do exceedingly debaſe themſelves, by ungodly and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practices, and become deſpicable beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Such perſons make themſelves brutiſh, yea, worſe than brutiſh, for they fit themſelves for ſudden deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sinners by their rebellion againſt the LORD of HOSTS, procure to themſelves ſore, waſting and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating judgments of a public nature. GOD is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his holy providence, to bring the iniquities of ſinners upon themſelves, and to cut them off in their own wickedneſs. Wickedneſs often overthrows ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this world. The vengeance of Heaven of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten purſues and overtakes the ungodly, in this world —takes from them their various comforts at one aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtroke; and ſweeps them away by a ſudden death and dreadful overthrow. Witneſs the waters of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah—the ſlames of Sodom—Pharaoh and his hoſts in the red Sea—the plagues of Egypt—the earth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding her jaws, and ſwallowing up Korah and his accomplices—the fire from heaven which deſtroyed thoſe who invaded the ſacred function—the plague that went out from the LORD and deſtroyed fourteen thouſand who murmured and fretted againſt the LORD and Moſes—the deſtruction of the nations of Canaan—the deſtruction of Jeruſalem—the Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian captivity—the deſtruction of the Jews by the Roman army—yea, the peſtilence—the many famines wars and rumours of wars, and garments rolled in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020955_0012_0FB14CFDC7BCBA68"/>
blood; which have been in every age, and in every place, ſweeping mankind from the earth; are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the dreadful wrong and injury ſinners bring upon themſelves by their oppoſition to GOD.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Sinners by violating the law of GOD, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt him: bring upon themſelves the ſword of the civil magiſtrate, which is ordained for their puniſhment. Hence we read in Rom. xiii. for he is the miniſter of GOD to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid for he beareth not the ſword in vain: for he is the miniſter of GOD a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. Many there are, who make themſelves ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable to ſociety by their crimes, that the Lord will not allow them to live in peace, and proſper in their wickedneſs: but commands the civil magiſtrate to be upon them with his ſword, and execute the ſentence of the law. Many there are who are great troublers of ſociety, and the LORD has commanded the civil magiſtrate to trouble them. There are many whoſe conduct is ſo dangerous and intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the laws of GOD and man will not admit of their being at liberty, but require their immediate confinement in a dark and dreary priſon; where alas! they have many days and nights of adverſity. But this puniſhment is not in many caſes ſufficient. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice requires them to be conducted from the priſon to the ſtake, the pillory and the gallows; and there, like brutes to receive corporal and ignominious pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. But this mode of puniſhment is too light for many, on the account of their attrocious crimes. The law of GOD and man, will not ſuffer them to live; but requires that they be immediately put to death. "<hi>He that ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed—and the murderer ſhall ſurely be put to death.</hi>" If by all the miſchief and diſtreſs which
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020955_0013_0FB14D005AAFAA40"/>
ſinners bring upon themſelves in this world, they might be brought to true repentance; have a new heart, and a new ſpirit given them, happy, unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably happy for them! for then like the thief upon the croſs, they might go from the gallows, or place of execution, to be forever with CHRIST in the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of GOD! Their troubles would be forever at an end, when they leave this world, and their ſtate exceedingly bliſsful to all eternity! But alas! how many will not be content with all the dreadful miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they bring upon themſelves in this world, by their God-provoking ſins; will not repent—will not reform—will not lay aſide their enmity againſt GOD: but will keep their ſins and die in them; therefore can have no better portion than an eternal confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the priſon of hell. As they will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en unto GOD, and ceaſe from their rebellion againſt him—as they hate GOD, and will not have him to rule over them—as they are incorrigible, and will not come unto CHRIST and have life—they ſhall die in their iniquities; go to their own people in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of horror and keen deſpair—where the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up forever and ever.— This is the ſecond death, eternal death, and as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners love the way to it, and will not have any other way—ſo death they muſt have; it is the fruit of their own way, and their own devices.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We learn from the ſubject, that ſinners muſt experience a very great and important change, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can reaſonably hope to go to Heaven.— They muſt forſake their evil ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their evil thoughts and ceaſe from their moſt unreaſonable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt GOD. They muſt lay aſide their reliſh for ſin, and their unclean heart, which goes whoring after their idols. Yea, they muſt become new-creatures;
<pb facs="unknown:020955_0014_0FB14D019F8CA518"/>
for <hi>if any man be in</hi> CHRIST <hi>he is a new creature, all old things are done away and all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new.</hi>" They muſt love what they before hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hate what they before loved.

They muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light exceedingly in his laws, becauſe they are holy, juſt and good; and be willing to truſt GOD; and leave all their concerns with him, both for time and for eternity. This is a great and important change indeed; which the ſcriptures hold up to our view, as neceſſary for every perſon, who would have any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional hope of being admitted into the heavenly world when they die. "<hi>Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the kingdom of Heaven.</hi>"</p>
               <p n="2">2. Seeing ſin is ſo great an evil, and brings ſo much trouble upon mankind; what matter of grief and lamentation is it, that there is ſo much ſin cleaving to us. No evil can be worſe than ſin, for it is the ſource of all miſery and diſtreſs. If therefore we have reaſon to be grieved and ſorry for any thing, it is, that we have ſo much of the evil of ſin within us. Above all things in the world we ſhould dread the evil of ſin; and be more afraid of ſinning than of ſuffering. When we conſider that it is againſt GOD, and him alone that we have ſinned, and done great evil; and how poiſonous, ſhameful, deſtructive and dangerous an evil ſin is; how can we refrain from many tears, and help being pained at our very hearts?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing ſin is ſo great an evil, as it is againſt GOD, and brings ſo much miſchief upon mankind; how thankful ſhould we be to GOD, for r<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

It is not becauſe others who have committed more open and ſhameful ſins; and brought more trouble upon themſelves, than we have; are worſe by nature than we are: for undoubtedly we have the ſame corrupt and depraved natures as they have.— But our not doing as they have done is owing to that reſtraining grace granted us which has not been grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. It has been very juſtly withheld from them, and might have been very juſtly withheld from us; for who of us have not long ſince forfeited all right to it? How much ſcandalous and abominable wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould many of us have committed, had we not been helped by divine reſtraints? And how many troubles ſhould we ſoon bring upon ourſelves, if left to fall a prey to our own luſts? Let us then adore that almighty being who has kept us back from many dangerous ſins: by means of education, religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, counſels and reprooſs, gentle rebukes of providence, and the ſtrivings of the holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We learn that ſinners, are the greateſt fools that can be found in the whole creation. They are fools for ſeting themſelves againſt GOD; for they can't proſper—can maintain no ſtrength againſt him.— They are fools for treating GOD as they do, for they ſay the LORD does not ſee nor hear them. If they can ſin out of the ſight of man, they care not how many ſins they commit; as if the great eternal was not worth regarding. But alas! his eye is continually upon them and knows all their ſecret abominations, even every thought and will make them known that he is the LORD. Not one of their ſins can be forgotten, all ſhall be brought into judgment againſt them— and they can't eſcape—"<hi>There is no darkneſs nor ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow of death where the workers of iniquity can hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>" What fools muſt they be who ſet themſelves againſt the GOD of infinite power, majeſty, worth

What fools for fighting againſt the moſt amiable and excellent being in the uin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe—who moſt earneſtly invites them to lay down the weapons of their rebellion, and come to him and poſſeſs all good things! What fools, to ſtand a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a holy GOD, leſt he tear them in pieces and there be none to deliver!</p>
               <p>Sinners are guilty of the moſt egregious folly by wilfully bringing ſo much trouble upon themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their enmity is turn'd againſt themſelves: and they don't at all regard their own intereſt. They will go on to bring miſchief upon themſelves, even while they are fairly and plainly warned of what is coming upon them. They will go on to trouble themſelves by their ſins, even while they are not only warned and beſought by the miniſters of CHRIST, and their dear friends, but even while they are warned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought by the great JEHOVAH himſelf. They bring ſo many troubles upon themſelves by their own wickedneſs; that they have a hell upon earth of their own making. But they don't chuſe to ſtop here; for in addition to the hell which they procure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this world, by their God-provoking ſins— they go on ſeeking and preparing for that dreadful priſon of hell, beyond the grave, where there is no reſt, day nor night, forever and ever The folly and madneſs which ſinners run into, are not parelleled in the whole creation.—I muſt cloſewith one or two addreſſes generally expected on ſuch an occaſion.</p>

               <p>Unhappy woman. As time is juſt about to leave you, and eternity to receive you; what ſhall I ſay? Who is ſufficient for the arduous talk of addreſſing you, upon this awful occaſion? For the horrid wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020955_0017_0FB14D0608F98BE0"/>
of murder, you are condemned to die, by the law of GOD and man. You are verily guilty concerning your infant child, in that you ſaw him, a helpleſs defenceleſs babe; who had neither injured you nor any of your fellow creatures: your own child, born of your own body, whom you had been wickedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental of bringing into the world; yet you hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened your heart againſt him, and determined that you would not exerciſe ſo much compaſſion towards him as the ſea monſters, who draw out their breaſts, and give ſuck to their young ones; but with violent hands you put him to death. Be aſtoniſhed O earth at the wickedneſs of your heart! You have thought that this crime of murdering your child, was not ſo great as the murder of an adult perſon. But, let me tell you, that the murder you are guilty of, is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more dreadful aggravations than common murder. In many if not moſt inſtances of murder, there is either ſome provocation, or injury received from the perſon murdered, or a proſpect of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gain, or there is no relation by kindred blood, or the perſon is capable of making ſome defence:— but in this murder of your's, there is none of theſe things to excuſe you. You are guilty of a moſt horrid, monſtrous, and unnatural crime.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible that perſons in your ſituation, need a more ſkilfull hand than I am to deal with them; yet as you are one of the precious ſouls committed to my charge, and deſired that I ſhould ſpeak to you upon this occaſion; I muſt be allowed to ſpeak the truth to you, and act the part of an honeſt dying man, who muſt give an account to the JUDGE of quick and dead as well as you.

Although you have been frequently called, and urged, yet you would not come unto CHRIST that you might have life. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt GOD, has been the delight of your ſoul. What abominable uncleanneſs and whoredom, have you been guilty of? and to hide this awful wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what horrid lies have you told in denying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly that you was in a ſtate of pregnancy, juſt before the birth of your child? But the horrid wickedneſs of whoredom and lying, were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for you; to theſe you have added the crying ſin of murder repeatedly. You muſt conſider that in all your wickedneſs you have hated GOD, and been fighting againſt Him. GOD has been good to you, told you the truth, and beſtowed numberleſs bleſſings upon you. In the day of your diſtreſs, has repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly helped you, and uſed bleſſed means with you to reclaim you from ſin, and deliver you from the wrath to come.

right towards you. O then unleſs you now repent, are deeply humbled for your ſins, and fly to the LORD JESUS by faith; <hi>what will you do when GOD ariſeth up, and when he viſiteth what will you anſwer? Can your hands be ſtrong or your heart endure when GOD ſhall deal with you?</hi> Very great ſinners may repent and turn to GOD, and he will have mercy on them. As great ſinners as you have had a true ſenſe of their ſins, been deeply humbled before God, cryed to him with a broken heart, and obtained forgiveneſs. GOD is ready to hear prayer. The ſacrifices of a broken heart he will not deſpiſe. There is forgiveneſs and plenteous redemption, for thoſe who will repent and give themſelves to the LORD JESUS. Your ſins are not too great to be forgiven. Although you have lived in dreadful wickedneſs, yet the door of mercy is not ſhut againſt you: for GOD now calls upon you to come to him that you may have life. O then let not a moment be loſt. Lay aſide your enmity againſt GOD immediately—be reconciled to him—fight againſt him no longer—lift your ſoul to him in humble pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itent groans.

Love the Lord JESUS CHRIST in ſincerity, and you need not fear. We read of a woman in the goſpel, notoriouſly wicked and vile; who came to our Lord with a humble heart; weeping and mourning for her ſins; and waſhed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. The Lord had mercy on

Some of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jews, who crucified the LORD of Glory, were brought to repentance, became the real friends of GOD, and were forgiven. The thief upon the croſs became a new creature in his laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Lord ſaid to him, this day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe. If you can now find yourſelf reconciled to GOD's character, are pleaſed with his perfections, and are not afraid to truſt in him; you ſhall be forever happy with him. May the GOD of infinite mercy and grace interpoſe for you; and give you repentance and remiſſion of ſins, and an inheritance among the ſaints in light.

If you do that which is evil you may well be afraid; for the ruler beareth not the ſword in vain;—for he is the miniſter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. It is dangerous to venture upon thoſe ſins, which are called not ſo great as others: for ſins are all linked together like a chain, which leads to temporal and eternal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs.
