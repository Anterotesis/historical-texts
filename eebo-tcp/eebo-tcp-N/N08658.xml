            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A PREFACE ADDRESSED TO BRITISH COLONISTS.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE following explicit Obſervations, only for Corrections and Additions, were intended for the Preſs in October, 1765, when his Majeſty's Colonies were thrown into Commotions by the Stamp-Act, which may account for the Spirit and Freedom of them. They were firſt prepared ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily for three Weekly Papers, and recommended to the Printer's Correction, which indeed they greatly wanted, as new and but poorly digeſted Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as they could not then reach the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, are now expediently preſented to it; for tho' old Flames are greatly abated, they are not yet extinguiſhed, but may ſoon blaze afreſh, and even conſume us, if not timely prevented, and by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing the genuine Source of a virtual Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I have clearly ſhewn, we are not any Way repreſented in Parliament, and of Courſe, that we cannot be conſtitutionally taxed by it.</p>
            <p>Engliſh Money-granters, ſay they, have a right to tax us: And their injurious Claim has no Baſis but a pretended virtual Repreſentation, which is ſurely but a fictious one; yet our moſt learned and
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:011073_0003_0F854B0BB8086BE0"/>
worthy Remonſtrants, ſo far as I have ſeen their Writings, have left that principal Matter in much Obſcurity; and our Freedom never can be ſecure, while we may be taxed at Home, under a Colour of Right, as I have clearly ſhewn in another Place. My Arguments may have been rendered needleſs, by ſuperior Labours on the ſame Subject, but I have not ſeen them in my Recluſion, and therefore ſends my own Sentiments abroad; for though our late Grievances are juſtly redreſſed, Affairs at Home are ſtill in a fluctuating Condition, and our very impatient Enemies, who can but poorly brook their late Diſappointment, yet bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend we are virtually repreſented by Engliſh Commons, and may therefore, be regularly taxed by them.</p>
            <p>The Stamp-Act was ſoon repealed, according to our Prayer, and the importunate Clamours of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Tradeſmen, after their Tone about us was changed, but a right of taxing us at Home, ſaid to be founded on a virtual Repreſentation, is ſtill warmly inſiſted on, even in open Contempt of all our former Remonſtrances; and ſurely our ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Freedom, as Engliſh Subjects, can never be out of Danger, while that unjuſt Claim is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Power of a Britiſh Legiſlature. The moſt arbitrary Monarch in Being, may ſometimes attend to the humble Complaints of his grieved Subjects, as the Parliament lately did to ours, and ſtill maintain an abſolute Dominion over them, nor was the late unjuſt Tax taken off us as an arbitrary Impoſition, but under a ſpecious Pretence of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to a diſquieted People, and perhaps more to oblige Britiſh Tradeſmen than American Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The injurious Claim ſtill exiſts on which it was founded, and not meerly the Stamp-Act, but the momentous Right of Taxation, was and is the important Diſpute between England and us; and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:011073_0004_0F854B0C8800A908"/>
as proper Repreſentatives, only may tax us conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutionally, our Adverſaries ſay, we are virtually repreſented in Parliament, and may therefore be regularly taxed by it, yea, even as conſtitutionally as Britiſh Non-Electors themſelves.</p>
            <p>This is the only Source of the alarming Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before us, and if we are virtually repreſented in the Britiſh Senate, like Non-Electors at Home, we may of Courſe be as juſtly taxed by it as they are, which I now freely confeſs, and have clearly proved in the following Pages, would be very up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly indeed; but I think ſome of my ſucceeding Obſervations not only render ſuch idle Pretenſions evidently groundleſs, but even ridiculous to a high Degree, notwithſtanding the profound Knowledge of their prejudiced Supporters. Theſe are my preſent Conceptions, and ſhould my brief Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on that Subject be indiſputably concluſive, and inconteſtably demonſtrate we are not repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament at all, or become a ſolid Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for more copious Reaſonings that do ſo, we cannot poſſibly be taxed in England, under the fainteſt Colour of a conſtitutional Right, which is the grand Point we ſhould invincibly prove, if we are able to do it, and not weakly content ourſelves with the Repeal of the Stamp-Act.</p>
            <p>To favour that great End is the principal Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Pamphlet, and yet, all my Arguments relative to it, take up much leſs Room, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding and following Obſervations of another Kind, which are not quite inſignificant, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may not prove intirely fruitleſs; but Brevity, Importance, and Clearneſs are often connected by the Learned, if the Encomiums of Fame are well grounded, and ſome unlearned Writers may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unite them by an happy Accident at leaſt. However improbably ſuch Things may be, yet they are not utterly impoſſible, and to prevent the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:011073_0005_0F854B0D2F983C10"/>
trouble of fruitleſs Criticiſm, ill-natured Cavilling, and vain-glorious Carping, I confeſs myſelf a Stranger to Scholaſtick Embelliſhments; but muſt alſo take leave to obſerve, that genuine mental Treaſure, never ſhould be contemned, for want of meer ineſſential Ornaments; the moſt curious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Impreſſions, at Coining, can never heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the intrinſick Worth of pure Gold, nor the Want of them impair it; and Bible-Worſhipers ſhould unanimouſly acknowledge, that Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Diſputants themſelves, even the very greateſt of them, have been utter Strangers to them Arts and Sciences now called liberal.</p>
            <p>This Truth muſt be confeſſed by well informed Scripturians; and yet a predicted Antichriſtianiſm is grown ſo rampant, that I know a Chriſt-like Teacher, poſſeſſed of as much human Learning as his Maſter, who is proudly contemned for Want of Scholarſhip, as well as cautiouſly open Chriſtian Reprehenſions, and not only by haughty learned Deiſts, but ſeveral vain glorious Impoſtors alſo, blaſphemouſly called Chriſtian Divines, and formerly honoured accordingly, while ſome of them evidently prefer notorious Courtezans to true Evangeliſts, and while others, not quite ſo audacious, with ſome renowned Laymen, dare impiouſly keep ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Fiends in Countenance, and profanely help them to abandon Shame, becauſe they can drink Wine, wear Velvet, pervert Learning, ſooth the faſhionably ungodly, and excite Laughter, though but very frothily, conſidering their Education and Experience.</p>
            <p>True Advocates for a rigidly holy Goſpel will hardly eſcape Contempt, the Fear of God effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtem evil Diſpoſitions among nominal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor our ſavage Enemies be reclaimed from Cruelty, while ſuch Antichriſtian Apoſtles, ſuch graceleſs Dictators, ſuch traitorous Wretches are
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:011073_0006_0F854B0DECC9D9D0"/>
awfully ſuffered to preſide over the Church, and kindly ſmiled on by Probationers of Underſtanding, Reputation, and Influence. Well may a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Zeal, Reproof, and inflexible Holineſs be ridiculed, and offenſive Truth called abuſive and ſlanderous, while their moſt flagrantly perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enemies are honoured as Chriſtian Teachers, and while our Legiſlatures connive at their horrid Treaſon, or at the evident Ungodlineſs of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon called a Divine; their Profeſſion of Chriſtianity is an Inſult to its ſlighted Author, notwithſtanding they pretend to believe he will finally judge them.</p>
            <p>I hate Bigotry, Superſtition, and ſtupid prieſtly Dogmas, ſanctimoniouſly founded on trying Figures, as well as a holy ſacerdotal Perfidy; but am ſorry a pure practical Fear of our Heart viewing Creator, Judge, and Rewarder, ſhould be abſurdly deemed Folly, and the contrary Wiſdom, by any of our leading and learned Sages, or even their weakeſt Inferiors of common Senſe, for ſuch Concluſions are far beneath the real Dignity of the human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and never can favour the great <hi>Summum Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of moral Agents, by exciting them to a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble voluntary Diſcipline, in the midſt of a trying Patience, and free Probation, according to the Law of a pure rational Faith; and compulſive Diſplays muſt not, cannot wait upon a State Tryal, for there could be no Probation under conſtraining Exhibitions. Such deadly Notions cannot poſſibly proceed from Wiſdom or Virtue, nor ever tend to the Promotion of either, but even quite the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, in a higher or lower Degree, whatever the moſt idolized deiſtical Philoſophers, or their moſt underſtanding Votaries, may loftily ſay, or blindly think to the contrary; and even infatuated Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts are more conſiſtent than Slighters of a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God. A carnal Clergy, and their learned Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, have long exploded each others groſs Errors,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:011073_0007_0F854B0EAB796CD0"/>
and fondly perverted Knowledge in favour of their own, with an equal mixture of Sophiſtry, and Confidence; both Parties have evaded the Rigour of a brave ſelf conquering Warfare, by wreſting try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Figures in a different Manner.</p>
            <p>But, after this flaming unfaſhionable Digreſſion, which anſwers a ſpecial Purpoſe, and ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a general Good, I muſt farther obſerve, that all the Pageantry of human Learning, can never make bad Men good Ones, nor injurious, abſurd, trifling, or unintelligible Productions valuable and praiſe-worthy, nor the Want of it, render the Reverſe juſtly contemptable, even in the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and e're many Years attend upon us, if I am not greatly deceived, the moſt adored Gods of the Earth, notwithſtanding their Philoſophical Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, will be awfully ſurprized at the alarming Dictates of an unlearned, yet obſcure, and even much deſpiſed Pen, after its Fortitude has out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved a rigid Diſcipline, heavy Diſappointments, a pungent Ridicule, and other very grievous Trials.</p>
            <p>Guilded Pills may be rank Poiſon, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guilded ones are conducive to Health; a fair Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may be a baſe Proſtitute, when a virtuous Matron has a contrary Aſpect; and even a Man of great Capacity may be a Fool, when one poſſeſſed of fewer Talents is truly wiſe, through a counter Application of Knowledge. Should I purchaſe immortal Happineſs with my one Talent, I am ſurely wiſer than Men that buy endleſs Sorrows with ten; however, ſuch knowing Fools may vaunt againſt me, and pernicious, or inadequate Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be artfully cloathed with ſhining Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, when divine Truth itſelf is deſtitute of ſuch deluſive Ornaments.</p>
            <p>Men ſhould honour momentuous Inſtruction more than frivolous Niceties; and moſt of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:011073_0008_0F854B0F614F2150"/>
Obſervations, or at leaſt the moſt mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of them ſhould have been corrected by the Printer, when they were firſt hurried very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly out of my Hands, and might all have been ſoon put now into a modiſh Dreſs, by one or other of our learned Rabbins, had not weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations forbid it, which may timely appear to the World; but all the Punctilios of the Schools can never ſecure our Freedom, nor demonſtrate the Parliament has no Right to tax us; and ſhould my Arguments without them effectually do it, or ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble others to evince it inconteſtably, they ſhould not be utterly deſpiſed by learned Americans, even the moſt eminent Profeſſors in our Infant Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, how juſtly ſoever their Superiors at Home may contemn them, in the tranſcendently matured. Univerſities of England.</p>
            <p>I greatly prize the valuable Labours of good learned Writers, and would not offend any of them by theſe extorted Hints, nor meanly degrade hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning becauſe I am deſtitute of it, but would gladly induce my learned Readers to guard againſt Prejudice, they will of Courſe be tempted to imbibe, and to prefer eſſential Worth to ineſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Decorations, how pretty ſoever the latter may appear, leſt my own rough Performances ſhould generally meet but a poor Reception, and perhaps much worſe than they really deſerved. No doubt ſuch inaccurate Obſervations, though ever ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a moral Reſpect, will be treated but coolly at leaſt by vain Criticks, that judge of Arguments as beauiſh Coxcombs do of Perſons, and can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low none to be valuable but what are faſhionable; but however they may fare in the Hands of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cavillers, I think they may be ſooner carped at than fairly refuted, and ſeemingly diſdained than utterly contemned; and could ſuch inartificial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings poſſibly excite Envy, truly, great Men

               <p>Our open Colonies, in a State of Minority, are alarmingly threatned with unnatural Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from a haughty Parent Country, that ſhould treat them affectionately, even with a tender Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Friendſhip; and we complain warmly of her arbitrary Treatment, but to what rational Purpoſe do we inveigh againſt it, while there are ſo few reaſonable Efforts to avert the impending Danger<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>I had ſeen no weighty Arguments on the Subject, when theſe Complaints were utter'd, in 1765, but ſome valuable Conſiderations upon it were then publiſhed, which came to Hand a few Days after, and I fear my Complaints have yet ſome Foundation; for great Emergencies require great Efforts, and no doubt, many able Writers have been much too negligent. I underſtand ſome very good Pens have lately been at Work; but one of the worthy Father's Twelve Letters, and one of the Virginia Monitor's florid Epiſtles, are all I have yet ſeen of their laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Productions, in the midſt of a very ſingular Retirement; and I wiſh they may yet obtain many new Aſſiſtants; for when imminent Danger is ſwiftly approaching, no formidable Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Defence can be ſpeedily finiſhed, without a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Artiſts of different Kinds, and the Materials they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally prepare, will ever be ſcattered about for ſome Time, like the various Materials of other Artificers, before they are properly ranged in the much wanted Fortreſs, according to the Laws of a compleat Martial Architecture.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſuitable Hints may juſtify my patriotick Complaints, and ſhew more Labourers are much wanted to aſſiſt them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Men already employed, for ſufficient Materials muſt be fitly prepared, before the great Work can poſſibly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; and the Materials of grand moral Structures, as well as others, moſtly want ſucceſſive Changes, and ſometimes very great ones, after they are firſt collected from proper Foreſts and Mines; ſo as better Artiſts have been too backward, I have endeavoured to forward the important Work a little, tho' I can but poorly attend on ſuch Labours, and even but rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform them, as they are quite foreign to my proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011073_0011_0F854B11A4601A70"/>
Free Complaints, and bold Proteſtations, will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflame wilful Oppreſſors; and ſhould our Rights only be invaded, through a plauſible Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, ſound Reaſoning and Evidence alone can remove it; nor may any Thing elſe juſtify ſpirited Declamations againſt our Superiors, however they may be palliated through ſurpriſing Provocations. Let us not meerly cringe, nor raſhly offend, but unite Courage with Circumſpection, and ſupport free Complaints by proper Remonſtrances.</p>
               <p>My ſucceeding Freedom, without an argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Authority, would render me juſtly obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to cenſure, but I hope to juſtify it by ſound geometrical Reaſoning, before I have done, and dare therefore introductively ſay, without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelude, hath a victorious England, with our Aſſiſtance, exempted us from the Incurſions of our French Neighbours, and partly intimidated our
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011073_0012_0F854B12646F58C8"/>
Indian Enemies, that ſhe may tyrannically enſlave us herſelf? Should that be our deplorable Lot, would not their accidental Inroads, be leſs griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than her perpetual Chains? And how intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is lordly Oppreſſion, from a hard hearted Parent, that ſhould be our moſt endearing Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and Protector! How ſhocking are the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Beginnings alluded to; and ſhould Principals which gave them Exiſtence prove long liv'd and fruitful, what a horrid Brood of fatal Conſequences muſt ſucceſſively attend us, while we labour under the heavy and galling Yoak! Should our potent Mother greatly amaſs ſuch mental Treaſure, judge, my inattentive Brethren, yea, judge timely and ripely, what a fine Patrimony will deſcend to her American Children.</p>
               <p>Let us even grant our late War was partly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and very gallantly maintained for our Intereſt, as well as the Advantage of Great-Britain, and that we ſhould conſequently defray a ſmall Part of the Expence, proportioned to our ſtraight Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, if it is not fully done already, or help to ſupport a ſufficient Number of ſtanding Forces, which in peaceable Times will be but a few; and would our Circumſtances even admit of it, we never ſhould maintain many to oppreſs us. Let us ever deſerve Fidelity and Affection, and not be enſlaved under a Pretence of being guarded. We may be driven to Diſtraction, then called Rebels, and treated accordingly; but Oppreſſion only will cauſe a general Diſloyalty, whatever invidious Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, diſappointed Ambition and Avarice, may ſometimes raiſe againſt juſt Monarchs; and when affectionate Subjects are rendered uneaſy, by inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Treatmen, they ſhould not be loaded with cauſeleſs Expences, as dangerous Malecontents, through the immoral Jealouſy and Perverſeneſs of their Oppreſſors, who naturally ſuſpect Averſion they conſciouſly deſerve.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:011073_0013_0F854B135C3515A8"/>
Let us be treated fairly, and behave dutifully, for we have ſome Property ſcattered about in this extenſive Wilderneſs, and ſhould, doubtleſs, be at a reaſonable Expence, according to our ſmall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Occaſions; but let our Enemies alſo confeſs it ſhould be a voluntary one, and that we ſhould be uprightly permitted, as free Britiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to grant or withhold our Money diſcretional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without having it violently extorted from us. Let us be active, voluntary, and prudent Loyaliſts, and not paſſive Vaſſals in arbitrary Chains.</p>
               <p>But while we complain warmly of over-bearing Treatmen, let us wiſely conſider where it came from, and that it chiefly proceeded from our aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fellow Subjects; for we muſt know the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Authors of it, before our Remonſtrances can be properly directed: The Prince only paſſed the Law we complain of, after the Commons of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, as our pretended Repreſentatives, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly prepared it for his Aſſent; and the beſt and greateſt of Monarchs, as frail Men, may often be deceived by pernicious Schemes, which plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly advance their Revenues, or any other favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Purpoſe, and more eſpecially young Princes, e'er mature Knowledge befriend them, which due Experience only may give. When pleaſing Offers have a fair Complexion, they are too frequently embraced without a proper Examination, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Affairs are often but ſlightly viewed at very magnificent Courts; for they occur too often to occaſion Surpriſe, or even a deep Attention, amidſt all the Interruptions attending Auguſt Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, unleſs ſome very alarming Circumſtances wait upon them.</p>
               <p>We may thus clearly ſee how virtuous young Princes, who tenderly love their People, may ſoon follow plauſible gratifying Deſigns, into very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Errors, when even moſt of the greateſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011073_0014_0F854B13E35FEC68"/>
Politicians in the Nation, artfully combine to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them about remote Colonies, in a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Empire. A Prince muſt ſurely be very tall indeed who can view his far diſtant Subjects clearly, when a great Number of very tall Men, and his own lofty Deſires alſo, ſtand crouded before him, and ſtrive to intercept his Sight.</p>
               <p>In the Caſe before us, as the publick Debt is very heavy, the Neceſſity of raiſing Money is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently apparent; and a young Prince, under ſuch Circumſtances, equally deſirous of increaſing the Revenue, and mitigating the Burthens and Clamours of his ſurrounding Subjects, might paſs the Stamp-Act from equitable Motives, worthy of a good Monarch, without maturely conſidering the more diſtant Conſequences of it, when he was even much excited to give it Authority by the Publick, as well as private Council of England, and had no weighty Repreſentation againſt it. Let us but conſider the prevailing Clamours of the Nation, the general Bent of the Parliament, the King's ſtrong Motives to concur with it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Money-Bills, and what Party ſurrounded the Throne, when the Stamp-Tax was impoſed, and then our Surpriſe at the royal Aſſent, muſt intirely vaniſh.</p>
               <p>Britiſh Princes muſt needs be very unwilling to diſſent to Money-Bills, or any other Favourite Projection of the Money-granting Commons; and all Kings are naturally fond of Power, and raiſing the Revenue; and though the Stamp-Act greatly wounded the Power of the Crown, and even ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Grants of our Sovereigns contemptable, ſo far as it annulled the Force of our Charters, and made us fear more arbitrary Proceedings, yet, it gave the Prince a new Power over us, which might ſeem more advantageous at that deluſive Juncture; and no Wonder therefore, it obtained his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011073_0015_0F854B14AA0C9278"/>
without a very ſcrupulous Examination, when it was even generally applauded as a moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and equitable Impoſition; but it is meerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing wiſe Fellow Subjects, exceedingly tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of their own Freedom, could fondly and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobly throw ours away, repugnant to the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Bias of free Britons. The King only gave Power to a Bill preſented by our nominal Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by political Sages of Experience and Renown, that pretend to be the faithful Defenders of our ſacred <hi>Magna Charta</hi> Compact, and every other conſtitutional Privilege; ſo let us blame the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Betrayers of our Rights, and dutifully ſtem groundleſs Murmurs againſt the Crown, which had plauſibly darkning Motives for its Aſſent.</p>
               <p>The ſeeming Virtues of regal Tyrants, are juſtly deteſted by good Men, that ſee the baſe Motives they flow from; and of Courſe, the greateſt Errors of virtuous Princes, ſhould always be viewed in a favourable Light, as they never proceed from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable Intentions, but are always the Effect of plauſible Appearances; and the moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Monarchs, will ever be more liable to faultleſs Miſtakes, in the great Multiplicity of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Occurrences and Contingencies, than private Men of much leſs Judgment can poſſibly be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs wiſe and faithful Counſellors prevent it; and even a ſufficient Number of them, ſhould but one Favourite convey their occaſional Aſſiſtance to the royal Mind. Several wiſe miniſterial Intelligenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, muſt aſſiſt every prime Miniſter, that ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately ſerves his Maſter and the Community; for the wiſeſt of Subjects is but a frail Creature, and the moſt auguſt Throne, refulgent Crown, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Dominion upon Earth, never can make their frail Poſſeſſor infallible, but may probably render him more liable to inculpable Error than he could poſſibly have been in a much lower Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011073_0016_0F854B15676A2A08"/>
and therefore, candid Allowances ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be made on ſuch Occaſions.</p>
               <p>But offended Carpers may contend I have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Sovereign too freely, by preſuming to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate his Conduct; ſo, let me ſay, the loyal Part I have acted, however it may be taken, is more du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful than ſeditious Complaints, which inflame his Majeſty's Subjects againſt him, or the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Projection occaſioned them. As offenſive Laws are executed in the King's Name, the Affection of his murmuring People, on ſuch Occaſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proper Means of Prevention, is much ſooner alienated from him than other Branches of the Legiſlature, which may be principally or ſolely to blame; and when ſuch Prejudices are like to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, diſcerning Loyaliſts ſhould bring their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Cauſes into a moral Light, and thus direct Complaints into a proper Channel, which would otherwiſe rage againſt the Innocent, and perhaps ſeldom more perniciouſly than at preſent.</p>
               <p>I may be falſely cenſured from various Motives by licentious Contemners of Government, and its arbitrary nominal Friends alſo; but the Intention of my preceding Hints about Monarchs general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and our own Sovereign particularly, is to remove and prevent the Prejudice of Subjects, at a very critical Time, and not to palliate any real Fault in Princes; for of Courſe they ſhould always be the beſt of Men, and thus be truly great indeed, but never ought to be condemned for blameleſs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, which will often be their Lot, if not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally prevented. The Bulk of Mankind are much greater Politicians about the galling Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bad Laws than their artfully veiled Cauſes, and will often blame a faultleſs Prince for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, through his Miniſtry or otherwiſe, more than a criminal Parliament for the latter, unleſs they obtain much better Directions, than their own fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011073_0017_0F854B1624CCF988"/>
Judgment is able to give. Theſe Obſervations will hardly be diſputed by underſtanding Readers of Candour; and let me now turn my Views from the aſſenting Part of the Britiſh Legiſlature to that aſſuming Branch which prepares Money-Bills.</p>
               <p>The morally thinking Part of us muſt ſay, we ought to be taxed, according to our Circumſtances and Occaſions, but not to defend extenſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts we have no Advantage from, and which may perhaps injure our Trade at length, by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to glut all our Markets abroad. We ſhould doubtleſs be liable to expedient Impoſitions; but when and by whom they ſhould be laid upon us, and what they ſhould occaſionally be, both in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Degree, are the grand Matters in Debate; and if aſſuming Britiſh Commons have a Right to tax us at all, they have equally a Right to do it at Pleaſure, and even in what Manner they pleaſe continually, which would reduce us to Vaſſalage beyond Diſpute, for we could lay them under no conſtitutional Obligation, as we ſhould have no Power to continue or change them, however they behaved, and could have no Advantage Engliſh Non-Electors conſtitutionally enjoy, as I hope to ſhew clearly by and by.</p>
               <p>No abſolute Monarch is more independent of his People, than Britiſh Commons are of our Favours and Frowns; and ſhould it even be our wretched Lot to be taxed by them, what good Treatment can we expect from lofty Oppreſſors, after all our free and provoking Complaints, who treated our Petitions with the utmoſt Diſdain, before we had incured their formidable Diſpleaſure, for only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repugnant to their Money-raiſing Will! While powerful Encroachers haughtily reject humble Prayer, they will hardly honour cutting Freedom, which cannot poſſibly intimidate them; and ſhould our little Fortunes lye at the Mercy of ſuch lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Gentlemen, how might the Britiſh Patriots eaſe that Nation, even to the utmoſt Extent of our narrow Circumſtances, by loading her American Children with arbitrary Taxations, under plauſible falſe Pretenſions of Juſtice, Expediency, Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the great Danger of our growing Opulence and Independency? Slavery might thrive very faſt through ſuch Nouriſhment, and invidious Charges of Rebellion for extorted Invectives:</p>
               <p>Oppreſſors always ſeek Pleas of Juſtification; for Oppreſſion hates to appear in a true Light, and, like other ugly Vices, ever ſtrives to hide its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity under ſpecious Veils of one Kind or other; but ſhould we be lorded over by arrogating Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to us, our Ability, and various Concernments, under the moſt plauſible Pretenſions that can be invented, yet their moſt colourable Arts, never can perſuade impartial Men of Underſtanding, we are virtually repreſented by them, till they can ſhew Perſons and Matters unknown, or but very imperfectly known at beſt, may be properly and effectually repreſented. They may have profound Knowledge, but are not quite omniſcient; and ſhould even the beſt Limner on Earth, only view me at a great Diſtance, and conſequently but very imperfectly, he could ſurely pourtray me but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indeed, and yet might repreſent me as truly by a Picture, as Engliſh Commons can repreſent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans in Parliament at preſent; and I hope timely to ſhew the Words, virtually and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are not merely inſignificant Sounds, and that faithful Repreſentatives never can enſlave the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they act for.</p>
               <p>We came here to improve a loneſome Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Power to make wholeſome Laws for the gradual Advancement of our Intereſt; and what may all our Charters, provincial Aſſemblies, and legiſlative Regulations avail us, if England ſhould
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011073_0019_0F854B19574415D0"/>
tax us at Pleaſure! We may, it ſeems, enact pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Laws ſucceſſively, and even get Money by them as faſt as we can, that ſhe may call for it when ſhe pleaſes, but muſt not have the Honour of granting it to our Sovereigns for neceſſary Uſes, nor the Privilege of Retention, when ſhe calls for it ever ſo inexpediently, ever ſo unjuſtly; are theſe conſtitutional Proceedings? Are they conſiſtent with Britiſh Liberty or ſound Morals? If Freedom be not much worſe than an empty Name, can it even poſſibly attend upon us, while our Intereſt is torn out of our Hands repugnant to our Will; and may not powerful legiſlative Uſurpers, under ſome Pretence or other, as colourably and juſtly deprive us of every other conſtitutional Privilege? If this be Freedom, let me have Bondage, for I prudently chuſe the reverſe.</p>
               <p>Should even a lawleſs Diſtraction be the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch male Treatment, ought we to be cenſured for it, or they, which made us run mad? Which Party threw the Empire into Confuſion, and ſhould be ſtigmatized accordingly, as criminal Incendiaries! Let virtuous Engliſh Freemen look upon us with Compaſſion, and even bluſh at the late awful Miſtakes, or more ſhocking Deſigns of their auguſt and renowned Legiſlature; and as we may get all the Money we can by our own Laws, let us be permitted to give it prudently away by them likewiſe. This is not only a requiſite Privilege, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on true Morality, but even one inſeperably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the Law of Britiſh Taxations; and how hardy therefore muſt Engliſh Senators be, that would cruelly rob us of it, when their arbitrary Dreams are exchanged for true Ideas! Should the King tax us, they would ſoon be alarmed, and yet he might ſurely force our Money from us, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally as the Parliament, and as juſtly as the Commons of England can grant it; for our own
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011073_0020_0F854B1A10EA3728"/>
Delegates only may tax us as Britiſh Subjects; and ſuch Strangers to us and our Circumſtances are not blindly choſen to repreſent us; and if they dare outrun a conſtitutional Juſtice, they will hardly guard our Weal from natural Motives, as their private Intereſt has no Connection with ours. Theſe Conſiderations alone may ſufficiently damn their injurious Pretenſions, even with a true Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Authority; and yet we have others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their pretended virtual Repreſentation, which, as they ſap the Foundation of their Claim, may ſtill ſeem more cogent and powerful.</p>
               <p>Were but Engliſh Politicians diveſted of Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, they might find much better Employ than plotting againſt our Liberty, for great Regulations are wanting in this Part of the Britiſh Empire, both concerning the Demands of the Crown upon it, and apportioning our Grants to the various Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Colonies; for we ſhould judge of the Expediency or Unreaſonableneſs of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with a Parliamentary Order, and conſtitutional Freedom, and divide the latter regularly among us, which cannot be done in our preſent diſunited Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I think it is very demonſtrable, that all our Grants to the Crown ſhould be general, for were Supplies ever ſo neceſſary, and we ever ſo able to grant them, I fear the King would not timely obtain an adequate Aſſiſtance in our preſent looſe Situation; and ſhould all the Requiſitions of a Britiſh Miniſtry, by highly expedient, which is no very probable Suppoſition, yet the reſpective Quotas of many young Provinces, under various Advantages and Degrees of Improvement, could not be ſo exactly pointed out at Home, as here; nor ſhould unjuſt Demands ever be granted, though ever ſo fitly proportioned to our Circumſtances, yet ſome Colonies no doubt would comply with them, under the irregular Plan of ſpecial Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011073_0021_0F854B1AA09C7708"/>
and others reject the moſt reaſonable Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, ſo keep Things in perpetual Diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and conſequently in England alſo.</p>
               <p>A great Number of unconnected Colonies, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly inclined from the Influence of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Views and Apprehenſions, will hardly come under regular Taxations for a publick Good, while each may conſtitutionally reject any Part, or even the Whole of every Claim from the Crown; but were they politically united for the Purpoſe before us, all their private Views might be juſtly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled for a publick Utility, and our Sovereigns requiſite Demands be ſpeedily honoured without either unreaſonable Burthens or Exemptions. Thus a general Aid would alſo kindly attend on every ſpecial Emergency, and perhaps occaſionally prevent inſupportable Exigencies, which might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe diſtreſs particular Provinces alternately, while we are liable to the barbarous Incurſions of bloody Savages; and ſurely no ſtrait and ſhort-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed provincial Patriotiſm, but the more generous Direction of a publick Spirit only, can poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a Marylander to write in this Strain. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Utility no doubt ſhould be favoured, when it ſtands not in Competition with an imperial Good; but when a publick and private Intereſt happen to be temporary Rivals, the former ſhould ever be wiſely preferred, and even for the laſting Security and Promotion of the latter.</p>
               <p>For theſe weighty and obvious Reaſons, let us have an American Parliament, as well as provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Aſſemblies, and be gently tied together, with the pleaſant Chords of a Sovereign Policy, inſtead of the galling Chains of a threatned Slavery. Let us throw our Mites dutifully into the imperial Treaſury, but let us do it on a moral Plan, as ſoon as poſſible, and as loyal Engliſh Subjects, without a groundleſs and immoral Compulſion. Let us do
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011073_0022_0F854B1CED387E08"/>
it by proper Delegates of our own chooſing, that know when and how to tax us better than Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and whoſe Intereſts are cloſely connected with our own. Such Men will hardly load us and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with unneceſſary Burthens, nor loſe or endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Whole for Want of granting a requiſite Part; ſo let them firſt help us to get Money, and then grant it expediently for a general as well as provincial Benefit, as ſoon at leaſt as a proper Scheme is wiſely concerted, by our national and provincial Politicians, and firmly eſtabliſhed by a wholeſome legiſlative Authority; for we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be virulently but not virtually repreſented by ſoaring Strangers.</p>
               <p>Let our general Welfare be favoured at a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Expence, occaſionally levied by Virtue of our own Delegation, for we may be ingloriouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by powerful Legiſlators at Home: But I muſt now draw a virtual Repreſentation out of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, where it has hitherto lurked in Ambuſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and thus utterly annihilate their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Right to tax us, by ſhewing clearly it has no real Foundation, and that we are not repreſented in Parliament at all. This no doubt is the main Point in Queſtion, notwithſtanding I have but ſlowly approached to it; and though I abſolutely deny we can be conſtitutionally taxed at Home, yet I freely grant Britiſh Subjects may be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally taxed by virtual Repreſentatives, and that a great Number are virtually repreſented in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Senate; for the Commons of that Nation, cannot faithfully ſerve their Conſtituents as legal Delegates, without favouring Non-Electors as vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Repreſentatives, and muſt ſtill promote the Intereſt of thoſe which have no Vote, by ſerving them well that gave them a Seat in the Houſe, becauſe the Intereſt of both Parties, throughout the Kingdom, are very <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

inſeperably connected. Thus Engliſh Non-Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are and ever muſt be virtually repreſented and favoured, while Electors themſelves are faithfully ſerved; and it might even be ſaid with great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, that we were virtually repreſented in the Britiſh Legiſlature, if all our different Intereſts were ſimilar to thoſe of Engliſh Electors, and ſo cloſely interwoven with them, that the Houſe of of Commons could not properly favour the latter, without duly promoting the former; but as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are repugnantly circumſtanced, it is ſo abſurd to pretend we are virtually repreſented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that even a School-Boy, acquainted with ſuch Words, ſhould be duly corrected for perverting them ſo baſely.</p>
               <p>Where Voters and Non-Voters have the ſame Dependence and Intereſt, there cannot be a Legal without a virtual Repreſentation; and had our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies a ſufficient Number of faithful Delegates in the Britiſh Senate, well acquainted with all their Concerns, a Part of each provincial Society would be virtually repreſented by them; but I muſt be dreaming or delirious, if it be not even ridiculous to ſay we are now virtually repreſented at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> by aſſuming Strangers to us and our fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating Affairs, unleſs a Parliamentary Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Words <hi>Virtually,</hi> and <hi>Repreſented,</hi> be quite foreign to the common Acceptation of them.</p>
               <p>Britiſh Non-Electors may be as juſtly taxed at Home, as our Non-Voters are here; for the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Commons of England, are not only collected from every County, and every City, but even from more inferior Boroughs alſo than there are very conſiderable Towns in the Kingdom, though ſome large Towns want Borough Privileges, and have therefore properly before them, all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Kinds of Manufactories, Modes of Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Branches of Trade, a national Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011073_0024_0F854B1E8566DFA0"/>
flows from, and by effectually cleanſing them Sources of their Wealth, that they may flow free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they evidently advance the Intereſt of the whole Community, as well as that Part of it which impowered them to do ſo. By duly purging and promoting all the Springs of a national Welfare; they inconteſtably favour every one that drinks at them, as well as their Conſtituents, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenly tax Britiſh Non-Electors, thus befriended, with a pure conſtitutional and moral Authority; for of Courſe Men ſo favoured ſhould be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently taxed, towards the Advancement and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a publick Good which promotes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures their own private Benefits.</p>
               <p>It would even be as abſurd to ſay ſuch People ſhould not be taxed by the Parliament, as it is to contend we ought to be taxed by it, and a greater Abſurdity than the latter can hardly appear; for they indeed are virtually repreſented by Engliſh Commons, according to the true Signification of ſuch Words, and ſo Men are virtually repreſented and taxed here as well as in Great-Britain; but we never can be repreſented in that Manner by Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which neither promote, regard, nor even know our manifold Intereſts. Can we poſſibly be virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repreſented by ſuch arrogating Foreigners; or ſhould they levy our Money without a conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Authority, and even quite repugnant to their own fundamental taxing Maxim, which ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver teach themſelves as well as others, that Britiſh Subjects only can be conſtitutionly taxed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Repreſentatives? How inconſiſtent are ſuch lawleſs Stretches with true Britiſh Liberty, the real moral Dignity of juſt Engliſh Law-givers, and that ſolid Baſis of equitable Taxations they ſolely build their own taxing Right upon! Should the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thus violate one of the greateſt Laws of our ineſtimable Conſtitution, and injured Colonies ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011073_0025_0F854B1F242CD570"/>
for juſtly reſenting it, or incenſed Mobs be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed for illegal Commotions? I am ſorry this Kind of plain Dealing was extorted, by Proceedings highly derogatory to our imperial Senate.</p>
               <p>The Lords of Parliament have an immenſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Nation; and yet as they hold their Seats from the Crown, while the Commons are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the People, they are excluded from point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Ways and Means of raiſing Money. This well known Fact will hardly be diſputed; and the immemorial Claim of the Money-granting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons is intirely founded on this laudable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as their numerous Conſtituents bear the principal Burthen, they ſhould be permitted to grant or withhold their own Money occaſionally, as their Delegates may deem to be moſt expedient, when Matters are maturely debated among them. From theſe weighty Conſiderations, the Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granting Repreſentatives of the People admit of no Direction from the higher Branches of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature. They are choſen and relied on by the Freemen of England; ſo juſtly contend they ought to promote and guard their reaſonable Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and therefore claim the ſole Right of forming Money Bills; but as this ſound Reaſoning holds good for their taxing the Inhabitants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it abſolutely forbids their giving away our Money, who neither chooſe, know, nor have any Reaſon to truſt a Majority of them; and clearly ſhews we ſhould be taxed by Perſons of our own chooſing, whom we confide in for that great Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, among other occaſional Requiſites of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
               <p>I call Taxation a great Purpoſe, which indeed it ſurely is in many Reſpects, and even a Privilege of vaſt Importance, a free People muſt ever poſſeſs; for no Community can poſſibly be free without it; and ſhould our Colonies be cruelly deprived of it,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011073_0026_0F854B1FF1C1F9E0"/>
Vaſſalage of Courſe muſt be their Portion. While Subjects command their own Purſes abſolutely, a Miſapplication of granted Money, and all other grievous Proceedings, may be generally prevented in a peaceable Mannner, and moſtly ſuppreſſed without Violence, when they accidently offend any Community; but take that Shield away from the governed, and governing Oppreſſion and Tyranny may thrive gradually, in every growing Seaſon, and even rage uncontroulably at length, till they are awfully drowned in a Deluge of Blood.</p>
               <p>While the Rights of the Crown and Subject are equally guarded and ſecure, agreeable to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Conſtitution, expedient Grants and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Money may keep good Princes and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Subjects very naturally under mutual Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, greatly conducive to a publick Utility, and the former, as ſucceſſive Parents of the Whole Community, may probably apply its Money more regularly than the latter, and be much leſs influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by private Views than their partial Children; but when the People want Power to withhold their Intereſt from the Crown, they have no political Shield to ſcreen them from the Darts of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and how well ſoever juſt Monarchs may treat them, yet only a violent and bloody Hoſtility, or intimidating Fears of it, may ſtem the impious Carreer of imperious Oppreſſors, at the Head of a national Army.</p>
               <p>Should our Freedom be violently rended from us, let us brook a helpleſs Bondage with Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Prudence; but let us ſtruggle bravely for its Preſervation; and not madly ſurrender it up to King <hi>George</hi> himſelf, though perhaps one of the beſt of Monarchs, for he cannot poſſible intail all his legal Virtues on every Succeſſor, nor even the leaſt he poſſeſſes upon any one of them. Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Admonition, and Example cannot abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011073_0027_0F854B20A3FEB0F0"/>
govern free Agents; and Hanoverian Princes, by Nature, have licentious Paſſions in common with other frail Men, which ſome of them may controul very gallantly, and others gratify as inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, whatever Adulation may ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Theſe are undeniable Concluſions; ſo let us ſtrive heroickly to ſave our ineſtimable Privileges, and dutifully honour a Britiſh Prerogative. Let a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional Relation between Prince and Subjects, their Reſpective Rights, and mutual Obligations be ever inviolably preſerved; for Princes may as reaſonably expect Favour from us, as we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from them, and never ſhould be Slaves to our Avarice, Ambition or Caprice, while we are befriended by their Adminiſtration. Let us render to Ceſar all that ſhould be Ceſar's, and be ruled by him with a noble Sovereign Fidelity. Let us grant Money expediently, according to our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Occaſions, and the Crown advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly apply it.</p>
               <p>But e'er I take my Leave of this great Topick, I muſt yet detect a Subterfuge relative to it; for our alarmingly overborne Colonies, according to our Enemies Pretenſion, are as much repreſented in the Britiſh Legiſlature, and may be as juſtly tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, as Engliſh Bodies corporate without legal Delegates. Thus our lordly Antagoniſts argue; and this fine Time ſerving Pretence is intirely founded on Falſhood, however plauſible it may ſeem to weak or prejudiced Minds; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome Engliſh Bodies corporate, which are far from being inconſiderable, have no Power to ſend Delegates to Parliament, yet all the ſpecial Intereſts of ſuch little common Wealths, which are but particular Sources of a national Utility, are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Commons of that Kingdom; and though ſuch private Communities are not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011073_0028_0F854B216435F948"/>
as incorporated Bodies, they are all directly repreſented by the Knights of Shires, and ſome of them alſo, by the Delegates of Cities or Boroughs they vote for, and may likewiſe promote the Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Favourites greatly, and even have ſome of their own Members elected, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Counties, adjacent, or diſtant Boroughs. Theſe inconteſtable Truths ſhew a wide Difference between ſuch Bodies Corporate and our Colonies; and without ſuch great Privileges, the former might even have a great Intereſt in Parliament, from an intimate Correſpondence, and perhaps a more beneficial Connection with many of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which far diſtant Americans could not procure.</p>
               <p>Could ſuch political Bodies not vote for either City or Borough Repreſentatives, nor have any of their own Members elected; and could no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious Attachments flow from their Vicinity; yet, as all their Voters may chooſe County Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, they are even thus as fully repreſented, as a great Part of the Britiſh Freeholders, inſtead of being in our Condition, and in every much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Election, but very few more than half the Voters themſelves may be repreſented by Perſons of their own chooſing; and as a Majority of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Non-Electors may probably be of the ſame Opinion, from the great Intermixture of themſelves and Affairs, even the latter, as well as the former, may frequently be repreſented by Men they approve.</p>
               <p>I think theſe are reſpectably Concluſions about this important and much wreſted Subject; and when Voters are even divided into the moſt ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Parties, they may ſtill have their joint Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt principally in View, and only differ in Opinion about the propereſt Advocates for it; and ſhould Prejudice even blind each Party, or either of them,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011073_0029_0F854B2231712290"/>
and cauſe their principal Intentions to be ever ſo oppoſite, yet, as I have clearly evinced, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons cannot ſerve their Conſtituents faithfully without favouring their warmeſt Opponents in a ſimilar Manner, from the great Affinity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of their Intereſts. Thus the various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts at Home are regularly promoted, by Men intimately acquainted with them all, and as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sources of a national Emolument; but were the ſame Gentlemen ever ſo much diſpoſed to favour us, they could not poſſibly repreſent or befriend us effectually, for Want of proper Ideas of our chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Affairs, and can therefore never tax us with a conſtitutional Equity, either as Britiſh Non-Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or any Kind of incorporated Bodies at Home. Were they even unanimouſly our ſincere Friends, which ſurely they are not at preſent, we could not be virtually repreſented by ſuch Strangers; nor may any Perſon contend for ſuch a Repreſentation, or the fictitious Right founded upon it, without a very weak Head, or a very bad Heart, and a palpable Abſurdity.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs appear now to be very demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at leaſt, and I think to be already briefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, that we neither are virtually repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament, nor can poſſibly be ſo repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at preſent; and that we may even tax England as juſtly as ſhe can tax us, but not enforce arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impoſitions with an equal Power. Could that Idol, called Britiſh Freedom, even poſſibly exiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, while our Intereſt is diſpoſed of by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, without our Conſent, and repugnant to our Will, or while we are reſtrained from manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing provincial Commodities, for our own Uſe at leaſt, it would hardly be worth adoring and boaſting of, according to the immemorial Cuſtom of Engliſhmen. Without oppreſſive Taxations, the Scourges of Prohibition may drive us into
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011073_0030_0F854B22E1338AD0"/>
Bondage, into abſolute Bondage; but I muſt leave the latter to other Writers, and cloſe my preſent Arguments againſt the former by only juſt obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther, that we ſhould be viewed as genuine Branches of the Britiſh Family, and that the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People of Ireland, a conquered Country, might be much better repreſented by Engliſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, and more equitably taxed by them, than far diſtant Americans can poſſibly be, unleſs the awfully different Sounds of <hi>Iriſh Parliament,</hi> and <hi>American Aſſemblies</hi> intirely change the Nature of ſuch Things; and yet I preſume they will hardly tax that contigious Kingdom, however over-borne Coloniſts, already a much more numerous People, may be tyrannically forced to groan under arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Burthens.</p>
               <p>I have now drawn this much perverted Subject out of Darkneſs, and I think our moſt ſanguine Adverſaries, after reading my Obſervations upon it, can no more preſume to ſay, we are virtually repreſented in England, and may be juſtly taxed by her. Their virtual Repreſentation is now damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an argumentative Authority, much too powerful for all the Sanctions of Sophiſtry, which no doubt was our greateſt one Thing needful from the Beginning; for all their Batteries againſt our Freedom, are erected upon it, and our moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Denials could never refute their confident Aſſertions, nor ſhew the wide Difference between us and Britiſh Non-Electors, or Engliſh Bodies corporate, without ſpecial Repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>When their pretended virtual Repreſentation, and the nominal Right leaning upon it, are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly annihilated by invincible Arguments, a naked Injuſtice only may enſlave us, which the worſt of our imperial Senators will hardly avow; and yet many of them may be as deaf to Remonſtrances againſt a Parliamentary Deſpotiſm, while they have
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011073_0031_0F854B23B9892810"/>
any Colour of Right to favour it, as over-reaching Bargainers are to moral Reaſonings, that would perſuade them to annul their Kind of fair Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and to forego Advantages they may legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retain. While Innovators have an ideal Right, and colourable Intention, they always encroach as upright Men; and pungent Arguments may drive them gradually to Tyranny, under the Name of abuſive Invectives, inſtead of exciting them to grant Redreſs. Warm moral Complaints againſt legal Pretenſions, or injurious Proceedings found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, may ſoon raiſe national Storms of a fatal Conſequence. Very lofty ſuperſtructures without a good Foundation are more likely to cruſh than favour their Inhabitants, eſpecially in tempeſtuous Seaſons; and I think the preſent A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our imperial Planets, does not portend very temporate Weather.</p>
               <p>While Parliamentary Encroachments are neatly dreſſed, with the Shadows of Right, and a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Purpoſe, they will ever be called juſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient Exertions of Power; and Truth very warmly uttered againſt them, will not only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded as ſeditious Calumny, but uſurping legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Bigots will even think often it is ſo, while they ſeem to have any conſtitutional Authority; and that Pretext muſt be entirely taken from them e'er free Remonſtrances effectually prevail, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſucceſsful ſoothing Petitions may now and then prove. Had we not many imperious Grenvils to ſtruggle with, one or a few of them could not hurt us; and ſuch lordly Gentlemen, may kindly vouchſafe to grant humble Petitions, properly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to their ſuppoſed Excellency, but never can brook cutting Remonſtrances againſt their moſt injurious Tranſactions, while the leaſt Shew of Right waits upon them; ſo we ſhould entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of ſuch Pleas, or ſeem to give up our
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011073_0032_0F854B246D457658"/>
Rights, and cringingly implore Favour, inſtead of boldly demanding Juſtice by irritating Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances and provoking moral Complaints. While ſuch Arrogators can maintain a pretended Right, they will nobly reſent abuſive Truth, and be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry highly incenſed at moral Slander. I am well acquainted with ſuch nobly inglorious Tempers, and have purchaſed my Ideas of them, at a very conſiderable Expence.</p>
               <p>No doubt many Engliſh Senators have another Kind of Greatneſs, and gallantly ſuppreſs Excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to an ignoble Loftineſs of Mind; but we know not how many of them are well diſpoſed, as moſt of them are utter Strangers, nor can we tell who may ſucceed them; ſo if I have not already ſhewn, inconteſtably ſhewn, we are not repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Parliament at all, I hope others will improve my Arguments on that Subject, or advance better on a new Foundation, if that may be done, and demonſtrate it even ſo conſpicuouſly, that none may preſume to diſpute it. I think it is rendered indiſputable already; and ſhould I greatly over va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue my own Arguments, according to the Cuſtom of petty Scribblers, yet ſurely it is capable of ſuch a Demonſtration, and our threatned Welfare loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls for it.</p>
               <p>Should the People of France, or any abſolute Monarchy, argue ever ſo juſtly and wiſely in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Freedom, I ſuppoſe their ſtrongeſt moral Reaſonings would hardly procure the wanted Bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but might probably draw new Evils upon them, if perſeveringly and ardently advanced, much ſooner than weaker and leſs pungent Arguments; and perhaps no abſolute Monarch is fonder of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Prerogative, than many Britiſh Commons now are; and others may be hereafter of an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Money-raiſing Power; ſo of Courſe we muſt clearly ſhew their taxing Power is bounded,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011073_0033_0F854B25348CE950"/>
and that it does not extend to the Colonies, before our endangered Freedom can ever be ſecure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their Deſigns may be repreſſed a while. Encroachments proceed ſlowly, while Shame or Fear can ſtem them, but may gradually advance till their potent and enraged Authors, are rendered almoſt inſuſceptible of either; and there muſt be a very great Change of Times indeed, e're moral Reaſonings drive Men from an idolized conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Right, or any darling Claim that is deemed to be one; nor will parliamentary Enthuſiaſts, wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to idle Notions, add here leſs fondly to a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ideal Right, than to one the moſt firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, until they are properly undeceived by forcible Exhibitions; and e're wilfully falſe Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Right are openly detected, their immoral Authors will hardly recede from them, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently juſtifies my preſent Concluſions, let our Grievances proceed from Miſtake or Deſign.</p>
               <p>Moral Arguments, indeed, ſhould always be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by moral Agents that have Power to weigh them, but very rarely ſucceed when oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an ideal or pretended Right; and arrogating Encroachers will not only call Abſurdity Reaſon, but, through an artificial Blindneſs, often deem it to be ſo while it can be prettily cloathed with a plauſibly gratifying Sophiſtry; ſo their aſſumed Right muſt be utterly effaced before our Freedom can poſſibly attend us in Safety, as Subjects to the Crown of Great-Britain; and the Support of one imperial Government is enough for England and her Colonies. A notional Right is a dangerous Weapon in the Hand of Oppreſſive Power; and arbitrary Impoſitions upon us, while they have ſuch a Foundation to befriend them, muſt be glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly injurious e're Strangers to our Circumſtances, highly prejudiced in their Favour, and much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by our galling Complaints againſt them,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011073_0034_0F854B25EFEFE190"/>
will even think them unjuſt or unreaſonable, ſo long as they are colourably applied; and ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs abate our preſent Alarms, yet our Danger muſt exiſt perpetually, while the Parliament can ſupport its aſſuming Right of taxing us. Abated Flames may ſoon revive through accidental Blaſts when much Fuel is near them, and even rage more fiercely than ever; ſo let our invaded Rights be explicitly aſcertained before we have done, for they ſhould now be abſolutely fixed, as parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Infringements may ſhew us.</p>
               <p>We labour already under more Grievances than the Stamp-Tax, which are far from being inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and it is Time to know our Condition certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we ſhould not always wander in Darkneſs about a Matter of ſuch vaſt Importance, but have proper Limits fixed between us and the Britiſh Legiſlature, which never can be done conſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by a parliamentary Bill of Rights we had no Share in. As no Law can affect Britiſh Freemen without their Conſent, it will be hard to ſhew how we can be conſtitutionally affected by any parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Bill of Rights we never aſſented to, and without ſuch arbitrary Proceedings, had we but an American Parliament, the momentous Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and her Colonies might naturally induce their two great Legiſlatures to proceed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly, and to ſecure a parental Precedency to our Mother Country, without Oppreſſion, lordly Treatment, Complaints or Diſaffection.</p>
               <p>Let us draw Good out of evil Intentions, get our Rights clearly aſcertained, and take every Handle from our Enemies; for when national En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments are brought into Being, they will hardly periſh for Want of Subſiſtence, while a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Right, and colourable Purpoſe may feed them, however they may be ſtunted a while. A parliamentary Deſpotiſm may occaſionally forbear
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011073_0035_0F854B26A1258110"/>
to act offenſively, while it is even defended by the ſtrongeſt Fortification and Garriſon on Earth; but we muſt deprive it intirely of all Kinds of Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that has any Appearance of conſtitutional Proviſion, before it will ever ſurrender to our Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how loudly ſoever our Heralds may ſummon it; and we can hardly force it otherwiſe to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>While the Parliament has Recourſe to arbitrary Bills of Right, it will hardly lay down an aſſumed Power againſt us it may colourably retain; for ſurely French Edicts may operate againſt us as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally as any arbitrary Britiſh Statute what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; ſo let Order be drawn out of Confuſion, and proper Boundaries be openly fixed as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble between Engliſh Privileges and ours. A Bill of Right for Great-Britain may be regularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Parliament, as the Rights of that Nation are ſolely divided between the King and People of it, and as no Bill can paſs without the Aſſent of both Parties; and had we a Negative in the Britiſh Legiſlature, ſuch Laws might conſtitutionally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to us alſo, becauſe they could have no Force without our Concurrence; but as Matters are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnantly circumſtanced, nothing can be more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary than ſuch Acts of Parliament, ſo far as they affect the Colonies. This Doctrine may great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarm our moſt ſoaring Enemies, that dream as wildly of a parliamentary Omnipotence, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts do of their Church's Infallibility; but it ſurely proceeds from a conſtitutional Pen, that hates Petulancy, as well as Encroachments; and ſhould the Parliament have a Right to fix Limits between England and us, independent of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it may as juſtly alter ſuch Limits at Pleaſure, and no French Monarch can be more abſolute; ſo let the Rights of each Party be conſtitutionally aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained before our important Debates ſubſide,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:011073_0036_0F854B2767FDCEE8"/>
that invigorating Harmony may ſtrengthen the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and inteſtine Feuds enervate it no more. The grand Diſpute is warmly commenced, and let it be proſecuted to a ſovereign Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I think theſe Hints ſhould be honoured by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Encroachers, and American Writers againſt them, for they may be very uſeful to the latter, ſo far as they turn the former and their firſt Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants inſide out. I have been very explicit indeed, and we never ſhould trifle in alarming Danger, when even a very formidable Power, we relied on for Protection, threatens us and our Poſterity with perpetual Chains.</p>
               <p>Britiſh Commons pretend to defend the Rights of the Subject, as faithful and noble conſtitutional Guardians; but I fear a great Number of them, after every juſt Palliation in their Favour threw ours very ingloriouſly away, when they fondly prepared the Stamp-Act for the royal Aſſent, and in other conſiderable Inſtances alſo, which I muſt wave at preſent; and we may well be as free in Remonſtrances, that have argumentative Sanctions, as they have been in Attempts to enſlave us. They ſhould not force us to complain, and then condemn us for complaining, for we had rather bleſs them as Friends, than curſe them as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and ſhould they have been deceived through Inclination, Precipitancy, and falſe Shews of Right, we ought to render their ſhocking Miſtake appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and the horrid Fruits of it deteſtable, that we may obtain Redreſs, and prevent the like for the Future.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons, I think my openeſt Language highly expedient, and conſequently very juſtifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but Writers, much heated by great Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are often prejudiced in Favour of their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring Freedom, and ſhould I ever be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of ſuch an Error, I am willing to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011073_0037_0F854B282C598018"/>
and adequate Reparation; for it is noble to make Satisfaction for known Injuries of any Kind, and Meanneſs only may excite Men to defend them, as I would fain perſuade our Superiors and others to believe. But while we inveigh freely againſt the aſſuming Houſe of Commons, for the arbitrary Proceedings of a Majority, let us vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly remember ſome brave Men, a praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Minority, in that arrogating and ſometimes giddy Aſſembly, which ſcorned temporizing Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, and whoſe laudable Efforts, though fruitleſs, call loudly for our grateful Acknowledgement and Eſteem. When we complain the moſt warmly of injurious Numbers, and the invincible Force of parliamentary Yeas againſt us, let us treat ſuch over-borne Worthies with a lively Reſpect that is evidently due to their Merit.</p>
               <p>Let ſuitable Petitions humbly ſue for the favourable Influence of the Crown, and ſpirited Remonſtrances, from the Preſs or otherwiſe, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evince our threatned conſtitutional Rights, and clearly detect the groundleſs Claim of our aſſuming Fellow-Subjects againſt them, which ſolid Arguments only may effect. Let us proceed in this Manner till our Grievances are removed, and our conſtitutional Privileges firmly eſtabliſhed, if that may be done. We may thus draw every true Briton to our Intereſt, leave our perſevering Enemies no Colour of an Excuſe, convert the fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Friends to the Advancement of their Friendſhip, and perhaps timely convince our lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Oppreſſors, we are not meer Beaſts of Burthen, created for their Service, but the Fellow-Creatures, and Fellow-Subjects of ſuch great Men.</p>
               <p>When we want Favours from the Parliament, and when it proceeds according to the genuine Dignity of a Britiſh Legiſlature, let us humbly preſent our Petitions, and treat it with a dutiful Reverence, as our auguſt imperial Senate, but let
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011073_0038_0F854B28E1ADA4A0"/>
us not flatter the Vanity, nor feed the Errors of imperious Fellow-Subjects, in the moſt exalted Stations, that want oppreſſively to lord it over us; for much leſs injurious Proceedings than we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of, would even render a German Diet utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unworthy of Honour. If Men are not really and eſſentially great, a lofty Situation cannot poſſibly make them ſo; and ſprightly Dwarfs may not only climb very high, but even ſolace greatly, and ſhine bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Pageantry, on a very ſoaring Eminence, when very great Men are in Trouble, and Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity at the Bottom of it; ſo if our Freedom muſt fall a Victim to potent Ambition, let it die ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably, but not through our own Pertneſs, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, and falſe Ideas of Honour. Should dreadful Times even forbid us to ſpeak Truth free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us not meanly utter Falſehood, but guard our Virtue with a ſullen Integrity, that nobly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to extend a Time-ſerving Adulation, and never rail at Men for holding great Offices, but treat good Officers with a proper Reſpect.</p>
               <p>Indeed the greateſt frail Men are but fallible Creatures, and liable to plauſibly miſchievous Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but never can ignobly defend them when ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcloſed, for moral Eminence only is real Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo if our Superiors have wandered after a colourable Deception, adapted to their Inclination, let them be now open to Conviction, as truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Men, and henceforth merit and obtain a reſpectful Submiſſion, according to my ardent Deſire; but let us not meanly ſooth them, when we cannot honour them ſincerely. Their Ability of Courſe is greater than ours, as they have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Opportunities of Improvement; but our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on this Subject, are no doubt generally much ſuperior to theirs, and as ſuch ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the greateſt of them, for they have not only conſtrained us to ponder maturely, but ſound
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011073_0039_0F854B29C0AF81B0"/>
Reaſoning does not ſuit their Purpoſe, as Truth is intirely on our Side the Queſtion. As our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have a ſolid Foundation, an oppoſite Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry can but have a fictitious one, and Neceſſity is often the Mother of important Conſiderations, as well as other uſeful Inventions; and none truly great may immorally deſpiſe her argumentative Productions, when they openly call for Redreſs of Grievances, however baſe Flattery may abuſe their Contemners.</p>
               <p>I have dealt very plainly with our potent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbers, for I cannot be properly regarded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being clearly underſtood; and Compliments are no proper Return to male Treatment, nor do Opulence and Greatneſs always aſſociate as friendly Companions, but are often great Strangers and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents to each other, as every Propriator of both, as well as Poſſeſſors of the latter only, will freely confeſs inſtead of reſenting; and though the Stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Act obtained the Royal Aſſent, after ſoaring En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Money-granters prepared it for that Purpoſe, yet ſome of my preceding Obſervations, as well as the Dignity of Monarchs, may ſhew why the Crown ſhould be addreſſed by Petition, while we freely explode their lordly Proceeding. They have already ſpurned at our humble Petitions; and now let us prudently reſent their Diſdain, without any Kind of ſeditious or abuſive Invectives, for no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Loyaliſts can be pleaſed with the latter, when he coolly reflects upon them; and the former muſt be approved by every real Friend of Britiſh Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when it and the Cauſe of it are preſented to his Mind; for no true Briton, without Abhorrence, can poſſibly ſee Engliſh Subjects, even the remot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Branches of them cruelly deprived of vital Freedom, and tyrannically buried alive in Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm.</p>

               <p>I HAVE doubtleſs proved in my former Eſſay, among other Things of Importance, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland cannot tax Americans conſtitutionally, nor even without a manifeſt Violation of a national Faith, in a Matter of the utmoſt Conſequence; and I hope now to ſhew her late Overbearings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us were as far diſtant from true Policy as good Morals, which, indeed, in proceſs of Time, will ever be found to be inſeperably united.</p>
               <p>As correct Maps have not yet diſcloſed the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, let us take it for granted at preſent, that Britiſh Dominions, on the Continent of North-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, are now equal to a Square of a Thouſand Miles, and then maturely conſider what Colonies are wanted, and what a vaſt Number of People may be ſupported, and very advantageouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in that widely extended Empire. I think we have a reaſonable Hypotheſis before us; and ſuch a prodigious Tract of Ground contains a Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſquare Miles, or ſix Hundred and forty Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Acres of Land, which would even be ſixteen Acres for each Individual, when equally divided among forty Million Inhabitants; and it will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow of Conſequence, that a truly political Britiſh Legiſlature can never treat People oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, haughtily, or even coolly, which are moſt likely to forward the Settlement of it.</p>
               <p>That extenſive Territority we are now imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſurveying, is, perhaps, more than twelve times the Area of England and Wales, and would probably contain more than a hundred Million In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, if crouded with People like them Countries; ſo two Fifths of that vaſt Number, or the forty Million I have aſſined it to, would hardly overload it with Reſidents; for which
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011073_0041_0F854B2B2C98C368"/>
weighty Reaſon, its preſent blooming Colonies ſhould not be raſhly ſcourged, but even very kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated, to induce proper Numbers to fill it up ſpeedily. They ought to be tenderly guarded by a jealous Love, that valuable Fruits may proceed timely, and even abundantly, from their very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing Bloſſoms, which the Storms of a jealous Tyranny would blaſt and prevent. Loyal Subjects can but poorly brook ſuch injurious Tempeſts, from a Conſciouſneſs they are not deſerved.</p>
               <p>We have indeed Mountains, barren Deſerts, Moraſſes and Waters, like other wide Empires on this terraqueous Globe; but our external Barrens, like ſuch in other Places, as well as our fine Bays, Rivers and Lakes, may be internally fruitful, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a great Number of People, and not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow many Neceſſaries, but even much Wealth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon the Empire. Theſe are natural, and therefore probable Concluſions; and as our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable Wilds want many new Colonies, can that important End poſſibly be promoted by violently breaking down our Conſtitutional Fences, that arbitrary Brutes of Prey may rudely ſpoil thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready planted? Do not the Laws of true Policy, and even of true common Senſe itſelf, as well as the Laws of common Juſtice, and our excellent Conſtitution, abſolutely prohibit the prepoſterous Meaſures alluded to? Can extending bad Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to good old Tenants induce other Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to ſtruggle with many Hardſhips in ſettling difficult new Tenements for ſuch Landlords?</p>
               <p>When Britiſh Commons raſhly extort ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they could not poſſibly be directed by true Policy, admit it could even exiſt in Oppoſition to a conſtitutional Juſtice; and as they have viewed our large Continent itſelf but very imperfectly, at ſo great a Diſtance, they can hardly properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent our little thriving Nurſeries upon it, which
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011073_0042_0F854B2BEDF336D0"/>
change conſiderably every growing Seaſon, nor ſee clearly what trimming and other Improvements they ſucceſſively want; for great Mountains are more viſible afar off than ſmall artificial Mounts can be, and are even often diſcovered when many of their own conſiderable Eminences and Cavities are not diſtinguiſhable at all. While Men cannot ſee or overlook very great Things, they never can have clear Ideas of much ſmaller Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with them; and potent Strangers may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſend Force enough to plunder us, under a Colour of Law or otherwiſe, but never can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent us virtually, when they neither can clearly ſee us, our little changing Affairs, nor even the new World itſelf we live in. Before ſuch Men virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent us, the common Signification of ſuch Words muſt be reverſed.</p>
               <p>After warmly encountering and partly ſubduing rude Foreſts, dangerous Serpents, wild Beaſts, and worſe Savages, we now begin to make ſome Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure on our Part of the Globe; and I ſuppoſe it will hardly be denied, that ſome of our firſt Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lately purchaſed a Peace for Great-Britain, and that we chearfully aſſiſted her afterwards in ſtretching out this vaſt Empire to its preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive Dimenſions; and yet, after all our Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Bravery, added to the Importance of our Trade, what alarming Returns does ſhe make us! Do we deſerve that hard Treatment we meet with? May either Juſtice or Wiſdom extent it? Can it even poſſibly nouriſh our Loyalty or Affiance? Are galling Chains our righteous Deſert? May they and our extorted Complaints favour new Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, and help England to exchange our uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Trees for uſeful Colonies of People? Strange Proceedings, moſt ſurely, for the moſt celebrated Legiſlature on Earth!</p>

Of Courſe the Parliament has been lulled aſleep, and the Conduct complained of proceeded from a Dream, or our ancient lawgiving Mother, which has been deemed rigidly virtuous, and exceedingly wiſe, wants to gratify imperious Luſt very wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, impoliticly, and even very unnaturally in her advanced Years, at the great Expence or Ruin of her legitimate Offspring, and hitherto dutiful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Alas! our Proſpects are very gloomy indeed; and yet let us not cheriſh Deſpair or Averſion, but even hope for the beſt, while we can prudently cheriſh buoying Expectations; for I would fain believe our preſent Grievances, how wilful ſoever they may ſometimes appear, muſt needs be the Effect of our Mother's ſlumbering Deluſions, and will ſtraight be removed when the old Empreſs awaketh. A virtuous Matron may have lacivious Dreams, and deteſt their Excitments when ſhe can deliberate freely; and even tender dreaming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may receive bad Impreſſions againſt a hopeful Progeny, yet greatly abhor them when truly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated by Reaſon. Theſe are dutiful conjectural Palliations, and ſhould they even be incorrigibly reſented, the charitable Author cannot be to blame.</p>
               <p>But can our imperial Mother cruelly reſent them, and enforce her arbitrary Impoſitions by a cauſeleſs Vengeance! can ſhe be ſo greatly dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, ſacrifice her Honour ſo ignobly, proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute her Power ſo baſely, or even poſſibly keep our Complaints alive, after our importunate Clamours awake her, and excite her to ponder maturely! Let us not fondly imbibe ſuch imbittering Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, but cry aloud for Redreſs and ſuppreſs them, while we can ſafely cheriſh a better Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſhould all our Remonſtrances be loftily ſlighted, can ſhe reaſonably look for a perſevering filial Reſpect, if ſhe ſtill declines a parental Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and ſtrives unnaturally to oppreſs us!

Should not Parents ſhew good Examples to their Children, as well as expect a dutiful Behaviour from them; and ſhould not their Reſpect always be reciprocal? It is a wretched Precedent, moſt ſurely, when Parents firſt make very irregular Demands, and then threaten orderly Children for not complying with them; and, doubtleſs, all our Superiors, but our ſpiritual Fathers in God moſt ſignally, ought to ſhew us repugnant Examples.</p>
               <p>Should faithful Subjects have ſlaviſh Chains made for them, by a Power that ſhould ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their Freedom, and then be viewed as Rebels for refuſing to wear them, while they can poſſibly avoid it? Are we Traitors to King <hi>George,</hi> or any of his Dominions, for juſtly ſpurning at unconſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Fetters, or they which would cruelly force us to wear them, and thus make alarming Inroads into Britiſh Freedom, and even ſap the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our moſt excellent Conſtitution! Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould our Flames or the Conduct of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamers be condemned? which Party acts traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to our free State, by dangerouſly wounding its exquiſite Eſtabliſhment, and rending its Peace and Strength to Pieces? Can Juſtice authorize England to lord it over us, to load us at Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with arbitrary Impoſitions, and to puniſh us for an extorted Reſentment? Or may any Kind of Policy acquaint her, that plucking up our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Freedom violently by the Roots, is a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Method to make new Colonies take deep Root downwards, and bear much Fruit upwards? Can ſuch momentous Queries be juſtly anſwered in Favour of the Stamp-act, or any other Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Rights; or any wiſe and upright Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature perſeveringly defend ſuch Proceedings, however it was hurried into them, as neither Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor Virtue may juſtify, and jointly explode and abhor? Such Queſtions may be offenſive to

ſome of their Extorters, but I never ſhould he cenſured for them.</p>
               <p>My freeſt Obſervations loudly call for Thanks inſtead of Reſentment; for the Purpoſe I expoſe is pregnant with horrible Miſchief, that may even prove fatal to both Parties, if not timely ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and while England treateth us ill, after all our Dangers, Hardſhips and Dutifulneſs, her late Acquiſitions can do her ſmall Service, as unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced common Senſe may plauſibly fore bode; for it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe the Contrary, or that any conſiderable Number of People will leave their Native Countries, and come hither to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a Wilderneſs, under ſuch a criminal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic Diſcouragement. How greatly muſt any State be ſurcharged with Inhabitants, or diſtreſſed otherwiſe, ere many would leave it, and exchange their native Land for our Deſerts, under ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterouſly intimidating Prohibitions? Can ſmall Inducements and great Diſcouragements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, or even poſſibly, cement this great Empire with England, or furniſh it timely with proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants? Will breaking forcibly into our Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and gathering our Fruit at Pleaſure, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce others to plant new Ones at a great Expence or Labour, that would be equally liable to ſuch Robberies, or attach us firmly to the Intereſt of ſuch Plunderers? If theſe are political Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. I have no Idea of Politicks.</p>
               <p>The bare Word of Princes ſhould ever be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ground of Reliance; and yet the monſtrous Proceedings before us, if madly ſupported, muſt even ſoon render the very Patents of our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns utterly contemptible, and the Great-Seal of England a deſpicable Signet; for the ſame Power that annuls or curtails any of our Charters, or any Privilege granted by it, may even as juſtly annul every one of them entirely, and do likewiſe to all
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011073_0046_0F854B2EF0D05A68"/>
King <hi>George</hi> and his Predeceſſors have granted, or that he and his Succeſſors can grant: So of courſe our Monarchs Charters cannot be prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relied on, while a parliamentary Deſpotiſm is prepoſterouſly avowed. Was Juſtice even but an empty Name, ſuch Policy will not quickly fill our large Vacancies with People, and ſpeedily tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all the improvable Parts of our immenſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt into earthly Paradiſes, nor bring Honour to the royal Prerogative, or Affiance to the publick Faith; for no doubt the Parliament has as much Right to revoke every Charter the Crown has granted, or can grant, as it has to annul the leaſt Part of any one of them.</p>
               <p>Should the Credit of the Crown's Grants be thus bartered away for an unconſtitutional Power of collecting our Money, or any other parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Encroachment? And as Monarchs are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally too fond of raiſing their Revenues, ſhould young Princes be abuſed by their Council, and artfully ſeduced into ſuch fatal Errors? ſhould not the Honour of the Royal Prerogative, and a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, be even very watchfully guarded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being murdered by the Sword of a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Deſpotiſm; and ſhould ſuch arbitrary Puſhes even not injure them at all, may not a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious England have Work enough frequently from her jealous combining Neighbours, without ſtruggling with evil Conſequences, madly urged, by driving three Million of good Subjects from Loyalty to Diſſafaction, which at beſt muſt be very Miſchievous in alarming Exigences? If this be the Fruit of true Policy, its lauded Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſurely deteſtable.</p>

               <p>What enchanting Fiend, what malevolent Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer, has lately directed our imperial Councils, transformed our Unity to Diſcord, our Glory to Ridicule, and made the Empire a Butt for its E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Sneers and Plots!

There may be Storms enough in the watery Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire without employing Conjurers to raiſe them: And ſhould a parliamentary Power wed oppreſſive Machinations, through any Kind of Enchantments whatever, and ſtrive to enforce the Stamp-act, or any other arbitrary Impoſition or Prohibition, can true Britiſh Coloniſts tamely bear ſuch ungrateful Scourgings, after all their dutiful and gallant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, while they have ſo many Ambuſcades to befriend them? Should we prove ſuch daſtardly Creatures, would not every true Engliſhman, and even our ſoaring Enemies themſelves, when Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice would ſuffer them to think coolly, inwardly condemn and deſpiſe us? Is not male Treatment a poor Retaliation for our Loyalty and Bravery? and ſhould we ignobly brook it without a proper Reſentment, or be cenſured for breaking the Peace of the Empire, when lawleſs and ruffinous Aſſaults have made us cry out?</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this extorted Freedom, we are very ſenſible our Trade, Towns, and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Plantations, are quire defenceleſs againſt England, ſhould Tyranny out-brave a conſtitutional Juſtice, and other great Powers, without her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; but many of us, like our robuſt and ſhifting Fore-fathers, can breath and ſtrugle a while without them. We have friendly Labyrinths to hide us, wild Food to ſuſtain us, and natural For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes to defend us for ſome Time: And ſhould Great-Britain madly drive us to the laſt Extremity, we could not only form a common Intereſt with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Indian Nations, now our Enemies, but even call her jealous Neighbours alſo to our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and perhaps to enſlave us at length, as no other Kind of European Deſpotiſm would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo intollerable as her's.

               <p>Explode not this occaſional Explicitneſs, for I greatly abhor Sedition; and the thinking Part of us, ſhould not haſtily ruſh into any Thing like it; but ſtem Raſhneſs, ſeek Redreſs, and keep good Decorum as much as poſſible, until a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering Oppreſſion drives us into Tumults. This, no doubt, is our duty, and many of us yet can weigh Things in the Scales of Reaſon; but the ghaſtly Face of real Deſperation, or even very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and exaſperating Provocations, might ſoon deprive us of that great Advantage, and raſhly drive us from one Evil to another, and, perhaps, from a leſs to a greater, ſucceſſively; for when inteſtine Flames rage to a national Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, they are far more licentious and fatal than any other Kind. When former Friends become irreconcilable Enemies, their Enmity has no Limits; and when good Subjects are driven into a State of Deſperate Madneſs, a furious and outrageous Reſentment may ſoon cauſe their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors to loſe Sight of their own Crimes, to throw all the Blame on the injured Party, and even to deem the bloodieſt Revenge but extorted Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Our Enemies already verify theſe Obſervations, by perverſly inveighing againſt us as Rebels, for ſome little Hurly-burlies and warm Invectives their own evil Conduct ſolely occaſioned; and was their Power but equal to their incenſed Ambition, they would doubtleſs chaſtiſe us ſeverely, as very upright Men, for only reſenting their wicked At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to enſlave us, with ſome irregular inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Commotions, too common at Home on much leſs Provocations: This is the curſed Fruit of inteſtine Quarrels. And ſhould England and her Colonies be univerſally inflamed againſt each

other, how ſoon might the Darts of a lawleſs Phrenſy wound, torment, and blind our Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and even make them deem Cruelty but a juſt Retaliation, after they were rendered incapable of ſeeing that ſucceſſive male Treatment, which made us run mad, and kept us out of our Senſes! May not our own Annals beneficially teach us, that diſmal inteſtine Storms may ſometimes have but a moderate Beginning; and yet gradually fill a Nation, even a learned Nation, with ſuch groſs Darkneſs, that infatuated Princes at length, though above earthly Tribunals, may even be tried, condemned and executed by lawleſs Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, after the latter have been ſacrificing one another. Let us ſhudder at the Proſpect of ſuch deſtructive Quarrels, and ſtigmatize the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Fomenters of them, while prudential Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations can favour each Party; for we are as liable to an infatuating, imbittering, and ruinous Prejudice, as our frail Anceſtors could be, if their inſtructive Harms, and due Conſideration excite us not wiſely and bravely to ſtem it.</p>
               <p>The Meaſures I degrade are awfully prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous; for the growing Envy of jealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates againſt England, may too ſoon cauſe her to want the utmoſt Fidelity and Aſſiſtance of all her Subjects, in every Quarter of our extenſive Empire; and even nothing but Traiterouſneſs, or a very groſs Infatuation, can ever excite her to urge the contrary. Should foreign Troubles greatly alarm her, inteſtine Feuds would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſubſide; but ſhould all our Remonſtrances be ſlighted 'till then, what Affiance could either Party have in the other? Conſider my native Country, Great-Britain conſider maturely, and let the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies behave circumſpectly, for I would by no Means favour Undutifulneſs, by ſtriving vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly to ſtem Oppreſſion; and ſhould our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

ever merit Correction, let us juſtly feel the Rod of a Sovereign Power, and not be ſuffered to offend with Impunity. Let us be wiſely and nobly governed according to the Laws of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional Policy, for Anarchy is deteſtible and ruinous; but let not oppreſſive Ambition drive us to Self-Defence, Invectives, Enmity, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Diſtraction, and then tyrannically knock out our Brains as out-lawed Rebels.</p>
               <p>I think thoſe expedient Hints ſhould not be diſdained, for they may reaſonably prevent ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſchief, which even ſeems already to ſtare us grimly in the Face; and perhaps our moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated Guides of the moral World but rarely give better Advice from the Pulpit, how coſtly ſoever their Lectures may be, and however brightly they may ſhine with a Scholaſtick Page<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antry. Had but our learned Prelates preached as good Doctrine in their Temples frequently, and in the Houſe of Lords occaſionally, the Stamp-Act would hardly have paſſed into a Law; and as my plain Dealing is morally adapted to a great Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, they might and ſhould have prevented, I think they ſhould honour it ſignally, as God's moſt holy Vicegerents and divine Preſidents, to all about them. When ſuch great Men have rendered momentous Freedom abſolutely neceſſary, they ſhould of Courſe very humbly revere it; and I am ſorry mine was raſhly extorted, for ſurely the mutual Intereſt of England and her Colonies equally requires the former to merit our Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and the latter to deſerve her Protection and Favour, nor may any unprejudiced Friend of either Country think otherwiſe, whatever our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and ſome very cholerick Americans may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely ſay or idly imagine.</p>
               <p>The ſtaple Commodities of Great-Britain are very ſuitable Merchandiſe for moſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,

and no doubt ſhe is compleatly qualified at preſent, when her State Affairs are rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted, for the auguſt Seat of Government, Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Magazine, and ſtrong occaſional Bulwark of a grand maritime and trading Empire, and ſhould of Courſe greatly encourage all her Colonies for her own Advantage as well as theirs. This will hardly be diſputed by unprejudiced Men of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, for I think it may even be clearly demonſtrated, by ſound common Senſe itſelf, that true Britiſh Policy can neither curtail our Freedom, nor cramp our Trade; but guard the former, and promote the latter, which ſhould not only favour the expeditious Settlement of new Plantations, and that perhaps very greatly indeed, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us to deal much more freely at Home, than our preſent Circumſtances will by any Means admit of; and alſo inſpire us with a noble Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of defending a Britiſh Glory and Utility, at the Expence of our Lives and Fortunes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally; which precious Fruits never can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from arbitrary Scourgings.</p>
               <p>But to wave a raging Jealouſy and Diſſaffection, and all their deſtructive Conſequences, which are ſurely the moſt fiendiſh Offspring of Oppreſſion; we yearly want more Britiſh Goods conſiderably than our Exports to that Nation can purchaſe; and were but proper Markets opened for all the reſt of our vendible Commodities, we could traffick more and more with our Mother Country, and throw more and more Caſh into her Coffers ſucceſſively, while a true Britiſh Policy, a conſtitutional Juſtice, and a ſovereign Amity ſubſiſted between us; nor would any Thing more naturally facilitate the Settlement of new Colonies, than cauſing thoſe already planted to flouriſh greatly. When old Tennants are very well treated, new ones will ſoon grow fond of ſuch good Landlords; and our large
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011073_0053_0F854B35A04784F0"/>
Vacancies call loudly for ſuch virtuous Policy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the counter Treatment extended to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Coloniſts, which, if madly ſupported, can hardly fail of ruining both Parties at length, and muſt even inconteſtably, while defended by the Parliament, render the firmeſt Grants of the Crown exceedingly precarious, if not utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and thus deeply wound the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, the Peace, Affiance and Affection of its Grantees, the Progreſs of new Settlements, and a Publick Faith in general.</p>
               <p>I hope England will be aſhamed, afraid, of ſuch monſtrous Proceedings, and even run ſwiftly from them before their direful Conſequences make her ſhudder; and theſe Expectations ſeem well grounded, for admit ſhe is very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, which I would not fondly believe, yet as her late Encroachments are ſo glaringly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to her own Intereſt, as well as a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Juſtice, I think they proceeded of Courſe from Deluſion, and muſt vaniſh when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. I think we may rationally conclude, that after the great Fatigues of a hot War, and the intoxicating Elatements of a glorious Peace, ſome very officious Spirits, ſuch as victorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms abound with, rocked her Helmſmen into a deep mental Slumber, in the inchanting Cradle of Ambition, and that all our Alarms proceed from meer Chimerical Viſions, which muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely vaniſh, and our Grievances with them, as ſoon as them celebrated Sages are thoroughly awaked. Theſe are buoying and charitable Hopes, and let us yet cheriſh them in Spite of our gloomy Appearances; for Hiſtory and Experience may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſhew us, that many famous Men, in the wiſeſt Ages, have wildly dreamed, with their Eyes open, in Favour of one darling View or other.</p>

Some of my Readers, may call theſe ludicrous Obſervations, but ſurely they are not meer ſportive Trifles, nor do I know how to account more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally for our ſurpriſing Grievances; and of Courſe, ſoothing Deluſions thrive always the faſter when they are planted in a very rich Soil, and eagerly cultivated by very ſtrong Abilities. I would not write in vain, ſo have endeavoured to affect Men of Different Tempers, by interſperſing argumentative Banters among graver Reaſonings, and a Diverſity of ſtriking Similies of the ſame Import, which may not prove fruitleſs like vain Repetitions, and ſhould not be degraded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Let us keep up our Spirits, and a good Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum alſo, and when we remonſtrate ever ſo freely, let us alſo behave circumſpectly, and ſuppreſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections as much as poſſible, in the midſt of our warmeſt Complaints of Encroachments. Let Force only drive us into Tumults that have any Appearance of Sedition, for we are but hurt yet, by alarming Apprehenſions concerning the Stamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Act, and ſurely our Grievances muſt inſtantly be removed, when proper Repreſentations appear in in our Favour. Let us be watchful, let us be couragious, and convince our Superiors Freedom is dearer than Life; but throw neither of them raſhly away. Let us keep our Arms in good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but Compulſion only make us uſe them.</p>
               <p>We are doubtleſs too numerous, valuable and ſpiritful, to be utterly contemned, and to have all our Complaints proudly diſdained, by a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliberating Parliament, notwithſtanding that Freak of Elation offends us. When a Scotch Prince aſcended to our imperial Throne, that great Elevation made him and ſome of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants very light headed; but ſurely, the late Conqueſts of Great-Britan cannot long intoxicate

her wiſe Legiſlature accordingly, however their Fumes may affect it a while. Men of generous Revolution Principles may ſometimes have Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiſh Dreams, but never can adhere to ſuch arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Deluſions, when their injurious Tendency plainly appears: And could England even reduce us inſtantly to Vaſſalage, every laudable Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration abſolutely forbids it; and it muſt needs be more glorious for our auguſt Monarchs to reign mildly, over many affectionate Subjects, like Princes, and numerous Myriads of loyal inferior Freemen, than to lord it over mean and diſpirited Slaves.</p>

               <p>I HAVE already clearly proved, according to my own Conception, that the Stamp-Act wounds the royal Prerogative deeply, and is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with the Honour of the Crown, a national Faith and Affiance, a conſtitutional Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, the fundamental Law of Britiſh Taxations, and true political Wiſdom, which ſhould abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly excite moral Agents to damn ſuch brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evils, and all their horrid Offspring; but as arbitrary Tempers are exceedingly fond of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Encroachments, I muſt yet ſtrive to render them more deteſtable, by farther expoſing their vieled Deformity, which is far from being fully diſcloſed at preſent, and will even be much ſecreted when I have done, ſo let others diſplay it effectually at length. Such rude Puſhes at our Freedom are very alarming, when ſeriouſly viewed in any Light, how ſportive ſoever we may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times decry them, in the midſt of our fluctuating Ideas, when Hope alternately gets the better of Fear, but are moſt ſhocking when we conſider where they came from, and that they actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from its nominal Guardians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:011073_0056_0F854B399037AC20"/>
If powerful Friends ſtood firmly by us, we might ſafely deſpiſe the baſe Deſigns of much weaker Enemies, but ſhould be very circumſpect and gallant too, when potent nominal Friends join eagerly with open Foes to enſlave us; and that wicked Law which threatens to deſtroy our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, was the amazing Draught of its nominal Protectors; of Men that pretend nobly to defend conſtitutional Rights and Privileges, againſt both regal Uſurpations and miniſterial Corruptions. That Britiſh Commons thus aſſume the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Subject, is even inconteſtably notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and yet now our famous nominal Guardians, through the Plentitude of their Money-raiſing Power, would freely damn the conſtitutional Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their American Fellow Subjects, an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobly intail perpetual Slavery upon us! We are thus experimentally inſtructed, that great Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions have ſometimes but ſmall Foundations, and are not always ſupported by great Realities; but ſurely ſuch Gentlemen muſt be ſurpriſingly deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Britiſh Electors might find much better Delegates, if Old-England is not even inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly degenerated. A genuine Britiſh Patriotiſm, immemorially lauded by the greateſt Men, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a partial Diſpoſition highly inglorious.</p>
               <p>Were ſuch arrogating Mortals our beſt Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Guardians, and ſhould they adhere to their preſent Intention, how wretched indeed would our Circumſtances be! we ſhould thus be treated like the holy Author of Chriſtianity, who was ſacrificed by the nominal Friends of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah; and who is ſtill betrayed to a faithleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt by nominal Chriſtians, even the greateſt of them, our lofty High Prieſts themſelves; but let us be truly thankful, for our Condition is not quite ſo gloomy, unleſs our wounded Grants from the Crown be intirely murdered at length, which
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011073_0057_0F854B3A24DDC650"/>
ſhould, no Doubt, be inſtantly healed, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably honoured for the future. Our Provincial Legiſlatures, however diminutively they may be ſpoken of, are not confined to trifling By-Laws, like Companies and Towns corporate, but even our Fortunes, Reputations and Lives are as much ſubjected to their ſucceſſive Acts as thoſe belonging to the Inhabitants of England are to the Statutes of that Nation; ſo we may well be ſuffered to tax ourſelves diſcretionally, according to our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Occaſions.</p>
               <p>Under what Colour of Juſtice may a very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Legiſlature, unacquainted with our Ability and Occaſions, or rather the aſſuming Commons of England, deprive us of that great conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Privilege! Such Britiſh Patriots would be highly inflamed, indeed, if a Prince on that Throne illegally demanded our Money, and threatned to ſcourge us for Non-compliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Kind of arbitrary Exactions, if not timely ſuppreſſed, might ſoon bury their own Freedom, as well as ours, in the yawning Grave of Deſpotiſm; but while their own Rights ſeem to be out of Danger, they can fondly deprive us of ours, and authoriſe the Servants of the Crown to plunder us boldly, under a Colour of Law. If ſuch Proceedings are conſiſtent with true Honour or the genuine Dignity of a Britiſh Parliament, I have hitherto been greatly miſtaken; and ſurely ſuch Men are not faithful Guardians of a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional Freedom, which ſhould be equally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in every Part of the Empire, but partial Sticklers for the Freedom of their own Iſland only.</p>
               <p>How diſhonourable are ſuch Stretches of invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Power, of Power that ſhould nobly defend them momentous Rights it aims to deſtroy! and how could the Intriegues of a few reſtleſs Enemies
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011073_0058_0F854B3AF2AB5BF8"/>
make us dread ſuch parliamentary Encroachments, ere we ſaw them, even in a free-thinking Age, wherein Britiſh Liberty is merely idolized! How could we ſurmiſe great Men, exceedingly tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of their own Freedom, could ingloriouſly wreſt ours from us, and thus run from the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Britiſh Legiſlature! Should the Court ever remove to this Continent, how would Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain like ſuch male Treatment! And ſhould our imperial Power thus change its Situation, would not Americans have as much Right then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe it as their Engliſh fellow Subjects have now? In a State of Trial, Probationers muſt have Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to various Kinds of Evil, but ſhould a bad Miniſtry direct the Britiſh Legiſlator, or a good Parliament controul its injurious Deſigns! Strong Men may extend evil Treatment to their weaker Brethren, as Experience too often evinces, but ſtrong Virtue never can produce it, nor ſtrong Reaſoning ever defend it.</p>
               <p>The Stamp-Tax is evidently a partial Impoſition, and was it ever ſo equitable in its own Nature, that could not poſſibly juſtify an Arbitrary Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and judicious Britiſh Commons, as ſtaunch Engliſh Patriots, would be greatly alarmed at deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic Exactions from the Throne, that were ever ſo reaſonable in themſelves, for they would be fully perſwaded, as prudent fore ſeeing Men, that Deſpotiſm, which began the moſt plauſibly, if not timely repelled, might gradually advance to intolerable Oppreſſion; and can ſound Reaſon perſwade Engliſh Money-Granters it is better for us to be arbitrarily thumped by the Scepter and Mace alſo than by the former alone! When ſuch Proceedings are placed in a proper Light, how cenſurable and defenceleſs muſt they appear? And what is the dreaded Power of a Royal Prerogative, when compared with ſuch a boundleſs Money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raiſing
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011073_0059_0F854B3BAD4F0F60"/>
Authority? If we muſt be reduced to Slavery a while, let us not have ſo many hard Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to lord it over us, for doubtleſs one will be more than enough, and the latter may probably be much ſooner intimidated from Tyranny, than a great Number of powerful combined Oppreſſors, perpetually inflaming each other againſt us. We had better endure the Rod of an Abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch only, however we may dread it, than Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Scourgings from the Crown, and every Member of the Britiſh Parliament, or but even a majority of them alſo. We had better form a common Intereſt with all the Subjects of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Monarchy, againſt the Power of a deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Ruler, than have ten Million fellow Subjects to help a Prince to enſlave us, and to keep us faſt chained in Bondage.</p>
               <p>Theſe are very free Obſervations, and I ſuppoſe our Adverſaries will call them Treaſon; but let impartial Readers ſeriouſly conſider, whether they or we are Enemies to the State, and that our Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty cannot poſſibly keep always alive, if it has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Poiſon to feed on. Small Portions of Bane may not kill it, and be timely expelled by proper antidotes; but male Treatment never can nouriſh our Fidelity, while Cauſes only produce natural Effects: And ſhould not thoſe be cenſured which ſtrive to infect it, inſtead of us which call loudly for wholeſome Proviſions, that may and ſhould preſerve its Health and Vigour? We have indeed already been conſtrained to drink deadly Potions, which perhaps would have poiſoned our Loyalty intirely, had not Hope and Redreſs, as a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Counter-poiſon, greatly repelled their baneful Operations: And ſhould we be driven forcibly to Enmity or even any Thing like it, when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently deſire indiſſolvable Friendſhip, and then <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

ſeverely ſcourged by Potent Injuſtice, and then deemed Rebels for ſome bitter Complaints and frantick Geſtures, occaſioned by the Torments of our agonizing Wounds, or the torturing Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of our diſtracted Minds!</p>
               <p>Should not Britain be aſhamed of her idle Clamours againſt us on Account of our late Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, after ſhe had driven us forcibly into them; and ſhould not our Lectures excite her to ponder maturely, to behave like herſelf for the future, to protect the Rights of all her Subjects impartially, and to ſtigmatize criminal Innovators under their moſt blazing Pretenſions of Patriotiſm? Have we not been very indirectly treated, and are not our Enemies peſtilent Diſturbers of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire? Do they not behave more like French In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiaries than true Britiſh Patriots? Should they approach the Throne at Pleaſure, and have open Avenues for that Purpoſe, or a ſtrong Faction ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them very powerful, and enable them to force a Paſſage to it through his Majeſty's Guards? I am not vain enough to ſuppoſe my weightieſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, though not very trifling, will have Power to lead ſome of our Foes to Retraction, for, perhaps, Arguments ſent down from Heaven itſelf, would hardly extort Confeſſion from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate imperious Offenders, that ſet up themſelves as infallible Oracles; but let Old-England con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider maturely, and timely conſider, and let not a generous People be gulled any longer by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip Machinations the moſt neatly dreſſed by art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sophiſts. Let them draw Wiſdom out of their late ſhocking Confuſion, even as Light was firſt extracted from a rude Chaos, and let not us be elated by victorious Arguments, as Great-Britain was by her late Conqueſts, for we never ſhould copy after ſuch bad Originals, whatever temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations aſſail us. We juſtly explode her licentious
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011073_0061_0F854B3D2E5004A0"/>
Wanderings, ſo let us not ſtrole at Random our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but chearfully render to Caeſar all his juſt Dues, with a loyal conſtitutional Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>In our great monarchial Common-wealth, the Rights of the Crown and People ſhould be equally guarded; for no Prince can ſufficiently befriend us without an adequate Power, nor the People be truly happy without Freedom and Security. Theſe are well grounded Obſervations; and yet great Sticklers for parliamentary Privileges, frequently explode a wholeſome Power in others, that they may engroſs a noxious one themſelves; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many arbitrary Britiſh Taxers, if not Court Minions, could but poorly brook a beneficial Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in the chief Magiſtrate, while they are encroaching, even very injuriouſly, as Senators; and doubtleſs the Court, if not cautiouſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, would ſoon Monopolize all the Power of the freeſt Nation.</p>
               <p>Theſe Concluſions are juſtified by Hiſtory and Experience, and therefore ſhould not our auguſt Houſe of Lords, as a proper medium between the King and his People's Delegates, equally guard the Rights of Prince and Subject, and thus keep the publick Scales ever in good Order, that Common-wealth Affairs may be properly weighed in every Part of our extenſive Empire? This not only ſeems to be the conſtitutional, important, and indiſpenſable Duty of the powerful Nobility of England, but is even a Syſtem of Politicks wiſely adopted by them great Men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how could the Lords of Parliament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with their own political Maxims, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Royal Prerogative, the indubitable Rights of the Subject, and the Dignity of their exalted Station, gratify the aſſuming Commons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, and thus furniſh executive Power with a Sword to murder our conſtitutional Freedom,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011073_0062_0F854B3DE33CE3A8"/>
and the Force of its Maſters Grants, under the Great-Seal of the Empire! The Stamp-Act is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually injurious to the Prince and People, though in a very different Manner, and under a Pretence of favouring the former; but let us wave the bleeding Prerogative at preſent, and aſk how the Princes of the Britiſh Diet, with ſo many inſpired Guides among them, came to wander ſo amazingly, when that deteſtable Law came into Exiſtence! what led them ſo to grieve our Infant Colonies, and to withdraw their paternal Regard intirely from them?</p>
               <p>It is Time ſurely, high Time indeed, for Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Coloniſts to be greatly alarmed, when a great Majority of Engliſh Commons eagerly combine to enſlave us, as our pretended Repreſentatives, and the Potent Lords of that Realm concur with their meaſures; for while them two Branches unite againſt us, the Court, no doubt, though very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly, will carry their arbitrary Purpoſe into Execution, for various Reaſons that might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; and yet at that very unpropitious Juncture, we had ſome tender Friends in both Houſes, but their weightieſt Arguments were Legiſlatively out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the much ſuperior Force of Yeas and Contents.</p>
               <p>Our requiſite Plaineſs ſhould not be reſented, for the Injured have ſurely a Right to complain; and even very bitter Words might be juſtly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on ſuch provoking Occaſions, if Prudence did not forbid them. I would not affront any Peer in Britain, but would induce them all to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor their arbitrary Proceedings, for they certainly are deteſtable; and while moral Freedom is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally extended to the Crown itſelf, through the Miniſtry or otherwiſe, as the avowed and much applauded Privilege of Engliſhmen, we ſhould not only be allowed, without Cenſure, but even with conſtitutional Encomiums to treat our
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011073_0063_0F854B3EBB003B98"/>
greateſt fellow Subjects as openly, whenever their Conduct renders it neceſſary. I think temporal Lords greatly blameable, and their ſpiritual Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren much more culpable; for the latter, very ſignally, as God's moſt holy Vicegerents, ſhould ever aſſiſt his weaker Creatures, occaſionally, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the injurious Deſigns of their ſtronger Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, inſtead of combining with ſuch powerful Oppreſſors, like Jewiſh high Prieſts and lofty Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins of old. Our Prelates have Precedence of temporal Lords, and ſhould evidently deſerve it, or be juſtly contemned; for Merit only may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly entitle them to it.</p>
               <p>The great Primate of all England himſelf can hardly refute this Doctrine, and I know not what his Grace may think of it; but I think he ſhould dutifully and humbly revere it, even in the midſt of his greateſt pontifical Glory, and that he cannot poſſibly do otherwiſe, without greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring the Laws and Precedent of the Meſſiah, who, I ſuppoſe he now and then vouchſafes to call Maſter, with an orthodox Formality, on extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions. The Stamp-Act is but Part of the baſe Fruit of a paſſionate Darkneſs, that has long reigned proudly over Great-Britain, and which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have done ſo, had but her dignified Clergy ſhined as bright ſpiritually as they have done temporally, and been as fond of a pure Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Greatneſs as they have been of a carnal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence.</p>
               <p>Formal hail Maſters are eaſily repeated; ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Offences, without much pain, avoided; and our kind of phariſaical Works are not very grievous, but the rigorouſly perfecting Laws and Precedent of Chriſt, are no more honoured by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern than antient Rabbins; and Engliſh Biſhops now prefer legal Grandeur to a Goſpel Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the World, as much as Hebrew chief

Prieſts did formerly. Our wiſe Reformers could eaſily diſtinguiſh good Popiſh Livings from bad Popiſh Tenets, and their underſtanding Succeſſors make the ſame Diſtinction as clearly. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Abſurdities are leſs ridiculous than Popiſh Ones; and our dignified Leaders can freely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the former in Oppoſition to the latter, but like idolatrous Papiſts, they ſo piouſly rail at, are much fonder of great Popiſh Revenues, fine Palaces, Coaches and Retinues, than following the Meſſiah, apoſtolically, through a Soul-humbling Poverty, and a brave Self-conquering Warfare.</p>
               <p>The greateſt of Men are ſurely but fallible Creatures, and liable to injurious Miſtakes, even as extenſive as their Influence, unleſs due Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection prevent it, for not only many famous Grecians and Romans of old, but even many ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Politicians, Philoſophers, and Divines of our more inlightned Day, have wandered ſtrangely after favourite Views into very groſs Errors, and raſhly wounding our Freedom is not the leaſt of them; for I will venture to propheſy freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the illuminating Aid of a Prelate's Benedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that our roughly treated Colonies ere long, however they may be over-borne for a while, will either become ſome of the brighteſt Jewels in the Diadem of England, or preſent Crowns of Thorns to her Monarchs ſucceſſively; and I am as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident the greateſt Emolument of each Party ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely requires the former. Theſe are now my deep-rooted Sentiments; and ſhould the Opinion and Arguments of a Cottager, be ever ſo loftily deſpiſed by Proprietors of Palaces, yet Time will ſurely determine, whether lordly Curtailors of our Rights, or prudent and loyal Remonſtrants againſt them, are truly political and ſound Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth's Men.</p>
               <p>We are bravely defended indeed againſt foreign
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011073_0065_0F854B4021726C78"/>
Uſurpers, but our Allegiance and Advantage to Great-Britain, loudly demands that Protection, and yet it may ſurely avail us but little, ſhould our open Colonies be plundred, by England, which has more Power to hurt us than any other State; and as a Conflagration may actually proceed from a ſmall Coal, or even a ſingle Spark of Fire, ſo may Bondage, a compleat Bondage, if not timely prevented, from much ſmaller initial Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than what we reſent. I appeal to Free Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Underſtanding, Generoſity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and let them nobly guard againſt Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, for though great Men are liable to very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Deceptions, while they lurk artfully under plauſible Favourite Pretenſions; yet, as I have Occaſionally obſerved, they cannot ignobly cleave to them when properly Unmaſked; and were but our moſt Strenuous Adverſaries over-borne Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, I fancy they would complain as warmly as any of us; for Men fond of lording it over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, can but poorly brook lordly Treatment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſhould not therefore ignobly extend it to their fellow Creatures, but uprightly and bravely control baſe Impulſes to it.</p>
               <p>A very Potent Nation may forcibly drive us into Slavery of one Kind or other, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not with the utmoſt Facility; but what Right hath England to demand our Allegiance, had we even no Grants at all from the Crown, without ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to us the Privileges of Britiſh Subjects? Are we not Legitimate Children, have we not hitherto been Dutiful, is not a conſtitutional Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony our juſt Due, and may our Parents with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tyranny deprive us of it, and cruelly drive us into Bondage, with the Scourges of Ambition or Avarice! Have I not ſhewn we are not Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Parliament at all, and can Engliſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be taxed juſtly by any but their own Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives?
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011073_0066_0F854B40E9F97BC0"/>
Should not Britiſh Subjects poſſeſs Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Rights; and is not Freedom our Right by the ſacred Law of Nature, as well as the Laws of our excellent Conſtitution? We certainly ought to be Free; and can we poſſibly be ſo, while our Intereſt is diſpoſed of by others without our Conſent, and repugnant to our Will; or even under any Kind of arbitrary Impoſitions or Prohibitions whatever? If this be Freedom what is Vaſſalage! I ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally to wiſe Britiſh Senators, to Men that have Power to oppreſs us, and perhaps to enſlave us a while, but ſhould nobly defend our ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Rights.</p>
               <p>The unaccountable Proceedings before us may be ſomewhat palliated, but nothing can poſſibly juſtify them; for let us even ſuppoſe the national Debt, the Expence of the late War, the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of ſome wrangling Colonies in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent looſe Condition, and other Conſiderations of Conſequence, might naturally throw the Parliament into great Agitations about us, when its Spirits were much elated by a glorious Peace; yet when all this is granted, what could poſſibly juſtify an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Impoſition, before a conſtitutional Demand had been made and perverſely rejected! Arbitrary Stretches never can be expedient in peaceable Times, void of Emergencies, ere prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional Meaſures have been utterly contemned; and of Courſe the Stamp-Act was very unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably carried into Force, admit ſuch deſpotical Exertions of Power were ſometimes neceſſary in very Alarming and dangerous Exigencies. Should our Superiors have had upright Intentions, they were very prematurely and raſhly executed; but if they ran haſtily after falſe Ideas into ſoothing Error, of a very awful Tendency, let them grant us Redreſs when their deadly Miſtake appears, and cautiouſly purſue a conſtitutional Juſtice for the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011073_0067_0F854B41AD6D5D30"/>
future through all their legiſlative Tranſactions. We can freely forgive true Penitents, but not be ſo willingly enſlaved by incorrigible Enemies.</p>
               <p>I know a ſcheming Miniſtry, and the Crown through it, are generally blamed for offenſive Laws, as if the Parliament could do no Wrong, or was quite above Cenſure; but whatever Reſpect may be intended by it, I think it but a very poor Compliment to the Lords and Commons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to be thus repreſented as mere Cyphers, or paſſive Figures at beſt, occaſionally uſed by a few great Officers of State, and have therefore treated them with a much greater Reſpect, as free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Agents in a very important Station, that are morally accountable to the Publick for their Conduct, and even much more ſo, than Men poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of but few Talents, a low Truſt, and a ſmall Influence can poſſibly be. I cannot view or treat ſuch great Men as meer inanimate Tools, taken up and uſed at Pleaſure by State Artificers, for thus our famous Parliament would only be a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Shew, a fictitious Good, or a meer idolized Name, and even have leſs Power than impotent French Parliaments, while Britiſh Miniſters had more than the Miniſtry of France. I very much eſteem a good Miniſtry, and hate the Proceedings of a bad one, but cannot think the Security of our rights leans upon the former, nor that the latter can rend them forcibly from us, or compel the Parliament to do it.</p>
               <p>A young Britiſh Monarch, indeed, in the Caſe before us, muſt have been under the darkning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſtrong Deſires to increaſe the Revenue, to concur with a Money-granting Parliament, and to gratify his importunate ſurrounding Subjects, that were artfully prejudiced againſt us by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Councils of the Nation; and as the greateſt young Princes, ere much Experience
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011073_0068_0F854B426F87D8C0"/>
waits upon them, muſt often rely on the Advice of others, they may receive falſe Ideas from the plauſible Arguments of private Counſellors; but a Majority of Engliſh Lords and Commons cannot poſſibly have ſuch Palliations in their Favour, for they ſhould have guarded our Rights againſt the natural Bias of the Crown; and many of them are poſſeſſed of much Experience, as well as a great natual Capacity and liberal Education.</p>
               <p>Theſe Truths are even quite inconteſtable; nor is it leſs indiſputable, that the injurious Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſuch great Men, may be as juſtly exploded, as their Praiſe-worthy Tanſactions can be gratefully lauded. This ſhould not only be acknowledged by the greateſt cenſured Reader, but our ſpiritual Lords ſhould even confeſs it in a very examplary Manner, and not treat me for ſuch occaſional Freedom, as haughty Jewiſh Doctors treated ſhe poor, ſorrowful, unlearned, and freely reproving Author of Chriſtianity, for boldly promulgating that ſacred Truth they pretend to defend; nor yet as Papiſts treated inveighing Proteſtant Reformers; for great Profeſſions can no more juſtify the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Proceedings of dignified Proteſtants now, than they juſtified the Crimes of Jewiſh and Popiſh Rabbins formerly.</p>
               <p>As we are grieved by a parliamentary Diſpotiſm, we ſhould doubtleſs remonſtrate directly againſt its injurious Supporters, how great ſoever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and not content ourſelves with branding the Conduct of an unjuſt Miniſter; for had not Mr. Granville many powerful Confederates, and was there but one over-bearing Mortal in England, he might inceſſantly plot againſt us in vain: And why ſhould we flatter the Vanity of ſuch an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enemy, by falſly attributing our Grievances to his Influence? His greateſt Efforts could not have hurt us, and he might have racked his Brains
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011073_0069_0F854B432CB3A250"/>
to no Purpoſe, had not Engliſh Senators been pleaſed with his miſchievous Devices, and we could hardly treat the Britiſh Legiſlature more affrontive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or with a greater Indignity, than by petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to direct it to repeal the Stamp-Act; and yet he has certainly as much Authority over it in that Reſpect as he had when it came into Force againſt us, which may ſhew the great Irregularity of our common Declamations. Let our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints be directed into a proper Channel, for it is not a lordly Impotence, but the King, Lords and Commons of the Realm, that may drive our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed Colonies farther into Thraldom, or reſtore and protect our Freedom. A bad Miniſtry might project our preſent Grievances, but could not drive us authoritatively into them; and when the Excitements of Injurious Miniſters can juſtify par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Oppreſſion, the Inſtigations of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, of other artfully wicked Impoſtors, or even an impulſive Depravity itſelf, may juſtify all Kinds of Offences, and permit Immorality, Anarchy and Ruin to rage inculpably throughout the great Common-wealth of Mankind.</p>
               <p>This explicit Reaſoning may be called abuſive by incorrigible Delinquents, but it is ſurely very far from being ſo; and a moral Deformity ſhould be occaſionally expoſed, when a natural one is compaſſionately covered, for that is a proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Diſgrace, and this of Pity; and when the former is rendered deteſtable, it may inſtantly be exchanged for Beauty, but the latter cannot be ſo advantageouſly bartered away. My Expreſſions are very open on this provoking Occaſion, and yet I would not wilfully offend any of my Superiors, nor even the leaſt or worſt of the human Race; but as I treat indirect Proceedings and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors very freely, I expect my Obſervations will diſpleaſe many in this paſſionate Age, but that is
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011073_0070_0F854B43F4D200D0"/>
far from being their real Intent, and I think they ſhould produce much nobler Effects.</p>
               <p>I have only been expediently open according to my own Conceptions, and all my Freedom is doubtleſs very juſtifiable, however it may be taken, if it has but ſufficient argumentative Sanctions, as well as Truth to ſupport it; and as certainly blameable if it has them not, how juſt ſoever it may be in itſelf. Men view their pernicious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct very partially whenever they do wrong through Miſtake or Deſign, and therefore reproving Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould not only have a juſt Foundation, but have its ſolid Baſis rendered apparent, elſe a greater or leſſer Degree of Reſentment inſtead of proper Convictions, and the moral Fruit of them will probably and almoſt certainly repay it.</p>
               <p>Even very generous Unbelivers of a moral Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition will be excited to curſe rather than bleſs our ardent Divines, when ſuch illuminated Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies with a burning Zeal, angry Brow, glowing Cheeks, a prieſtly Authority, and great Anxiety for their Welfare, threaten Damnation for ſlighting a very Sanctimonious prieſtly Jargon about our holy Sacraments, Grace, Election, Faith, Works, Law, Goſpel, Jews, Gentiles, Adam, Chriſt Man's Fall, our Impotence through it, Original Sin, imputed Righteouſneſs, Juſtification, Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and Satisfaction through the Blood, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Merits of the Meſſiah; for however ſacred ſuch Articles of Faith may be, yet what underſtanding Creature will cordially brook Threats of Ruin, or even but a ſtern Reproof itſelf, for diſbelieving them, before he can ſee how they may be rationally aſſented to, and conſcientiouſly honoured? I ſhall not Blaſheme ſuch Doctrines deiſtically, and thus offend their ſanctified Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, however I may doubt their Divinity ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for I know they are the very Quinteſſence
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:011073_0071_0F854B44B5719848"/>
of Proteſtantiſim, after all the Refinements of our boaſted Reformation; but my preſent Purpoſe enjoins me to ſay, they are only honoured by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Guides and implicit Belivers, as no other Perſon is able to view their Reaſonableneſs.</p>
               <p>According to my Ideas, trying Symbols and Figures muſt ever attend on a State of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, but can by no Means conceive how true Teachers can found Doctrines upon them, utterly repugnant to all the Plain Laws of God, and the Dictates of his Monitor in Probationers, and how wiſe moral Agents can piouſly aſſent to ſuch Tenets or be damned for the contrary. I think alſo Bible Figures will be ſoon defined, according to the Law of a reaſonable Faith; and that pure mortifying Documents will not be duly revered, while the moſt ſacred Prieſtly Abſurdities are ever ſo devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mixed with them; nor can I even ſee the very Foundation of a modern Orthodoxy, or how the Meſſiah could bear the Sins of the World atoningly; but can eaſily conceive how that juſt and gallant Youth might ſuffer for the unjuſt, as a Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victing Precedent, and noble Pattern of invincible Purity. I cannot ſee how our Creator can poſſibly require or accept ſuch Satisfaction; and ſhould I even believe both undoubtedly, I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Propriety in ſuch Doctrine, or how the Sufferings of one Man could make adequate Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Sins of all Mankind; and I ſuppoſe our Advocates for ſuch a Propitiation, even the moſt extravagant of them, will hardly ſay the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature ſuffered. The Code of Probation is tryingly vailed, and letter Teachers, Antichriſtian Apoſtles, may very piouſly wreſt its ſacred Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, but never expound them according to the Law of a vital Faith.</p>
               <p>Open ſcriptural Ethicks unanimouſly require a legal Submiſſion, correſpondent to the Law of my
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:011073_0072_0F854B456CD60700"/>
Conſcience, and my Ideas of God's moral Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; ſo what counter Doctrine even from an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel may reaſonably induce me to think otherwiſe, and to lay the Streſs of Salvation upon any other Thing. Can I rationally honour ſuch Lectures, whenever ſo confidently preached by the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſaintiſh Babblers, brim full of an Antichriſtian Orthodoxy; and not only much inſpired with Latin and Greek, but greatly illuminated alſo by a pious Conceit or Enthuſiaſm, and a very hallowed Bigotry, or even by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury himſelf, under the moſt awful Pontifical Sanctions, after his Grace, as a Proteſtant Doctor, has enjoined me to read and honour our plain Bible Statutes? A true Anſwer to ſuch Queſtions, may not be very favourable to the beſt eſtabliſhed Religion upon Earth, or its moſt celebrated Guardians; and were prieſtly Myſteries ever ſo divine, yet while I deem them to be impious, I can neither ſincerely honour them, nor Threats or Cenſure for contemning them, for no Perſon can ſincerely honour Offenſive Reproof or Threatnings but what he conceives ought to be revered.</p>
               <p>I hope my Freedom will be approved by every impartial Reader that weighs my Reaſonings; but ſhould all my free Expreſſions ſtand naked, perhaps not only the moſt generous Lords and Commons I have preſumed to cenſure, but all the reſt of my wiſeſt Readers, would even bluſh at them, as ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Invectives, full of Turpitude, and yet in that Condition, like a modeſt naked Woman, they would even be as chaſte as they are now, when abundantly cloathed with good ruſtick Arguments, which ſhews the juſteſt Reproof ſhould be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently dreſſed, and never make its Appearance without documental Garments.</p>
               <p>We frequently hear Damnation authoritatively denounced from the Pulpit, for a perſevering Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:011073_0073_0F854B462F8C8410"/>
of myſtical prieſtly Dogma's, which ſeem very feaſible to implicit Believers, but even quite abſurd to conſiderate Perſons of Underſtanding; and a good Man may indeed reprove freely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adequately ſhewing his Reaſons, upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition the culpable Party fully knows them; but let me tell our moſt famous cenſuring Divines, as well as their Hearers, yea even thoſe adorned with Mitres themſelves, that no truly wiſe Man can proceed ſo imprudently, for let his own Ideas of any Offence be ever ſo juſt, and his Charges ever ſo uprightly adapted to them, yet the latter, inſtead of giving proper Convictions, will more or leſs offend the cenſured Perſon, while their Reality, or even Fitneſs, is concealed from his View. Theſe Concluſions are evidently juſt, and ſhould I have been guilty of ſuch common Errors, I might keep myſelf in Countenance, by pointing out ſimilar Miſtakes in many famous Writers, but that would not change the Nature of my own, ſo Reparation of Courſe ſhould be made for them, when reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably demanded by proper Exhibitions; but not ſuch Reparation as perverſe Carpers may call for.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not abuſe the meaneſt of my fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor cringe to the greateſt unconſcientiouſly; and as infectious Weeds grow rankeſt in a rich Soil, I have faithfully endeavoured to expel a very poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Deluſion many Britiſh Lords and Commons have fondly imbibed; and however offenſive my ſtrong Antidote may be, yet I think it is but an adequate Remedy, judiciouſly and uprightly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, and that I ſhould not therefore aſk Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the greateſt Peer in England, nor even of King <hi>George</hi> himſelf, before I can ſee a moral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. I know very little Creatures, puffed up with Pride, Flattery, Affluence, Succeſs, or even but a falſe Peace itſelf, while the contrary waits on their much greater Reprehenders, will proudly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:011073_0074_0F854B46E41BE198"/>
juſt Reproof, very prudently extended, and even demand Satisfaction for it with a lofty Brow; but ſurely the greateſt Monarchs, rather than God's inherent Monitor, ſhould ever be diſpleaſed by moral Agents let the temporal Conſequence be ever ſo grievous.</p>
               <p>I may incur the Diſpleaſure of haughty Mortals, but not of really great Men, if Truth, Decency, and clear Reaſoning always accompany my Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and nominally great Men, without eſſential Greatneſs, are not only proper Objects of ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd Freedom as mine, but even of the keeneſt decent Satyr can reach them; for indirect Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are much more hurtful and blameable in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Noblemen, Philoſophers, and Divines, than they can poſſibly be in uncultivated Peaſants, of a trifling Judgment and Influence. A common Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or to ſpeak more properly, a Perſon that might really be one, may even deſerve a ſevere moral Cenſure, for what a Dunce ſhould be pitied; and when nominally great Men proceed indirectly, they ſhould ever be more keenly reprehended than the Vulgar, but in a very different Manner, for as the latter have very groſs Perceptions, as well as rude Paſſions, they muſt often be very roughly treated, and even filled with intimidating Terror, ere they ſufficiently view an offenſive Picture of their Conduct, or properly attend to the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniton; and the former ſhould be occaſionally moved in a gentler or ſharper Method, by the fair Dint of Reaſon alone. Plain Dealing alſo is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary on this Occaſion, for when great Men ramble fondly after Prejudice, they hate to think they are going aſtray, and blindly gadding after a ſoothing Deluſion; ſo rarely return from ſuch favourite Wanderings, before they and their evil Tendency are explicitly diſcloſed. After Men of Ability wed gratifying Error, they are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:011073_0075_0F854B47A56D96B8"/>
to be divorced from it, or to think it even capable of jilting them, as ſome of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Readers, and even perhaps ſome of our Prelates themſelves, may too ſhortly and evidently evince.</p>
               <p>According to theſe Ideas, I have endeavoured to place the Subject in a true Light, ſo far as I have handled it, and to give our Superiors ſuch open Conviction, through very explicit Arguments, as may reaſonably excite them to redreſs our Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and abhor ſuch Abuſes of Power for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but would not deſignedly offend one of them by my very freeſt Expreſſions, which I think only repreſent Matters juſtly, and even for ſo laudable a Purpoſe, as that of re-uniting Great-Britain and her much diſturbed Colonies, in the ſacred Bands of a perpetual Amity; nor will any Perſon decry my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitneſs, that would have duly honoured a leſs Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play. By ſuitable Reaſonings, I may argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively influence the Parliament, according to our ardent Deſire, but could not poſſibly bully it into Compliance, ſhould I even ſtupidly attempt it; and we ſhould not wilfully exaſperate it againſt us. The greateſt moral Agents ſhould honour Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they have rendered neceſſary, and no truly great Man can ever reſent Plain Dealing, which the great Part of his own Nature cannot explode. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as frail Probationers, your wiſe and rigidly chaſte Virgins, which diſdain to gratify licentious Paſſions, and nobly controul each impure Excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may have the ſame natural Deſire, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers meanly follow to the vileſt Proſtitution, and the greateſt Men may feel irregular Emotions, in very uncommon Trials, but cannot ignobly give them an injurious Vent.</p>
               <p>I have wandered ſurpriſingly from the Tract of learned Writers, and have therefore had Recourſe to apologiſing Obſervations, which, I think, may reaſonably prevent miſchievous Conſtructions; and

ſurely the pertinent Freedom of this little ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant Pamphlet ſhould not only be freely excuſed, but even greatly approved, by every Reader of Judgment, and I hope no generous Britiſh Senator can poſſibly reſent it, but deem it expedient and ſuitable to the Occaſion.</p>
               <p>The Subject is ſurely a very great one, and not beneath the ſerious Attention of the greateſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Peer, nor even of Ceſar himſelf, when placed on his auguſt Throne, with a glorious Crown upon his Head, and all his princely Nobles about him; nor ſhould my Obſervations upon it, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ones, be utterly contemned by any of them. I have endeavoured to mix Loyalty, Patriotiſm, and expediently free Reaſonings properly together, and ſhould not have been ſo explicit, had leſs Plaineſs ſeemed adequate to my great Purpoſe, and ſufficient to raiſe neceſſary Convictions, in Spite of a reluctant Prejudice. Nor can I be juſtly obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Cenſure, for interſperſing Religious Hints with political Arguments, while our Divines have a Share in the Britiſh Legiſlature, for that Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment greatly countenances ſuch a Mixture.</p>
               <p>My Balls fly not generally at the baſe Deſigns of a Single Mr. Grenville, but of a menacing Evil of a much higher Nature, for I had much rather ſlay a Parliamentary Deſpotiſm, than ſpend my Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition againſt the Malevolence of an impotent Swaggerer. I would not hang or burn him in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figy, as the potent Oppreſſor of our Colonies, nor take his Life as an impenitent Offender, but ſpare the haughty Criminal Time for Repentance, though perhaps to no Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I cannot always honour old Maxims, for ſome of them are but very poor Ones; and I think new Ones, awfully ſuperior, will ſoon be uſhered into a ſecure World, when it never leſs ſuſpected them, and even without the great Aſſiſtance of a Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick,

a prieſtly Illumination, or a ſcholaſtick Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency, and not only from a Perſon very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to ſpread them, but alſo from a Place the the moſt unlikely to produce them, according to the Ideas of earthly Gods. Theſe are my deep rooted Conceptions, and I know not how they may fare abroad, but have Reaſon to fear many Sages will treat them as idle ſanatical Notions; for my underſtanding Neighbours have long contemned them, and me for adhering blindly to ſuch Whims, as Men of too profound Judgment to mind either; and as I could not drive their powerful Contempt away, I ſeemed generally to be inſenſible of it, as a Perſon having Ears that could not hear, and Eyes that could not ſee, but ſecretly cheriſhed my Sort of Vanity, according to the Cuſtom of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Bigots, and never thought them altogether ſo wiſe, nor myſelf quite ſo fooliſh as their Words and Behaviour denoted. They or I have wandered ſtrangely, and perhaps theſe Lines may ſhew ſome of my Readers which Party has blindly and proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roamed.</p>
               <p>My Arguments now draw near a Concluſion, and I think every Member of our high Court of Parliament, by condeſcending to weigh them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberately, may clearly view the Irregularity of the Stamp-Tax, and the ſhocking Tendency of any Sort of arbitrary Proceedings, even in many important Reſpects, and that loyal Americans cannot be taxed at Home, under any Pretence whatever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a manifeſt Outrage againſt their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Rights. The idle Pretence of our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Parliament, the fictitious Right foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon it, and the wretched Policy which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for them, muſt now appear utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible to all that will view their naked Deformity, as far as it is faithfully exhibited by this Picture; and yet it cannot even be coulourably diſputed, but
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011073_0078_0F854B4AA643E600"/>
the Crown ſhould have its reaſonable Demands oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally granted, as ſoon at leaſt as our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates can do it on a regular Plan, which no doubt is a Matter of very great Conſequence, that ſhould be maturely conſidered and timely effected. Were but our numerous Colonies wiſely united, for that very momentous Purpoſe, their own American Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, extracted from Provincial Aſſemblies, might conſtitutionally weigh his Majeſty's Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, when occaſionally convened, and dutifully honour all his reaſonable Demands, without arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Impoſitions, partial Exemptions, or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Burdens.</p>
               <p>Thus publick Evils might nor only be regularly prevented, but a great Utility as cordially advanced throughout all the dangerous and favourable Viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of perpetual Ages, according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Dictates of a conſtitutional Policy; for as I have formerly ſhewn, every valuable Occupation in our extenſive Empire, has a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Voters, and while all them various Callings are duly favoured by wiſe and faithful Delegates, every Member of each Vocation which cannot elect them, is virtually repreſented and befriended, and ſhould conſequently be taxed by them, for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Support of a publick Welfare, which promotes his own private Benefits, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them ſecure. Upon ſuch a wholeſome Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, good Monarchs, and faithful Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of loyal Subjects, might not only proceed very harmoniouſly, but lay each other under mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obligations of a ſovereign Nature, and always promote a publick Weal by the moſt natural Kind of moral Policy: And ſhould Britiſh Lords and Commons yet lay Impoſitions upon us, and thus render the Grants of the Crown deſpicable, under a Pretence of advancing the royal Prerogative, I know no legiſlative Veſtments they can now tax us

under, as their fine parliamentary Cloak of a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Repreſentation is even irreparably rended in Pieces. The Power of an Engliſh Legiſlature may ſoon oppreſs us, and perhaps drive us into Bondage at Length, but a conſtitutional Juſtice cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe it to tax us, nor true Policy lead it to any Kind of arbitrary Proceedings, as my unlearned Pen has briefly demonſtrated, and might much more illuſtrate by expatiating greatly; ſo well may learned ones render it conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>I have now cloſed my open Obſervations on this important Subject, and I hope every judicious Reader of Candour will approve them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my ſoaring Freedom and Cenſure; for trifling will not do on ſuch alarming Emergencies. Our Freedom is not only much wounded already, by a potent Ambition, but is even in great Danger of being intirely murdered by it, unleſs adequate Efforts prevent its threatned Deſtruction; and I have not only provided many valuable Materials for a ſtrong Fortreſs to defend it, but have alſo digged deep, cleared away the Rubbiſh, and laid its Foundation ſurely on a very commanding Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence: So let proper Artiſts ſpeedily and formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably finiſh it, even according to the beſt Laws of Fortification.</p>
