            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>THAT portion of Scripture which ≈øhall lead our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while we mo≈øt ≈øen≈øibly participate in the general ≈øorrow of our afflicted country, and pay our mournful tribute of re≈øpect to the departed Hero and Father of the American States, is written in the <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>LXXXII PSALM, 6 and 7th ver≈øes.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>I have ≈øaid, Ye are Gods: and all of you are children of the Mo≈øt High. But ye ≈øhall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HOWEVER bright the ≈øun may ri≈øe, however u≈øeful and cheering he may be in his meridian cour≈øe, yet, at the appointed hour, he will mo≈øt certainly ≈øet. His cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light and genial influence will be withdrawn. In like manner men of the greate≈øt eminence, the mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhed by genius, by mental improvement, by exalted ≈øtations and public u≈øefulne≈øs, to whatever degree they have illuminated, gladdened and benefited the ≈øeveral ages and nations in which they have flouri≈øhed, after a ≈øhort and precarious day, have ≈øet in the midnight gloom of death. Their u≈øefulne≈øs has ≈øoon terminated, and they lie in the dark regions of the dead. Short is the whole term from the morning of life to the ≈øad evening of death. The author of our nature has made our days as an hand breadth and our age as nothing before him. The term of public life and u≈øefulne≈øs is ≈øtill much ≈øhorter. How ≈øoon is the arm, which, with manly vigor ≈øwayed the ≈øceptre, wielded the ≈øword of ju≈øtice and of war, enervated with years? How ≈øoon does the ≈øtronge≈øt memory fail and the greate≈øt mental powers decline with age? Nay, how often are men of the mo≈øt di≈øtingui≈øhed characters arre≈øted by the hand of death, before the approach of old age? In the glory of life, in the mid≈øt of u≈øefulne≈øs they vani≈øh, like the vapor, and appear no more. They die ≈øuddenly, die in every period of life and u≈øefulne≈øs, and by all the di≈øea≈øes, ca≈øualities and misfortunes by which other men die. They exhibit to the world the mo≈øt melancholy and ≈øtriking evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>That every man at his be≈øt ≈øtate is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF this it is the de≈øign of the text to admoni≈øh all men, and e≈øpecially all the great and honorable among them: That notwith≈øtanding the importance and elevation of their character they are mortal. The text indeed concedes, that ≈øome men are highly exalted above others. Magi≈øtrates are called by the awful name of Gods, and all of them children
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038679_0006_1012AF9AC29A7160"/>
of the MOST HIGH, on the account of their office; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with which they are inve≈øted, the work to which they are appointed, and the maje≈øty which GOD hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> put upon them. But to check human vanity, make them better men, and more exten≈øively u≈øeful, he who maketh them Gods, affirms al≈øo, That they ≈øhall die like men. His words not only a≈ø≈øert their mortality, but imply the great importance and utility of their knowledge of it, and of their frequently and ≈øeriou≈øly contemplating upon it, and on their re≈øpon≈øibility to a tribunal higher than their own.</p>
            <p>IT will therefore be natural in further di≈øcour≈øing on the ≈øubject <list>
                  <item>I. TO ≈øhow the maje≈øty of civil rulers: or that GOD high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalts ≈øome men in genius, dignity and u≈øefulne≈øs above others.</item>
                  <item>II. THAT however highly they may be exalted in office, or in any other re≈øpects above other men, they are equally with them ≈øubject to mortality and all its con≈øequences.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to ≈øhow the maje≈øty of civil rulers: or that GOD highly exalts ≈øome men in genius, dignity and u≈øefulne≈øs above others.</p>
            <p>THE SUPREME MAJESTY, in the text and context, expre≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terms the kings, magi≈øtrates and rulers of I≈ørael, Gods. This, of all names, is the mo≈øt high, venerable and glorious. When given by GOD him≈øelf, it mu≈øt be with great proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; importing the high exaltation, maje≈øty and importance of magi≈øtrates and civil government: That they are in≈øtituted by him, and bear a re≈øemblance of his glorious maje≈øty.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government, however different, in different times and countries, is of GOD. He expre≈øsly appointed it among his own people. It was his expre≈øs command, <hi>Judges and officers ≈øhalt thou make thee in all thy gates</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Deut. xvi.18.</note>. The divine gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is univer≈øal. HE <hi>hath prepared his throne in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and his kingdom ruleth over all</hi>
               <note n="¬ß" place="bottom">P≈øalm, ciii.19.</note>. All other rulers are of GOD, as well as tho≈øe of his own peculiar people. Hence that remarkable pa≈ø≈øage, <hi>By me kings reign, and princes decree ju≈øtice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Prov. viii.15, 16.</note>. The apo≈øtle Paul expre≈øsly affirms, <hi>The powers that be are ordained of</hi> GOD. <hi>And there is no power but of</hi> GOD <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.1, 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038679_0007_1012AF9C51AE9898"/>CIVIL government is founded in rea≈øon. It originates in the divine philanthropy; and has its foundation in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care, ju≈øtice and goodne≈øs of the common parent of all his creatures. It is de≈øigned to be a re≈øemblance of him in the righteou≈øne≈øs and purity of his laws and admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When it is good, it bears a glorious re≈øemblance of him, and is one of the greate≈øt ble≈ø≈øings enjoyed by man. As mankind are, this is the grand ≈øecurity of life, limb, lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, property, dome≈øtic, public, civil and religious peace and order; and indeed of all the ble≈ø≈øings of ≈øocial life. This only defends us again≈øt violence, inju≈øtice, robbery, war, and death. Without it there could be no order, ≈øtrength, beauty, unity, or peace in ≈øociety. Nay, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øtrained lu≈øts and pa≈ø≈øions of men, like a mighty tornado or inundation would ≈øweep from the earth every thing which is plea≈øant and valuable to man.</p>
            <p>AS GOD hath in≈øtituted civil government, ≈øo men of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular genius and mental powers elevated to ≈øeats of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dominion are his mini≈øters, and, in their legi≈ølative and executive capacity, bear his image as the SUPREME RULER and JUDGE of the univer≈øe. They ≈øtand in his place, act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his authority, legi≈ølate and judge for him. They are his officers to ≈øuppre≈øs violence, fraud, di≈ø≈øipation and every wickedne≈øs which injures the public weal, and to maintain truth, order, righteou≈øne≈øs and peace in the earth. Hence it is written, <hi>Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in judgment</hi>
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">II. Chron. xix.6.</note>. The civil ruler mu≈øt imitate GOD in the integrity of his heart, in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs and purity of his law, and in the impartiality of his government. The divine throne is e≈øtabli≈øhed in righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs; <hi>ju≈øtice and judgment are the habitation of it.</hi> The divine law is perfect and pure.

They are law-givers to guard the life, property and liberties of the people; to defend, encourage and reward the righteous, to puni≈øh the wicked, to cut off the violent man, and evil doers from the earth. They are exalted to ≈øeats and thrones of judgment, to defend the poor, the fatherle≈øs and the widow: to do ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and judgment, and to e≈øtabli≈øh truth, and righteou≈øne≈øs, and peace in the earth. With the Lord, who≈øe re≈øemblance they bear, <hi>there is no iniquity, nor re≈øpect of per≈øons, nor taking of gifts</hi>
               <note n="¬ß" place="bottom">ver≈øe 7.</note>. It is therefore commanded with re≈øpect to them, <hi>Ye ≈øhall not re≈øpect per≈øons in judgment, but you ≈øhall hear the

            <p>CIVIL magi≈øtrates ≈øhould imitate the SUPREME RULER in his paternal care and goodne≈øs over his creatures, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈ø≈øion, and in the goodne≈øs of his government.

The ri≈øing ≈øun, in a clear morning, ≈øpreads an univer≈øal joy, and its clear ≈øhining after rain, has the mo≈øt exten≈øive and beneficial effects. So the influence of a good ruler extends its happy effects to every community, family and individual in a whole nation. It gives order, ≈øafety, peace and joy to all. In this view how amiable, dignified and glorious is the good ruler. In what an high and important ≈øen≈øe does he re≈øemble the MOST HIGH?

In this re≈øpect they might be called Gods: and every one of them children of the MOST HIGH. But in this view no rulers ≈øince the coming of CHRIST can be called by this high and reverend name. In the other view, however, they are a happy re≈øemblance of the DIVINE MAJESTY, and their character is mo≈øt venerable and u≈øeful. The more wi≈øe, righteous, patriotic and exten≈øively u≈øeful they are, the more happily they an≈øwer to the high and awful name by which they are characterized.

            <p>HE rai≈øes them up with all their ≈øuperior abilities natural or acquired; and by his providence exalts them to the ≈øever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ≈øtations in which he de≈øigns them to act, for the defence, peace and pro≈øperity of his kingdom.

            <p>THE natural and acquired abilities of men are exceedingly different. The di≈øparity between ≈øome men and others is, probably. nearly as great as between ≈øome angels and men.

For his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance he gave him captains and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals, <hi>who were men of war, fit for the battle, who could handle ≈øhield and buckler, who≈øe faces were as the faces of lions, and who were ≈øwift as the roes upon the mountains</hi>

            <p>WHEN GOD de≈øigned to deliver I≈ørael from their bondage in Egypt, and to form them into a di≈øtinct kingdom, he gave them Mo≈øes for a lawgiver and deliverer.

Such was the ≈øtrength and accuracy of his genius, the agreeablene≈øs of his manners, and his general acquaintance with men and things, that he began, in early life, to be noticed as a man of talents, and to be introduced to public bu≈øine≈øs. In 1753, when he was about twenty-one years of age, he was ≈øent by the governor of Virginia <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Lieutenant governor Dinwiddie. Wa≈øhington at that period ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the rank of a major, and yet he took his provi≈øions on his back, and travelled four hundred miles with a ≈øingle companion.

The next year he was made a lieutenant-colonel, and commanded a regiment of Virginians. In 1755, he went an extra aid-de-camp with general Braddock.

The ≈øupreme authority of Virginia was ≈øo deeply impre≈ø≈øed with a ≈øen≈øe of his worth and military talents, that he was made adjutant-general of all the troops rai≈øed, and to be rai≈øed in Virginia. In 1758, he commanded the van-brigade, in the army of general Forbes, in the ≈øucce≈øsful expedition again≈øt fort Du Que≈øne. From about the year 1760 to the commencement of the di≈øpute with Great-Britain, he was elected a member of the general a≈ø≈øembly in Virginia, was a magi≈øtrate, and a judge of the court of the county of Fairfax, in which he re≈øided. In 1774, he was elected member to the fir≈øt congre≈øs. He was elected al≈øo member of the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in 1775, in which on the 15th of June he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commander in chief of the armies of the united colonies. This arduous command he accepted at a time of great peril to America; and during eight ≈øucce≈ø≈øive campaigns, ≈øubjected him≈øelf to the hard≈øhips of a ≈øoldier, jeoparding his life in the high places, for the defence of the liberties, lives and property of his fellow-citizens, and to ≈øecure the peace, ≈øafety and pro≈øperity of his country.</p>
            <p>WHEN he took the command, the Americans had not a regular regiment nor fortre≈øs, nor did they po≈ø≈øe≈øs an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ≈øhip. They were almo≈øt without arms, artillery, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and other means of defence. The colonies were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by ≈øea and land, by the mo≈øt formidable force that ever invaded a young country. He was called to act again≈øt the be≈øt generals and troops which Europe could boa≈øt. They had gathered laurels in Europe and America, in Flanders, at Loui≈øburg, and on the plains of Abraham. They were furni≈øhed with the be≈øt arms, and the fine≈øt train of artillery, ≈øerved by the be≈øt engineers which Great-Britain or Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could produce. A great part of his army, until nearly the clo≈øe of the war, con≈øi≈øted of militia and troops who were only temporary; and he had often to di≈øband one army and form another in the very face of the enemy. Yet he made a ≈øurpri≈øing defence. He was never once ≈øurprized, never lo≈øt an army, nor ≈øuffered any con≈øiderable defeat.

yet he finally baffled all their arts, totally defeated their de≈øigns, and, under the ≈øuperintendance of a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, rai≈øed the United States to independence, peace, and glory.</p>
            <p>DURING his command, he exhibited ≈øtriking demon≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an uncommon genius, a ≈øingular knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the mo≈øt ma≈øterly ≈øtrokes of general≈øhip.</p>
            <p>WHEN he arrived before Bo≈øton, he found it inve≈øted with a half armed and undi≈øciplined multitude, ha≈øtily drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from their fields and ≈øhops, the greater part of whom, though a bold and virtuous yeomanry, had never before ≈øeen a campaign, nor the forming of a ≈øingle regiment. In New England, he had made no connexions, and was ≈øcarcely known. To its legi≈ølatures, to its men of principal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the officers and troops, who compo≈øed his army, he was an entire ≈øtranger. Yet he was able, of this chaotic ma≈øs, to form an army, introduce ≈øy≈øtem, obedience, di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and bravery. He at once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed him≈øelf of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and confidence of his officers and of the whole army. Equally did he po≈ø≈øe≈øs him≈øelf of the e≈øteem of all the New-England patriots and colonies; and was able to point their whole force to the object of his wi≈øhes. Though he had not only an army to harmonize, before a numerous enemy of veterans, but, for a time, almo≈øt to create the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">When general Wa≈øhington arrived at head quarters at Cambridge, the army had neither tents, nor commi≈ø≈øaries, nor any regular ≈øupplies of provi≈øions. They had neither engineers capable of planning regular works, nor tools to erect them. They had no proper train of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their arms were very defective, and numbers had none at all. With re≈øpect to ammunition, they were ≈øtill more deficient. On the 4th of Augu≈øt it was found that the whole ≈øtock of powder in the four New-England colonies, was little more than ≈øufficient to furni≈øh nine rounds for each man, then inve≈øting the town. After every exertion which could be made, as late as February 1776, there were 2,000 troops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms. Enterpri≈øing and high ≈øpirited officers, with their adherents, had pu≈øhed forward to the camp, without regard to rank, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Congre≈øs, or their re≈øpective colonies. To a≈ø≈øign to them the ≈øtation which their rank and ≈øervices required, and much le≈øs to which their vanity a≈øpired, and to introduce ≈øubordination and di≈øcipline among freemen, was a ta≈øk too great for any man but a Wa≈øhington.

a con≈øtant ≈øtate of ≈øiege and alarm; and at length, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all their force and vigilance, to take ≈øuch po≈øitions as to oblige them, to ≈øave their fleet and army, to evacuate the town and port of Bo≈øton<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">The troops in Bo≈øton con≈øi≈øted of between ≈øeven and eight thou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. They were aided by two floating batteries and 150 ≈øhips of war and tran≈øports. To confine them within their limits the general was obliged to form lines of about ten miles in circumference. His army when mo≈øt numerous con≈øi≈øted of no more than 14,500 men; but at the clo≈øe of the year, while the old army was di≈øbanding, and a new one forming, it amounted only to 9650. Yet his arrangements were ≈øo judicious, that the enemy never made a ≈øingle attempt upon his lines. With a view to drive the ho≈øtile army from Bo≈øton, the general was reinforced with 7,000 militia; at which time he found him≈øelf at the head of 17,000 effective men. But he was greatly embarra≈ø≈øed for want of ammunition and military ≈øtores ≈øufficient for ≈øuch an attempt. However, on the night of the 4th of March 1776, he ordered a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under general Thomas to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Dorche≈øter heights. The van was compo≈øed of a covering party of 800 men. To the≈øe ≈øucceed 1200 fatigue men with carts carrying on their entrenching tools. In the rear was a train of more than 200 carts loaded with fa≈øcines and bundles of hay. Here every thing was conducted with the profounde≈øt ≈øilence, while the attention of the enemy was drawn to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other quarter, by a bri≈øk bombardment and cannonade: and ≈øuch were the preparations and di≈øpo≈øitions made by the general, that by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light the provincials had completed ≈øuch lines of defence, as a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni≈øhed the enemy. General Howe in particular, in con≈øternation, was heard to exclaim, "I know not what I ≈øhall do; the rebels have done more in one night, than my whole army could have done in months." By taking this po≈øition the general had ≈øuch command of the harbor and town, that the enemy determined on an immediate evacuation of Bo≈øton.</note>.</p>
            <p>HIS army afterwards con≈øi≈øted of the troops of thirteen different ≈øtates, different in education, manners views and intere≈øts, of troops from Canada and France, of different nations and languages, yet he ≈øhared deeply in the e≈øteem and confidence of the whole. How did he harmonize the armies of the United States?‚ÄîThe fleets and armies of France and America? In the darke≈øt periods of the war, and through the whole of it, how perfectly did he enjoy the

affections and confidence of the army, of Congre≈øs, and of every ≈øtate in the union? Indeed he had ≈øuch command of the hearts of men, that his troops would abide with him in cold, hunger, nakedne≈øs and in all hard≈øhips and dangers.</p>
            <p>HIS retreat from Long I≈øland, in 1776, was ≈øuch a ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpiece of general≈øhip as is rarely exhibited in the hi≈øtory of man. In one ≈øhort night, in the face of a ≈øuperior ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he brought off about nine thou≈øand men, without the lo≈øs of a ≈øingle company. His retreat from the I≈øland of New York, and through the Jer≈øies were exhibitions of the ≈øame great mind.</p>
            <p>THE manner of his recro≈ø≈øing the Delaware, the ≈øurpri≈øal and capture of the He≈ø≈øians at Trenton, the march which he ≈øtole upon Cornwallis, and the defeat of the Briti≈øh troops at Princeton, were feats of greater brilliancy, and far more important and glorious in their con≈øequences. The affairs of the union were now at their lowe≈øt ebb. The political pul≈øe was almo≈øt gone; but the≈øe unexpected and ≈øurprizing movements and victories, ≈ønatched us from the jaws of death, rekindled the vital ≈øpark, and diffu≈øed life and joy through all America<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>All the American fortre≈ø≈øes had now fallen before the enemy; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Wa≈øhington had been hotly pur≈øued through New Jer≈øey acro≈øs the Delaware into Penn≈øylvania. His army was nearly annihilated, and the remains of it were in a manner unclothed and un≈øhod. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was in a ≈øtate of deep de≈øpondency, and many were going over to the enemy and ≈øubmitting to Lord Howe. In this cri≈øis general Wa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, on Chri≈øtmas evening, made di≈øpo≈øitions for cro≈ø≈øing the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in three divi≈øions, with a view to attack the enemy's po≈øts in ≈øo many different places. The night was dark and ≈øevere; the ≈øtorm roared, the hail de≈øcended, and the Delaware rolled down in currents of ice; but he cro≈ø≈øed with 2400 men to the ho≈øtile ≈øhore, and after a march of nine miles ju≈øt at the dawn of the morning, December 26, ≈øurpri≈øed the He≈ø≈øian po≈øt at Trenton. About forty of the enemy were killed or wounded, twenty three officers, 886 privates were made pri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Col Rall, who commanded the po≈øt, was ≈ølain. The ≈øame day the general cro≈ø≈øed the river into Penn≈øylvania. Two of the Americans were killed, two were frozen to death, and ≈øix or ≈øeven were wounded. The general having ≈øecured his pri≈øoners, on the 2d of Jaunuary 1777, again cro≈ø≈øed the Delaware, and took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Trenton. His army con≈øi≈øted of about 5000 men, of whom 1800 were continentals, who≈øe time of enli≈øtment was now expired, their clothing was no ways ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ≈øea≈øon, and they were worn down with ≈øervices. But, by the per≈øua≈øion of the general, they were induced to tarry ≈øix weeks longer. The others were raw militia men, brought into the field in the then pre≈øent emergency. By this time the royal army had been a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled at Princeton, and Lord Cornwallis at its head, was coming on, with great force, to repair the injury they had ≈øu≈øtained in their late defeat. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the enemy attacked an advanced po≈øt, which general Wa≈øhington had placed with four field pieces, a little north of the town. General Green was ≈øent forward with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to ≈øupport it; but the enemy were in ≈øuch force that it was with difficulty, that he made good his retreat. The American army was ha≈øtily formed behind Sanpink bridge and the creek of that name, which runs through the town. The general had a good train of field artillery, and a number of pieces were ≈øo placed as to concentrate their fire upon the bridge and the road leading to it. The enemy's grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pre≈ø≈øed on with great ≈øpirit to force the bridge. Their attack was ≈øo warm, and their fire ≈øo heavy, that the general was obliged to expo≈øe his per≈øon and u≈øe all his exertions to prevent his troops from giving way; but the fire of the field pieces and of the troops was ≈øo well directed that after three un≈øucce≈øsful attempts the enemy retired. The Americans kept their po≈øition until night, and both armies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a cannonade upon each other. The feeble American army was now in a mo≈øt critical ≈øituation. To retreat and pa≈øs the river in the face of ≈øuch an army was impracticable. Be≈øides, it would hazard the city of Philadelphia, and extingui≈øh every ray of hope which had begun to dawn in the late ≈øucce≈øs. To ri≈øk a general action with ≈øuch inferior force, would have been madne≈øs. The liberties of America, ≈øeemed, at this time, to be ≈øu≈øpended upon a mere thread. In this dilemma, general Wa≈øhington determined, by a circuitous march, to get into the rear of the enemy and attack Princeton. To deceive them he ordered the fires to be kept in full blaze until the morning. About midnight the whole army took up their line of march, and arriving near Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a little before day, fell in with Colonel Mawhood, at the head of his regiment, marching for Trenton. The Colonel was a gallant offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and commencing a clo≈øe fire upon the Americans and charging with bayonets, they gave way, and a general panic ≈øeemed to be ≈øpreading. At this critical moment, the American Fabius appeared with all the fire and boldne≈øs of Hannibal or the Scipios, encouraging his troops, interpo≈øing him≈øelf between the two armies not more than thirty yards di≈øtance from the enemy's front with the head of his hor≈øe toward them, while they di≈øcharged their pieces. The Americans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated by his example, returned the fire and encompa≈ø≈øed the Briti≈øh on every ≈øide; upon which the colonel, with what men he could, broke through and made his e≈øcape. While the general was engaged in this quarter, the re≈øt of the army engaged two other Briti≈øh regiments, who fled before them. Some of the enemy retired into the College and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to defend them≈øelves in that; but the Americans no ≈øooner began to fire upon them with their field pieces, than they ≈øurrendered. Sixty of the Briti≈øh were killed, many wounded, and three hundred taken pri≈øoners. General Wa≈øhington marched off in ≈øafety to Morri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. The Briti≈øh generals were filled with ≈øuch con≈øternation at the≈øe unexpected and brilliant movements, that they immediately evacuated Trenton and Princeton, and, in a few weeks, the whole ≈øtate of New-Jer≈øey, except Brun≈øwick and Amboy, to which the Briti≈øh were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, was completely recovered.</p>

One great thing nece≈ø≈øary to effect this was to amu≈øe the Briti≈øh generals with the idea that a formidable attack was to be made on New-York, until the Che≈øapeak ≈øhould be blocked up, and ≈øuch force concentrated in Virginia, as would be adequate to the reduction of Cornwallis.‚Äî For this purpo≈øe a plan was concerted for the meeting of governor Trumbull and his council at Danbury, in July or Augu≈øt, with a number of principal characters from other ≈øtates, to deliberate on mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures for taking New York. This was publicly given out, and great expectations were entertained from the meeting of ≈øuch a number of ≈øages. The patriots met at the time the general wi≈øhed, and all the wi≈øe heads were laid together, and plans devi≈øed in their united wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All thought they were a≈ø≈øi≈øting the general, and that he was about vigorou≈øly to pur≈øue the wi≈øe ≈øchemes which had been concerted. Requi≈øitions had been made on the New England ≈øtates of 6200 militia to fill up their re≈øpective quotas, to be ready within a week of the time for which they ≈øhould be called for. Flat bottomed boats ≈øufficient for the tran≈øportation of 5000 men had been brought down Hud≈øon's river to the vicinity of the American army. Count de Rochambeau, with the French army, had marched from Rhode I≈øland, and joined the American army. Ovens were erected oppo≈øite to Staten I≈øland, and appearances were made for the formation of a permanent camp in that quarter. About the ≈øame time a letter from general Wa≈øhington was pretended to be intercepted containing a plan of the de≈øigned oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations again≈øt New York. Such a combination of circum≈øtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the royal generals and the people in general to believe that the reduction of New York was the grand object. At the ≈øame time the general was marching his troops through the country to the Che≈øapeak. Governor Trumbull had hardly reached Hartford, in his return from the council at Danbury, before he received a letter from general Wa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, acquainting him, that the French fleet was arrived in the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øapeak, and that he was going to Virginia.</note>.</p>

and pre≈øided in the formation of our pre≈øent national con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, under which the United States have ari≈øen to ≈øuch re≈øpectability, opulence and glory. Notwith≈øtanding his great predilection for the enjoyments of private life, yet at the unanimous call of his country, he accepted the high and arduous office of the chief magi≈øtrate of the nation. With what ≈øolid and magnanimous principles, founded in morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion, did he commence his admini≈øtration? How ≈øoon did he demon≈øtrate the wi≈ødom of the choice which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had made; and that he was not le≈øs di≈øtingui≈øhed by civil policy and the art of government, than in that of war?</p>
            <p>HOW did he remove difficulties, an≈øwer previous obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, harmonize and ≈øtrengthen the union, clear and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the path to national peace, pro≈øperity and honor? How did the millions of the American States realize the happy effects of his admini≈øtration, and rejoice under its righteous, mild and benign influence?</p>
            <p>AS years increa≈øed the ardor of his de≈øire to return to the rank of a private citizen al≈øo increa≈øed. When the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidential term expired he had drawn up his farewell addre≈øs, and was prepared to proclaim his intentions. But at the united and ardent ≈øolicitations of all around him, and upon a view of the critical ≈øtate of the union, he once more ≈øacrificed private inclination to the public weal. A ≈øecond time was he unanimou≈øly cho≈øen to the ≈øupreme magi≈øtracy. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ≈øervices did he again render to his country? While war has hung out its bloody flag through the principal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Europe, and through a great part of the old world; and mankind have been ≈ølaughtered, cities era≈øed, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ≈øhaken beyond all parallel in modern ages, through his wi≈ødom, and invincible firmne≈øs, the United States have not only enjoyed peace; but, beyond all former precedent, have increa≈øed in number, ≈øettlements, hu≈øbandry, navigation and commerce. The happy effects of his admini≈øtration have extended their benign influence to enemies, as well as to fellow-citizens. The ho≈øtile Indians have not only been conquered and reduced to a ≈øtate of peace, but through his recommendation and influence, their condition has been greatly ameliorated.

he would a third time be unanimou≈øly called to the chair of the ≈øupreme magi≈øtrate, he once more retired to the rank of a private citizen. No man had ever rendered more e≈ø≈øential and exten≈øive ≈øervices to his country than he; yet, as though all this had been too little to an≈øwer the public demands, and ≈øatisfy the great and generous impul≈øes of his own mind, when the exigencies of his country required it, he again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the chief command of our armies, to defend us again≈øt the intrigues and violence of a mo≈øt terrible nation.</p>
            <p>HE rendered all his ≈øervices with a peerle≈øs genero≈øity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally declining every pecuniary con≈øideration<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">When he accepted the command of the army he ≈øaid, in his addre≈øs to the pre≈øident of Congre≈øs, "As to pay, ≈øir, I beg leave to a≈ø≈øure the congre≈øs, that as no pecuniary con≈øideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expen≈øe of my dome≈øtic ea≈øe and happine≈øs, I do not wi≈øh to make any profit from it.

The whole ≈øum which pa≈ø≈øed through his hands during the war, amounted only to fourteen thou≈øand four hundred ≈øeventy-nine pounds eighteen ≈øhillings and nine pence ≈øterling.

In every emergency he exhibited the ≈øame greatne≈øs of mind, the ≈øame invincible fidelity and attachment to his country; ≈øacrificing all private con≈øiderations, and con≈øecrating all the powers with which heaven had enriched him, to the public good. No bribes, no offers of preferment, no dangers could make him deviate from the path of honor and duty. Of him it might not with le≈øs truth be ≈øaid, than of the Roman Fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, WASHINGTON <hi>is the man who may with more difficulty be removed from the ways of honor, than the ≈øun from his cour≈øe</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Such was the nece≈ø≈øity of the ca≈øe, and ≈øuch the confidence which congre≈øs repo≈øed in the general, that, at ≈øome times, they inve≈øted him with power nearly equal to that of univer≈øal dictator; yet he has left no in≈øtance of his abu≈øe of power. He always paid a punctilious regard to the laws of his country, and to the rights and property of his fellow-citizens. He might with the greate≈øt facility, like Cae≈øar or Cromwell, have made him≈øelf king or lord protector of America, but he cho≈øe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to return to the rank of a private citizen, than enjoy even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and emoluments which his country ever wi≈øhed to give him. At the clo≈øe of the war public credit was at the lowe≈øt ebb. The troops though they had performed the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential ≈øervices for their country, were unpaid. Some of the principal officers, and many of the ≈øoldiers were determined never to lay down their arms until they had redre≈ø≈øed their own grievances. An artful, in≈øidious publication, circulated to inflame the troops, and inviting them while they had arms in their hands, to do them≈øelves ju≈øtice, was ≈øpread in the camp. In this alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming cri≈øis, how did the magnanimity of the general and his invincible attachment to his country ≈øhine forth? In≈øtead of giving the lea≈øt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to ≈øuch mutinous de≈øigns, he convened his officers, and with a kind of paternal tenderne≈øs addre≈ø≈øed them on the ≈øubject. While he a≈ø≈øured them of his e≈øteem of them and affection for them, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for their honor and intere≈øt, he conjured them, "as they valued their honor, as they re≈øpected the rights of humanity, and as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the military character of America, to expre≈øs their utmo≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtation of the man, who was attempting to open the floodgates of civil di≈øcord, and deluge their ri≈øing empire with blood." Taking hold of one of his venerable locks, he ≈øaid to this effect, See how my head has whitened in the ≈øervice, and yet I have not once doubted of the ju≈øtice of my country: and a≈ø≈øuring them that he would u≈øe his whole influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for their advantage, he urged them to ca≈øt them≈øelves upon it. They were melted even into tears, and the apparent ≈øtorm terminated in an honorable and happy calm. The troops were ≈øoon after di≈ømi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, and in the mo≈øt peaceful and orderly manner, returned to their re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective homes.</note>.

Indeed in him were united the three great characters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius, Fabius, and Cincinnatus.
