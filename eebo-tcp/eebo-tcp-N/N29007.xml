         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <argument>
               <p>THAT portion of Scripture which ſhall lead our medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, while we moſt ſenſibly participate in the general ſorrow of our afflicted country, and pay our mournful tribute of reſpect to the departed Hero and Father of the American States, is written in the <q>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>LXXXII PSALM, 6 and 7th verſes.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods: and all of you are children of the Moſt High. But ye ſhall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>HOWEVER bright the ſun may riſe, however uſeful and cheering he may be in his meridian courſe, yet, at the appointed hour, he will moſt certainly ſet. His cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light and genial influence will be withdrawn. In like manner men of the greateſt eminence, the moſt diſtinguiſhed by genius, by mental improvement, by exalted ſtations and public uſefulneſs, to whatever degree they have illuminated, gladdened and benefited the ſeveral ages and nations in which they have flouriſhed, after a ſhort and precarious day, have ſet in the midnight gloom of death. Their uſefulneſs has ſoon terminated, and they lie in the dark regions of the dead. Short is the whole term from the morning of life to the ſad evening of death. The author of our nature has made our days as an hand breadth and our age as nothing before him. The term of public life and uſefulneſs is ſtill much ſhorter. How ſoon is the arm, which, with manly vigor ſwayed the ſceptre, wielded the ſword of juſtice and of war, enervated with years? How ſoon does the ſtrongeſt memory fail and the greateſt mental powers decline with age? Nay, how often are men of the moſt diſtinguiſhed characters arreſted by the hand of death, before the approach of old age? In the glory of life, in the midſt of uſefulneſs they vaniſh, like the vapor, and appear no more. They die ſuddenly, die in every period of life and uſefulneſs, and by all the diſeaſes, caſualities and misfortunes by which other men die. They exhibit to the world the moſt melancholy and ſtriking evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>That every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF this it is the deſign of the text to admoniſh all men, and eſpecially all the great and honorable among them: That notwithſtanding the importance and elevation of their character they are mortal. The text indeed concedes, that ſome men are highly exalted above others. Magiſtrates are called by the awful name of Gods, and all of them children
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038679_0006_1012AF9AC29A7160"/>
of the MOST HIGH, on the account of their office; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with which they are inveſted, the work to which they are appointed, and the majeſty which GOD hath <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> put upon them. But to check human vanity, make them better men, and more extenſively uſeful, he who maketh them Gods, affirms alſo, That they ſhall die like men. His words not only aſſert their mortality, but imply the great importance and utility of their knowledge of it, and of their frequently and ſeriouſly contemplating upon it, and on their reſponſibility to a tribunal higher than their own.</p>
            <p>IT will therefore be natural in further diſcourſing on the ſubject <list>

                  <item>II. THAT however highly they may be exalted in office, or in any other reſpects above other men, they are equally with them ſubject to mortality and all its conſequences.</item>

            <p n="1">I. I AM to ſhow the majeſty of civil rulers: or that GOD highly exalts ſome men in genius, dignity and uſefulneſs above others.</p>
            <p>THE SUPREME MAJESTY, in the text and context, expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terms the kings, magiſtrates and rulers of Iſrael, Gods. This, of all names, is the moſt high, venerable and glorious. When given by GOD himſelf, it muſt be with great proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; importing the high exaltation, majeſty and importance of magiſtrates and civil government: That they are inſtituted by him, and bear a reſemblance of his glorious majeſty.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government, however different, in different times and countries, is of GOD. He expreſsly appointed it among his own people. It was his expreſs command, <hi>Judges and officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xvi.18.</note>. The divine gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment is univerſal. HE <hi>hath prepared his throne in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; and his kingdom ruleth over all</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Pſalm, ciii.19.</note>. All other rulers are of GOD, as well as thoſe of his own peculiar people. Hence that remarkable paſſage, <hi>By me kings reign, and princes decree juſtice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. viii.15, 16.</note>. The apoſtle Paul expreſsly affirms, <hi>The powers that be are ordained of</hi> GOD. <hi>And there is no power but of</hi> GOD <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. xiii.1, 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038679_0007_1012AF9C51AE9898"/>CIVIL government is founded in reaſon. It originates in the divine philanthropy; and has its foundation in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care, juſtice and goodneſs of the common parent of all his creatures. It is deſigned to be a reſemblance of him in the righteouſneſs and purity of his laws and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When it is good, it bears a glorious reſemblance of him, and is one of the greateſt bleſſings enjoyed by man. As mankind are, this is the grand ſecurity of life, limb, lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, property, domeſtic, public, civil and religious peace and order; and indeed of all the bleſſings of ſocial life. This only defends us againſt violence, injuſtice, robbery, war, and death. Without it there could be no order, ſtrength, beauty, unity, or peace in ſociety. Nay, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrained luſts and paſſions of men, like a mighty tornado or inundation would ſweep from the earth every thing which is pleaſant and valuable to man.</p>
            <p>AS GOD hath inſtituted civil government, ſo men of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular genius and mental powers elevated to ſeats of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dominion are his miniſters, and, in their legiſlative and executive capacity, bear his image as the SUPREME RULER and JUDGE of the univerſe. They ſtand in his place, act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his authority, legiſlate and judge for him. They are his officers to ſuppreſs violence, fraud, diſſipation and every wickedneſs which injures the public weal, and to maintain truth, order, righteouſneſs and peace in the earth. Hence it is written, <hi>Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in judgment</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">II. Chron. xix.6.</note>. The civil ruler muſt imitate GOD in the integrity of his heart, in the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and purity of his law, and in the impartiality of his government. The divine throne is eſtabliſhed in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>juſtice and judgment are the habitation of it.</hi> The divine law is perfect and pure. How great and awful is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of civil magiſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>tes in this view? They are law-givers to guard the life, property and liberties of the people; to defend, encourage and reward the righteous, to puniſh the wicked, to cut off the violent man, and evil doers from the earth. They are exalted to ſeats and thrones of judgment, to defend the poor, the fatherleſs and the widow: to do juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and judgment, and to eſtabliſh truth, and righteouſneſs, and peace in the earth. With the Lord, whoſe reſemblance they bear, <hi>there is no iniquity, nor reſpect of perſons, nor taking of gifts</hi>

            <p>CIVIL magiſtrates ſhould imitate the SUPREME RULER in his paternal care and goodneſs over his creatures, in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and in the goodneſs of his government.

The riſing ſun, in a clear morning, ſpreads an univerſal joy, and its clear ſhining after rain, has the moſt extenſive and beneficial effects. So the influence of a good ruler extends its happy effects to every community, family and individual in a whole nation. It gives order, ſafety, peace and joy to all. In this view how amiable, dignified and glorious is the good ruler. In what an high and important ſenſe does he reſemble the MOST HIGH? On theſe accounts it has generally been ſuppoſed that magiſtrates, in the ſcriptures, are called GODS.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:038679_0009_1012AFA3C19DC5C8"/>THERE is yet another important, and perhaps a principal reaſon, why the Kings of Judah and Iſrael were called Gods; Becauſe they were illuſtrious types of the MESSIAH, the SON of GOD. In this reſpect they might be called Gods: and every one of them children of the MOST HIGH. But in this view no rulers ſince the coming of CHRIST can be called by this high and reverend name. In the other view, however, they are a happy reſemblance of the DIVINE MAJESTY, and their character is moſt venerable and uſeful. The more wiſe, righteous, patriotic and extenſively uſeful they are, the more happily they anſwer to the high and awful name by which they are characterized. Such officers are the LORD'S, the PILLARS of the earth, and he hath ſet the world upon them<note n="†" place="bottom">I. Sam. ii.8.</note>.</p>
            <p>HE raiſes them up with all their ſuperior abilities natural or acquired; and by his providence exalts them to the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſtations in which he deſigns them to act, for the defence, peace and proſperity of his kingdom. As known unto him are all his works from the foundation of the world, ſo he qualifies men, in the different periods of time, for the great purpoſes which he has in view. He brings them on to the great theatre of action; and makes them, through his bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adequate to the emergencies of the church, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable events which he deſigns to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>THE natural and acquired abilities of men are exceedingly different. The diſparity between ſome men and others is, probably. nearly as great as between ſome angels and men. David is repreſented, As <hi>wiſe according to the wiſdom of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to know all things that were in the earth</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">II. Sam. xiv.20.</note>. GOD gives to ſome men, natural genius, largeneſs of heart, an acumen and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration far beyond the common ſhare of their fellows. He forms them for great actions and purpoſes. Thus he gave to <hi>Solomon wiſdom and underſtanding exceeding much, and largeneſs of heart, even as the ſand which is on the ſea ſhore</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I. Kings iv.29.</note>. He alſo, ſo governs events, in his providence, that the natural powers of ſome perſons ſhall be greatly improved by litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all advantages to form them for public uſefulneſs. To ſome men he gives great talents for government. Like the men of Iſſachar they have an underſtanding of the times, ſo that they diſcern both time and judgment; and know what Iſrael ought to do. On others he beſtows uncommon

military abilities; magnanimity, and penetration of mind, ſtrength and agility of body, ſo that they are admirably calculated to defend his church againſt her enemies. In ſome inſtances theſe are both united in the ſame perſon. Thus, when the exigencies of the church required it, GOD raiſed up David, and gave him not only great wiſdom, policy, and military ſkill, but uncommon ſtrength and agility, ſo that the bow of ſteel was broken by his arms, and he ran through the troops and leaped over the walls and ramparts of his enemies<note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm xviii.29, 34</note>. For his aſſiſtance he gave him captains and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals, <hi>who were men of war, fit for the battle, who could handle ſhield and buckler, whoſe faces were as the faces of lions, and who were ſwift as the roes upon the mountains</hi>

            <p>WHEN GOD deſigned to deliver Iſrael from their bondage in Egypt, and to form them into a diſtinct kingdom, he gave them Moſes for a lawgiver and deliverer. When they needed a general to lead them into Canaan, he raiſed up a Joſhua. When the holy ſeed were doomed to an univerſal and total deſtruction, by the device of a wicked Haman, he prepared an Eſther, with all the charms of nature and good ſenſe, and with the poliſh of a fine education, to raviſh the heart of the king of Perſia, and by her influence to obtain a reverſal of the fatal decree. When it was his purpoſe to deſtroy Babylon, and to deliver his people from the North country, he called Cyrus, and girded him with his might; <hi>That he might let go his captives and build his city</hi>

            <p>IN like manner, when he ſaw, that men were about to riſe up againſt the people of America, and ſwallow them up quickly, unleſs his merciful interpoſition ſhould prevent, he qualified and exalted men to places of truſt, in the cabinet and in the field, for their defence. At that period aroſe a Franklin, that uncommon genius, who firſt diſcovered the philoſophy of the electric fluid, and taught how to conduct the tremendous bolts of heaven harmleſs from the dwellings of men. Then appeared in mature age, and the full vigor of life, a Randolph, a Hancock, an Adams, a Jay, and other diſtinguiſhed characters, to guide our counſels in the cabinet and negociate our affairs in foreign kingdoms; and that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious man, GEORGE WASHINGTON, to command our armies in the field, and be the Saviour of America. For his aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance there appeared a Green, a Montgomery, a Wooſter, a Sullivan, a Lincoln, a Wayne, a Mercer, and other heroic

patriots to defend our liberties, and lead us to peace and glory. Theſe, with the other great and patriotic characters who labored with them in the ſame glorious cauſe, were his inſtruments to effect the great work which he deſigned. He gave them their powers and raiſed them to the elevated ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in which they acted. <hi>For promotion cometh neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, nor from the South But God is the judge; He putteth down one, and ſetteth up another.</hi> Hence the powers that be are of GOD. He creates and preſerves them for his own purpoſes, and removes them at his pleaſure. Though he ſtands in no need of creatures, means, or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; can work with or without them, as ſeemeth good in his ſight, yet it pleaſeth him, ordinarily, to govern the world, and accompliſh great events by them.</p>
            <p>This brings me to obſerve</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT however highly they may be exalted in office, or in any other reſpects above other men, they are equally with them ſubject to mortality and all its conſequences.</p>
            <p>THIS is a truth however melancholy and deeply affecting it may be, which lies ſo open to univerſal obſervation, that it needs no laboured illuſtration. The buſineſs of a preacher is rather to impreſs, than demonſtrate a truth ſo obvious. The experience of all ages, of every year and month from the apoſtacy to the preſent time bears witneſs to it. Both the ſacred and hiſtoric page atteſt it. <hi>One generation paſſeth away and another generation cometh. The fathers where are they?

Neither their wiſdom, power, nor ſtrength, can evade, over awe, or withſtand the meſſenger of death. Neither can their riches bribe him, and prevent the fatal blow.

            <p>THE chief men of a nation, the created Gods of the earth, die like men, as to the manner of their death. They die ſuddenly; die in the glory of life. They lie down in eaſe and apparent ſafety, ſlumber a few hours, and awake in ſore diſeaſe and the agonies of death. Nay, they lie down in health, cloſe their eyes in ſoft repoſe, and wake no more. They die in all the ways, in all the agonies, ſwoons, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, fears and terrors of other men.</p>
            <p>THEY fall like one of the princes, by the arrow from the bow drawn at a venture, by the ſword upon the high places, by the dagger of the aſſaſſin, by the poiſonous draught, and the numerous delicacies, dainties, and indulgencies of high life. They die on beds of down, tapeſtry and fine linen; amidſt learned phyſicians, coſtly medicines, and royal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants. Yes, in the midſt of all theſe, they muſt die; nor can they obtain a moment's reprieve. In magnificent domes and ſtately palaces, in the preſence of captains and mighty men, in all the hurry and alarm of an affrighted court, they bid the world and time adieu.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038679_0013_1012AFABAFEC72A8"/>THEY die like men with reſpect to all the conſequences of death. Their bodies like thoſe of their fellow mortals drop into a ſtate of inſenſibility and inaction. They lie down in the grave, the land of darkneſs and ſilence, the worms cover them, and they return to their original duſt. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change their robes of ſtate, their palaces, their lofty domes and ſoft lodgings for the winding ſhroud and the tomb.</p>
            <p>THEIR immortal part paſſes inſtantaneouſly into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, eternal world of ſpirits, and becomes ſubject to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, government and awards of that endleſs and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate.

            <p>LIKE other men they are accountable for all the principles, views, and ends with which they have acted; for all they have done not only in their high ſtations, but in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſecret walks; for every thing which they have done in the body.

            <p n="2">II. FROM a review of our ſubject we are led to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the divine wiſdom and goodneſs, in raiſing up men of uncommon abilities, in the various ages and emergencies of the church, for her protection and proſperity, and for the general happineſs of mankind. In a particular manner, ſhould they be acknowleged, in his cauſing ſuch a number of great, illuminated, bold, and patriotic characters to appear on the theatre of action, at the time of the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Eſpecially, do they ſhine with a conſpicuous and commanding luſtre, in raiſing up that pre-eminent man, General WASHINGTON, to command our armies, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our councils, until he had eſtabliſhed our independence, and we had obtained the bleſſings of an honorable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous peace: and then in exalting him to the chair of the ſupreme magiſtrate, to guide the affairs of the nation, for ſuch a number of years, until he had raiſed it to a high degree of dignity, proſperity and glory. This demands the moſt lively gratitude and animated thankſgivings of the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the American ſtates.

the illuſtrious men who negociated the peace. <hi>Adams, Franklin</hi> and <hi>Jay,</hi> are names never to be forgotten by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Nor are they leſs to be regarded, in the patriotiſm and valour of our officers and ſoldiers, and in the capacity, fidelity, invincible fortitude and attachment to their country, with which the members of Congreſs and the magiſtrates of the American ſtates in general, and of this ſtate in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, conducted our public affairs. They have indeed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed their names; and, with a ſweet fragrance, they will be handed down, in the remembrance of a grateful people, to the remoteſt ages. But whatever honors and thanks are to be given to men, the SUPREME GOVERNOR is ultimately to be acknowleged and praiſed for all the wonderful things which have been done for our country; and for the unrival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, public and private privileges and bleſſings which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. While therefore we contemplate the amiable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of general Waſhington, his proweſs and military ſkill, his abilities as a ſtateſman, his firmneſs, integrity and fidelity in government, his generoſity and uſefulneſs, and mingle our tears of condolence at his fall, let us in all theſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege the divine hand, and give glory to him, whoſe kingdom ruleth over all.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE views we have taken of the mortality and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility of created gods, will lead us to a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting and profitable reflections, with reſpect to magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and all great men, and alſo with reſpect to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>THE ſolemn thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that death will ſoon wreſt the ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre and the ſword from the hands of the moſt exalted and powerful, and defile their crowns in the duſt: That their robes of ſtate, and ſeats of dignity muſt be exchanged for the winding ſhroud and the dark grave, are moſt powerfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to check the pride of office: To teach leſſons of meekneſs, condeſcenſion and goodneſs:—The vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, of worldly honor and greatneſs, and of all the wealth, pomp and glitter of the preſent world. What can poſſibly impreſs with greater energy upon the human heart that divine maxim, <hi>Verily every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether vanity</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm xxxix.5.</note>. How doth this conſideration ſtain the pride of all human glory! What can be more energetic to excite great men, and all men, So to number their days, that they may apply their hearts unto wiſdom<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm xc.12.</note>? The thoughts of their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponſibility

to the judge of the univerſe, are adapted with great energy to guard them againſt the thirſt of domination, againſt the numerous luſts and temptations to which, in high ſtations and high life, they are expoſed. They have a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py influence to guard them againſt ſelfiſhneſs and ſiniſter views, againſt oppreſſion and violence, againſt the taking of gifts and reſpect of perſons. Theſe thoughts are weighty to awaken them to the moſt laborious diligence, activity and faithfulneſs in the duties of their office: Nay, to be really pious, righteous, humane and temperate; and to ſeek thoſe ſubſtantial and permanent honors which come only from GOD. Happy and honorable indeed will it be for magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates and all great men, who ſhall frequently dwell on theſe meditations, and who will ſuffer themſelves to be ſuitably influenced by them. Then when they ſhall put off the badg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of ſtate, and the garments of mortality, and be removed from ſeats of dignity and thrones of judgment on earth, they will be clothed in the robes of righteouſneſs and garments of ſalvation, and be exalted to ſeats and crowns immortal in the preſence of their GOD and REDEEMER.</p>
            <p>THAT they muſt die like men, teacheth us to put no truſt in princes, ſince they are vanity, and to make not fleſh our arm. It ſpeaks in this energetic language, <hi>Ceaſe ye from man whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of</hi>

How ſhould they engage us to do whatever our hand findeth to do with all our might?

OUR ſubject teacheth us to acknowlege the divine providence in the death of great and good men, who have been the political fathers, ſaviours, and benefactors of their country, and to be humbled and mourn under ſuch awful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</p>
            <p>IT is GOD who putteth them down, as well as ſetteth them up. Our times are in his hands.

He hath not only determined the degree and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but the term of every man's uſefulneſs.

Our ſorrow ought to be, in ſome meaſure proportionate to his worth, the magnitude of the ſervices he hath rendered us, and of the loſs we have ſuſtained. Great bereavements call for great mourning and humiliation.</p>
            <p>WHEN Moſes that eminent ſervant of GOD died, who had delivered Iſrael from the houſe of bondage, and was king in Jeſhurun, all Iſrael mourned for him. When that excellent prince Joſiah fell, <hi>All Judah and Jeruſalem mourned for him, and Jeremiah lamented for Joſiah, and all the ſinging men and ſinging women ſpake of Joſiah in their lamentations unto this day</hi>

While we contemplate his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, his ſervices and mournful exit, and condole with our country and with each other in our incalculable loſs, does not every breaſt heave with ſorrow, and all eyes run down with tears?</p>

               </note>. His countenance appeared bold and thoughtful, but placid and winning. He had a good, though not a public education. Such was the ſtrength and accuracy of his genius, the agreeableneſs of his manners, and his general acquaintance with men and things, that he began, in early life, to be noticed as a man of talents, and to be introduced to public buſineſs. In 1753, when he was about twenty-one years of age, he was ſent by the governor of Virginia <note n="†" place="bottom">Lieutenant governor Dinwiddie. Waſhington at that period ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the rank of a major, and yet he took his proviſions on his back, and travelled four hundred miles with a ſingle companion. One half of his rout lay through a trackleſs wilderneſs, inhabited by none but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.</note> with plenary powers, to the commandant of the French fort near the Ohio, to demand of him the reaſons of his encroachments on the Britiſh dominions, and of the violence which had been offered to the ſubjects of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in that quarter; and to inſiſt on his evacuating the fort which he had erected. The French governor laid claim to the whole country and refuſed to give up his fortreſs; but major Waſhington conducted the buſineſs of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with ſuch addreſs, expedition, and accuracy, as further recommended him to public notice. The next year he was made a lieutenant-colonel, and commanded a regiment of Virginians. In 1755, he went an extra aid-de-camp with general Braddock. At the time of his memorable defeat, he behaved with ſuch gallantry, in preſerving the remains of his broken army, as procured him ſtill greater honour <note n="‡" place="bottom">He preſerved the Virginians from the general panic, formed a bold front to the enemy, and covered the regular troops in their retreat.

The ſupreme authority of Virginia was ſo deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of his worth and military talents, that he was made adjutant-general of all the troops raiſed, and to be raiſed in Virginia. In 1758, he commanded the van-brigade, in the army of general Forbes, in the ſucceſsful expedition againſt fort Du Queſne. From about the year 1760 to the commencement of the diſpute with Great-Britain, he was elected a member of the general aſſembly in Virginia, was a magiſtrate, and a judge of the court of the county of Fairfax, in which he reſided. In 1774, he was elected member to the firſt congreſs. He was elected alſo member of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, in 1775, in which on the 15th of June he was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commander in chief of the armies of the united colonies. This arduous command he accepted at a time of great peril to America; and during eight ſucceſſive campaigns, ſubjected himſelf to the hardſhips of a ſoldier, jeoparding his life in the high places, for the defence of the liberties, lives and property of his fellow-citizens, and to ſecure the peace, ſafety and proſperity of his country.</p>
            <p>WHEN he took the command, the Americans had not a regular regiment nor fortreſs, nor did they poſſeſs an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhip. They were almoſt without arms, artillery, ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and other means of defence. The colonies were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by ſea and land, by the moſt formidable force that ever invaded a young country. He was called to act againſt the beſt generals and troops which Europe could boaſt. They had gathered laurels in Europe and America, in Flanders, at Louiſburg, and on the plains of Abraham. They were furniſhed with the beſt arms, and the fineſt train of artillery, ſerved by the beſt engineers which Great-Britain or Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny could produce. A great part of his army, until nearly the cloſe of the war, conſiſted of militia and troops who were only temporary; and he had often to diſband one army and form another in the very face of the enemy. Yet he made a ſurpriſing defence. He was never once ſurprized, never loſt an army, nor ſuffered any conſiderable defeat. His army was generally much inferior to that of the enemy<note n="†" place="bottom">The continental army, at its beſt ſtate, conſiſted of about 22,000 men. According to the ſpeeches in the parliament, and hiſtorical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, Great-Britain employed more than 5<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The fleet under Lord Howe at New York, in 1776, conſiſted of 300 ſail. That which tranſported the royal army to Quebec, conſiſted of more than an hundred ſail. Beſides, a great number of armed boats and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateers were employed in the war againſt the States.</note>,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038679_0020_1012AFC00736E4B0"/>
yet he finally baffled all their arts, totally defeated their deſigns, and, under the ſuperintendance of a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, raiſed the United States to independence, peace, and glory.</p>
            <p>DURING his command, he exhibited ſtriking demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an uncommon genius, a ſingular knowledge of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the moſt maſterly ſtrokes of generalſhip.</p>
            <p>WHEN he arrived before Boſton, he found it inveſted with a half armed and undiſciplined multitude, haſtily drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from their fields and ſhops, the greater part of whom, though a bold and virtuous yeomanry, had never before ſeen a campaign, nor the forming of a ſingle regiment. In New England, he had made no connexions, and was ſcarcely known. To its legiſlatures, to its men of principal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the officers and troops, who compoſed his army, he was an entire ſtranger. Yet he was able, of this chaotic maſs, to form an army, introduce ſyſtem, obedience, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and bravery. He at once poſſeſſed himſelf of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and confidence of his officers and of the whole army. Equally did he poſſeſs himſelf of the eſteem of all the New-England patriots and colonies; and was able to point their whole force to the object of his wiſhes. Though he had not only an army to harmonize, before a numerous enemy of veterans, but, for a time, almoſt to create the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<note n="‡" place="bottom">When general Waſhington arrived at head quarters at Cambridge, the army had neither tents, nor commiſſaries, nor any regular ſupplies of proviſions. They had neither engineers capable of planning regular works, nor tools to erect them. They had no proper train of artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their arms were very defective, and numbers had none at all. With reſpect to ammunition, they were ſtill more deficient. On the 4th of Auguſt it was found that the whole ſtock of powder in the four New-England colonies, was little more than ſufficient to furniſh nine rounds for each man, then inveſting the town. After every exertion which could be made, as late as February 1776, there were 2,000 troops with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms. Enterpriſing and high ſpirited officers, with their adherents, had puſhed forward to the camp, without regard to rank, the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Congreſs, or their reſpective colonies. To aſſign to them the ſtation which their rank and ſervices required, and much leſs to which their vanity aſpired, and to introduce ſubordination and diſcipline among freemen, was a taſk too great for any man but a Waſhington. But he was able to adjuſt all theſe embarraſſments with ſafety, and to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſatisfaction.</note>, yet he was able, for many months, to keep them in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038679_0021_1012AFC457EA5C38"/>
a conſtant ſtate of ſiege and alarm; and at length, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their force and vigilance, to take ſuch poſitions as to oblige them, to ſave their fleet and army, to evacuate the town and port of Boſton<note n="†" place="bottom">The troops in Boſton conſiſted of between ſeven and eight thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and. They were aided by two floating batteries and 150 ſhips of war and tranſports. To confine them within their limits the general was obliged to form lines of about ten miles in circumference. His army when moſt numerous conſiſted of no more than 14,500 men; but at the cloſe of the year, while the old army was diſbanding, and a new one forming, it amounted only to 9650. Yet his arrangements were ſo judicious, that the enemy never made a ſingle attempt upon his lines. With a view to drive the hoſtile army from Boſton, the general was reinforced with 7,000 militia; at which time he found himſelf at the head of 17,000 effective men. But he was greatly embarraſſed for want of ammunition and military ſtores ſufficient for ſuch an attempt. However, on the night of the 4th of March 1776, he ordered a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, under general Thomas to take poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights. The van was compoſed of a covering party of 800 men. To theſe ſucceed 1200 fatigue men with carts carrying on their entrenching tools. In the rear was a train of more than 200 carts loaded with faſcines and bundles of hay. Here every thing was conducted with the profoundeſt ſilence, while the attention of the enemy was drawn to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other quarter, by a briſk bombardment and cannonade: and ſuch were the preparations and diſpoſitions made by the general, that by the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning light the provincials had completed ſuch lines of defence, as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed the enemy. General Howe in particular, in conſternation, was heard to exclaim, "I know not what I ſhall do; the rebels have done more in one night, than my whole army could have done in months." By taking this poſition the general had ſuch command of the harbor and town, that the enemy determined on an immediate evacuation of Boſton.</note>.</p>
            <p>HIS army afterwards conſiſted of the troops of thirteen different ſtates, different in education, manners views and intereſts, of troops from Canada and France, of different nations and languages, yet he ſhared deeply in the eſteem and confidence of the whole. How did he harmonize the armies of the United States?—The fleets and armies of France and America? In the darkeſt periods of the war, and through the whole of it, how perfectly did he enjoy the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038679_0022_1012AFC5E6F071E0"/>
affections and confidence of the army, of Congreſs, and of every ſtate in the union? Indeed he had ſuch command of the hearts of men, that his troops would abide with him in cold, hunger, nakedneſs and in all hardſhips and dangers.</p>
            <p>HIS retreat from Long Iſland, in 1776, was ſuch a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpiece of generalſhip as is rarely exhibited in the hiſtory of man. In one ſhort night, in the face of a ſuperior ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he brought off about nine thouſand men, without the loſs of a ſingle company. His retreat from the Iſland of New York, and through the Jerſies were exhibitions of the ſame great mind.</p>
            <p>THE manner of his recroſſing the Delaware, the ſurpriſal and capture of the Heſſians at Trenton, the march which he ſtole upon Cornwallis, and the defeat of the Britiſh troops at Princeton, were feats of greater brilliancy, and far more important and glorious in their conſequences. The affairs of the union were now at their loweſt ebb. The political pulſe was almoſt gone; but theſe unexpected and ſurprizing movements and victories, ſnatched us from the jaws of death, rekindled the vital ſpark, and diffuſed life and joy through all America<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>All the American fortreſſes had now fallen before the enemy; gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Waſhington had been hotly purſued through New Jerſey acroſs the Delaware into Pennſylvania. His army was nearly annihilated, and the remains of it were in a manner unclothed and unſhod. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was in a ſtate of deep deſpondency, and many were going over to the enemy and ſubmitting to Lord Howe. In this criſis general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, on Chriſtmas evening, made diſpoſitions for croſſing the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in three diviſions, with a view to attack the enemy's poſts in ſo many different places. The night was dark and ſevere; the ſtorm roared, the hail deſcended, and the Delaware rolled down in currents of ice; but he croſſed with 2400 men to the hoſtile ſhore, and after a march of nine miles juſt at the dawn of the morning, December 26, ſurpriſed the Heſſian poſt at Trenton. About forty of the enemy were killed or wounded, twenty three officers, 886 privates were made priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Col Rall, who commanded the poſt, was ſlain. The ſame day the general croſſed the river into Pennſylvania. Two of the Americans were killed, two were frozen to death, and ſix or ſeven were wounded. The general having ſecured his priſoners, on the 2d of Jaunuary 1777, again croſſed the Delaware, and took poſſeſſion of Trenton. His army conſiſted of about 5000 men, of whom 1800 were continentals, whoſe time of enliſtment was now expired, their clothing was no ways ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the ſeaſon, and they were worn down with ſervices. But, by the perſuaſion of the general, they were induced to tarry ſix weeks longer. The others were raw militia men, brought into the field in the then preſent emergency. By this time the royal army had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Princeton, and Lord Cornwallis at its head, was coming on, with great force, to repair the injury they had ſuſtained in their late defeat. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the enemy attacked an advanced poſt, which general Waſhington had placed with four field pieces, a little north of the town. General Green was ſent forward with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to ſupport it; but the enemy were in ſuch force that it was with difficulty, that he made good his retreat. The American army was haſtily formed behind Sanpink bridge and the creek of that name, which runs through the town. The general had a good train of field artillery, and a number of pieces were ſo placed as to concentrate their fire upon the bridge and the road leading to it. The enemy's grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers preſſed on with great ſpirit to force the bridge. Their attack was ſo warm, and their fire ſo heavy, that the general was obliged to expoſe his perſon and uſe all his exertions to prevent his troops from giving way; but the fire of the field pieces and of the troops was ſo well directed that after three unſucceſsful attempts the enemy retired. The Americans kept their poſition until night, and both armies main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a cannonade upon each other. The feeble American army was now in a moſt critical ſituation. To retreat and paſs the river in the face of ſuch an army was impracticable. Beſides, it would hazard the city of Philadelphia, and extinguiſh every ray of hope which had begun to dawn in the late ſucceſs. To riſk a general action with ſuch inferior force, would have been madneſs. The liberties of America, ſeemed, at this time, to be ſuſpended upon a mere thread. In this dilemma, general Waſhington determined, by a circuitous march, to get into the rear of the enemy and attack Princeton. To deceive them he ordered the fires to be kept in full blaze until the morning. About midnight the whole army took up their line of march, and arriving near Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a little before day, fell in with Colonel Mawhood, at the head of his regiment, marching for Trenton. The Colonel was a gallant offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and commencing a cloſe fire upon the Americans and charging with bayonets, they gave way, and a general panic ſeemed to be ſpreading. At this critical moment, the American Fabius appeared with all the fire and boldneſs of Hannibal or the Scipios, encouraging his troops, interpoſing himſelf between the two armies not more than thirty yards diſtance from the enemy's front with the head of his horſe toward them, while they diſcharged their pieces. The Americans an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated by his example, returned the fire and encompaſſed the Britiſh on every ſide; upon which the colonel, with what men he could, broke through and made his eſcape. While the general was engaged in this quarter, the reſt of the army engaged two other Britiſh regiments, who fled before them. Some of the enemy retired into the College and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to defend themſelves in that; but the Americans no ſooner began to fire upon them with their field pieces, than they ſurrendered. Sixty of the Britiſh were killed, many wounded, and three hundred taken priſoners. General Waſhington marched off in ſafety to Morriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town. The Britiſh generals were filled with ſuch conſternation at theſe unexpected and brilliant movements, that they immediately evacuated Trenton and Princeton, and, in a few weeks, the whole ſtate of New-Jerſey, except Brunſwick and Amboy, to which the Britiſh were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, was completely recovered.</p>

climax, he roſe in the force and brilliancy of his actions. The manner in which he outgeneralled Clinton and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh officers in the removal of his army from the vicinity of New York, to Yorktown in Virginia, and the capture of Cornwallis, made the fulleſt diſplay of the greatneſs of the man, and gloriouſly finiſhed his military career<note n="*" place="bottom">General Waſhington and the French general had, a conſiderable time before, concerted the plan of the coming over of the French fleet, and of attempting the defeat, or capture of Lord Cornwallis. One great thing neceſſary to effect this was to amuſe the Britiſh generals with the idea that a formidable attack was to be made on New-York, until the Cheſapeak ſhould be blocked up, and ſuch force concentrated in Virginia, as would be adequate to the reduction of Cornwallis.— For this purpoſe a plan was concerted for the meeting of governor Trumbull and his council at Danbury, in July or Auguſt, with a number of principal characters from other ſtates, to deliberate on mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for taking New York. This was publicly given out, and great expectations were entertained from the meeting of ſuch a number of ſages. The patriots met at the time the general wiſhed, and all the wiſe heads were laid together, and plans deviſed in their united wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. All thought they were aſſiſting the general, and that he was about vigorouſly to purſue the wiſe ſchemes which had been concerted. Requiſitions had been made on the New England ſtates of 6200 militia to fill up their reſpective quotas, to be ready within a week of the time for which they ſhould be called for. Flat bottomed boats ſufficient for the tranſportation of 5000 men had been brought down Hudſon's river to the vicinity of the American army. Count de Rochambeau, with the French army, had marched from Rhode Iſland, and joined the American army. Ovens were erected oppoſite to Staten Iſland, and appearances were made for the formation of a permanent camp in that quarter. About the ſame time a letter from general Waſhington was pretended to be intercepted containing a plan of the deſigned oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations againſt New York. Such a combination of circumſtances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the royal generals and the people in general to believe that the reduction of New York was the grand object. At the ſame time the general was marching his troops through the country to the Cheſapeak. Governor Trumbull had hardly reached Hartford, in his return from the council at Danbury, before he received a letter from general Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, acquainting him, that the French fleet was arrived in the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapeak, and that he was going to Virginia.</note>.</p>

The high places round Boſton, the heights of Dorcheſter, Long and York Iſlands, the White plains and the High lands in New York, Trenton, Princeton, the Brandywine, Morris Town, Valley Forge, Germantown, Monmouth and York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, witneſſed his fatigues and dangers<note n="†" place="bottom">The general often endured hardſhip and great fatigue, ſometimes lodged and fared coarſely; as at Trenton and Princeton, in his retreat through Jerſey, and at Valley-Forge.

and preſided in the formation of our preſent national conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, under which the United States have ariſen to ſuch reſpectability, opulence and glory. Notwithſtanding his great predilection for the enjoyments of private life, yet at the unanimous call of his country, he accepted the high and arduous office of the chief magiſtrate of the nation. With what ſolid and magnanimous principles, founded in morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion, did he commence his adminiſtration? How ſoon did he demonſtrate the wiſdom of the choice which Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica had made; and that he was not leſs diſtinguiſhed by civil policy and the art of government, than in that of war?</p>

            <p>AS years increaſed the ardor of his deſire to return to the rank of a private citizen alſo increaſed. When the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidential term expired he had drawn up his farewell addreſs, and was prepared to proclaim his intentions. But at the united and ardent ſolicitations of all around him, and upon a view of the critical ſtate of the union, he once more ſacrificed private inclination to the public weal. A ſecond time was he unanimouſly choſen to the ſupreme magiſtracy. What im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervices did he again render to his country? While war has hung out its bloody flag through the principal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Europe, and through a great part of the old world; and mankind have been ſlaughtered, cities eraſed, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhaken beyond all parallel in modern ages, through his wiſdom, and invincible firmneſs, the United States have not only enjoyed peace; but, beyond all former precedent, have increaſed in number, ſettlements, huſbandry, navigation and commerce. The happy effects of his adminiſtration have extended their benign influence to enemies, as well as to fellow-citizens. The hoſtile Indians have not only been conquered and reduced to a ſtate of peace, but through his recommendation and influence, their condition has been greatly ameliorated. Laws have been enacted providing not only for their peace and ſafety, but for their convenience and proſperity.</p>

he would a third time be unanimouſly called to the chair of the ſupreme magiſtrate, he once more retired to the rank of a private citizen. No man had ever rendered more eſſential and extenſive ſervices to his country than he; yet, as though all this had been too little to anſwer the public demands, and ſatisfy the great and generous impulſes of his own mind, when the exigencies of his country required it, he again ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the chief command of our armies, to defend us againſt the intrigues and violence of a moſt terrible nation.</p>
            <p>HE rendered all his ſervices with a peerleſs generoſity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally declining every pecuniary conſideration<note n="†" place="bottom">When he accepted the command of the army he ſaid, in his addreſs to the preſident of Congreſs, "As to pay, ſir, I beg leave to aſſure the congreſs, that as no pecuniary conſideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expenſe of my domeſtic eaſe and happineſs, I do not wiſh to make any profit from it.

He always paid a punctilious regard to the laws of his country, and to the rights and property of his fellow-citizens. He might with the greateſt facility, like Caeſar or Cromwell, have made himſelf king or lord protector of America, but he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to return to the rank of a private citizen, than enjoy even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and emoluments which his country ever wiſhed to give him. At the cloſe of the war public credit was at the loweſt ebb. The troops though they had performed the moſt eſſential ſervices for their country, were unpaid. Some of the principal officers, and many of the ſoldiers were determined never to lay down their arms until they had redreſſed their own grievances. An artful, inſidious publication, circulated to inflame the troops, and inviting them while they had arms in their hands, to do themſelves juſtice, was ſpread in the camp. In this alar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming criſis, how did the magnanimity of the general and his invincible attachment to his country ſhine forth? Inſtead of giving the leaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to ſuch mutinous deſigns, he convened his officers, and with a kind of paternal tenderneſs addreſſed them on the ſubject. While he aſſured them of his eſteem of them and affection for them, of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for their honor and intereſt, he conjured them, "as they valued their honor, as they reſpected the rights of humanity, and as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the military character of America, to expreſs their utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of the man, who was attempting to open the floodgates of civil diſcord, and deluge their riſing empire with blood." Taking hold of one of his venerable locks, he ſaid to this effect, See how my head has whitened in the ſervice, and yet I have not once doubted of the juſtice of my country: and aſſuring them that he would uſe his whole influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for their advantage, he urged them to caſt themſelves upon it. They were melted even into tears, and the apparent ſtorm terminated in an honorable and happy calm. The troops were ſoon after diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and in the moſt peaceful and orderly manner, returned to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective homes.</note>.

Indeed in him were united the three great characters of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius, Fabius, and Cincinnatus. He adored the divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, called the United States, and his troops, on ſpecial occaſions, to acknowledge and praiſe the GOD of armies! How did he in his laſt addreſs to his fellow-citizens, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend morality and religion as the moſt ſtable and ſure baſis of public happineſs? He roſe ſuperior to local prejudices for ſtates or nations. He could not be intoxicated with proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, nor be depreſſed with adverſity. In his numerous ſpeeches and addreſſes, on various occaſions, we find not a ſingle expreſſion of vanity, nor an invective againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. He was efficacious, but mild in government; inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive and engaging in his manners, temperate and regular in his mode of living, generous to public inſtitutions, and charitable to the poor<note n="†" place="bottom">It is well known that the general gave largely to ſome literary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and in a letter to the gentleman who had the care of his houſe, he writes thus, "Let the hoſpitality of the houſe be kept up with reſpect to the poor. Let no one go hungry away. If any of this ſort of people ſhould be in want of corn, ſupply their neceſſities, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it does not encourage them in idleneſs. I have no objection to your giving my money in charity, when you think it will be well beſtowed. I mean that it is my deſire that it ſhould be done. You are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that neither myſelf or my wife are in the way to do thoſe good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces."<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

good magiſtrate. Impartiality, juſtice and patriotiſm were prominent features of his whole adminiſtration, both in his military and civil capacity. How did the fruit of his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and of his wiſe, righteous and peaceful civil adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like the riſing ſun, diffuſe joy and feſtivity through the whole union? When through the energies of his wiſdom and proweſs, the thunder of war ceaſed in all our coaſts, and peace with her olive branch quieted America; When her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed inhabitants returned, and repoſſeſſed their abandoned cities and villages; Yes, when from captivity, doleful priſons, and the high places of the field, he reſtored her hardy ſons to the boſom of their country, to the embraces of parents and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of wives and children, was he not to you <hi>as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds?</hi> When under his happy adminiſtration, your ruined towns and cities were rebuilt, your depopulated tracts repeopled, your ſettlements extended, your navigation and commerce increaſed: nay, when he preſerved your peace, amidſt the convulſions and wars of ſo many conflicting kingdoms, was he not to you, <hi>as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain?</hi> Was not he the magiſtrate under whoſe government the people univerſally rejoiced? In a word, he was the father, the patriot, the ſaviour and glory of his country. Above all men he poſſeſſed the hearts of his fellow-citizens; and having lived well, he cloſed the ſcene of days with the ſame compoſure, dignity and fortitude, with which he lived. Theſe facts beyond a thouſand pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics, beyond all the pomp and ſwell of words, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the greatneſs, the incomparable worth and ſervices of the man, and the irreparable loſs of America in his mournful exit. But alas he is no more! His heart which was ſo warm, and beat ſo high in his country's weal is cold and beats no more. His limbs which were ſo beautiful, vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and active, are frozen in the embrace of death. Yes, the beloved Waſhington lies in the dark tomb. Death feeds upon him there. O Mount Vernon, how doſt thou tremble at his fall? What mourning ſpreads through thy ſpacious domes and humble cots? What lamentations riſe from all thy lofty groves and pleaſant walks? How does the ſorrow ſpread from city to city, from ſtate to ſtate, and pervade all America? How will it croſs the Atlantic and urge the ſilent tear from thouſands of Europeans eyes? Weep, O Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, your glory is departed. Weep, ye ſages of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all ye gods of America. Weep, O ye officers and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whom he commanded, whom he loved, and led to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Weep, O ye Cincinnati, ye Maſonic brethren, and all
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038679_0030_1012AFDDE4B4F518"/>
who have eyes to weep and hearts to mourn, come, ſhow how you loved him, come, water his tomb with your tears.</p>
            <p>BUT mourn with entire acquieſence and ſubmiſſion. For GOD hath ſaid, He ſhould die like a man, and fall like one of the princes. He hath determined the time and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his death. And as for GOD his way is perfect. His language to man is, Be ſtill and know that I am GOD.</p>
            <p>MOURN thankfully, that you have enjoyed your beloved Waſhington, for ſo many years; and that GOD enabled him to render unto his country ſuch extenſive and eſſential ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: That we have an Adams, a man ſo diſtinguiſhed in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics, of ſuch known and tried integrity, and who for ſuch a length of time, hath rendered ſuch eſſential, national ſervices, to guide our political affairs; and that while ſo large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind are engaged in ſuch bloody and horrible wars, we enjoy ſuch a degree of peace, ſuch diſtinguiſhing privileges and growing proſperity. What united, conſtant and animated thankſgivings do ſuch bleſſings demand?</p>
            <p>MOURN with profit to yourſelves. All the diſpenſations of GOD are full of inſtruction. His chaſtiſements are for our profit. Let us be ſure to be inſtructed and benefited by them. Let us learn the incalculable evil of ſin, which has ſubjected us, and the whole race of man to death: which opens every grave and fills every bitter cup: which expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth every ſoul of man to indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, and let us tremble and repent without delay. Let us entertain the deepeſt impreſſions of the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, and of all ſublunary enjoyments; not only of the certainty, but nearneſs of death. Realize, my brethren, how ſhort and precarious is the term of life and uſefulneſs. How the ſhort term of twenty, or twenty-five years, has ſwept the ſtage of all the great men, who were upon it, at that diſtance of time? Where now are our generals, the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Congreſs, and the governors of our ſtates? Where are Randolph, Hancock, Huntington, Green and Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Trumbull, Griſwold, and Wolcott? Where are their compatriots and cotemporaries, but in the grave? How nearly are thoſe ſtepping off into eternity, who have been upon it the ſame length of time, or even longer? How ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den may be the awful tranſition? How did a few hours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our moſt beloved and uſeful fellow-citizen, from a ſtate of perfect health to a breathleſs corpſe? With what ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould every one enquire, am I ready for a change ſo
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:038679_0031_1012AFE249604C90"/>
ſudden and momentous? Shall we not all work while the day laſteth, ſince the night cometh, nay, may ſo ſuddenly come, when no man can work?</p>
            <p>WHILE we contemplate great and pre-eminent characters let us ſtrive to imitate them. Behold, ye magiſtrates of America, ye created and mortal gods, the character of your political father, your beloved Waſhington, and while you admire, imitate his exalted virtues. Like him, by patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, integrity, impartiality and extenſive uſefulneſs, make glad the hearts of your fellow-citizens, and embalm your names to the lateſt poſterity. Like him harmonize the meaſures and hearts of your countrymen, and promote our external and internal peace and proſperity. Behold him, ye young men, and all ye inhabitants of the United States and learn to love your country, to prize its conſtitutions, to be public ſpirited and ſeek her peace, and with your lives and property defend her juſt rights and important intereſts. Know how to appreciate your ineſtimable privileges, your birth right and fair inheritance, tranſmitted to you from the moſt worthy anceſtors, and purchaſed at the expenſe of ſo much blood and treaſure. Defend them like men and never part with them, but with your lives. Aſpire to true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſiſting in piety, righteouſneſs, and univerſal good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Be rich in faith and good works, and heirs of the kingdom which GOD hath promiſed to them that love him<note n="†" place="bottom">I. Tim. vi.18, and James ii.5.</note>.</p>
            <p>IN a word, mourn not with deſpondency, but with a firm and humble confidence in the power, wiſdom and goodneſs of the SUPREME RULER. When creatures die, and you have the moſt ſtriking demonſtrations, that all which cometh is vanity, let this be your conſolation, that, The LORD reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that he will reign, and that his mercy endureth forever. He will never forſake his people. If we will be willing and obedient, we ſhall ſtill eat of the good of the land<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah i.19.</note>. GOD is in the midſt of Zion: HE <hi>will help her, and that right early</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſalm xlvi.5.</note>. In HIM therefore let us repoſe all our hopes: To HIM ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all obedience, all honor and bleſſing, thankſgiving and power, majeſty and dominion, now and for ever.</p>
