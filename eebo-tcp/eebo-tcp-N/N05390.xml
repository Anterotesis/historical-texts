            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Acts X. 1, 2.</bibl>
               <q>—Cornelius, <hi>a Centurion of the Band called the Italian Band—A devout Man, and one that feared GOD with all his Houſe,</hi>—</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>ALtho' the Perſon here ſpoken of, is not mentioned by Name in any other Parts of the holy Scripture, yet in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Holy Ghoſt does him abundant Honour, in recording his Name, and Character, and Converſion to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Faith, to the Glory of divine Grace, and for the ſufficient Encouragement of the Gentile Nations in all Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>It would be needleſs at this Time and foreign to my preſent Buſineſs, if I ſhould take any further particular Notice of him, than what I am led to, by the Words read as our Text, yet I may in the Proceſs of my Diſcourſe have ſome Eye to ſome other Paſſages in the Context, which relate to him.</p>
            <p>And if I am not miſtaken, theſe will afford us proper Matter for our Meditation and Inſtruction, at ſuch a Time, and upon ſuch an Occaſion a this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006825_0004_102A3804F73FC0C8"/>
Here then, he is exhibited to our View, 1. <hi>As a Man of a Military Character, an Officer upon the Roman Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment.</hi> Cornelius, <hi>a Centurion of the Band, called the Italian Band.</hi> i.e. The Captain of a Hundred, or a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of choſen Men, who were engaged and employed in the Military Life &amp; Buſineſs, who were furniſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Martial Skill, and fitting themſelves for, or rather had fitted themſelves for (for they were now upon Duty) the Service of their Prince, in that Employment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſarea</hi> is the Place in which this Company of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, under the Command of <hi>Cornelius</hi> was poſted—A Place rebuilt by <hi>Herod</hi> with great Coſt and Charge, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with rich and ſtately Buildings, Ports and Temples, and many the moſt agreable Accommodations,—He changed the ancient Name of it, which was <hi>Straton'</hi>s <hi>Tower,</hi> for that of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> in Honour to the Roman Emperor—And it became the uſual Reſidence of the Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.</p>
            <p>It was ſituate upon the Sea-Shore, and of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Romans, to be well Garriſon'd, that ſo there might be a Communication between <hi>Rome</hi> and the Places in thoſe Parts already conquered by them.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Company were quartered here, and we may juſtly argue, That he was a Man honourable and faithful in his Profeſſion and Buſineſs, or elſe he had not had ſuch an important Poſt aſſigned him.</p>
            <p>His Company were all choſen Men, Italians or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans by Birth—<hi>Watching and Warding—All holding Swords, being expert in War, every Man having his Sword upon his Thigh, becauſe of Fear in the Night.</hi> Cant. 3. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is <hi>exhibited to our View, as a devout Man and one that feared God.</hi> Indeed the Chapter before us, gives us an Account of his miraculous Converſion to the Chriſtian Faith, by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>—But we are to conſider him before this remarkable Event took Place.</p>
            <p>And before this, he is ſaid to have been <hi>a devout Man, and one that feared God.</hi> i. e. he was a religious Man—One that had come to the Knowledge of the true God; One that had juſt Conceptions of the ſupreme Lord and Governour of the Univerſe—
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006825_0005_102A5A0D94A6ED20"/>
And one that yielded a reverential Regard to him, both, as to Worſhip and Practice, according to the Light he had received from the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets—It matters not how he ſtood in the Eſteem of the bigotted <hi>Jews</hi>—nor how he came to this Knowledge and Fear of God, whether by his former Education, when Young, which is not in the leaſt probable; or by his quartering among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which is more than probable—ſo it is—He is termed, and he was, a pious religious Man—And herein he was accepted of God—And upon his Account is it primarily, that the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf as in the Context, v. 34, 35. <hi>Of a Truth I perceive that God is no Reſpecter of Perſons: But in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteouſneſs is accepted with him.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. He <hi>appears to have been a pious Head of a Family, a devout Man, and one that feared God with all his Houſe,</hi> ſays the Text—Tho', in an elevated Station of Life, and uſed to manly Exerciſes Abroad, yet having his Heart poſſeſſed of the Fear of God, he is deſirous that his Houſe or Family ſhould be well inſtructed and religiouſly edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated—He was careful to exhibit a good Example to his Houſhold, and to inſtruct them, and train them up in the Knowledge and Service of the true God. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd the ſordid Practices of Vice, and walked himſelf, and aim'd at the bringing his Family to walk in the Paths of Virtue and Religion.</p>
            <p>What an illuſtrious Example is here! worthy the Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Men in the moſt exalted Stations, whether of the Civil or Military Order—Truly ſuch Examples have a commanding Influence upon Perſons in lower Ranks and Orders, eſpecially ſuch as are more immediately in the View of them.</p>
            <p>No doubt ſome of his Company were by his Example and Influence won over to the Practice of Vertue and Piety—To be ſure we find One at leaſt, to be devout as well as he—Thus we read in the Context, v 7. <hi>A devout Soldier of them <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was valued by his Superiors, reſpected by ſuch as knew him, and lov'd by ſuch as were under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand—We may juſtly think that he was prized for thoſe Things which he was poſſeſſed of in common with other good Officers; but more for his manly, his pious, religious Conduct towards God and Men.</p>
            <p>Such a Man could not but behave with an agreeable Air and Mein—He was full of true Magnanimity, and therefore void of Pride and Haughtineſs—He was Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Courteous, Juſt and Charitable—He was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by Men in general, chearfully obeyed by his Soldiers, reverenced by his Family and Neighbours, and much reſpected even by the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves. It is ſaid in the Context, v. 22. <hi>He was of good Report, among all the Nation of the</hi> Jews. But above all, he was highly honoured of God; having a Teſtimony of his Integrity, his Sincerity, his Acceptance with God, given him by an Angel, a Meſſenger from God.</p>
            <p>Honoured of God, in being made the firſt Fruit of the Gentiles Converſion to the Faith of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>He lived up to the Light which he had before, and God vouchſafed to cauſe the Light of the glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the bleſſed God to ſhine into his Soul, and brought him to believe in the Lord Jeſus with all his Heart—Thus, the Man ſo piouſly diſpoſed, ſo faithful in his Place and Station, hath a more abundant Honour put upon him, and his Name ſtands enroll'd in the ſacred Pages, among the Worthies of Faith, and wherever the Goſpel comes his Memory will be revered and honoured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006825_0007_102A5A0FDF959240"/>
Not that he by his perſonal Merit, ſwayed and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the divine Conduct, in thus chooſing him to the firſt Rank in the Gentile Converſion, or to the Faith of Jeſus.—</p>
            <p>But for great and important Ends, the ſovereign God was pleaſed thus to call him by his Grace; and being thus called, and choſen, and dignified, his Character is worthy our Notice and Imitation.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in farther diſcourſing, I ſhall attempt theſe Things following.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. To ſhow, That the Military Life and Employment conſiſts with Chriſtianity.</item>
               <item>II. That Piety and Religion conſpicuous in the Lives and Deportment of Men, of the Military Order, render their Character the more bright &amp; illuſtrious.</item>
               <item>III. That altho' the Buſineſs of the Soldier leads him Abroad in the World, and in the Field, yet it is not beneath him, but a bounden Duty to manage and diſcipline his own Houſe or Family.</item>
               <item>IV. That a good Soldier is much to be valued and honoured, eſpecially if he not only excels in Military Accompliſhments, but demonſtrates a reverential Regard to God, and the practical Duties of Religion.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſhall be as brief in ſpeaking to each of theſe Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars as I poſſibly can, and then proceed to ſome ſuitable Application.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>That the Military Life and Employment conſiſts with Chriſtianity.</hi> However the Caſe was with <hi>Cornelius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he attain'd to the Knowledge of the true God, and whatever his Notions and Principles were then, with Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his Employment in Life, is not material in the Point before us.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that he hath this Teſtimony, and is deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated a good Man, tho' a Soldier.</p>
            <p>None can or will pretend to plead or argue, that Fightings and Warrings were not tolerated in and under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation, for abundant are the Inſtances to be produced not only of Wars &amp; Fightings, of the People of the Jews, or God's People, both on the

offenſive and defenſive Part, under the particular Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</p>
            <p>But ſuch Inſtances are ſo well known, that I need not mention them—Now <hi>Cornelius</hi> living among the Jews, and attaining to the Knowledge of the true God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worſhipping him to the divine Acceptance—and yet not laying down his Arms, or quiting his carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, is an Evidence that his Buſineſs conſiſted with his Religion; which was the true Religion, and the ſame with the true Religion now, only his Advantages and the Advantages of the Jews themſelves, were vaſtly leſs than were afterward and are now enjoyed under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation—And here lies the Streſs of the Argument, whether Wars and Fightings, whether a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Life and Employment, are countenanced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in and under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation? And it muſt be affirmed, that altho' the pure Precepts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity enjoin Peace with all Men; and where they have a true and genuine Influence in and upon the Hearts of Men, ſuch Men are diſpoſed to Peace; yet the Deſign of thoſe Precepts is not to eradicate the Principles of Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Preſervation, but to regulate the Temper and Conduct of the World, and to make Men keep within the juſteſt Bounds and Limits, in all their Conduct and Behaviour towards one another.</p>
            <p>A voracious, Blood thirſty, quarrelſom Diſpoſition, is utterly condemned by the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To take up Arms, or to wield the Sword out of an avaritious and inſatiable Deſire to poſſeſs that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Perſon or People are poſſeſſed of, and have a good Right to, is unjuſtifiable—But then, if Life is dear and valuable, if the Lives of our Families are precious in our Eſteem, and if civil, and religious Priviledges are ſacred, and much to be prized by a People, then are Men called now as much as ever they were, to ſecure and defend themſelves, and their valuable Enjoyments of one Sort and another.</p>
            <p>And in Order to this, conſidering the preſent Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs in the World, in all Parts of it; conſidering the Cuſtoms and Uſages in War thro' the World—It

appears neceſſary, that Men who profeſs Chriſtianity ſhould addict themſelves to the military Buſineſs and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that ſo they may be in a Readineſs to go forth to War; and that they really ſhould go forth, when called in the Providence of God ſo to do—And being ſuitably furniſhed with Martial Skill &amp; Weapons, relying <hi>upon the God of the Armies of Iſrael.</hi>

            <p>Let me add—When the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent for by, and came to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and was <hi>to teach him all Things commanded him of God;</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Context ver. 33.</note> Did he at all inform him that his military Profeſſion was inconſiſtent with Chriſtianity? He certainly preached Chriſt unto him, and was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of bringing him to the Faith of Jeſus—But not a Word did he ſay to condemn his Calling as a Soldier, which he would have done, exhorting and enjoining him, to throw down his Arms and quit his Poſt, if it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Chriſtianity—Moreover, when another Centurion addreſs'd himſelf to our Lord Jeſus, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that Teſtimony of his Faith from Chriſt—<hi>I have not found ſo great Faith, no not in</hi> Iſrael.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt 8. 10</note>—Chriſt himſelf does not condemn him for, or on Account of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</p>
            <p>And one would think that He would not have avoided it, if he had diſapproved of it, ſince the Centurion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him with his Situation and Employment in Life—<hi>I am a Man under Authority</hi> (ſays he) <hi>having Soldiers under me,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="§" place="bottom">Matt. 8. 9.</note> From which Silence of our bleſſed Lord in this Matter, we may conclude, that he has leſt Men to ſome prudent Methods of defending themſelves &amp; their invaluable Liberties and Priviledges, by the Uſe of the Sword; tho' the Precepts of his Religion are of Force enough, if rightly regarded, to reach them when, and how to do the ſame in a juſt and lawful Manner—Finally here—When the Soldiers came o <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt with that Queſtion—<hi>And what ſhall we do?</hi>

            <p>Therefore,</p>

As the military Employment conſiſts with Chriſtianity, ſo the Soldier and Chriſtian may unite in the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the Grace of God is ſufficient to ſubdue the Luſts of all Sorts of Men, and where it is wro't, it makes the Man, of whatever Character in Life, the more glorious—Yea the Chriſtian Soldier, is the Chriſtian Hero.</p>
            <p>But here I would obſerve—How or in what Reſpects a Soldier may and ought to demonſtrate his Piety and Religion—And then, if he does ſo, it will ſecure his Character, and raiſe his Honour much in the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I would in the firſt Place, <hi>Obſerve how a Soldier may and ought to demonſtrate his Piety and Religion in his Place and Station.</hi> And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In his Conduct and Behaviour toward God.</hi> He ſhould not take his ſacred Name in vain—But ſhould ſpeak of the great God, and uſe his Name with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Reverence and Submiſſion—So ſhould he alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>He ſhould be grave and ſolid in his Speech as well as Behaviour; not Light and frothy—He ſhould keep a Watch and Guard upon the Door of his Lips—His Tongue ſhould be under a good Regimen, and under the Reſtraints of Reaſon and Religion; And as he hath Opportunity he ſhould ſpeak of the Things which pertain unto Godlineſs—He ſhould be conſciencious in yielding to God that Worſhip which is his Due; he ſhould thus acknowledge God's Lordſhip in the World, and exalt the Name of God and the divine Honour as much as in him lies—He ſhould pay a juſt Regard to all divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions (not to keep his military Poſt, and to ſave his Pay) but out of a pure Regard to God and our Lord Jeſus—He ſhould be much in Prayer to God for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him, and upon his juſt and lawful Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> was a Man of Prayer—He <hi>prayed to God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>In his Conduct and Behaviour toward Men.</hi> He ſhould firſt of all <hi>approve himſelf loyal to his Prince,</hi> and faithful in his Place and Station, whether he is in Office, or a private Centinel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006825_0012_102A59DAE68C4940"/>
He ſhould conſider himſelf as under Authority, as the Centurion before mentioned did—as under the Authority of God, and the Authority of Kings and Governours—Having taken the Oath of Allegiance to his Sovereign, he <hi>ſhould perform unto the Lord his Oath</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth 5 33.</note>. Not deſerting his Poſt, not flying from his Colours, not giving up the Cauſe thro' Careleſſneſs or Cowardice, and to be ſure not thro' Treachery or Bribery.</p>
            <p>He ſhould make it evident that the publick Good lies near his Heart, and that he will defend and ſecure it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, and by his Help, in the Danger of his Life, and at the Expence of his very Blood if called to it—Again, <hi>he ſhould approve himſelf Juſt and Righteous in his Conduct toward his Fellow-Soldiers. If he is an Officer,</hi> he ſhould be as tender of the Lives of his Men, as is conſiſtent with the common Safety—Not thruſting them into needleſs Dangers, not being laviſh and prodigal of their Blood, not throwing away their Lives to gratify his own Pride and Ambition, or Rancour and Revenge.</p>
            <p>He ſhould conſider them as Men, and as Men highly deſerving their peculiar Rights and Priviledges at his Hands.</p>
            <p>He ſhould have a juſt Regard to the perſonal Merit and Bravery of his Soldiers, and fill up his Commiſſions with the Names of ſuch as diſtinguiſh themſelves moſt by their Loyalty, Bravery, and good moral Deportment.</p>
            <p>And not with the Names of ſuch as can crouch, and cringe, and fawn &amp; flatter, and give a good Sum of Money to purchaſe the ſame, when perhaps they may have nothing elſe to lay in as a Claim thereto.</p>
            <p>He ſhould ſee that the Rules of Juſtice and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are regarded and practiſed upon, by and among his Men, putting ſome Marks of Favour upon them that are honeſt and juſt, and puniſhing with Diſcretion, ſuch as are Diſhoneſt and Wicked.</p>
            <p>And then to be ſure, he ſhould do all in his Power, that his Soldiers ſhould have their juſt Wages,&amp; ſhould not allow himſelf upon any Conſideration whatever, frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently to pocket that which is their Due.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006825_0013_102A5A14D0CE9108"/>
               <hi>If he is a private Centinel,</hi> He ſhould be obedient to his proper Officers, diligent and faithful, juſt and honeſt in his Place and Station, ſhould <hi>be ready to go or to come;</hi> to <hi>do this or that,</hi> at the Word of Command—He ſhould do to his utmoſt, and be content with his juſt Allowance.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. In his <hi>Conduct and Behaviour with Reſpect to himſelf.</hi> He ſhould be ſober, chaſte and temperate in all Things, <hi>keeping under his own Body;</hi>

            <p>If he in any Combat with an Enemy ſhould come off Conquerer, he ſhould ſhew forth a generous, courteous and noble Spirit; and thereby ſhew, that he is Maſter of himſelf, and knows how to be merciful to the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py who lie at his Mercy.</p>
            <p>And if at any Time the Succeſs of the Engagement ſhould turn againſt him, and he ſhould be conquered, then he ſhould acquieſce in the Diſpoſal of Providence, and quietly and patiently bear his Misfortunes.—Theſe are ſome few Hints how a Soldier may and ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate his Piety and Religion, in his Place and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And now,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Soldier does thus demonstrate his Piety and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his Character is hereby ſerved, and his Honour raiſed much in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly ſuch a Character appears in quite agreable and beautiful Colours in the Eye of every Man, who thinks and judges right of Men and Things—Multitudes of Men in the World, and I may ſay not a few of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Sword, being too much wanting in the ſuitable Expreſſions of a true Regard to their Maker, yet can't but reverence and reſpect an Officer or Fellow-Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, whoſe martial Accompliſhments are accompanied with the Marks and Evidences of true and undiſſembled Piety and Vertue.</p>
            <p>To be ſure ſuch as are Friends to Religion and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they love to ſee Religion prevailing in the Hearts and Lives of all Sorts of Perſons; and reſpect them who
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006825_0014_102A59DC6D814EA8"/>
appear to be under the Influence of its Doctrines &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; ſo they look upon ſuch a Man's Character to be peculiarly bright and illuſtrious, and the more ſo, becauſe of its being ſo rare.</p>
            <p>If a Man in his military Poſt, enterprizes ſome bold and daring Action, and performs ſome noble Exploit, and is crowned with Succeſs, he generally attains to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a good Soldier.—But if it appear that his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is rational, the Effect of Faith and Truſt in God, and his Deportment is agreable to the Precepts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; his Character ſhines with a peculiar Luſtre.</p>
            <p>The Courage of a bold and daring Soldier, who is as irreligious, as he is bold, is no better, and deſerves no higher Encomium than the Courage of the <hi>Horſe which ruſheth into the Battle.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. 8. 6.</note> But to be valiant, and to do Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and to demonſtrate a Regard to God, who <hi>is the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and to ſhew forth a Subjection to the Laws of God and Chriſt; this is truly noble and Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.—Such a Soldier can't fail of obtaining a bright and excellent Character, ſo long as there are Men in the World capable of diſtinguiſhing ſuch a Merit from a meer vain and empty Shew of Greatneſs.</p>
            <p>But I may ſay ſomething further to this Point under the laſt Head.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the <hi>third</hi> Thing propoſed,</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Altho' the Buſineſs of a Soldier leads him Abroad in the World, and in the Field of Action, yet it is not beneath him, but his bounden Duty, piouſly to diſcipline his own Houſe or Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> was one engaged in a military Life, and yet the holy Ghoſt takes a ſpecial Notice of his Piety &amp; the Extent of it—His Religion operated toward and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it ſelf in the Family—He was upon military Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had the Care and Command of his Company, but yet was conſciencious as to other Duties.</p>
            <p>All with whom he had to do, ſhared in the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be derived from ſo good an Officer, and ſo good a Man—No Doubt it is deſigned for Imitation, or elſe there had not been ſuch a Notice taken of this Part of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006825_0015_102A5A177B951128"/>
his Character as there is—Yea and if the Soldier is now inquiſitive, and ſaying, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> The Anſwer founded upon this Warrant ſhall be, Go and do likewiſe; Conſider the Duty you owe to God and the King, in your publick Capacity—And don't neglect, but diſcharge the Duties alſo which are incumbent on you, in your more private Life and Station—And to be ſure, let your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies lie near your Hearts, and ſhare in your beſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Happineſs and Welfare to Mankind—There are Times indeed, in which the Soldier is called off from his own Family, and tho' ever ſo near and dear to him, he muſt march to his Poſt and Station, <hi>and jeopard his own Life unto the Death in the high Places of the Field;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Judg. 5. 18.</note> nor all the tendereſt Embraces, nor all the moſt pitiful Accents of thoſe as dear to him as Life itſelf, muſt ſtop him in his Purſuits after the common Safety, and the Deſtruction or Conqueſt of the common Enemy—In this Caſe the beſt he can do, will be to leave them in the Hands, and to commit them and himſelf, to the Care of a faithful Creator.</p>
            <p>But how unprepared for this, and in how poor a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner can he commit either himſelf or the deareſt Objects of his Love, to the keeping of a faithful God, if he has been living in Careleſneſs and Irreligion at Home?</p>
            <p>If his Houſe or Family which ſhould be as a well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined Company, is nothing more than a Cage of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Birds, and his Conſcience flies in his Face and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids him for the Neglect of his own Soul, and the Souls of them, whom he ought naturally to have cared for; it is not likely that his Courage will ſtand the Shock of a furious Battle; or that he will reſolutely fight for his Country, when he has already been unfaithful in his own more immediate and moſt important Betruſtments.</p>
            <p>But there are Times alſo in which the Soldier returns from the Field or the Camp, &amp; lives quietly at Home; and tho' he ſhould not even in thoſe Times, ſuffer himſelf to grow Effeminate, or ſuffer his Sword to ruſt in its Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard, and he himſelf careleſs as to military Exerciſes; yet in ſuch Seaſons he hath an Opportunity of minding
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006825_0016_102A59E02266ABD0"/>
and regarding his own Soul, and of training up his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold in the Way in which they ſhould go, i.e. in the Paths of Vertue and Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>This is not beneath the Soldier, it is his bounden Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—That Man's Notions of Honour muſt be very falſe, which cauſe him to think lightly of any Duty of the Chriſtian Life.</p>
            <p>That the Care of one's Family, and the religious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Education of the ſeveral Branches of it, is a Duty incumbent on all Heads of Families, whether in higher or lower Spheres of Action in the World, is as plain as that there are any Duties of Religion at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us—Yea the moſt high God puts Honour upon religious Heads of Families, let them be in what Stations they will—<hi>For I know him</hi> (ſaith God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham) <hi>that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the Lord,</hi> to <hi>do Justice and Judgment,</hi> that <hi>the Lord may bring upon Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> that <hi>which he hath ſpoken of him</hi>*</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> the valiant Leader of God's People, did not think it beneath him; but it is mentioned to his Honour, that he reſolved to be religious himſelf, and that his Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold ſhould be ſo too; <hi>But as for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the Lord.</hi>† And as I have diverſe Times ſaid, <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion, as he hath an honourable men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of him in the Chapter before us, ſo in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, this is ſpoken to his Honour in our Text, <hi>That he feared God with all his Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to the fourth and laſt Thing propoſed, which is,</p>
            <p>IV. <hi>That a good Soldier is highly to be valued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, eſpecially if he not only excells in military Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, but demonſtrates a reverential Regard to God, and the practical Duties of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be remembred that I ſaid, but juſt now, that the religious Soldier could not fail of obtaining a bright and excellent Character, ſo long as there were thoſe in the World, who could diſtinguiſh between real Merit, and a meer Shew of Greatneſs—And ſo it is—But it muſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006825_0017_102A5A1B4FBBE0B8"/>
be acknowledged, that tho' he ſhall aſſuredly be reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the un prejudiced, and Men of Noble, Chriſtian Spirits and Tempers—Yet too often, it is the Caſe, that thro' Envy, ill Will, and perſonal Prejudice, the faireſt Character is ſlur'd, and the Man that hath done worthily for his Country in his Place and Station, and has expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Life, and all Things dear, for the common Safety, in Dangers Abroad, and in Tumults at Home, ſhall be reviled and abuſed, defamed and ſlandered, and poorly, requited for his Services—But this ſhould not be.</p>
            <p>Good Patriots and Warriours, deſerve the higheſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours that a People can beſtow upon them.</p>
            <p>They deſerve more than empty Words of Praiſe, they deſerve ſuitable Rewards, Rewards proportionable to their Services—And it is an Argument, of Inſenſibility in a People, or of ill timed Parſimony not to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence Men according to their Merit and publick Ability, let them be in what Stations they will—To be ſure the Men who go forth to War, and do valiantly, and return with Succeſs, deſerve, from the higheſt Officer to the loweſt Centinel to be honourably and ſuitably rewarded, more eſpecially if they have voluntarily, kept their Hands from, or in Obedience to lawful Commands in the Camp, have not divided the Spoil and enrich'd themſelves with their Enemies Goods and Eſtates; the common Uſage and Cuſtom in War.</p>
            <p>Indeed it may prove poor Policy in the End, when ſuch Men and ſuch Services are not ſuitably rewarded—Men may grow diſcouraged, and a Remembrance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ill Uſage, may prove of bad Conſequence in any new deſigned Enterprize.</p>
            <p>But it is alſo Ingratitude in a People not to honour and reward ſuch as have done worthily, and been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of acquiring new Glory, and great Intereſts, to a Nation or Country—And Ingratitude is a Crime as black and odious in a People, as it is in a particular Perſon.</p>
            <p>And however the Caſe may be, ſometimes, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Honours and Rewards are by unreaſonable Lets and Hindrances, with-holden—Yet every Perſon in his own

Heart and Mind ſhould value the Man that hath acted his Part well, or gives ſufficient Grounds in and by his martial Accompliſhments, to hope that he would do ſo if called to Action; and is withal a Man of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p>As War is ſometimes unavoidable, ſo Soldiers are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary—And if there are thoſe that give their Minds to the Study of the Art of War, and are pious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, juſt and righteous toward Men, chaſte, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and vertuous toward themſelves—And ruling well their own Houſes, and not only yielding a good Example, but giving good Inſtruction, and maintaining Family Religion, Order and Government—Doing their Duty to ſuch as are immediately under their Care—This as it encourages our Hopes as to their future Valour and Serviceableneſs, ſo it calls for our preſent Eſteem and Reſpect, and all ſuitable Acknowledgments—Such Men will be valued by the judicious and unprejudiced Part of the World—They will live in Credit and Reputation; they will die regreted and lamented, and their Memory will be honoured by all ſober good Men.</p>
            <p>It now remains that I ſay ſomething by <hi>Way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement or Application.</hi>

            <p>And tho' I might deduce many Things from what has been ſaid, more than the Time will now allow of—yet ſhall only ſay as follows—</p>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006825_0019_102A5A1CE1857F48"/>
Wars and Fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your Luſts, that war in your Members?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jam. 4. 1.</note> The Goſpel is the moſt pure and excellent in it ſelf, and <hi>teaches Men how to deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts.</hi>

            <p>In the Goſpel there are the beſt Maxims and Principles laid down, the beſt Motives ſuggeſted, the beſt Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples exhibited, and a ſufficiency of Grace offered, whereby Men may come to be evangelically perfect and compleat in the whole Will of God—And in the Article of War, either with a Heatheniſh or Chriſtian People (which is ſometimes as unavoidable, as it is undeſirable) Men ſhould engage in the Warfare with a ſuitable Regard to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as they would avoid the Imputation of Inconſiſtency in their Tempers and Conduct, with the Orders of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; tho' warring it ſelf is conſiſtent with Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>They ſhould ſee to it that their Ends and Aims be Right—That they are not elated with Pride and lawleſs Ambition—That they are not fluſhed with an eager De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after vain Glory, that they are not avaritious and inſatiable.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let the Soldier learn, that however dignified he is by his Commiſſion, or in his Poſt and Station; yet his real Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is but mean and contemptible, if he is impious and irreligious.</hi> Vice and irreligion are odious in Perſons of

low Life. How much more ſo, in Men raiſed above the common Level of Mankind; who are apt to make great Pretenſions to, and Profeſſions of Heroiſm? To ſee or hear of a military Man off his Watch and Guard, vain and profane in his Speech, immoral in his Life, unjuſt and unrighteous in his Poſt and Station, and irreligious in his own Houſe, this ſullies his Character; and tho' he might have done many worthy Actions as a Warriour, yet hereby he loſes all his ſubſtantial Glory—Such an one perhaps may have ſome external Reſpects paid him by ſome—But yet moſt Men are void of any real cordial Regard to, and Eſteem of him.</p>
            <p>To be ſure he has no Share in the Value and Eſteem of Men of Piety and Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let <hi>what has been ſaid, ſerve to excite in Men of the military Order, a real Deſire, and earneſt Endeavour after thoſe Qualifications and Accompliſhments which will render them truly excellent and honourable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soldiers Employment is in no wiſe ignoble in it ſelf.—He therefore that would be a good Soldier, an Honour to his Profeſſion, and an Ornament to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try—ſhould endeavour to get his Mind well furniſhed with military Skill, and the beſt Maxims for the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Conduct.</p>

            <p>It is with Pleaſure, that we behold ſo many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of good Education and Chriſtian Deportment at the Heads of the ſeveral Regiments thro' the Province.</p>

It would alſo be a Pleaſure to ſee them exerting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their ſeveral Poſts to advance the Credit and Reputation of the Militia in every ſuitable Way.</p>
            <p>Their Care to fill up their Commiſſions with the Names of ſuch as are known in our ſeveral Towns, to be Men of a military Genius, Men of honeſt and righteous Principles, Men of Sobriety and Temperance, and of a moral and Chriſtian Behaviour, would have a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence—And in Caſe of a War, it is probable ſuch would be faithful in their Places and Stations, juſt and honeſt in their Betruſtments, and prevent any future Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of poor Soldiers, with Reſpect to their Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Wages.</p>
            <p>Activity and Diligence in ſuperiour Officers with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to military Exerciſes, would be ſerviceable to revive the martial Spirit; and would put lower Officers and common Soldiers upon ſome Efforts to excel in their ſeveral Poſts and Ranks.</p>
            <p>Exemplary Piety and true Religion in ſuch, would have a mighty Influence upon them who are rather more apt to obſerve and imitate what is laudible in their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, than to obey their bare Words of Command.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Gentlemen of the</hi> ARTILLERY:</p>
            <p>You need not to be urged to the Study of Arms, or to accuſtom your ſelves to military Exerciſes—Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice and your laudible Endeavour forbid this.</p>
            <p>Yet you may, conſiſtently enough, and without any Reflection upon your Honour, be caution'd againſt any Levity or Careleſſneſs in theſe Matters—Likewiſe alſo may you with Propriety be put in Mind of the great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion incumbent on you, and of what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from you by God and his People.</p>
            <p>You will therefore, I perſuade my ſelf, regard what has been ſaid in: the ſeveral Parts of this Diſcourſe—And endeavour yet further by your conſtant military Exerciſes, and that upon the Principles and from the Motives of Chriſtianity to be prepared for ſpecial Service, as God in his Providence ſhall call you to it.</p>
            <p>

Your <hi>Company is Ancient and Honourable,</hi> this is juſtly your Style—But we ſhall eſteem you more honourable for your Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and your practical Regards to the Duties of Religion, than even for your Age, or your military Accompliſhments—Not that theſe latter Things are diſregarded by us, but becauſe they are and will be rendered the more agreable and beautiful by the former.</p>
            <p>Nor yet, Gentlemen, do I deſign to flatter; but muſt exhort you to <hi>Watchfulneſs.</hi> This is your Duty as Soldiers, and as Chriſtian Profeſſors—As you would watch againſt your worldly Enemies; ſo you are to watch againſt your ſpiritual ones—Watch againſt the Corruptions of your own Hearts—Againſt the Influence of bad Examples in the World, &amp; againſt the Deceivings of Satan. Prove your own ſelves, and ſee that you are approved of God in your Profeſſion &amp; Practice. <hi>For not be that commendeth himſelf,</hi> or is commended of others, <hi>is approved,</hi> but <hi>whom the Lord commendeth.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10. 18.</note> There is one Thing farther in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which be ſpeaks you, Gentlemen, with Propriety, from the Character open'd in the foregoing Diſcourſe, and that is relating to your Family Piety and Religion—Thro' the Indulgence of God, you are not called at this Time, to go forth to the Battle—Will you therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your Time and Opportunities for the well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; diſciplining your Houſes—It is not beneath you, it is what God expects of you—In this Way you will not only have Comfort your ſelves, in the various Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine Providence, with Reſpect to you and yours, but will do Service for the Publick, and give us Hope of your future Fidelity and Serviceableneſs in your more publick Poſts and Stations—Look upon your ſelves and your Families in Relation to another World—See to it, that you and yours are Partakers of the Grace of God, and that you and they are living in the Fear of God daily. Then may you commit your ſelves &amp; them into the Hands of your Covenant God.</p>
            <p>Then may you expect to be reſpected while you live. Then may you quit the preſent Field of Action, when

            <p>We ſhould give <hi>Honour to whom Honour is due.</hi>

            <p>Let us ever guard againſt Envy, Prejudice and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction—Let the Soldier be reſpected by us in his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—Let us commend his Bravery—Honour him for his Piety, and as far as our Power and Influence reach, reward his Services.</p>
            <p>Let us reſpect and honour the Gentlemen in Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſeveral Regiments—The honourable Company now in Arms; and the other<note n="†" place="bottom">The honourable Company of CADETS under the Command of <hi>Benjamin Pollard,</hi>

            <p>But Finally,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let it be remembred by all of us here preſent, in whatever Stations we be, that there is a War to be engaged in and proſecuted by every one of us, which is not only conſiſtent with Christianity, but which the Goſpel even obliges and animates unto.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>By Reaſon of Sin, all Men are in Danger of being led Captive by Satan at his Will and Pleaſure, and of being ruin'd and undone forever.</p>
            <p>The Devil is our conſtant and inveterate Enemy—By his Temptation and Solicitation we at firſt revolted from God, our rightful Lord and Sovereign; and ſo long as Luſt and Corruptions remain unmortified in us, we are in the Service of this accurſed Foe—If then we would return Home to God, &amp; ſecure and ſave our ſelves from eternal Ruin, we muſt reſiſt the Devil, and gain a Victory over our Hearts Luſts.</p>
            <p>This is the moſt difficult Warfare; but yet not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but that we may, and ſhall (thro' the Help of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace) manage it with Succeſs, and come off in the End more than Conquerers.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel obliges all Men to this. The Goſpel gives us all ſuitable Directions and Motives, and exhibits the beſt Example to animate us to, and to encourage us in the Combat.</p>
            <p>Chriſt hath undertaken for us, hath waded thro' a Sea of Blood, hath fought for us and overcome.—<hi>Who is this that cometh from</hi> Edom, <hi>with died Garments from</hi> Bozrah? <hi>This that is glorious in his Apparel,</hi> and <hi>travelling in the Greatneſs of his Strength?

            <p>Let us therefore Liſt under his Banner—Let us be Voluntiers in his Service, and the Service of our Souls. And Oh that God <hi>would make us willing in the Day of his Power.</hi>

            <p>And we truſt, that thoſe who have not as yet ſhared in the ſame Troubles, either Perſonally or in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, have had you in their Hearts, in their Prayers to God, begging that your Faith and Patience might not fail.</p>
            <p>And that God would hereby awaken you and all, to Repentance and a thoro' Reformation.</p>

            <p>And indeed it is vain to talk of a Revival of Religion, or of a general Reformation, while Men in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue immoral in their Lives, and irreligious in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>If the Hand of God upon you, is ſanctified to you; and if you of this Town are bro't to be exemplary in your Piety—If you ſhew a good Regard to the Day &amp; Houſe of the Lord, if you walk in the Paths of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and your Families appear to be under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Religion—Then your Example will, we hope, be of happy Influence upon all our Towns—But if you ſhould continue in Vice and Wickedneſs, in Pride and Extravagance, in Irreligion and Licenciouſneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſuperiour Advantages you enjoy, with Reſpect to the preached Goſpel and other Means of Grace, and notwithſtanding the awful Rebukes of God—Then it is to be feared that your Example will have a very bad Influence upon all Parts of the Land; and that God will juſtly leave us to fill up the Meaſure of our Sins, and to ripen for Deſtruction.</p>
