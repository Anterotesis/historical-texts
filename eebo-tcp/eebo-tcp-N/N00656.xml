            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A CASE of Conscience Concerning <hi>Eating of Blood,</hi> Considered and Answered.</head>
            <p>COncerning that Case of Conscience, <hi>Whether the Eating of Blood be Lawful</hi>? I find that many not only of the more Ignorant, &amp; Common Professors of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, but some very Learned men among them, have Inclined to the Negative in the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proposed. So did some of the Ancients, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and the Author of the Questions and Answers to the Orthodox, which passeth under the Name of <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> Like-wise <hi>Eusebius</hi> relates, that when St. <hi>Biblis</hi> was put upon the Rack to make her Confess, that Christians were wont to Eat Infants (for so had the Accuser of the Brethren made the Heathen Believe) she Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>How should they Eat Children, when they Abstain from all Eating of Blood</hi>? Also, in the Book of Canons falsly pretended to be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, the Sixty Third Canon declares, that <hi>If any one in Holy Orders, Eateth Blood, he shall be Degraded, but if he be a Lay man, he shall be Excommunicated.</hi> Moreover, some Old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have condemned it, as Unlawful: And some Emperours have by very severe Laws, Inhibited all Blood-Eating. The most Remarkable is that Ordinance of the Emperour <hi>Leo,</hi> Sirnamed the Philosopher <hi>A D.</hi> 886. He sayes, that <hi>He had received Information<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that there were some, who stuffed Blood into Guts, or in Bags, and did Eat
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000798_0002_0FAA5277E6E4AE28"/>
the same, as usual Meat: He does therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mand that no Person should dare so to Practice himself<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or to Sell such things to others; declaring that both Buyer and Seller, shall have all his Goods forfeited, his Head Shaven, and himself sent into Perpetual Banishment.</hi> It is further True, that the Christian <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Russians, Abyssines, Maronites,</hi> have abstained from the Eating of Blood, as unlawful. Nor are those Christians free from far greater Superstition than this Some late Authors have Written against it: So <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Curcedaeus</hi> in his Treatise <hi>De Vsu Sanguinis</hi>; Dr. <hi>Du Veil,</hi> in his Commentary on Acts 15 29 And Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> the late Bishop of <hi>Lyncoln,</hi> whose Arguments in the Opinion of the <hi>Athenian Mercury</hi> (March 3, 1694.) are of such weight<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as that <hi>they will make his Antagonist sweat to Answer them.</hi> This notwithstanding, the Generality of Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines maintain the Affirmative, in the Question under Consideration. So <hi>Pareus, Rivet, Calvin, Willet,</hi> and many others in their Commentaries on <hi>Gen</hi> 9 4. So <hi>Voetius de Politia Ecclesiastica,</hi> Part 1. Pag. 471. who refers his Reader for Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in that point to <hi>Libavius</hi> and <hi>Horn-beck</hi> his <hi>Diatriba de Sanguine &amp; suff<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> So among Episcopal Divines, Bishop <hi>Richardson,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> Thus also some of the Ancients. <hi>Quadra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> (an old Christian Philosopher who affirms, that in his Time, some of the Persons on whom our Saviour wrought Miraculous Cures were still Living) maintains (as is testified by <hi>Bede</hi>) that there is no Meat from which a Christian ought to abstain Vid. <hi>Monologium Graecorum,</hi> in Septemb 21 See <hi>Dupin</hi> Vol. 1. p. 48. But it is not the Practice or Authority of men, without Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Convincing Reason, that can Determine, or
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000798_0003_0FAA527B11C6A4D8"/>
satisfy Conscience. For my own part, I concur with the Generallity of Protestant Christians, as to the Case under Debate. And that especially for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Meat does in its own Nature defile, Math. 15.11. <hi>Not that which goeth into the Mouth Defileth the man.</hi> I suppose that the Apostle hath Respect unto those Words of our Saviour, when he says, <hi>I know and am perswaded by the Lord Iesus, that there is nothing Vnclean of it self,</hi> Rom. 14 14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures of the New-Testament give such a General Allowance for the Eating of all sorts of Meats as doth Comprehend that of <hi>Blood,</hi> There is that Scripture, Rom. 14.2 <hi>One Believeth that he may Eat all things</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he that Believed so, was Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in his Judgment as to that particular, And it was from <hi>Weakness in Faith,</hi> that is from Ignorance of the Latitude of Christian Liberty, under the Gospel, that any did Haesitate about it. Now if the Christian may Eat <hi>All Things,</hi> then <hi>Blood.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Scripture is that in 1 Tim. 4.3, 4. where the Apostle condemns the Superstition of those, <hi>That Abstain from Meats, which God had created to be received with Thanksgiving of them, which Believe and Know the Truth, for every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be Received with Thanksgiving</hi> Now if <hi>Nothing</hi> is to be Refused, then <hi>Blood</hi> is not to be Refused. Another Scripture is that 1 Cor. 10 25. <hi>Whatsoever is Sold in the Shambles, that Eat, asking no Question for Conscience sake</hi> It was usual to Sell <hi>Blood</hi> in the Shambles, If therefore we may Eat not some Things only, but <hi>whatever</hi> is Sold in the Shambles, we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Eat <hi>Blood,</hi> for that is there Sold,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are Medicinal Uses of Blood. Our
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000798_0004_0FAA527BD18BDDF8"/>
Modern Physicians have found, that the Spirit of Blood is a wonderful Restorative, may not a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> who is in a Consumption make use of that Spirit for the Recovering of his Impaired Health, and Preservation of his Life, according to the Sixth Commandment, only because <hi>Iews</hi> were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited things made of Blood?</p>
            <p n="4">4 If it be Lawful to Eat things Strangled, then it is Lawful to Eat Blood. The Consequence is undeniable. And the Jews were as much bound in Conscience to abstain from things Strangled, as from Blood, and they Practise accordingly to this Day; Some of the Popes have denied Christians this Liberty. So did Pope <hi>Zachary,</hi> A D. <hi>circiter.</hi> 756 Also several Councils that were Convened in the Dayes of Popery, but <hi>Austin</hi> declares, that in his Time, if any man scrupled the Eating <hi>things Strangled,</hi> (which had the Blood in 'em) he was Laughed at by all the World v. <hi>August</hi> Lib. 32. <hi>contra Faustum.</hi> cap 13. If a man among us should affirm that it is unlawful to Eat an Hare, or a Rabbet, killed by a stroke in the Neck, or a Pigeon caught in a Net, he would be Ridi'cled by most people. If the Eating of a <hi>thing that dies of it self,</hi> is lawful, then to Eat things Strangled, or with the Blood in them, is so too; but this is, and ever was Lawful for the Gentiles, Deut. 14 21. <hi>Thou shalt not eat any thing that dyeth of it self,, thou shalt give it to the Stranger, that he may eat it, or Sell it to an Alien.</hi> Divines argue strongly concerning <hi>Vsury,</hi> that the Prohibition of it to the Jews, was only a <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and not a <hi>Moral</hi> Precept, because they might take Use for Mony Lett to Strangers. There is a Parity of Reason, as to this Case. He that Eats that which dies of it self, eats Blood. This the Gentiles might do. Therefore Eating of Blood
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000798_0005_0FAA527DDE8D6558"/>
was not against the Moral Law.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All Precepts which were only Ceremonial &amp; not Moral, are Abrogated by the Death of Christ. Col. 2.16, 17. Gal. 4.9. Heb 9.10 such was this concerning the not Eating of Blood, as appears from the Reason of the Prohibition mentioned, Lev. 17.11. <hi>For the Life of the Flesh is in the Blood, and I have given it you upon the Altar to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for your Souls, for it is the Blood that makes an Atonement.</hi> Blood the Organ of Life, was Holy to God the Author of Life, &amp; therefore they should not Profane it by Eating thereof. Now this is a Ceremonial Reason, Blood was a Sacred Thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to be offer'd to God for making Atonement, as Typical of the Blood of Christ. Wherefore since Christ has shed his Blood, there is no Sacredness in any other Blood.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew Doctors object, that there were six Precepts given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and so to the <hi>Antediluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which were all of them Moral and Perpetual unto the Observation whereof all Mankind is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And that a Seventh was added and given to <hi>Noah, viz.</hi> That Gen 9.4. <hi>The Flesh with the Life thereof, which is the Blood thereof, thou shalt not Eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Answer. Not to Insist upon the Falseness of that <hi>Rabbinical Notion</hi> of Seven Precepts in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, the Error whereof <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>sius</hi> has shewn in his <hi>Nucleus Prophetiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some of the <hi>Iewish Masters</hi> themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the Precept which forbids Eating Blood, does concern only Israelites, and not other Nations. Rabbi <hi>Solomon,</hi> and some others of the Rabbins sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Text does only forbid the Eating of the Flesh of Creatures, whilst they are yet Living, and the Drinking of their Blood. This Interpretation is followed by <hi>Cajetan, Mercer, Aynsworth,</hi> the <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000798_0006_0FAA527E07C55D58"/>
Annotators</hi> &amp; some others. It is an usual Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome among the Barbarous <hi>Scythians</hi> to drink the Blood of their Horses. Also the <hi>Arabians</hi> will draw Blood from their Camels and Drink it. Mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing used to Blood makes them ferocious, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, as we see in Butchers, whence our English Laws permit not Butchers to be Jury-men in cases of Life and Death. According to this Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Design of that Precept to <hi>Noah,</hi> is to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all Inhumanity, which suits with the next verse, containing a Prohibition of Murder. But</p>
            <p n="2">2 'Tis a mistake to think, that all the Precepts given to <hi>Noah,</hi> were Moral, binding all his Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all the Ages of the World. For in his Dayes there was a Distinction made betwixt Clean and Unclean Beasts. Gen. 7.2. which was a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and not a Moral Commandment: And so was Sacrificing required of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Patriarchs before the Flood. And for that Reason it was not meet that they should Eat Blood.</p>
            <p>It is further Objected, That there was a <hi>Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Decree</hi> against the Eating Blood, in the Apostles Dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> that Acts 15 20. To which may be Answered, that the Apostolical Advice was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Scandal, which at that time, would have happened, in case the Converted Gentiles should have practised the Eating of Blood, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was only a <hi>Temporary Advice,</hi> &amp; not a Precept binding all Christians to the End of the World. <hi>Cessatio Causae efficit ut cessaret Observatio.</hi> The Learned and Judicious <hi>Turretin</hi> does by divers Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons prove, that that Precept was not of perpetual Observation. He argueth, that <hi>Paul</hi> was present in the Synod at Jerusalem, and knew the true Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Advice given<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Nevertheless he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wrote those Epistles, in which he allows the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000798_0007_0FAA527EB70D7D98"/>
Eating of all sorts of meat, without any Limitation, which he would not have done, if the Decree, at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem had been of perpetual Observation. But in those Dayes the Eating of Blood would have scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliz'd the Jews. That Practice was so abhorrent to them, as that it would have Endangered their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prejudiced against all Christianity, had they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that all Christians indulged themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; on which account, to abstain from it was then <hi>necessary,</hi> verse 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. It would also have been Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Gentiles among whom the Eating of Blood was an Idolatrous Rite. Psal. 16.4. The <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> used to drink some of the Blood of their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Book of <hi>Wisdom</hi> informs us, that the old Canaanites had Blood in their Feasts. And <hi>Lanctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> testifies, that the Heathen at the Feast of <hi>Bacchus</hi> were wont to Drink Goats Blood; they would also Boil Blood, &amp; mix it with Meat &amp; Spices, &amp; so Eat it at their Sacrifices, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Botulos Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

does not forbid them to do it, in their own Houses, because in the one place it might be without Scandal, but not in the other. There is then no Validity in the Objection. <hi>Eating of Blood &amp; Fornication</hi> are conjunctly mentioned, therefore they are of the same Nature. We find in other Scriptures that Precepts, which are only <hi>Iudicial,</hi> are conjunctly mentioned with those that are <hi>Moral.</hi> Thus in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. The taking of a <hi>Pledge,</hi> &amp; <hi>Usury,</hi> Judicial Precepts, are condemned with <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry</hi> &amp; <hi>Adultery,</hi> hainous Transgressions of the Moral Law, unlawful to be done by any persons, in any place, or at any time. Moreover, the Gentiles esteemed <hi>Fornication</hi> to be no sin at all, yea, the Unclean Spirit unto whom they Sacrificed, taught them to make it a part of their Idolatrous Worship; Witness that shameful thing <hi>Baal peo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Another late <hi>Annotator</hi> conceives, that the Thing more especially Designed, is to forbid that <hi>Concubinate,</hi> which was commonly practised both by Jews and Gentile, the Evil whereof was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, until discovered by the Light of the Gospel. These four things<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>Idolothytes, Fornication, Strangled and Blood</hi> were the Rites of Idolatry commonly practised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Nations, so that the Gentiles by abstaining from them, declared a perfect Renunciation of their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, which Dr <hi>Spencer</hi> in his late Learned Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, takes to be the special Reason why those four parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are by the Apostles instanced in.</p>
