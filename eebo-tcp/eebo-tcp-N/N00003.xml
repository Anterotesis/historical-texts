            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which treacherous plots were confirmed by the Indians generall preparations, messages, insolencies and outrages against the English &amp; such Indians as were subjects or freinds to them, so that the English Colonies, to their great charge and damage, were forced to Arm, to keep strong watch day &amp; night, and some of them to travail with convoyes from one plantation to another: and when Miantonimo in his circular travel was questioned at New-Haven concerning these thing, in stead of other &amp; bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction he threatened to cut off any Indians head that sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Commissioners by the premises observed Miantonimo's proud and treacherous disposition, yet thought not fit to proceed against him in that respect, till they had collected more legal and convincing proof.</p>
            <p>But while these things were under deliberation, Miantonimo was brought prisoner by Uncas to Hartford, and the case being opened &amp; clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as followeth, he craved the commissioners advice how to proceed with him.</p>

at all acquainting the English or advising with them, but more especially of late since the fore-mentioned plots and designes were in hand.</p>
            <p>First, a Pequot Indian one of Uncas his subjects in the spring 1643 aiming at Uncas life, shot him with an arrow through the arm, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently fled to the Narrowgansets or their confoederates, boasting in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian plantations that he had killed Uncas; but when it was known Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas (though wounded) was alive, the Pequot (taught as was supposed) chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his note, affirming that Uncas had cut through his owne arm with a flint, and had hyred him to say he had shot and killed him.</p>
            <p>Miantonimo being sent for by the Governour of the Massachusets upon another occasion, brought this Pequot with him, and would have covered him with the former disguise, but when the English out of his owne mouth found him guilty, and would have sent him to Uncas his Sagam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re Miantonimo earnestly desired he might not be taken out of his hands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising he would send him safe to Uncas to be examined and punished.</p>
            <p>But fearing (as it seems) his owne treachery would be discovered, within a day or two, he stopped the Pequots mouth by cuting off his head, but at parting he told the Governour in discontent, that he would com no more to Boston.</p>
            <p>After this, some attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by poyson and by sorcery; these failing, som of Sequassons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (an Indian Sagamore allyed unto, and an intimate confoederate with Miantonimo) shot at Uncas with an arrow or two, as he was going down Conecticot river: Uncas according to the fore-mentioned treaty 1638 complained, and the English by mediation sought to make peace, but Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quasson expressing his dependance on Miantonimo refused, and chose warr. They fought, and Uncas had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Miantonimo without any provocotion from Uncas [unles the dissappointment of former plots provoaked] and suddenly without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing warr, came upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>These things being duly weighed, the Commissioner judged that Uncas could not be safe, while Miantonimo lived, wherefore they thought he might justly put such a treacherous, and bloud-thirsty enemie to death; but advised him to doe it in his owne Jurisdiction, without torture or crueltie. And Uncas having hitherto shewed himselfe a friend to the English, and in this and former outrages (according to the treaty) craving their advise, if the Narrowgansets o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their confoederats should for his just execution unjustly assault him, the Commissioners for the Colonies promised to assist and protect him.</p>
            <p>Uncas heerupon slew an enemy, but not the enmity against him. The Narrowgansets soon fell to new contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This for a while cast an imputation of foule &amp; unjust dealing upon Uncas; but in September 1644 the English Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners meeting at Hartford, sent for the Narrowganset Sachems or their Deputies desiring they might be instructed to make good their charge.</p>
            <p>Uncas came himselfe, they sent their Deputies; but after due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination it appeared, though some loose discourses had passed that for such quantitie of wampom and such parcels of other goods to a great value, there might have been some probability of sparing his life, yet no such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels were brought, and the Narrowganset Deputies did not alledge; much lesse prove, that any ransom was agreed, nor so much as any serious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty begun, to redeem their imprisoned Sachem. And for the wampom and goods sent, as they were but small parcels and scarce considerable for such a purpose, so they were disposed by Miantonimo himselfe to sundry persons for curtesies received during his imprisonment, and upon hope of further favour.</p>
            <p>The Narrowganset Deputies saw their proofs fell far short of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer preten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Wherupon a truce was made, and both parties were ingaged that all hostility should cease till planting time 1645: and after that, they would give thirty days <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> but with expresse direction not to begin any offensive warr against the Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets or their confoederates till further order.</p>

            <p>The Commissioners being met, sent messengers the second time both to the Narrowganset and Mohiggin Indians, minding them of the former treatise and truce, desiring them to send their Deputies instructed and furnished with authority to declare and open the ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At first the Narrowganset Sache<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gave a reasonable and faire an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he would send Guides with them to the Mohiggins, and if Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas consented, he would send his Deputies to the Commissioners, and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight days hostility should cease: but he soon repented of this modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, told the English messengers his minde was chang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

themselves) by the course held at Hartford last yeare, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ers would mediate &amp; presse for peace, but they were resolved to have no peace without Uncas his head; it mattered not who began the warr, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hey were resolved to continue it; the English should withdraw their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison from Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, &amp; would procure as many Moquanks as the English should affront them with: that they would lay the English cattle o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaps as high as their houses: that no English man shold step out of doors to pisse, but he should be killed. They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his own arm, and saying the Narrowgansets had shot him; affirmed, that he would now murder the English messengers as they went or returned [if he had oppertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity] and lay it upon<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Narrowgansets.</p>
            <p>The English messengers upon this rude and uncivil usage, wanting Guides to proceed, and fearing danger, returned to the Narrowgansets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted Pesicus with the former passages, desired Guides from him, he [in scorne as they apprehended it] offered them an old Pequot Squaw, but would afford no other Guides. There also they conceived themselves in danger, three Indians with hatchets standing behinde the Interpreter in a suspicious manner, while he was speaking with Pesicus, and the rest frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; expressing much distemper in their countenance &amp; carriage. The English messengers not hoping for better successe at that time, departed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> telling Pessicus that if he would returne any other answer, he should send it to the English trading-house, where they intended to lodge that night. In the morning he invited them to returne, and promised them a Guide to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, but would grant no cessation of Armes. When they came to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they understood that in their absence a Narrowganset Indian had bin there, and faining himselfe to be of Conecticot, spake in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowganset tone. He told Benedict Aarnold's wife (who well understands the Indian language) that the English messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers should not passe to the Mohiggins, he knew they shold have no Guides, but should be destroyed in the woods as they travelled toward Uncas.</p>
            <p>Thus the English messengers returned, and the Interpreter under his hand &amp; upon his oath related the former passages, with others lesse material more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. Williams by the messengers wrote to the Commissioners assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them <hi>That the Country would suddenly be all on fyre, meaning by warr; that by strong reasons &amp; arguments he could convince any man therof, that was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  </gap>ed resolutions for warre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus while the Commissioners in care of the publick peace, sought to quench the fire kindled amongst the Indians, these children of strife breath out threatnings, provocations and warr against the English themselves, so that unles they should dishonour &amp; provoak God, by violating a just ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and expose the Colonies to contempt &amp; danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but exercise force, when no other meanes will prevail, to reduce the Narrowgansets and their confoederates to a more just and sober temper.</p>
            <p>The eyes of other Indians under the protection of the Massachusets, and not at all ingaged in this quarrel, are [as they have expressed themselves to the English messenger] fastened upon the English with strict observatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in what manner and measure they provide for Uncas safety. If he perish they will charge it upon them who might have preserved him: and no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l trust the English (if they now breake ingagement) either in the present or succeeding generations. If Uncas be ruined in such a cause, they foresee their head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon the next pretence shal be delivered to the wil of the Nartowgansets, with whom therfore they shall be forced to complye [as they may] for their future safety; &amp; the English may not trust an Indian in the whole Country.
