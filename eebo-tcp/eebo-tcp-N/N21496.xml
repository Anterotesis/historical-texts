            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is not pretended that any new arguments are advanced in this perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; nor does the author suppose that there is any need of referring to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar books which he has frequently consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when engaged in studies of this kind. If the reader ſhould find any of these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, in the works of <hi>Ditton, West, Lardner, Stackhouse, Doddridge, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> or other eminent writers, he will there see the same subjects treated with more learning and energy, than in this compendium; which is designed for those who have not leisure or opportunity to look into more voluminous works.</p>

            <head>ON THE NATURE OF THAT EVIDENCE BY WHICH THE GOSPEL IS SUPPORTED.</head>
            <p>IT has been the fate of many great and illuſtrious characters, to be miſrepreſented; and to have different opinions formed of them by perſons of different parties and prejudices; but there never was a perſon on earth who has, for ſo long a time been a ſubject of controverſy as JESUS CHRIST. The controverſy has aſſumed various forms, and has been ſtimulated by various paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and intereſts; but it has never been diſcontinued, or, if ſilent awhile, it has broken out again from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028256_0006_0FD847D91247DEE0"/>The oppoſition to the goſpel at this time, appears in a different form from that in the early days of chriſtianity. Then the followers of Chriſt, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed before magiſtrates, or inſulted by mobs, or anathematized by ſynagogues and councils; now, our perſons are ſafe, and our religious worſhip is undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed; but we hear our maſter defamed, and the writers of his life abuſed. The extraordinary facts which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, are either repreſented as incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; or made the ſubject of profane wit. A ſpecies of vulgar infidelity, founded partly in pedantry, partly in debauchery and partly in ill manners, is inſinuating itſelf into the minds of the thoughtleſs; and the moſt ſacred truths are rejected and ridiculed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an examination of their evidence, or a conſideration of their importance.</p>
            <p>Among other ebullitions of this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of infidelity lately preſented to the "Citizens of America" by a popular writer, I find the following.<note n="*" place="bottom">Age of reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 14. American Edition.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:028256_0007_0FD8480B8D3823D8"/>"THOMAS did not believe the reſurrection; and <hi>would</hi> not believe, without having ocular and manual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration himſelf. So neither <hi>will</hi> I; and the reaſon is equally as good for me, and for every other perſon, as for Thomas."</p>
            <p>It is true that Thomas did not believe the report of the reſurrection from his brethren; but it is equally true that when he had ſatisfactory evidence of its truth he did believe it. At the ſame time that Jeſus condeſcended to give him all the "ocular and manual demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion," which it was neceſſary for him <hi>as an apoſtle</hi> to have, he accompanied the condeſcenſion with this memorable declaration. "Thomas, becauſe thou haſt <hi>ſeen</hi> me thou haſt believed, bleſſed are they who have <hi>not ſeen</hi> and yet have believed."<note n="*" place="bottom">John 11.29.</note> Plainly giving him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the actual ſight which he demanded, and with which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, is not equally neceſſary for all,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028256_0008_0FD847DACD5B2C98"/>
as for him; but that there may be a true faith without it; that perſons who have not enjoyed it, and who cannot enjoy it, may have ſuch evidence offered to them as will be a ſufficient ground of faith, and give them a title to true bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. What this evidence is, may be learned from the remark of the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical hiſtorian immediately following.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 30, 31.</note>"Many other ſigns truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his diſciples, which are not written in this book; but theſe are written, that ye might believe, that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God; and that believing, ye might have life, through his name."</p>
            <p>Whilſt the apoſtles lived, their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony delivered in their public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate diſcourſes amounted to credible evidence of this great event; but as they knew themſelves to be mortal, they were directed by the ſame influence which conducted them through all their evangelical labours to commit to writing
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028256_0009_0FD8480D01F874A0"/>
ſuch things as were neceſſary to be a proper foundation for faith. Though they did not record every diſcourſe, or every ſign, or action of their maſter, yea though they might omit ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of thoſe things which they have recorded; yet there is enough written to convince every ſerious and candid inquirer, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the Son of God and therefore that there is a ſure foundation for the hope of ſalvation by him.</p>
            <p>The goſpel, and particularly that capital part of it, the reſurrection of Jeſus, is propoſed to us, not barely as an object of faith; but as containing the hope of eternal life. It is ſet before us, not merely to be believed as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact; but to be truſted in as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importance to us; as that on which our everlaſting intereſt depends. This is a juſt view of the goſpel, and we cannot rightly eſtimate its value, without taking both theſe ideas into the account. For if the goſpel, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028256_0010_0FD847DC46F8D210"/>
of Jeſus, were propoſed mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an object of belief, without any conſideration of our intereſt in it, ſome perſon might ſay, "What is this to me? It may be true, or it may not be true. I have no leiſure for inquiries, but into thoſe things with which I have ſome concern. I muſt attend to my buſineſs, and leave ſubjects of ſpeculative inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to men who have time and genius to purſue them." Or, on the other hand, if it were propoſed to us, as a ground of expectation, without any rational evidence of its truth, ſome might ſay, "How can I entertain hope, without ſome evidence which ſatisfies my mind? I cannot place my expectation, where I can ſee no reaſon for confidence. My eternal intereſt is an object too precious to be committed to any perſon as a ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but to one, concerning whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and qualifications I can be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on reaſonable evidence."</p>
            <p>To prevent objections of either kind, the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028256_0011_0FD8481244FD5800"/>
the doctrine of his reſurrection, is propoſed to us in a twofold view; as an object of faith, and therefore ſupported by proper evidence; and as an object of vaſt importance to us and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving attention. It is an object of ſo much importance, that if we do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into its truth with a view to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the hope which it contains, we are criminal in the higheſt degree; and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the ſevereſt reprehenſion of our own conſcience in a ſolemn hour. If the goſpel be of any importance, it is of the higheſt; it not only gives us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for our conduct in this life; but it points the way to immortality. It propoſes to us as a moſt ſerious truth, that this life is but the firſt ſtage of our exiſtence, and that though we muſt die and return to the duſt, yet that there ſhall be a reſurrection. It propoſes to us immortality, as the reward of well doing; and this immortality is ſaid to be a ſtate of the higheſt enjoyment which rational beings can expect or deſire; an eternal enjoyment of the chief good,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028256_0012_0FD847E118752F48"/>
and an eternally increaſing conformity to God as the baſis of that enjoyment; and the reſurrection of Jeſus ſhows us in the cleareſt light, how we are to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at this immortality.</p>
            <p>Now, what can be of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to mankind than ſuch a doctrine? Is there any higher or nobler truth with which we have any concern? Is there any thing, about which we can or ought to be more ſolicitous than to ſecure our happineſs in the future ſtate? And can we have any ſatisfaction concerning this moſt important of all conſiderations, equal to what is given to us in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?</p>
            <p>As the goſpel profeſſes to have in view our eternal intereſt; there is ſomething to excite our inquiry. We cannot look upon it with indifference; if it be true, it deeply and intimately concerns us. We muſt feel ourſelves intereſted in the inquiry, whether it be true or not; and this conſideration ought to lead us to a ſerious and thorough inquiry into that evidence, by which it is ſupported.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028256_0013_0FD84813C0D39BE0"/>
Men will not put themſelves to the trouble of inquiry, without ſome proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of advantage: They muſt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that there is ſome good to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, before they will enter on any thing which has the appearance of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. He who conſtituted our minds knew this; and therefore he has adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his goſpel to our moral conſtitution: He has propoſed to us, the higheſt good to be obtained, by a due regard to the revelation which he has given; that our attention might be excited toward it as a valuable and important object</p>
            <p>But he has not only given us a proper motive to make the inquiry; he has alſo afforded us ſuch evidence as is ſufficient to convince us of the truth, that is, of ſuch kind of truth as is thus highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to us. If phyſical truth were the object of our inquiry, we might look for ſuch kind of evidence as is equal to mathematical demonſtration. But our ſearch is after moral truth, and therefore we muſt admit moral evidence. What I mean, is, that we muſt admit
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028256_0014_0FD847E2A2D000A8"/>
ſuch evidence as we do in other caſes, where our intereſt is concerned; ſuch evidence <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> we think it prudent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and to depend on in matters which we eſteem of great importance to us. Let us take an example.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe, (as moſt people real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do) that the acquiſition of wealth is one of the moſt deſireable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant things in the world; and that it is the part of wiſdom to obtain as much riches as we can by our own induſtry; and at the ſame time, that there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of truſting to other men, for their information and aſſiſtance to accompliſh our deſires. Do we not think it ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and prudent to put this confidence in them? Do we not depend on their abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, their veracity, their fidelity? And what reaſon have we to think it ſafe for us ſo to do.?</p>
            <p>Suppoſe there is a report of a newly diſcovered country, containing abundant ſupplies of merchandize, the means of wealth; and that by adventuring our ſubſtance thither, there is a great proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

of advantage; what evidence do we require as a ground of that conduct which is prudent and rational? Muſt we actually ſee that country with our own eyes? No. Muſt we ſee the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have been there, and hear the ſtory from their own mouths? No. Muſt we examine their invoices and count the gains which they have made? No. We content ourſelves with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior kind of evidence: We depend on teſtimony, which we think credible. If there are books or letters written by perſons of proper information and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, we depend on that evidence: We believe that ſuch a country exiſts; and that there is ſuch a way of getting wealth; and we take the moſt prudent methods to obtain it. We put our confidence in ſuch perſons as are beſt acquainted with the buſineſs; and, venture our ſubſtance on the credit of their abilities and information. Who does not think this, rational and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conduct?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028256_0016_0FD847E3C64C9068"/>Well, juſt ſuch kind of evidence is exhibited to us to ſupport our hope of immortality! Evidence, on which it is rational and prudent to build our expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and form our conduct. I ſay, ſuch <hi>kind</hi> of evidence, becauſe it is the evidence of teſtimony; but it is much higher in its <hi>degree.</hi> For, the one is ſubject to ſome deduction, becauſe the moſt probable means have ſometimes failed: The adventurer has in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances been diſappointed: His confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has been miſplaced, or his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities loſt: Some accident has inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened to blaſt his expectations however well grounded; but the other can ſuffer no deduction from any ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: No inſtances can be produced, that any have failed of ſalvation, if they have fought it, in the way pointed out in the goſpel; and, therefore, there is no counter evidence to detract from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility of the goſpel hope. It ought then to have that place in our minds which belongs to the higheſt degree of moral evidence. It is ſaid that "faith<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. xi, 1.</note>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:028256_0017_0FD8481B46C3C408"/>
is the evidence of things, not ſeen; the ſubſtance of things hoped for." Here are the ſame ideas held out, a proſpect of advantage to be a ground of hope; as well as evidence of truth, to be a ground of faith. Where there is a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of advantage, and of ſuch vaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable advantage as the happineſs of a future ſtate; a ſubject which has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the attention of good men in all ages; ſurely, it is rational to admit that degree of moral evidence, which is founded on credible teſtimony; on teſtimony which cannot be contradicted by any teſtimony of equal credibility; and, from the certainty of which, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction can be made by any reaſonable evidence of a contrary truth.</p>
            <p>Such is the kind of evidence; and ſuch is the degree of that kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on which the facts which involve the goſpel hope of eternal life are grounded. It is the evidence of teſtimony; the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles. Jeſus Chriſt came from heaven into this world and pointed out to us the path of life by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028256_0018_0FD847E54245A658"/>
his doctrine and example. Having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his teſtimony and confirmed it by a ſeries of the moſt wonderful and beneficial works, which were ever ſeen and known in this world; having vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily yielded himſelf to the power of death and ſubmitted to be laid in the grave; he hath reſumed his life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to heaven. Of all this, there is ſufficient evidence; there is written evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; there is evidence from the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten teſtimony of credible witneſſes who could not be miſtaken, becauſe they did not believe it themſelves, until after doubting, they were convined by the moſt infallible and demonſtrative proof; and who could have no intereſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving us, becauſe they have ventured their own happineſs, on the credibility of the ſame truths. If then, we have any idea of the benefit, which is propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, by believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and obeying his goſpel; if we have any value for that ſalvation, which is there revealed; ought we not to attend to this evidence? And if it appears reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028256_0019_0FD8481D0B16AB38"/>
and we have no contrary evidence, to detract from its credibility, is it not wiſe and prudent for us to admit the truth of the facts, and the importance of the conſequences deducible from them: And when we have admitted it, to build our hope and expectations on it? Ought we not to exerciſe the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and caution on this ſubject, which we do every day on things of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? And at the ſame time, to place that confidence, and entertain that hope which ſhall animate us to exertion? Hope is the life of all buſineſs; and what nobler hope can we have than the hope of eternal life? Being perſuaded of this truth and poſſeſſed of this hope, we ſhall purſue with vigour the path of duty, and the farther we advance in the way of goſpel obedience the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſatisfaction ſhall we find; "the righteous ſhall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands ſhall be ſtronger and ſtronger."<note n="*" place="bottom">Job xvii.9<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

For why do you doubt, unleſs you have ſome idea of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the goſpel and that your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt may be involved in it? Had you no apprehenſion of its value, you would not think it worthy of a doubt. But your preſent ſtate of ſuſpence, implies a perſuaſion that if the goſpel be true; it is of the utmoſt conſequence to you. Let this perſuaſion operate as a ſtrong motive, to examine it, with the ſame attention that you would beſtow on books or letters which direct you how to ſecure your moſt valuable intereſt. Be ſure to admit the ſame kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the truth of chriſtianity which you would admit for the truth of thoſe facts, upon which you would ground

that conduct, which in other caſes would be thought rational and prudent. You can by no means be excuſed from the duty of making the moſt ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. In ſuch a caſe, negligence is criminal. Indifference will have the ſame conſequence as actual infidelity. When you have evidence preſented to you in ſupport of the moſt momentous truth, and you do not believe it becauſe you will not examine it, who muſt bear the blame? When you acknowledge the importance of chriſtianity and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in doubt of its truth, you are guilty of a criminal diſregard to your own intereſt, and a want of reverence to the authority of your maker, who has a right to require this of you. If chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſhould finally prove to be true, and you ſhould be found among thoſe who have had a price put into their hands, and have neglected to improve it, what can you expect but the fate of the unprofitable ſervant who hid his Lord's talent in the earth?

            <head>ON THE INCOMPREHENSIBILITY OF SOME THINGS IN THE SYSTEM OF NATURE; AND ITS ANALOGY, WITH SOME TRUTHS OF DIVINE REVELATlON.</head>
            <p>IF the book of nature and the book of ſcripture be the work of the ſame hand, we may expect to find the ſame marks and characters in both. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong human artiſts, there is a ſimilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſtyle and manner of books written by the ſame pen, of pictures drawn by the ſame pencil, and of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings erected by the ſame architect. May we not then expect to find in the works of the divine author, a ſtyle and manner peculiar to himſelf? And, if he hath impreſſed the peculiar mark of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibility on ſome of his works, is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028256_0023_0FD84823143249C0"/>
it not reaſonable to expect that the ſame mark ſhould be found, on ſome of the truths of his word? "Canſt thou find out the Almighty to perfection? How ſmall a portion is known of him!"</p>
            <p>We find by experience that we are unable to ſolve many of the appearances in the natural world, to trace their cauſes and diſcover the connection between the the cauſe and the effect. Let us look over a few objects with which we are familiarly acquainted, and ſee how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect our knowledge is, of thoſe things, which of all we ſhould think moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious.</p>
            <p>If we attempt an inquiry into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>inanimate matter,</hi> we ſhall find ſome things beyond our comprehenſion.

of the brutal creation; we may aſk, why is one ferocious and deſtructive, whilſt another is mild and docile? Why is one faithful and another deceitful? Why is one artful and another ſtupid? Why is one provident and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, whilſt another is indolent and torpid? Look at "the ſpider, which taketh hold with her hands, even in kings palaces;" the ant, "which prepareth her meat in the ſummer;" the bee, which gathers liquid ſweets from every flower; the ſilk-worm, which weaves a delicate web, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſes itſelf within a ſhroud of its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; the beaver, which ſtops the current of rivers, and makes them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his domeſtic purpoſes; the birds of paſſage, which traverſe oceans and continents on the wing, and explore the remoteſt regions for their ſummer and winter reſidence. Look on theſe, and ſay, why are they thus endowed, and why do they thus labour and toil, when others live at their eaſe and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

move from the ſpot where they firſt came into being?</p>
            <p>If we look up to the <hi>ſuperior regions</hi> and behold the ſhining glories of the heavens; what countleſs myriads of wonders preſent themſelves to our view! why does the ſun ſhine by his own luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the moon and planets borrow their light from him? How immenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwift and univerſally diffuſed are his rays! but what connects the particles of them together, or what force drives them to the utmoſt limits of heaven? What power confines the celeſtial globes to their orbits? What hinders them from rolling at large in the etherial ſpace? Or keeps them from falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sun, the centre of their attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>To deſcend from this elevation into <hi>ourſelves</hi>; what enlivens and animates this portion of matter? Why does an act of the mind give motion to a limb or a joint of the body? Why does a ray of light falling on the eye, preſent to us a diſtant object? And why when
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028256_0026_0FD847F0E3A6C138"/>
the eye is ſhut do we retain the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Why do we on certain occaſions, recollect ideas which had been long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? Why do ſome diſorders of the body deprive the mind of memory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and judgment? And why are theſe faculties at ſome times more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and active, than at others?</p>
            <p>When we aſk ſuch queſtions, what anſwer can we give, but, ſuch is the will of God. Or, if we take the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtep, and ſay, ſuch are the laws of nature, ſuch is the conſtitution of the material world; what is this, but in other words to ſay the ſame thing? For if we aſk who framed the laws of nature? Who ſettled the conſtitution of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial world? The anſwer is, GOD. Here we are at a ſtand: We cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a ſtep farther in our inquiry. If it be aſked, why did he thus ordain the frame of nature? Why did he chooſe this, rather than any other poſſible ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem? We are puzzled and loſt in the depth of the ſubject; and we can only ſay, that this appeared beſt to divine
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028256_0027_0FD84825E3125CF0"/>
wiſdom, but for what reaſons, we know not. God giveth no account, and his ways are paſt finding out.</p>
            <p>Thus, the incomprehenſibility of GOD is the end of all our inquiries into his works. And if we preſume to examine his eſſence; or the mode of his ſubſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; or his way of operating on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or on intelligent minds, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed and confounded; our faculties are totally unequal to the ſubject; and, we muſt lay aſide the inquiry as too deep for human penetration.</p>
            <p>Ought we not then, to learn modeſty and humility in our inquiries into the works of God? True philoſophy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tends to make us humble. The more we ſearch into the works of God, the more do we diſcover of our own weakneſs and imperfection, and of our incapacity to penetrate the myſteries of nature. The true philoſopher often finds himſelf at a nonplus; and is never aſhamed to confeſs his ignorance. And why ſhould he? What is the language
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028256_0028_0FD847F253104F60"/>
of ſuch a confeſſion, but this, that God is wiſer than man?</p>
            <p>May we not alſo trace the analogy between the works and <hi>word</hi> of God, and learn the ſame modeſty in judging of the latter as of the former? And, if we find the peculiar mark of incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibility on ſome of the truths which are delivered to us as divine, is it ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to reject them on this account? If there were no appearance of this peculiar diſtinction, attending the truths which claim a divine original, we might ſay, "all this we are able to diſcover by our own faculties; we need no divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bring this to our knowledge." But when the revelation is attended with this mark, that ſome parts of it are at preſent impenetrable, how can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently reject it? Muſt we not for the ſame reaſon reject all that knowledge of God which is derived from the works of nature? For there are impenetrable depths in both. To be conſiſtent, therefore, ſuch perſons muſt join with the fool who ſaith in his heart "there
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028256_0029_0FD84828B2605CC0"/>
is no GOD." But if we acknowledge that God is incomprehenſible in his works, why ſhould we ſcruple to admit, that he is equally incomprehenſible in his word?</p>
            <p>By this, it is not meant, that all the truths of God's word are paſt finding out, any more than that all the works of nature are ſo. There are many things in nature of which we know the uſe, though we are ignorant of the cauſe; and if we knew the cauſe, we ſhould receive no more benefit from the things themſelves than we do now. We know the uſe of the magnetic needle and its variation, and can guide ourſelves through the pathleſs ocean, by means of it; though we cannot ſolve the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, why does it point toward the poles? Or why does it deviate from the true meridian? But if we were to find out the true mechanical cauſe of its polarity or its variation, either by the exerciſe of our own faculties, or by information from above, what greater benefit could we derive from the needle than we now
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028256_0030_0FD847F385C4C2C8"/>
have? So there are many truths contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſcriptures of which we know the practical uſe, though we may be ignorant of their metaphyſical relations and connections. They may be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in principles abſtruſe and remote from human comprehenſion, and yet may be very uſeful and neceſſary to us in a practical view; and the teſtimony which accompanies them may be a ſufficient reaſon for our belief and practice.</p>
            <p>Beſides, though they be at preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to us, that is no reaſon why they will always be ſo. And, here we have alſo the analogy of nature to ſupport the argument, even in the inſtance juſt now mentioned. For how many ages was the magnetic needle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and the mariner afraid to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of ſight of the land? Had any perſon then foretold, that the time would come, when men might ſteer their ſhips, not only out of ſight of the land, but without ſight of the ſun, moon and ſtars; in the darkeſt night, and in the moſt tempeſtuous weather, by means of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028256_0031_0FD848298C577450"/>
a candle and a card, doubtleſs ſome would have derided the prediction as an impoſſibility. For how many ages was it ſuppoſed that the torrid and frigid zones were uninhabitable? But now it is known, that the human body is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing the utmoſt extremes of heat and cold, to which our globe is ſubject. Leſs than half a century age, it was deemed impoſſible to circumna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigate the globe, without loſing great numbers of ſeamen by the ſcurvy; but now methods have been found to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the lives and health of this uſeful claſs of men in the longeſt voyages, and in all climates, ſubject only to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſualties of human life.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſcoveries have been made in the book of nature: What was once deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impoſſible, is now known to be true. And, why may not diſcoveries be made in the volume of divine inſpiration? Why may not cloſe ſtudy and devout and humble inquiry, bring to light ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which have been deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable? For how many ages did the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028256_0032_0FD847F5184DB5D0"/>
Bible itſelf lie neglected and unknown in the dark receſſes of monaſtic libraries, till the active zeal of Luther brought it to light? How many advantages do we now enjoy ſince the diſcovery of the art of printing, which were before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known? How many illuſtrations of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of ſcripture have been made by inquiring into the genius, manners, arts and ſciences of the people among whom the ſacred writers lived; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the natural and political hiſtories of thoſe countries, the ſcene of thoſe events which they relate! And how much more might we have known, if it had not been for the deſtruction of ancient books and their repoſitories by the barbarous policy of conquerors, and the moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand of time! When all theſe things are conſidered, is it ſtrange or incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that in a book of great antiquity, and which claims the honour of contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine communications, there ſhould be ſome things, which at preſent are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of human comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but, which ought to be believed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028256_0033_0FD8482C5F0C0750"/>
on ſuch teſtimony, as is deemed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport other truths, which are confeſſed to be advantageous to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, though we may not be able to comprehend ſome of their cauſes and relations? Or, is it agreeable to our maxims of prudence to reject ſuch a book, or any part of it, on account of certain ſublime and impenetrable things contained in it; when it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears to be calculated for our benefit, and to contain other things, which we do underſtand and to which we can conform our hearts and lives? Does it not rather become us, with modeſty and humility to admit the whole for truth, becauſe it bears the ſame marks of the divine author as do the works of nature, which are evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the workmanſhip of an almighty hand?</p>
            <p>Here, we know but in part; and this imperfection of our knowledge is one of thoſe modes of trial, which God hath appointed for us in the preſent ſtate. The reaſon that we have any
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028256_0034_0FD847F9CC4F3308"/>
opportunity and advantage for acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine knowledge is that we may reduce that knowledge to practice, and thus improve ourſelves in true virtue. All the knowledge which we ſhall gain in this or the future world is intended to make us wiſer and better. Let us then ſtudy to employ our minds in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring as much knowledge of God and divine things as we can obtain; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our hearts and lives in thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and graces which will form our preparation for the moſt ſublime degrees of intellectual and moral perfection in the regions of eternal felicity.</p>

            <p>Of this laſt kind is the prediction in Daniel, (chap. ix.24,) reſpecting the time of the appearance of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which limits it to "<hi>ſeventy weeks,</hi>" from the time when the decree was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, for the reſtoration of the Jewiſh gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and the rebuilding of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, after the expiration of the captivity of the Jews in Babylon.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a perſon as the Meſſiah, was the ſubject of many predictions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Jewiſh Church, by the miniſtry of their prophets, is a truth in which both Jews and Chriſtians agree. He was predicted under different ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; all of which were expreſſive of the dignity of his perſon, the characters which he ſhould aſſume, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which he ſhould confer. He was called the ſeed of the Woman, the ſeed of Abraham, in whom all the families
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:028256_0037_0FD84832919294B8"/>
of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, the Son of God, the Son of Man, the Son of David, a prophet like Moſes, a prieſt after the order of Melchiſedec, a king in Zion, a redeemer, a deliverer, a ſaviour and the deſire of all nations.</p>
            <p>As the time of his advent approached, the predictions became more clear and diſtinct; and the ſeries of prophecy was not cloſed, till he was ſo particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and the time of his appearance was ſo diſtinctly fixed, that unleſs JESUS CHRIST were the Meſſiah, no ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has yet appeared in the world.</p>
            <p>The name by which he is familiarly known fully expreſſes the character, in which he appeared; JESUS ſignifies <hi>a Saviour,</hi> and CHRIST, <hi>the anointed</hi>; THE ANOINTED SAVIOUR, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon commiſſioned by GOD to be the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour of the world.</p>
            <p>"The ancient Jews were led by their prophecies, as interpreted by themſelves, to expect that they would be completed at the <hi>time</hi> in which, the chriſtians ſay, they were completed; and it was not
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028256_0038_0FD847FDD002F020"/>
till after the coming of Chriſt that they began to interpret them differently, and to look out for another completion of them. Judge then, if they, or we, are likely to have erred moſt; through pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, in expounding and applying the prophecies. Judge, if the natural and proper ſenſe, is not that, in which we take them; for that ſenſe occured firſt to themſelves, and was <hi>their</hi> ſenſe before we adopted it. I mean, eſpecially in reſpect to the <hi>time</hi> which they had fixed, for the accompliſhment of the prophecies concerning the Meſſiah."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hurd's introduction, page 147.</note>

            <p>It is well known, that the Jews num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered not only weeks of days but weeks of years. Not only every ſeventh day was a ſabbath, or day of reſt; but, every ſeventh year was a ſabbatical year, or year of reſt.

            <p>In addition to this chronological pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the coming of the Meſſiah, is limited by the prophet Haggai, to the time in which the ſecond temple ſhould be ſtanding. For whilſt the aged Jews who had returned from the captivity in Babylon, ſaw the erection of the ſecond temple, and compared it with the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſtructure which had been built
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028256_0040_0FD847FDD3BF57F8"/>
by Solomon, they could not refrain from weeping at the diſproportion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the gold and other rich furniture, ſeveral things were wanting in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond temple, which were accounted part of the glory of the firſt; viz. the ark of the covenant, the ſhekinah or viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible token of the divine preſence, the perpetual fire, the ſacred oil, the Urim and Thummim; but notwithſtanding the abſence of theſe, it was predicted by Haggai, [chap. ii.7, 8, 9,] for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of his countrymen, that "the glory of the latter houſe, ſhould be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the glory of the former; becauſe <hi>the deſire of all nations</hi> ſhould appear in in it, and by him it would be filled with glory." Theſe predictions limited the appearance of the Meſſiah, by the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fifth century, from the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration of the Jews, and by the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the temple which they rebuilt after their return from Babylon. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could be to them, more certain and definite, than ſuch predictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:028256_0041_0FD84835B45F7880"/>Accordingly it is evident, from the books of the new teſtament, that in the latter part of the fifth century, there was a general expectation of the appearance of an illuſtrious perſon among the Jews. Wiſe men came from the eaſt to inquire "where is he that is born King of the Jews, for we have ſeen his ſtar and are come to worſhip him."<note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew. ii.</note> Simeon was waiting for the conſolation of Iſrael, and it was revealed to him, that he ſhould not ſee death, till he had ſeen the Lord's Chriſt. Anna the propheteſs was in the ſame expectation, and ſpake of him to all them who looked for redemption in Jeruſalem.<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke, ii.25.</note> When John the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, began his miniſtry, the Prieſts and Levites ſent meſſengers to him, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether he were the expected Meſſiah.<note n="‡" place="bottom">John, i.19.</note> The ſame expectation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among the Samaritans,<note n="‖" place="bottom">John, iv.25.</note> as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the conference which Jeſus had with a woman of that country. Several impoſtors taking advantage of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:028256_0042_0FD847FEDEB822C0"/>
this general expectation, "drew away much people after them," and one of them Judas of Galilee, "in the days of the taxing," when Jeſus was born.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts v.36.37.</note> Theſe inſtances I truſt are ſufficient to prove that there was a general expectation, among the Jews, and the neighbouring nations, of the appearance of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, about the time when Jeſus was born and lived; and this expectation was grounded on the predictions above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which they could not but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in their moſt obvious and literal meaning. Jeſus began his miniſtry by ſaying "<hi>the time is fulfilled</hi> and the kingdom of God is at hand."<note n="†" place="bottom">Mark i.15.</note> In his diſcourſe, of the deſtruction of the city and temple of Jeruſalem,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xxiv.15.</note> he quoted a part of the prediction of Daniel; and in a remarkable parentheſis ("<hi>whoſo read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth let him underſtand</hi>") plainly intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the whole was very intelligible and worthy of their attention, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining one of the plaineſt of the ſigns of the times.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:028256_0043_0FD84835C2E272F8"/>It is alſo to be conſidered as one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborating proof, that in all the cavils and objections, which the Jews brought againſt Jeſus, to invalidate his claim to be the Meſſiah, they never once pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was not the proper <hi>time</hi> for his appearance. The truth is, that there was then no controverſy; but, all were agreed on that point. We may then ſafely conclude, that the time lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited for the appearance of the Meſſiah has elapſed, and that it muſt have elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before the deſtruction of the Jewiſh temple by the Romans.</p>
            <p>The great difference between thoſe of the Jews who rejected Jeſus, and thoſe who received him, was reſpecting the nature of that redemption or ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which the Meſſiah was to be the author. The former regarded it in a political ſenſe; they had been redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Egyptian bondage by the miniſtry of Moſes and Aaron; and from the Babyloniſh captivity, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ezra and Nehemiah; they were then in ſubjection to the Romans; and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:028256_0044_0FD84802DF419640"/>
they looked for the Meſſiah, as their national redeemer, from that yoke; as one who ſhould be a temporal prince, like David, and raiſe their nation to the ſame degree of independence, wealth and honour; but they ſaw no traits of ſuch a character in Jeſus, and therefore rejected him. The latter were induced by various degrees, to overcome the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional prejudice, in which they had been educated, and to regard the ſalvation of the Meſſiah in a moral and ſpiritual ſenſe; not as reſpecting this world but extending to the future ages; not as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Jews, but comprehending all mankind. "The Jews in rejecting a ſpiritual ſenſe of thoſe prophecies (which yet is admitted by them on other occaſions) have been driven to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſuppoſing a twofold Meſſiah, a new conceit, without warrant from their ſcriptures and againſt the ideas and expectations of their fathers; the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians by the help of that moral and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe, which they have put on the ſame prophecies, are able to explain
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028256_0045_0FD8483733B67AC8"/>
them, of one and the ſame Meſſiah, conformably to the event, and to the <hi>time</hi> which the ancient Jews had prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the completion of them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Hurd, page 148.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The conduct of the ruling part of the Jewiſh nation, toward thoſe of their brethren who embraced the doctrine of Jeſus, in the firſt age of the chriſtian church ſhows the force of prejudice over the human mind in a moſt affecting view. They had been ſubjected by the Romans; but had expected a Meſſiah to redeem them, and the time limited by the prophets had elapſed. Inſtead of being able to recover their own indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ſubdue all the nations who had oppreſſed them, and to reign as ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereigns over the whole earth; they not only continued tributary to the Romans, but ſaw a number of their own nation, under the full perſuaſion that Jeſus whom they had crucified was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, travelling over the world, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this doctrine, and inviting all men to partake of the bleſſings of God's
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028256_0046_0FD848040B93CA78"/>
kingdom, without firſt becoming Jews; or being proſelyted to the laws of Moſes. They ſaw the apoſtles and miniſters of Jeſus ſubmitting to the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, teaching obedience to it, as a moral duty; endeavouring to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eaſy in their ſubjection, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rewards of heaven to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and meekneſs. This was more than the temper of the Jews could bear. They were the moſt reſtleſs, uneaſy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world<note n="*" place="bottom">i Theſs. ii.15.</note>; and were frequently exciting ſedition and rebellion againſt the Romans. On the contrary, the chriſtians taught quietneſs, obedience and the payment of tribute. The Jews were looking for temporal dominion, but the chriſtians were expecting no kingdom but what was moral and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual and would extend to the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world.</p>
            <p>The poſterity of thoſe Jews have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee, not only that they as a nation were never delivered from the Roman yoke; but that the Roman empire,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028256_0047_0FD8483BDB747528"/>
which ſubjected their fathers, is itſelf broken to pieces; and yet that they are not redeemed nor reſtored. They are however preſerved as a diſtinct people notwithſtanding their diſperſions; and this preſervation is one of the ſtrongeſt, viſible evidences of the truth, both of the Jewiſh and chriſtian revelations.</p>

            <head>ON THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST AND THE WRITERS OF HIS LIFE.</head>
            <p>AMIDST the wit and ridicule which have been played off againſt chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, there is ſometimes an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of reſpect to the character of Jeſus Chriſt; which, however plauſible at firſt view, yet is accompanied with ſuch other ſentiments, as render the ſincerity of it very queſtionable. We are grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told "that ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt exiſted, and that he was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; that he was a virtuous and amiable man; that he preached moſt excellent
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:028256_0048_0FD8483D30450670"/>
morality; that the morality which he preached and practiſed was of the moſt benevolent kind; and that the grand trait in his character was philanthropy."<note n="*" place="bottom">Age of Reaſon, p. 12, 15, 36.</note> But, at the ſame time, it is ſaid, that "he wrote nothing himſelf; that the hiſtory of him is altogether the work of other people; that his hiſtorians brought him into the world in a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural manner, and were obliged to take him out again in the ſame manner; that the ſtory of his reſurrection is a wretched contrivance, which has every mark of fraud and impoſition upon it; that it is now impoſſible for us to know who were the authors of it, or to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the books in which the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is related were written by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe name they bear."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid p. 13, 15.</note> Thus, by flattering us into an idea that they are friendly to the moral character of Jeſus, they would deſtroy the grand evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the <hi>real character</hi> in which he appeared in the world, and ſap the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that hope of immortality
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:028256_0049_0FD84873C12A5AE8"/>
which we derive from his death and reſurrection.</p>
            <p>To expoſe the weakneſs and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of ſuch an attack on chriſtianity, let us attend to the following conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it be allowed that there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt, that he was virtuous and amiable, that he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt excellent morality and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the virtues which he taught, from what ſource is the knowledge of this derived? How do we know that there was ſuch a perſon, and that his doctrine and life were ſo good? Muſt not this knowledge be derived from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ancient authors? And are not thoſe authors moſt to be depended on, who were eye witneſſes of the facts and events of his life, and ear-witneſſes of the diſcourſes and inſtructions which he delivered? Though ſomething credible might have been ſaid by perſons at a diſtance who had known him by report and hearſay, who were not his contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, but had received their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:028256_0050_0FD8483E7B6E7E28"/>
by tradition, and who did not profeſs to write his life, nor to be his diſciples and who were far from being particular in their accounts of him; yet, is not greater credit due to thoſe who perſonally knew him, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently converſed with him, and who could not miſtake in their teſtimony concerning him? This is a rule which holds good in all other caſes, and why ſhould it not be allowed equally good here? We cannot violate this rule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuppoſing that the neareſt friends of a virtuous and amiable man were the greateſt liars; and that thoſe who knew him only by a diſtant report, were the only honeſt and credible hiſtorians. This ſuppoſition would not be admitted in any other caſe; becauſe it is contrary to the nature of teſtimony and the rules of evidence univerſally acknowledged among mankind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Jeſus Chriſt taught the pureſt morality and practiſed what he taught, who were more likely to learn of him and to imitate his example than his own
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:028256_0051_0FD848780D5C49C0"/>
diſciples? And would not the morality which they learned of him induce them to ſpeak the truth concerning him? <hi>Socrates</hi> was an eminent teacher of moral philoſophy among the Greeks, but he wrote nothing himſelf; <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Xenophon</hi> were his diſciples and wrote memorable things concerning him. Doth any perſon ſuſpect them of inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in their relations of their maſter? Why then ſhould the diſciples of Jeſus be leſs worthy of credit? What kind of morals can we ſuppoſe they had learned of Jeſus? What kind of morals do they recommend in their own writings? Do they not enjoin the ſame virtues and duties as did their maſter? and would not candor lead us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they practiſed what they taught? Are there not evident marks of ſimplicity and ſincerity in their writings? Do they not give us the moſt plain and undiſguiſed accounts of the actions and ſayings of their maſter? Of their own faults and imperfections? Of their own abſurd reaſonings, vain expectations
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028256_0052_0FD84841CDE2C388"/>
and falſe prejudices, and of the manner in which they were led to correct them? Do they not relate the moſt grand and ſolemn events, in a ſtyle as ſimple and unaffected, as they relate the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon occurrences? Do they not plainly ſhow that they had no fondneſs for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhing their narratives? But that they aimed only at giving a ſimple hiſtory of ſuch facts and events as fell under their obſervation? And, are there any ſeeming diſagreements in their narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but what may be reconciled, by the exerciſe of the ſame candor which we ſhould uſe in reconciling other wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of equal antiquity, who agree in the moſt material points? Why then are not the diſciples of Jeſus entitled to our credit in what they have related con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If Jeſus taught and practiſed the beſt morality, and if he accounts given of his life and character, by his biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, be true, then it muſt be allowed, that he was a perſon of ſtrict integrity, one who ſpoke the truth and had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028256_0053_0FD84879A14E8128"/>
to deceive. Admitting this, let us attend to what is related by them reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his <hi>miracles.</hi> A queſtion aroſe among the diſciples of John the Baptiſt, whether Jeſus were he that ſhould come or they ſhould look for another? With this queſtion John ſent them to Jeſus; and at the time of their arrival, Jeſus was employed in healing the ſick, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight to the blind, and performing other miraculous and benevolent works. Inſtead of giving any direct anſwer to their inquiry, he ſaid.

John was acquainted with theſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; the anſwer therefore was perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and the argument concluſive. And would a perſon of a truly virtuous character have uſed an unfair argument on ſo ſolemn an occaſion?</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſame manner did he appeal to his <hi>reſurrection,</hi> as a proof of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine miſſion. When the Jews aſked him, "what ſign ſhoweſt thou to us, ſeeing thou doſt theſe things?"

If he were a truly virtuous man, he would not have foretold ſuch event,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028256_0055_0FD8487AA14F7358"/>
unleſs he had a well grounded faith that it would come to paſs; and if his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples learned their morality of him, they would not have related ſuch an event, unleſs they had known it to be true. To pretend that the ſtory of his reſurrection was fabricated by his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as a counterpart to the ſtory of his miraculous conception is a reproach as weak and malicious as the old calumny of the Jews, "that his diſciples came by night and ſtole him away;" to pretend, at the ſame time, a reſpect to the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Jeſus as virtuous and amiable, is a palpable inconſiſtency; and, to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that the authors of the ſtory are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and that the time when it was invented, is unknown; is nothing more than "a wretched contrivance," to pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate a falſe and groundleſs pretence.</p>
            <p>It is in vain to attempt to ſeperate things which are ſo intimately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the virtuous character of Jeſus, and the truth of his miracles and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. They reſt on the ſame evidence and muſt ſtand or fall together. It is
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:028256_0056_0FD84844A5C9ACF0"/>
impoſſible to believe that Jeſus was vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and good, and yet that he wrought no miracles and did not riſe from the dead; for a good man would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to ſuch facts, and to ſuch an event, as the proofs of his divine miſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had been realities.</p>
            <p>If therefore we would be conſiſtent with ourſelves, and treat thoſe ancient and venerable hiſtorians, who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the life of Jeſus, with the ſame can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and reſpect, as other hiſtorians of equal antiquity; we muſt not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt did exiſt, and that he bore a virtuous and amiable character; but we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he was ſent by God, to be the Saviour of the world; that he anſwered in all reſpects the characters which had been given of the Meſſiah, in particular, that he went about doing good; and though he was put to death, yet that he roſe from death to immortality. Why ſhould not theſe facts be believed on the ſame teſtimony with that which ſupports the virtue and goodneſs of his character?
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:028256_0057_0FD8487C02DE7B58"/>
Were not his miracles one part of the proof of his benevolence? And did they not gain him the love as well the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the people? Thoſe works were, to the people who ſaw and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed benefit by them, the moſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proofs of the goodneſs and power of the perſon who wrought them; they proved that he was a prophet ſent from God. To us, theſe miracles have <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſame direct and intuitive evidence; but ſtill they are of uſe. The relation of them is credible; the nature of them was beneficial; they were a fulfilment of ancient prophecy; and, they ſerve to confirm our faith in the virtuous and amiable character of the perſon who wrought them. If we believe that he was virtuous, certainly he was not the leſs virtuous for doing ſo much good, as the evangeliſts have reported of him.</p>
            <p>His reſurrection may be conſidered in one view, as the reward of his virtuous and amiable conduct, and of the patience with which he endured his laſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Is it not credible, that virtue
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028256_0058_0FD84845FB716840"/>
ſhould be rewarded with immortal life and happineſs? Why ſhould it be thought incredible, that God ſhould raiſe the dead? But there is a farther uſe to be made of this great event. For as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath ſet us an example of virtue, which we are bound to imitate; ſo God hath, by the reſurrection of his Son, given us an aſſurance, that our virtue ſhall be rewarded, in the ſame manner. And what is the deſign of this, but to encourage us to perſevere in a cloſe imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the character of Jeſus Chriſt, truſting in his promiſe, "becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo?"</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, let every one who is acquainted with hiſtory and chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, or who may be eaſily informed, if he thinks it worthy his inquiry, be aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe queſtions. Do you believe that there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt? That he was born and lived in Judea, in the latter part of the fifth century, after the return of the Jews from the Babylon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh captivity? In the reigns of Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and Tiberius, Emperors of Rome?
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:028256_0059_0FD8487D97683000"/>
that he was a perſon of a virtuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that he practiſed what he taught, and that the writers of his life learned their morality of him? If he anſwers theſe queſtions in the affirmative, he muſt, to be conſiſtent with himſelf, be a chriſtian: He cannot reaſonably doubt the truth of the miracles, nor the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt; he cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably doubt of the doctrines, the duties nor the tendency of the whole goſpel ſyſtem through time and eternity.</p>

            <head>ON THE TESTIMONY OF THE ROMAN CEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURION TO THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST.</head>
            <p>IN any matter of conſequence, which engages our attention, it is very deſireable to have the opinion of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, obſerving and judicious perſons in our favour. This ſerves to keep as in
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028256_0060_0FD84849D6A2C108"/>
countenance, and give an additional ſatisfaction to our minds. For when thoſe, who have no intereſt to ſerve and no prejudice to gratify, give their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on any matter of importance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon and evidence, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they will judge right.</p>
            <p>There is no queſtion of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us, than whether the Chriſtian religion be true or not; and there is no human being who is unconcerned in this queſtion. But a perſon may be really concerned in a matter on which he is to give an opinion, and yet not know it, at the time. The caſe of David is full to the point. When Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than delivered the parable of the rich man who had taken away the poor man's lamb, David knew not that he was the perſon, but he gave a juſt deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on the merits of the cauſe. The Centurion who attended the crucifixion of Jeſus, did not know that he had any other concern in the tranſactions of the day, than that he was to do his duty as the officer of the guard. He was not a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:028256_0061_0FD8488084F58BE8"/>
Jew; and therefore had no tincture of the prejudice which the Jewiſh nation had againſt Jeſus. Nor was he one of his diſciples and therefore had no expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of honour and preferment in his kingdom, as the beſt of them, at that time had. He was to all intents an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, unprejudiced perſon. Yet, from the obſervations, which he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making on that ſingular event, the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant circumſtances, he deliberately and voluntarily pronounced him to be the SON of GOD; and the ſoldiers of the guard joined with him in the ſame teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew xx<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This teſtimony is of great weight and importance in the cauſe of chriſtianity <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Centurion with his company were appointed by Pontius Pilate the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:028256_0062_0FD8484B474CF520"/>
Roman Governor of Judea, to attend the execution of Jeſus and the two thieves. Mark ſays that he "ſtood over againſt him;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Mark, xv.39.</note> a ſituation extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favourable for his obſervations; being within ſight and hearing of all things that occurred, or were ſaid or done on that occaſion. Hence it appears, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> muſt have been a witneſs to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing facts and occurrences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The cruel hatred and enmity of the Jews to Jeſus. It is not uſual among any people, who make pretences to civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ization, to treat a perſon with inſult, when he is going to ſuffer death by a judicial ſentence; be his crimes ever ſo odious and deteſtable and his ſentence ever ſo juſt. Thoſe who have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of humanity will, on ſuch an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be ſatisfied with leting the law take its courſe; and though they acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in the execution as lawful and juſt, yet they will have compaſſion on the ſuffering criminal, and view his exit with a ſolemn ſilence. But here, the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028256_0063_0FD8488398626E80"/>
caſe was far otherwiſe. Jeſus was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of no crime, which the Centurion could judge deſerved death. Nor, did any thing appear in his character or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct which merited outrage and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But the Jews had wrought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to a furious paſſion, and vented themſelves in the moſt bitter, ſcornful, reproaching and inſulting language. This was not done by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only, from whom no better treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be expected; but by the prieſts, the elders and the ſcribes; the eccleſiaſtical rulers, the moſt ſacred and dignified characters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He muſt alſo have obſerved, the mild, meek and patient behaviour of Jeſus; "who when he was reviled, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled not again;" and, inſtead of ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any diſpleaſure againſt them for their cruel and abuſive treatment, pitied his perſecutors, and in his laſt agonies prayed for them, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."</p>
            <p>There was a moſt ſurprizing contraſt between the temper of the perſecutors
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028256_0064_0FD8484CC116D6D0"/>
and of the ſufferer. The former was harſh, unreaſonable, abuſive and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the higheſt degree. There was nothing in him which appeared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it; and if there had been, ſtill it would have been baſe and ungenerous to inſult a perſon when he was in their power, and they were inflicting on him the extreme puniſhment of the law: No brave, candid mind could approve ſuch conduct. On the contrary, the temper of Jeſus was all meekneſs, patience and benevolence; not an angry reſentful word or look proceeded from him; but he manifeſted a calm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, reſigned, dignified deportment, and a tender concern for his enemies when they were loading him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. This contraſt could not but have been obſerved by the Centurion and his company.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another circumſtance was the uncommon darkneſs, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the land, at the time of the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion. The account of this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, given by the evangelical hiſtorians,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:028256_0065_0FD848839C140CA0"/>
like all their accounts of extraordinary facts, is very ſhort and ſimple. "From the ſixth hour, there was darkneſs over all the land, till the ninth hour." They relate the event, but not the ſecondary cauſes, which produced it; for their writings were deſigned, not to ſolve phenomena in the natural world, nor to teach us philoſophy; but to give us a true account of the chriſtian religion and the means by which it was introduced into the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The darkneſs, having continued three hours, was ſucceeded by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. "The earth did quake, and the rocks rent," i. e. the rocks of mount Calvary, where the Centurion and his company were performing their duty. An earthquake naturally excites terror; and this event muſt have given an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſolemnity to the ſcene, and made a deep impreſſion on the minds of the Centurion and his company. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is remarked by the hiſtorian, that when they "ſaw the earthquake" and its effects, "they feared greatly."</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:028256_0066_0FD84850264CCB58"/>5. Another circumſtance as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any, was the converſation which Jeſus had with the penitent thief, and which paſſed within the hearing of the Centurion. Jeſus was crucified between two thieves, one of whom joined with the Jewiſh prieſts, in reviling him, and was reproved for it by the other, who ſaid; "Doſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? And we indeed juſtly, but this man hath done nothing amiſs." Having thus borne his teſtimony to the innocency of Jeſus, he turned himſelf to him and ſaid, "Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom." To which Jeſus anſwered, "<hi>Amen,</hi> I ſay to thee, this day ſhalt thou be with me in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxiii.43. (Greek)</note> Both theſe perſons were then apparently going out of this world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inviſible ſtate, yet the thief had an idea, that Jeſus was a King, and was going to the poſſeſſion of his kingdom; and though dying, he prayed that Jeſus would remember him, when he ſhould
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028256_0067_0FD84885CCB791C8"/>
come into his kingdom. What kind of a kingdom muſt this have been? Not a kingdom of this world, but a ſpiritual and a heavenly kingdom. The thief therefore, might be ſuppoſed to pray to Jeſus for an admiſſion into a ſtate of happineſs after death. This prayer was immediately anſwered by Jeſus, with a voice full of majeſty and dignity, promiſing him admiſſion into Paradiſe. What muſt an impartial ſpectator think of ſuch a converſation? Muſt he not conclude that Jeſus really had a power over departed ſpirits, to appoint them to a ſtate of happineſs, and that the thief had a full perſuaſion of this truth, and ventured his ſalvation upon it?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Another circumſtance was the cry which Jeſus uttered as he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring. "Father, into thy hands, I commend my ſpirit."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxiii.46.</note> Theſe words it is ſaid, he cried with a loud voice; which was an evidence of the inward ſtrength and vigour, both of his body and mind, notwithſtanding his pain and
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028256_0068_0FD848514104A690"/>
and the loſs of blood from his wounds. It was alſo an indication, that he died at his own time, that no man took his life from him, but that he laid it down of himſelf, and reſigned his ſpirit into the hands of his father. It is obſerved, by one of the hiſtorians, that when Joſeph of Arimathea, begged of Pilate, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus, "Pilate marvelled if he were already dead," and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, till he had called the Centurion, and was aſſured of it by him;<note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 44.</note> whence it appears that Jeſus died much ſooner than it was uſual for perſons in thoſe circumſtances to die; and indeed ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the companions of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>This loud expiring cry, joined with the other circumſtances abovementioned, drew from the Centurion and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that honeſt confeſſion.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 38.</note> "Truly this man was the Son of God." The penetration and ſenſibility which were diſcovered by theſe military characters,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:028256_0069_0FD84886814702D8"/>
did them much honour. They were greatly affected with the ſingularity and ſolemnity of the ſcene; their confeſſion was the reſult of conviction; it was vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and ſincere, and they could have no inducement to make it, but the force of truth.</p>
            <p>The Centurion's expreſſion as given by Luke is, "certainly this was a righteous man;" <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xxiii.47.</note> which amounts to what the penitent thief had ſaid, "This man hath done nothing amiſs," or to what Pilate had ſaid before, "I find no fault in this man." Theſe are full and ſufficient proofs of the <hi>innocency</hi> of the character of Jeſus; but the teſtimony, "that he was the SON of GOD," riſes ſtill higher and proves that the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian did believe him to have been a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of extraordinary dignity, honoured with a ſpecial commiſſion from God. He had doubtleſs learned this phraſe from his acquaintance with the Jews, it being one of the names, by which they were uſed to call the Meſſiah, whom
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:028256_0070_0FD84852DBA210F0"/>
they expected.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm ii.7.</note> He probably knew that Jeſus was put to death, for aſſuming this character; he had heard him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly pray to God, on the croſs, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him <hi>Father</hi>; "Father, forgive them." "Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;" and he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe from the extraordinary behaviour of the ſufferer, and the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn appearance of the face of nature, on that memorable day, that Jeſus was ſincere in theſe addreſſes, and that God had heard him; whence it was natural for him to conclude, that there was ſome ſpecial union and relation between God and him, as between a father and a ſon; that he was inveſted by the father, with a power over death and the future ſtate; that he had a kingdom beyond the grave, in the unſeen world, and could diſpoſe of departed ſouls at his pleaſure. Such a teſtimony, coming from ſuch a perſon, at ſuch a time, reflects the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour on the character of Jeſus, and is a ſtriking evidence in favour of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:028256_0071_0FD8488805BD44D0"/>
the chriſtian revelation. Could any perſon more deſervedly receive ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought, unbiaſſed teſtimonies? Can we wonder that his diſciples loved him, when thoſe who had no particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with him, but to aſſiſt in his execution, have expreſſed ſuch a full conviction of his dignity and glory and the ſpotleſs purity of his character? Who, judging only by the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and attending to the evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, were fully perſuaded that his pretenſions were juſt and his character divine?</p>
            <p>Permit me, here to introduce a fine paſſage, from the late excellent Biſhop Sherlock; where he compares and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines the different characters of Jeſus and Mahomet; both of whom are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by their reſpective followers to have been meſſengers from GOD.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sermons vol. 1.

            <p>THE dignity and ſolemnity of this grand event, and the infinitely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous conſequences of it to us and to all mankind, may juſtly ſtrike our minds with awe and reverence; yet if we would entertain a juſt idea of it, we muſt enter familiarly into all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;

and even into the affections, the weakneſſes and the prejudices of thoſe who were firſt acquainted with it; for they were human beings like our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, having reaſon and paſſion in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe at once; and the tumult of both produced thoſe effects; which we are now to contemplate.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to read the hiſtory of the life and death of Jeſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving the conſtant, zealous and reſpectful attention of his female friends. We find among them ſingular inſtances of attachment to a worthy and amiable character in the moſt diſtreſſing ſcenes. They gave the ſtrongeſt proofs of their love to him, even when moſt of his choſen diſciples forſook him; they kept as near to him as the circumſtances he was in would allow; and, they would gladly have miniſtered to him and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him in his laſt moments, had they been permitted.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028256_0075_0FD84891D04BB120"/>
death appeared openly and boldly in the character of diſciples. Theſe were Joſeph of Arimathea and Nicodemus both members of the Jewiſh council, but who had not been concerned in the proceedings againſt him. The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God ſo directed the manner of their expreſſing their regard to Jeſus, as to make them inſtrumental of fulfilling two remarkable prophecies reſpecting the Meſſiah. One was that he ſhould not "ſee corruption;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm xvi.10.</note> the other was that he ſhould "make his grave with the wicked and with the rich".<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah liii.9.</note> The two thieves were doubtleſs buried in Golgotha, the common burying ground, in or near the place of crucifixion; but the body of Jeſus, after Joſeph had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave of Pilate, was conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own garden, nigh at hand, in which was a new ſepulchre hewn out of a rock; and becauſe it was the day of preparation before the Sabbath, and it was near night, he thought it beſt to depoſit the body in that new ſepulchre.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028256_0076_0FD8485A41229E70"/>
To preſerve it in the moſt decent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which circumſtances would then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Joſeph and Nicodemus who were both men of wealth, brought fine linen with a large quantity of myrrh and aloes. "Then took they the body of Jeſus, and wound it in the linen cloth, with the ſpices, as the manner of the Jews was to bury." Thus by means of the rich drugs applied to the wounded body, and the linen wrapped around it, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the coolneſs of the rock in which the ſepulchre was hewn, the body of Jeſus was effectually preſerved from corruption, during the time appointed for its continuance in the grave. The entrance of the ſepulchre was cloſed with a great ſtone; and the body being thus ſecured by his friends, they retired and "reſted the ſeventh day according to the commandment."</p>
            <p>But his enemies could not reſt. They remembered what his diſciples had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, that he had foretold his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection on the third day; and they were afraid that ſomething might take
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:028256_0077_0FD8489335201900"/>
place which ſhould give countenance to ſuch a report. They feared that thoſe of his diſciples who had buried him, with the aſſiſtance of others, would come by night and take away his body and would ſo effectually conceal it, that there would be ſufficient ground to ſay that he was riſen from the dead; and thus "the laſt error would be worſe than the firſt." i. e. the people would be more ready to profeſs their regard to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the report of his reſurrection than they were during his life. Filled with this idea, they aſſembled on the Sabbath and went in a body to Pilate, deſiring that the ſepulchre might be ſecured till the third day. He granted them a guard which they placed in Joſeph's garden, to watch the ſepulchre. Having as may well be ſuppoſed, firſt looked into it to ſee that the body was there, they cloſed the entrance and ſealed the ſtone; and it is probable that their deſign was to keep the body till after the third day, and then publicly expoſe it to view; that they might at once ruin the credit
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:028256_0078_0FD8485DAC4EAAA8"/>
of the prediction and the character of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence overruled the deſigns of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as well as the endeavours of his friends, to give the utmoſt ſtrength to the proof of his reſurrection. All poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible care was taken to preſerve and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his body; by his friends, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to ſecure it from removal. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary then for a ſpecial divine agency to be manifeſted, in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that glorious event; on which the truth of the goſpel and our hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation eſſentially depend.</p>
            <p>The ſpace of time in which Jeſus had foretold that he ſhould lie in the grave, is in one place, ſaid to be "three days and and three nights;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xii.40.</note> in other places, the prediction is that he ſhould riſe "on the third day."<note n="†" place="bottom">Ch. xvi.21. and xx.19.</note> According to the Jewiſh mode of reckoning the, evening belonged to the day which followed it, and not to the day which preceeded it.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028256_0079_0FD8489428CFE810"/>
The day ended at the ſetting of the ſun; and then the next day began. The day on which Jeſus died, according to our mode of reckoning, was Friday at three of the clock in the afternoon. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of that day, viz. from that hour to the ſetting of the ſun, the Jews would call the firſt day of his death. Then the next twenty four hours, which ended at ſunſet on the Jewiſh Sabbath, was the ſecond day; and the following night and day, belonged to the third day. The ſeveral phraſes "three days and nights," or "after three days," or "in three days," ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the ſame as, "on the third day;" and thus the Jews underſtood it. For they went to Pilate on the ſecond day, which was the Sabbath, and aſked for a guard to watch the body <hi>till</hi> the third day, leſt his diſciples ſhould come <hi>by night</hi> and take him away. It is evident then that they underſtood the firſt day of the week, to be the day limited by Jeſus for his reſurrection; and if he roſe on
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:028256_0080_0FD8485ED705EFA8"/>
that day then the prophecy was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>The friends of Jeſus were ſo far from intending ſuch a thing as the removal of his body, to favour the ſuppoſition of a reſurrection, that they neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood nor believed what he had ſeveral times told them of his riſing from the dead. They had ſo deeply imbibed the Jewiſh idea of a Meſſiah, who ſhould "abide forever," that when Jeſus was dead, all their hopes were dead alſo. They had ſeen that he did not deliver himſelf from the power of his enemies; but was fallen a ſacrifice to their malice; and with the ideas of temporal domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which they entertained, what could they think of his being the king of Iſrael? As they knew his pious, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and benevolent character, it muſt
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:028256_0081_0FD84895A90BCC18"/>
have filled them with perplexity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his being put to death as a criminal. As the Jews had gratified their malice againſt him, it was natural to expect that the ſame vengeance would be executed on his followers. The terror of this, made them at firſt deſert him; it cauſed Peter to deny him; and it operated ſo ſtrongly on all, that when they came together, to confer on the ſtrange things which had happened, they ſhut themſelves up for fear of the Jews. Such was the ſtate of their minds; and hence it is eaſy to conclude that the apprehenſion of the Jews, leſt theſe men ſhould ſteal the body of Jeſus, and then raiſe a report of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was entirely groundleſs. All which the moſt zealous and forward of them intended, was to embalm it, in the moſt reſpectful and honourable manner, on the day following the Sabbath. For this, they had begun their preparations in the evening, and with an attempt to put this deſign in execution, the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the third day was opened. But
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:028256_0082_0FD84864EE138458"/>
the providence of God diſappointed that deſign and introduced a new, ſurpriſing and magnificent ſcene, of which they had not any idea or expectation. The particular circumſtances of it, I ſhall now recite, in the order, in which, from a compariſon of the four Evangeliſts, I conceive them to have happened.</p>
            <p>When the Sabbath was paſt, i. e. in the evening following the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of James, with Salome and Joanna and other women, bought ſweet ſpices that they might anoint the body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, in the preparation of which they employed themſelves during a part or perhaps the whole of the night. Very early in the morning, juſt as the dawn began to appear, Mary Magdalene went from home, with the other Mary and Salome, to ſee the ſepulchre, leaving Joanna and the other women to bring the ſpices. As they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding toward Joſeph's garden, near Mount Calvary, they ſaid among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, "who ſhall roll away the ſtone
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028256_0083_0FD8489A771DC978"/>
from the door of the ſepulchre? For it was very great." It is evident from this converſation, that ſome of them had ſeen the ſtone placed there by Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph and Nicodemus, two evenings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and the removal of this ſtone, was the only difficulty, of which they had any apprehenſion; the guard hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been placed there in the evening preceeding, without their knowledge. But, when they approached the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, they ſaw the ſtone removed; and it had been removed in a manner of which they had not the leaſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For, about the time of their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out from home, there was an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake; the noiſe of which would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have awakened the guard, if they had been aſleep; and an angel of the Lord had deſcended from heaven, and came into the garden, and removed the ſtone from the door of the ſepulchre, and ſat upon it. "His countenance was like lightning," flaſhing around him; "and his raiment white as ſnow; and for fear of him" the guards trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028256_0084_0FD8486653112E08"/>
and became as dead. At the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of this majeſtic appearance of the angel, and the terror of the guards; Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, being awakened from the ſleep of death, probably by another angel, aroſe and came out of the ſepulchre; his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being transformed in ſuch a peculiar manner, as to be viſible or inviſible at his pleaſure; and, the ſame peculiarity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the angels alſo. It is probable that the guards, as ſoon as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from their ſurprize, and ſeen the ſepulchre open, fled from the garden; for there is no account, that any of them were ſeen by the friends of Jeſus, at their approach.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Mary Magdalene, who was the foremoſt of the company, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the ſtone was taken away, and the ſepulchre open, ſhe left her companions, and ran to inform Peter and John, of what ſhe had diſcovered; and ſaid to them, "they have taken away the Lord, out of the ſepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:028256_0085_0FD81B59D91CECB0"/>Whilſt ſhe was gone on this errand, the other women advanced to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and went in; where they ſaw an angel in the likeneſs of a young man, ſitting on the right ſide, clothed in a long white garment, and they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted. But he ſaid to them, "be not affrighted, ye ſeek Jeſus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, who was crucified; he is riſen, he is not here; behold the place where they laid him. But go your way, tell his diſciples, and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galilee; there ſhall ye ſee him, as he ſaid to you." Having diſtinctly heard theſe words, they went out and fled; and it is remarked, that they ſaid nothing to any perſon whom they met by the way; though probably they met ſome of their own friends.</p>
            <p>After they were gone, Peter and John, who had heard the report of Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene, came running to the ſepulchre. John out ran Peter and came firſt; and ſtooping down, he looked in and ſaw the linen cloths, in which the body of Jeſus had been encloſed, but he went
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028256_0086_0FD84867D0AE8200"/>
not in. When Peter came, he went in and made a further diſcovery; that the napkin which was about his head did not lie with the other linen, but was wrapped together in a place by itſelf. Then John went in and ſaw the ſame, and <hi>he believed,</hi> i. e. he was the firſt of the diſciples who believed the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Lord. For as yet, the others knew not the meaning of the ſcripture, and of his own prediction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he ſhould riſe from the dead. Theſe two diſciples having examined all the objects preſented to their view, went away and probably called together the reſt of the eleven, to tell them what they had ſeen.</p>
            <p>But Mary Magdalene, who had come back to the ſepulchre, with, or ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Peter and John, ſtayed without, at the door, weeping; and as ſhe wept, ſhe ſtooped down, and ſaw two angels, who had been inviſible, whilſt Peter and John were there. They were cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in white, and were ſitting one at the head, the other at the feet of the place
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028256_0087_0FD8489DC9B8EFF8"/>
were the body of Jeſus had lain. They ſaid to her, "Woman, why weepeſt thou?" She anſwered, "Becauſe they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him." When ſhe had ſaid this, ſhe turned herſelf back and ſaw Jeſus, but knew not that it was he. Jeſus ſaid to her, "Woman, why weepeſt thou? whom ſeekeſt thou?" She ſuppoſing him to be the Gardener, ſaid, "Sir, if thou haſt borne him hence tell me where thou haſt laid him, and I will take him away." Obſerve, ſhe did not name the perſon, for whom ſhe was looking, but concluded that the keeper of the garden muſt know whom ſhe meant. Jeſus then aſſuming his uſual familiar voice, called her "Mary!" In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, ſhe knew the joyful ſound, and flew to embrace him, crying "Rabboni! or my Maſter." But Jeſus ſaid "Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father." The meaning was, do not now ſpend time in embracing me, I ſhall not yet leave the world, and go to my father; you will have opportunity to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028256_0088_0FD848694A446B00"/>
ſee me again; "but go to my brethren and ſay to them, I aſcend to my father and your father, to my God and your God." This was the firſt appearance of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>His next appearance was to the other Mary and Salome, and, probably the other women, Joanna and her company who were bringing the ſpices and had turned back alſo. For as the women were going to deliver to the diſciples the meſſage which the angels had given them: Jeſus met them, ſaying "All hail!" And they, came and held him by the feet, and worſhipped him. Then ſaid Jeſus to them, "Be not afraid, go tell my brethren, that they go before me into Galilee and there ſhall they ſee me."</p>
            <p>Should any difficulty ariſe from the account given by Luke of the women's viſit to the ſepulchre; where he ſpeaks of two men in ſhining garments who gave them a meſſage to the diſciples of the ſame import, though not preciſely in the ſame words, as that which Matthew and Mark have recorded; candour will
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028256_0089_0FD848A4299631C8"/>
oblige us to ſolve it, by ſuppoſing, either that ſome of them ſaw but one, and others both the angels; who might make themſelves viſible at one time and not at another, to one perſon and not to another or elſe, that different women came in ſucceſſion to the ſepulchre and that the angels, repeated the meſſage to them.</p>
            <p>When theſe women came into the city, they went to the eleven, who had met together. To them they reported what they had ſeen and heard; but their words ſeemed as idle tales and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them not. This obſervation muſt be applied only to the major part of the eleven; for John had been to the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, and had obſerved ſo much, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to believe the reſurrection of Jeſus; and Peter was wondering in his heart at the things which had happened. On this report of the women, who ſaid that they had ſeen a viſion of angels, Luke ſays that "Peter aroſe and ran to the ſepulchre." This is ſuppoſed to have been a ſecond viſit, which he
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028256_0090_0FD8486BCFDB1500"/>
made; but, at this ſecond viſit, <hi>he</hi> ſaw no angels; he only looked in, and ſaw the linen cloths lying as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Either with Peter or ſoon after, ſome others of the eleven went thither and found the ſepulchre in the ſame ſituation; but they ſaw not the angels, nor their riſen Lord.</p>
            <p>About this time, Cleopas and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the diſciples departed from the city to go to Emmaus; in which jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they had an interview with Jeſus, which completely ſatisfied them that he was riſen from the dead. The deſign of this appearance of Jeſus was to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs on the minds of theſe two diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, an argument for the truth of his being the Meſſiah which had not been conſidered by any of them as it ought to have been, I mean the argument from prophecy. That they might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this argument properly and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their reaſon in judging of it, he did not diſcover himſelf at once; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed himſelf in the habit of a traveller and entered into familiar converſation
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:028256_0091_0FD848A4329B0848"/>
with them, on the ſubject. Having thus in a rational way prepared their minds for the belief of his reſurrection, of which they had heard ſome report; but were in doubt and ſadneſs on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, her preſented himſelf before them as their riſen Lord, and gave them ſenſible evidence of the truth of what the women had reported.</p>
            <p>On their return to the city, they found that the evidence of this great event had gained ground during their abſence, by an appearance of the Lord to Simon, the particulars of which are not record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but neither the report of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance nor of his being ſeen of them at Emmaus was ſatisfactory to the eleven, until Jeſus himſelf came into the midſt of them, and did eat and drink before them; and made them handle him and judge on the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and demonſtrative proof, that, the ſame body which had been crucified, dead and buried was alive again. The ſame kind of demonſtration was given to Thomas at their next meeting, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:028256_0092_0FD8486D028F26C0"/>
thus the whole number were fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the moſt infallible evidence.</p>
            <p>It is now proper to turn our attention to the enemies of Jeſus, and ſee what effect this extraordinary event had on them. It is ſaid by Matthew, that "<hi>ſome</hi> of the watch came into the city, and told the chief prieſts all things that were done," as far as they were acquainted with them. Theſe ſoldiers doubtleſs told the truth, and probably <hi>others</hi> of them might tell the ſame truth to other people. Such an event was an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſurpriſe and concern to the Jewiſh prieſts, whoſe intereſt it was to ruin the credit of the miracle. When they had aſſembled and conſulted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they found no other means in their power to do this, but to bribe the ſoldiers with a large ſum of money, to tell this lie, "that the diſciples of Jeſus had come by night and ſtolen him away, whilſt they ſlept," and when the ſoldiers objected, that they ſhould be puniſhed for breach of duty, they gave them this aſſurance, "if it come to the Governor's
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028256_0093_0FD848A630012B58"/>
ears, we will perſuade him, and ſecure you." This argument prevailed; they took the money, and did as they were commanded. This report became cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among the Jews, and continued ſo till the time when the goſpel of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew was written, in which their arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was detected, and expoſed.</p>
            <p>Such were the circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; and from the whole, we may fairly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this obſervation; that if there had been ſuch a pre-concerted plan among the diſciples, as the Jews pretended, we ſhould have found them watching for the event, and ſeizing the firſt report as incontrovertible evidence. But in fact, it was a matter of prophecy, which none of them underſtood or expected. The news was received by them with ſurpriſe; and it was a long time before they could overcome their prejudices. Their incredulity in ſuch a caſe, is the ſtrongeſt evidence, that there was no fraud, no deſign, no artifice. Nothing but the moſt demonſtrative proof could
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:028256_0094_0FD8487160C58E90"/>
convince them; and when this was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they finally yielded themſelves to its force, and believed, that they had ſeen not a ſpectre as at firſt they imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the real riſen body of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved maſter.</p>

            <head>ON THE QUESTION, WHY THE EVIDENCE OF THE RESURRECTION OF JESUS CHRIST RESTS ENTIRELY ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN DISCIPLES.</head>
            <p>AMONG the objections which the wiſdom of this world hath made to the ſyſtem of chriſtianity, it hath been alledged that the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt was witneſſed by none but his own diſciples; and the credibility of the fact hath been ſuppoſed to be greatly injured by this circumſtance. It is ſaid, that "the reſurrection, ſuppoſing it to have taken place, admitted of public and ocular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:028256_0095_0FD848A8EDE74438"/>
to all Jeruſalem at leaſt. A thing which every body is required to believe, requires that the proof of it ſhould be equal to all, and univerſal. Inſtead of this, a ſmall number of perſons are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced as proxies for the whole world, to ſay that they ſaw it; and all the reſt of the world are called upon to believe it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Age of Reaſon page 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer to this objection, I will now endeavour to ſhow why this great and capital fact is atteſted in this particular manner; or, why the apoſtles and other diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt were the only witneſſes of his reſurrection. To vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this part of the conduct of divine providence let the following things be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Jewiſh prieſts and rulers had ſufficient evidence of his reſurrection without being eye witneſſes of it. They were perſons endowed with conſummate art and policy: They were fully aware of the conſequence of what Jeſus had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told concerning his own reſurrection:
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028256_0096_0FD8487242B7D8B8"/>
They ſaw that the cauſe of chriſtianity would be ſucceſsful if this point were to be believed; and, they took all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care to prevent <hi>all</hi> which they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed could or would be done to favour ſuch a report. They procured a guard and placed it at the ſepulchre, and ſealed the ſtone, to prevent the diſciples from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by night to ſteal the body. There was but <hi>one</hi> night in which there could be any apprehenſion of ſuch an event, and that night conſiſted of not more than ten hours, from the cloſe of one twilight to the dawn of the next. Now, who can believe that a company of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoldiers, in ſuch circumſtances, would not do their duty, for one night? Or if they had not done their duty, who can, believe that they would not have been puniſhed for their negligence? What the Roman diſcipline was in ſuch caſes we may learn from a ſimilar circumſtance. Peter was impriſoned by the command of Herod, and was miraculouſly delivered in the night by the miniſtry of an angel.<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts xii.18, 19.</note>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:028256_0097_0FD848A9BB99A8F0"/>
"As ſoon as it was day there was no ſmall ſtir among the ſoldiers, what was become of Peter; and when Herod had ſought for him and could not find him, he examined the keepers, and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they ſhould be <hi>put to death.</hi>" This was agreeable to the martial law of the Romans; and can any perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Jewiſh prieſts would have behaved, with ſo much tenderneſs and delicacy toward theſe ſoldiers, as not to have complained to the governor and had the martial law executed upon them, if they had been really guilty of ſleeping on guard? The acknowledged fact is, that the ſepulchre was opened and the body gone. Had there been really a ſuſpicion that it was ſtolen, they would have argued, that it muſt have been done either by force or by fraud. The guard was ſet to prevent force, and there would have been reſiſtance made, the evidence of which would have appeared on trial, in vindication of the ſoldiers. The ſeal on the ſtone was to prevent fraud; which could not have been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028256_0098_0FD848F764A37C70"/>
without connivance; and in this caſe, the broken ſeal would have been evidence againſt them. Sleeping on guard was a breach of truſt, and if urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an excuſe, could not have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them. But the truth is, that the ſoldiers were not brought to a trial, and therefore had no opportunity to juſtify themſelves by declaring what they knew to be fact, and the reaſon of their not having been brought to trial was that no complaint was made againſt them; nor did it conſiſt with the policy of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh rulers to make ſuch a complaint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would have brought the truth to light and defeated their own deſign.</p>
            <p>That ſuch a report, viz. of the ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the body of Jeſus by his diſciples was current among the Jews, is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is equally true, that the apoſtles knew how it came to be current. Should it be aſked, how could ſuch an artleſs ſet of men as the apoſtles are repreſented to be, have penetrated this ſecret? It may be anſwered; we are informed by Luke, the writer of the Acts of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:028256_0099_0FD848B30713EB90"/>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Chap, vi.7.</note> that after ſome time "the word of God increaſed and the number of the diſciples was greatly multiplied in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and a great company of <hi>the prieſts</hi> were obedient to the faith." Theſe prieſts were probably acquainted with the artifice, the fiction and the bribery which had been practiſed by their brethren; and upon their converſion would naturally communicate it to the apoſtles, of which number Matthew was one, who publiſhed it in his goſpel. The Jewiſh rulers had no means in their power to contradict what was thus pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. They did not attempt to prove, that the body was ſtolen; nor to account for its being miſſing; nor to produce it from its concealment, though they had ſufficient power to make a ſearch and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient inducement to detect the fraud, if any had been really ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The concluſion then is, that they were conſcious to themſelves of the truth of the reſurrection of Jeſus. They knew that they had bribed the ſoldiers
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:028256_0100_0FD848B44D080388"/>
to make a falſe report, and why ſhould they have done this, if they had not been convinced that Jeſus was riſen? Let any one who is acquainted with the motives and principles of human actions judge, whether, if the charge of bribery and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery thus brought againſt the Jews by the chriſtians, had been falſe, the Jews would not have taken ſome method to vindicate themſelves. There was an open controverſy between the chriſtians and the Jews on that queſtion, whether Jeſus were riſen from the dead. The chriſtians boldly and publicly aſſerted it, and declared themſelves witneſſes of it. And how did the Jews manage their part of the controverſy? They contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and blaſphemed: They threatned and perſecuted: They did all which power and malice could do, to hinder the doctrine from being propagated. And what kind of proof is this? It is a ſpecies of argument which has often been uſed in a bad cauſe; but never produced conviction in the mind of any ſincere inquirer. Since no other argument but
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028256_0101_0FD848B5CD02C7B0"/>
violence was by them oppoſed to the chriſtian doctrine, we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they had no other to uſe; and there is ſufficient ground for us to believe that the Jewiſh rulers <hi>knew</hi> that Jeſus was riſen; but endeavoured to conceal the truth and ſubſtitute a falſhood in its place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> It will follow, then, that they were of all men moſt <hi>unworthy</hi> to be indulged with any other evidence or mode of conviction. They had diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the greateſt enmity and malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jeſus Chriſt, his perſon, his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, his miracles and the ſucceſs of his public miniſtry: Their prejudice againſt him was ſo ſtrong; that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſiſt the plaineſt evidence, which could be offered. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then would have been any other evidence than what they already had? Would it have produced an alteration in their temper or behaviour? What was their conduct toward Lazarus, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jeſus had raiſed him from death?" "They gathered a council, and ſaid,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:028256_0102_0FD848B862127150"/>
what do we? For this man doth many miracles, if we let him alone, all men will believe on him. And they conſult-that they might put Lazarus to death, becauſe that by reaſon of him, many of the Jews believed on Jeſus."<note n="*" place="bottom">John xi.47, 48, and xii.10.</note> Now would not the ſame enmity have operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame way againſt Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Would not the ſame malice, which put him to death once, have attempted to kill him again? Should it be ſaid, that Jeſus might eaſily have eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their hands, as he did ſeveral times, during his life and before his hour was come; ſuppoſe he had, what uſe would ſuch malicious enemies have made of this circumſtance? They would have ſaid, that it was a ghoſt or ſpectre, which appeared, and not the real riſen body of Jeſus: They would have ſaid that the ſenſes of the people were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by magic; that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with a fictitious appearance, and thus they would have evaded the proof of his reſurrection. Did they not treat
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:028256_0103_0FD848BB34E40DE8"/>
his miracles in this manner? Theſe were open and public. The witneſſes were ſo many, that the facts could not be denied; but how did the enemies of Jeſus evade this proof of his divine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? "He caſteth out devils, by Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub prince of the devils." If ſuch was their malicious diſpoſition, how eaſy would it have been for them to invent ſome ſuch reaſon for the appearance preſented to the view of the people, and aſcribe it to ſome infernal artifice?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It may be inquired, if Jeſus had appeared openly and publicly to the Jews, his enemies, after his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what additional evidence could we have derived from it? How ſhould we have known that he thus appeared? If the Jews were ſo full of malice as to try all in their power to deſtroy chriſtianity, is it probable that they would have given their teſtimony and left it on record, that they had ſeen Jeſus alive again, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death? Such a thing could not have been expected. If they had left no ſuch teſtimony, then we muſt have
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:028256_0104_0FD848BE65A45270"/>
received it from his friends and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as we do now: We muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on their credibility as we do now; and what addition could have been made to the evidence from their teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had appeared to his enemies?</p>
            <p>Beſides, the malice of his enemies might have induced them to deny that they had ſeen him: They were certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked enough to have done this. And, what if it had been recorded by ſome Jewiſh hiſtorian; that the prieſts and rulers of his nation, had openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that they had ever ſeen the riſen Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, when the apoſtles had teſtified the contrary? Here would have been a claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of evidence, and the proof would have been weakened by it. For, if one witneſs appeals to another for the truth of any fact, and that other perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, the appeal is ſo far from helping, that it injures the evidence very materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becauſe it will naturally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that one or the other is in the wrong. It is plain then, that the credibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this fact could not have been better
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:028256_0105_0FD848BE6B8AD5D8"/>
eſtabliſhed, but might have been eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally injured, if the apoſtles had ſaid that the enemies of Jeſus had ſeen him after his reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The truth is, that not the number, but the character of the witneſſes is moſt to be regarded. If a few men can make it ſufficiently appear that what they ſay is true, there is as full evidence to a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable inquirer, as if the number were ever ſo great. And, the caſe before us is of ſuch a nature, that we could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expect any evidence, but what is given us by the friends of Jeſus; nor is there the leaſt neceſſity for any other. For the further illuſtration of this point, let it be conſidered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> That the diſciples of Jeſus were <hi>competent</hi> witneſſes of his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; both in regard to <hi>number</hi> and <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The number of the apoſtles was <hi>eleven</hi>; the number of diſciples who kept togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a body at Jeruſalem, was <hi>one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, i.15.</note> and the number by
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:028256_0106_0FD848BFB1C36910"/>
whom Jeſus was ſeen at once, was above <hi>five hundred</hi>; of whom the greater part were alive at the time when Paul wrote his firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv.6.</note> Had there been any doubt of the fact, by any ſerious inquirer, during the firſt age of the church, how eaſy would it have been to find one or more living witneſſes, of whom ſatisfaction might have been obtained? Suppoſe there were now, any doubt reſpecting an event, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in this country, forty or fifty years paſt; would it not be an eaſy matter to inquire, who is now living that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers it, and was then of ſufficient age to notice it, who had ſeen and heard what was the foundation of the report? And could not full ſatisfaction be gained by ſuch an inquiry? Would an event thus eſtabliſhed by the concurrent teſtimony of ſeveral witneſſes, loſe its credit with the next generation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when all thoſe who had been eye and ear witneſſes ſhould be dead? Eſpecially, if care had been tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by them, to commit the ſtory to writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:028256_0108_0FD848C10E8EB328"/>
and thus preſerve the memory of it? And, more eſpecially, if there had been a particular <hi>day</hi> ſet apart to celebrate the event and perpetuate the remembrance of it? Let us take an example, familiar to ourſelves. Do not we know, that on a certain day, in a certain year, of the preſent century, the delegates of theſe American ſtates, in Congreſs aſſembled, declared them <hi>independent</hi>? Should any perſon now, or within a few years hence doubt this fact, may not an appeal be made to thoſe perſons who were then living and acting in that great affair? Or, ſhould any doubt be made a century, or ſeveral centuries hence, when all the preſent generation will be in their graves; may not an appeal be made to public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, or to approved hiſtories, or to the annual celebration of the day on which the act was paſſed? And, will not this be reaſonable and convincing evidence? Juſt ſuch evidence we have that Jeſus roſe from the dead. It was a fact, ſeen and known, witneſſed and believed, by perſons who could not have miſtaken
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:028256_0109_0FD848C60CB1B1E0"/>
the fact; by numbers, by great numbers of them. There has been an authentic hiſtory of it written by eye-witneſſes, and preſerved by their ſucceſſors, There has alſo been a familiar monument of it preſerved among them; the firſt day of every week is regarded as a day of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious reſt and worſhip; it has been, for almoſt eighteen centuries, invariably kept, and underſtood to be kept ſacred, in memory of that great event. If any perſon in this age of the world ſhould doubt the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, let him ſeek ſome other reaſon for the obſervation of the Lord's day: Let him tell us when it began to be kept, and by whom, and for what purpoſe; and if he can give no other, or no more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory account of it, than is given in the books of the evangelical hiſtorians, let him be aſhamed of doubting or heſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to admit the truth of that account.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>character</hi> of the witneſſes, let it be obſerved, that they not only had full opportunity to know the truth and ſatisfy themſelves of it; but it was a
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:028256_0110_0FD848C705677410"/>
matter which they did not at once believe. They did not underſtand the predictions of the prophets nor of Jeſus himſelf; and therefore did not expect and were by no means prepared to believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of their Lord before it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. It was as new and ſurprizing to them, as if there had not been a word ſpoken concerning it. And, when the evidence of it was preſented to them, it was a long time before they were all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. They needed the moſt ſenſible, demonſtrative proof: They exerciſed their ſenſes and their reaſon in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and after the moſt full and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inquiry, they were convinced by "many infallible proofs."</p>
            <p>The evidence ſeems to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to them, in proportion to the reſpective ſtrength and capacity of their minds. The firſt appearance of Jeſus was to Mary Magdalene; the ſecond, which immediately followed it, was to the other Mary and her companions. Theſe women were the moſt zealous and affectionate friends of Jeſus; and the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028256_0111_0FD848C896FA9180"/>
firſt diſcovery of himſelf to them was doubtleſs intended as a reward for their faithful attention to him in his laſt hours before his death. But, there might be another reaſon for it. The female mind is well known to be ſudden in its deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: It does not ſtay to inquire, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine and compare ideas, and deduce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from various premiſes; but it ſeizes its object at once, or in want of it, falls into agony and diſtreſs. In conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention to this habit of acquiring truth, Jeſus did not leave his female friends in doubt, but ſatisfied them immediately of the truth of his reſurrection; and they received it with a tranſport of joy. Not ſo was it with his other friends. John, the beloved diſciple was indeed the firſt who believed the reſurrection; but he was left to draw his concluſion from ſeveral premiſes: He ſaw no angel, he heard no voice, he had no actual ſight of the riſen Jeſus; but, from comparing the ſtate in which he found the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, with what he remembered to have read in the ſcriptures, and with what
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028256_0112_0FD848CDD6F51B10"/>
Jeſus had ſpoken when he was alive, he drew his concluſion in favour of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of his maſter. Others had their doubts removed by degrees, and by different repreſentations of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to their minds. Thus there was an exerciſe of reaſon in judging of the evidence, and the reſult was conviction and faith. This is the right way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming true believers.</p>
            <p>If it be admitted that they believed the reſurrection and could not have been deceived in gaining this belief, the next inquiry is, what reaſon could they have for propagating the knowledge of it? Was it conducive to their temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt? No, they were poor before, and they had no proſpect of making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rich, by oppoſing the general ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, of the ruling party among their nation. Was it calculated to make them famous and reſpected in the eyes of the world? For enough from this! Their doctrine was to the Jews a ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the Greeks, fooliſhneſs. Was there any hope of their enjoying
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028256_0113_0FD848CF4183DCF8"/>
eaſe and tranquility? No, their apoſtolio character expoſed them to labour and travel; to be perſecuted and impriſoned; to endure all kinds of ſufferings, to which human nature ſubmits with the utmoſt reluctance. Were they overheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with enthuſiaſm? No men were more prudent and cautious and took more pains to avoid giving offence. Indeed their doctrine was contrary to the luſts and paſſions of mankind; and the ſpirit by which they were animated, obliged them honeſtly and boldly to maintain their principles and teſtify what they knew to be the truth; and by theſe means much oppoſition was excited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. The fault however lay not in them, but in their enemies. The religion which they preached and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed was full of love and good will to men; but it tended to diſturb and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the falſe opinions, the idolatrous worſhip and the licentious morals, which had been long eſtabliſhed in the heathen world; as well as the formality and hypocriſy which reigned in the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:028256_0114_0FD848D1090138B8"/>
Jewiſh nation; and therefore, all the policy and power of the prieſts and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, firſt among the Jews, and afterward among the Gentiles were oppoſed to it. In theſe circumſtances, what inducement could theſe men have to undertake ſuch a mighty work as to preach the goſpel <hi>to all nations</hi>? What, but a full convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its truth and importance, and a full expectation of receiving their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not in this but in a future ſtate? That they had this expectation, and this alone to ſupport and comfort their minds in the midſt of their apoſtolic labours and ſufferings, we have the teſtimony of one of the moſt indefatigable of them, who in his admirable diſcourſe on the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſays of himſelf and his brethren, "If in this life only, we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>If the apoſtles were competent and credible witneſſes of the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, we have only to inquire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:028256_0115_0FD848D2733ECE10"/>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> In what manner and with what degree of credibility is their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony handed down to us? In anſwer to this inquiry, it may be obſerved in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that there is as good hiſtorical evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth of what is delivered to us on this ſubject, as there is of any fact or went whatever, and he who ſcruples to admit this truth muſt deny all hiſtory and all teſtimony reſpecting any paſt event.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is ſufficient evidence from <hi>Roman</hi> hiſtorians, that there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt; that he lived and died in the reign of Tiberius Ceſar, and under the adminiſtration of Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Governour of Judea; that the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he taught was maintained by his followers; that it ſpread firſt in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, where if it had contained any error or impoſture it muſt have been ſooneſt and moſt eaſily detected; that it was propagated in Rome; the moſt learned and enlightened city then in the world; that the believers of this religion were deſpiſed and perſecuted; but, that the
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:028256_0116_0FD848D89AD0DA58"/>
oppoſition which they met with, inſtead leſſening, increaſed their numbers. There is therefore, as good evidence of the exiſtence of the chriſtian religion, as of any fact or event of equal antiquity. There is evidence that it began in the reign of Tiberius; and there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it began ſooner. Thus far the Roman and Chriſtian hiſtories agree.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The books which are handed down to us as the wirtings of the firſt diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, bear as evident marks of genuine antiquity as the books of Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny and other Roman hiſtorians of the ſame age. They give the chronology of the events which they relate; they tell us in whoſe reign they happened, and who were Governours of the Roman Provinces, and they are found to agree in theſe circumſtances with contemporary writers, as far at leaſt, as thoſe writers agree with each other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the evangelical hiſtorians have teſtified things which no other hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have teſtified, it was becauſe no other
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028256_0117_0FD848D9F22C8F08"/>
hiſtorians had the ſame opportunities and advantages to examine and be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſuch facts. That ſuch facts and events are poſſible, no one who believes the wiſdom and power of God can doubt; and if they were real, and were tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch an age and ſuch a part of the world as they are ſaid to have been, by what other, what better evidence could they have been ſupported than the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of perſons who were themſelves eye-witneſſes of them? If then, we give any credit to ancient hiſtory; if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any facts or events of equal anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with the death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, how can we reject the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe great and important facts without being chargeable with inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and folly?</p>
            <p>The ſame thing may be ſaid reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the goſpel, which Moſes ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the law; "Set your hearts to all the words which I teſtify to you, for it is not a vain thing, it is your life." Our eternal life depends on the truth of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, of which the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028256_0107_0FD848DB45EEA188"/>
grand deciſive proof is, his reſurrection from the dead. If Jeſus be not riſen from the dead, then we have no other aſſurance of immortality than Socrates or Cicero had, whoſe beſt expectations were founded on conjecture and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; and whoſe hope extended no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the future exiſtence of the ſoul, in a ſtate of ſeparation from the body, of which they had but vague and indiſtinct conceptions. But, if Jeſus be riſen, then "immortality is brought to light," we have a clear and definite idea of it, and a well grounded hope of its certainty in God's due time. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for the enjoyment of this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, we muſt believe in this ſaviour, and our hearts and lives muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to his precepts and example. Though we have not ſeen him, yet we may love him and follow him; and we ſhall then partake of that bleſſing, which he has pronounced on them" who have <hi>not ſeen</hi> and yet have believed."</p>

            <head>ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE RESURREC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF JESUS CHRIST, AND THE TRUTHS DEDUCIBLE FROM THE CERTAINTY OF THAT EVENT.</head>
            <p>JESUS Chriſt appealed to his reſurrection as the deciſive proof of his divine miſſion and his apoſtles followed his example. They were ſo ſure of the truth of this fact and ſo fully perſuaded of its importance, that they ſcrupled not to riſque the whole credit of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon it. They believed it, on the beſt evidence; they exhibited that evidence to others; they required the belief of this extraordinary fact as a neceſſary term of diſcipleſhip; and, they had ſuch a view of the connection between this and the other doctrines of chriſtianity, that they ſcrupled not to allow, that if this were falſe, all the reſt was not worthy of regard. "If Chriſt be not riſen,

                  </gap> v.14.</note>) then is our preaching vain and your faith alſo is vain." Theſe words fairly imply that if the doctrine of the reſurrection of Chriſt be true, then the preaching of the goſpel and the faith of chriſtians are of the higheſt importance, connected with and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to our eternal ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Having ſtated and vindicated the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this illuſtrious fact, let us at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the conſequences which follow from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If the doctrine of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt be true, then he was the promiſed Meſſiah, the Saviour of the world.</p>
            <p>In the ſame books which contain the evidence of his reſurrection, we have many of his diſcourſes, in ſome of which he declared in the moſt ſolemn manner, that his doctrine was not his own, but his who ſent him; that he ſpake to the world thoſe things which he had heard of the father; that as the father had taught him ſo he ſpake; and in his laſt
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028256_0120_0FD848E3082EECC8"/>
prayer with his diſciples he appealed to the father in theſe words "I have given to them the words which thou gaveſt me." Not only was his doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered but his miracles were wrought by the ſame divine commiſſion. "The works which I do, bear witneſs of me that I came from God." Theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were wrought to prove the truth of his doctrine: They were direct appeals to the ſenſes of mankind. Thoſe who ſaw them, and eſpecially thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the benefit of them muſt have been forcibly convinced, that the perſon who wrought them was endowed with more than human power; and muſt have been induced to attend to his teaching as the moſt ſerious and important truth.</p>
            <p>If we regard the death of Chriſt as that of a martyr, confirming his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with his blood, this muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a weighty evidence of the truth of what he taught; eſpecially when we take into view his holy and exemplary life, and the wiſdom, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humility which he diſcovered
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:028256_0121_0FD848E440D1B398"/>
in his whole conduct. We cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſuch a perſon as he appears to have been would have ventured to die, in any cauſe but that of truth; and if we had no other teſtimony than what ariſes from his miracles and his death, yet that would have been ſufficient to give credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to the doctrines which he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when in addition to this, we are aſſured that God did, by a ſpecial act of his power, raiſe this extraordinary perſon from death to life, exactly as he himſelf had predicted, we have the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt poſſible evidence, that he was ſent by God to enlighten and reform the world both by his doctrine and his example.</p>
            <p>But there was ſomething beyond this in the deſign of his death; ſomething which was prefigured in the Levitical ſacrifices, where an innocent creature, without ſpot or blemiſh, was offered to God in behalf of trangreſſors. In al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to this he is ſaid to have been <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> to God, to be <hi>ſacrificed</hi> for us and to <hi>die for our ſins.</hi> It is certain that he did not die for any ſin of his own; and
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028256_0122_0FD848E75F64B288"/>
it is equally certain that no man could have taken away his life, and that death could have had no power over him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own conſent. But he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God, that he might ſo take away ſin, as that God might be "juſt and yet juſtify the ſinner who believes in him."</p>
            <p>This great event, the death of Chriſt, and the particular purpoſe for which he died<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were foreknown and predetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, before the world was made. This eternal purpoſe was revealed as early as the days of Adam; it was the ſubſtance of the Levitical ſacrifices; it was the ſubject of ſeveral direct prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; it was as capital and eſſential a truth in the ſcriptures of the old as it is in thoſe of the new Teſtament. It may therefore be truly ſaid "that Chriſt died for our ſins, <hi>according to the ſcriptures.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Among the enemies of Chriſt and his religion, his death was reckoned a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the chriſtian cauſe. That the founder of a religious ſyſtem, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he was ſent from God, ſhould be put to death as a malefactor, was a
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028256_0123_0FD848E8E78566B0"/>
thing which in their opinion diſgraced his character and overthrew the merit of his pretenſions. This cavil of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of chriſtianity had ſuch an effect on ſome weak profeſſors, as to induce them to deny the death of Chriſt, and to invent ſome fabulous and abſurd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations of that part of the goſpel hiſtory, to remove the ſcandal, which they imagined was caſt on their religion by that event. But the apoſtles, who were perfectly inſtructed in the religion of their divine maſter, were ſo far from wiſhing to deny or evade this matter, that they eſtabliſhed the fact, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached that Chriſt died, and that he died for our ſins; without this, there could not be any foundation for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them; and without the ignominy of the croſs, there could be no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the glory of the reſurrection.</p>
            <p>The crucifixion and death of Jeſus then are to be conſidered as the direct way to his exaltation. "Becauſe he humbled himſelf and became obedient to death, even the death of the croſs
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028256_0124_0FD848EA4268ED98"/>
therefore God hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name, that in the name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, and every tongue confeſs him Lord, to the glory of God the father."</p>
            <p n="2">II. It follows from the truth of our Lord's reſurrection, that his apoſtles were divinely commiſſioned, to preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel through the world. The ſame books, which contain the evidence of his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, give us an account of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which he gave to his apoſtles; by which he provided in the moſt proper and effectual way for the continuance of his religion in the world. It was not intended that <hi>his</hi> viſit to this world ſhould be of any longer continuance than was neceſſary to eſtabliſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of his divine miſſion, and lay a ſure foundation for our hope of enjoying the benefits of pardon and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. It was fit and right that his voluntary humiliation ſhould be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the higheſt honours, and that he ſhould return in triumph to that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028256_0125_0FD848ED658587A0"/>
world from whence he came. But it was equally neceſſary that his religion ſhould be propagated in this world. His perſonal miniſtry was confined to "the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael;" but he had "other ſheep which were not of that fold," and it was neceſſary that "they alſo ſhould be brought in, that there might be one fold and one ſhepherd." Accordingly when he ſpake of the effect of his death he ſaid, "If I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to me." The commiſſion given to his apoſtles was expreſſed in the moſt univerſal terms, "Go ye into all the world and preach the goſpel to every creature." "Go ye and teach all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions." "As my father hath ſent me ſo ſend I you." The apoſtles under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their commiſſion in this extenſive ſenſe and accordingly each one took his diſtrict and travelled over that part of the world which fell to his lot. Whence we may conclude, that it was the will of Chriſt, that during the firſt and pureſt age; the knowledge of the truth ſhould
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028256_0126_0FD848EEEB1A4188"/>
be propagated through the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the ſame evidence which was exhibited before the eyes of the Jews. The impartial regard which God had to all men would not ſuffer him to confine theſe "glad tidings of great joy" to any particular nation. As he is no reſpecter of perſons, and would have all men ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, ſo the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of truth were ſent forth to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all men every where to repent</p>
            <p>Different people treated the goſpel differently. To ſome it was a "ſavour of life to life; to others of death to death." Some have preſerved ſome parts of the religion of Jeſus pure, whilſt they have corrupted other parts; ſome have preſerved what others have corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome have loſt both the name and the power of it. Theſe differences are to be aſcribed to various cauſes; ignorance, ſuperſtition, impoſture, bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, covetouſneſs, pride, invaſion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and tyranny have in their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective degrees contributed to mar the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:028256_0127_0FD848F065837C30"/>
glory of the chriſtian religion and deface the purity of its inſtitutions; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the combination or preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of theſe cauſes, yet we may reſt aſſured that as the chriſtian religion has not been loſt, ſo "the gates of hell ſhall never prevail againſt it."</p>
            <p n="3">III. From the truth of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt we deduce the <hi>divine authority</hi> of the books of the <hi>new</hi> Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The apoſtles were mortal as well as other men. Had there been no proviſion for a ſucceſſion of teachers, nor any authentic ſtandard of doctrine, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and eſtabliſhed in the chriſtian church, the religion of the goſpel would not have ſurvived the firſt age; but it was intended for a <hi>durable</hi> religion; not to be worn out or diſuſed, but to laſt forever. It was not deſigned for any one age or place, or for any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular claſs or denomination of men; but for mankind univerſally. It has its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the rational nature of man: It applies to his underſtanding, judgment, conſcience, will and affections; and it
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028256_0128_0FD848F1C9EDA040"/>
regards all men equally. It is a religion which has produced converts from heatheniſm and judaiſm; from every ſpecies of idolatry and ſuperſtition in the world: It is adapted to all countries and to all climates: It teaches mankind every where, the ſame truths to be believed; the ſame duties to be practiſed; the ſame examples to be imitated; the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to influence their conduct; and, it ſets before them the ſame hopes and proſpects to animate them in doing and ſuffering the will of God.</p>
            <p>This being the nature and deſign of the religion of Chriſt it was highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary that it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>writing;</hi> and that copies of what was written ſhould be preſerved; ſo that ſucceeding ages might enjoy the benefit of what was delivered by Chriſt and his apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Accordingly we find that there are books preſerved and handed down to us, which have been acknowledged as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic by chriſtians of ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times; by chriſtians of different
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028256_0129_0FD848F4E61B4790"/>
ſects and parties; who, though they have differed widely in their ſentiments, reſpecting ſome of the doctrines taught in theſe writings, yet have conſtantly appealed to them as the ſtandard of truth; and their mutual jealouſy has made them ſo watchful of each other, that no material alteration could have been introduced into theſe books, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being detected, by one party or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Since the art of printing has been diſcovered, the moſt ſcrupulous care has been taken to have theſe books correct; and whilſt there is a ſpirit of inquiry prevailing and opportunity given to all, to ſearch, and judge for themſelves, there can be no danger of any perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſed upon, with regard to the ſenſe of ſcripture.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, we may be ſatisfied on good grounds, that the books delivered to us as the writings of the apoſtles and evangeliſts are genuine and authentic; written as they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the <hi>ſpirit of truth;</hi> which Jeſus Chriſt promiſed to ſend into the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028256_0130_0FD81B608D977E00"/>
world after his aſcention to the right hand of the father.</p>
            <p>It is not however pretended that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration by which the new Teſtament was written extended to particular words and phraſes, and modes of ſpeech. There is a diverſity of ſtyle among the ſacred writers, according to each one's natural gift and particular genius and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But what is meant by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that there was ſuch a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending divine influence with the ſacred writers as brought to their remembrance what they had ſeen and heard of our Lord's diſcourſes and of his life and actions; and preſerved them from committing any material error in the repreſentation which they have given us of the truths of chriſtianity. Nor is this idea of divine inſpiration to be underſtood as if every matter or thing which is occaſionally mentioned in the writings of the apoſtles, were guided and governed by the divine ſpirit. It is evident that ſometimes the apoſtles give their own private opinions, on certain points; at other times they
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028256_0131_0FD848F88E52CF20"/>
introduce ſalutations to their friends; or give directions about common affairs; as particularly where Paul directs Timothy to bring the <hi>cloke</hi> which he left at Troas, with the books and parchments; and adviſes him to drink <hi>wine</hi> with <hi>water</hi> for the ſake of his health. Theſe things are brought in incidentally, in familar epiſtles, and ſhow that the apoſtles were men in ſimilar circumſtances with other men; having the ſame infirmities and wants as ourſelves. But theſe ſmall matters do not detract from the value and importance of thoſe dignified ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſublime deſcriptions which are given in other parts of the ſame writings; of which there is one of the moſt noble ſpecimens in the 15th chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the 1ſt, Epiſtle to the Corinthians. No perſon can read this chapter, with any proper degree of attention, without being forcibly ſtruck with the ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and ſublimity of the ſubject, and the eloquence and pathos of the language; all which together ſtrongly mark it as a diſcourſe written under the direction
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028256_0132_0FD848FACAF14118"/>
of that holy ſpirit which ſearcheth the <hi>deep things</hi> of God; which unveils the glories of the future ſtate; and penetrates into thoſe things which eye could not have ſeen, nor ear heard, nor could have entered into the heart of men, unleſs God had taught them to us by the miniſtry of his Son and his ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Another deduction which we make from the doctrine of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus, is, that the ſcriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> contain <hi>divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were no other proof of this, it would be ſufficient to reſt the truth of it upon the credit of Jeſus Chriſt and that of his apoſtles. For if it be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he came with a divine commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to declare the truth of God, and that he commiſſioned them to propagate the ſame truth; and if it be certain that both he and they appealed to the writings of Moſes and the prophets, as ſacred, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic books, acknowledged as ſuch by the Jewiſh church; if he and they quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the predictions therein contained, and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:028256_0133_0FD848FB8649B9D8"/>
applied them to occaſions and events, in that age in which they lived; then we have the higheſt authority for believing that thoſe books contain revelations of the mind and will of God, who ſpake at ſundry times and in divers manners, to the fathers, by the prophets. Theſe predictions refer to a multitude of events, ſome of which are ſo ſingular and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled, that no human penetration could have foreſeen or even imagined them; but yet we have the moſt credible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their exact fulfilment. One of them is that great event, the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt; for the language of the New Teſtament is, that he roſe again, <hi>according to the ſcriptures.</hi> If therefore he roſe from the dead, then the prophecies of the Old Teſtament, which foretold this among other great events, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by inſpiration of God. Beſides this, it is to be obſerved, that there is ſuch a connection between the chriſtian and the Jewiſh religions, that if one be true the other is true alſo. They are both parts of one plan, the one contains the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028256_0134_0FD848FF58BFAD98"/>
and the other the ſubſtance; one is the letter and the other the ſpirit. The Jewiſh religion cannot be properly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without the chriſtian; which ſhows the fulfilment of many things, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and typified, under that ancient diſpenſation; as any one may be fully ſatisfied by peruſing the epiſtle to the Hebrews, written by a learned Jew, brought up in the ſchool of Gamaliel, but better inſtructed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It alſo follows from the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt, that the reſurrection of the dead is the only true doctrine of <hi>immortality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The heathen world had no clear ideas of futurity. Some of their wiſeſt men had a notion of the immortality of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> conſidered as ſeparate from the body or of its paſſing into and animating oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er bodies; but they had no idea of the reſurrection of the body to life. So ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant were the wiſeſt of them on this point, that when Paul preached <hi>Jeſus</hi> and the <hi>reſurrection</hi> at Athens, they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him "a ſetter forth of ſtrange <hi>Gods,</hi>"
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:028256_0135_0FD84900C1886520"/>
ſuppoſing <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the name of one, and <hi>Anaſtaſis</hi> (the Greek word for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection) to be the name of another. And even with reſpect to the immortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the ſoul, their notions were confuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their proofs vague and inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. Socrates, though he uſed a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of arguments in ſupport of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine yet told his diſciples, "that if the proofs which he offered, ſhould appear inſufficient, it would be neceſſary for them to ſearch for others that would be more ſatisfactory." Cicero, though he endeavoured with all the force of his genius to aſſert the doctrine of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, yet declared "that his belief of it was founded more on the pleaſure of the proſpect, than on the conviction of his mind from the arguments uſed in its favour."<note n="*" place="bottom">Blacklock's Paracleſis, page 297.</note> The truth is, they had ſome ſublime ideas of God, and of the nature of the human ſoul; and they could not bear to think that God would create ſuch a noble being, to live only a ſhort time, in this world and then die
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:028256_0136_0FD84904E5B0E530"/>
with the body. Hence they were led to frame arguments and conjectures, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the <hi>probability</hi> of the ſoul's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exiſtence and immortality, which they wiſhed might prove true; and it is ſaid that Plato intimated his expectation that God would ſome time or other make this matter <hi>certain,</hi> by a revelation to mankind. Such were the ancient <hi>Deiſts</hi>; "they ſet themſelves to prove the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a future ſtate; and caught at every thing which had the ſhadow of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; they were ſenſible of the need of ſuch a doctrine, and gave a degree of plauſibility to the arguments in its favour." Yet it is certain that the true doctrine, of immortality was never brought to lights, but by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. By that great event we are inſtructed, that the goſpel hope of immortality is a reſurrection of the body from death; and a reunion of the ſoul to it, never more to be ſeparated; "that this corruptible ſhall put on in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality and then ſhall be brought to
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028256_0137_0FD849072C52A248"/>
paſs the ſaying that is written, death is ſwallowed up in victory."</p>
            <p>The goſpel indeed does not give us a circumſtantial and particular detail of the employments and entertainments of the future ſtate, as did ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient poets who believed the ſoul's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and as did Mahomet; who framed his ſyſtem agreeable to the taſte and diſpoſition of the people who were to receive it for truth. Divine revelation gives us an aſſurance and a pledge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, by which the certainty of it is eſtabliſhed; but its bliſsful ſcenes are ſo tranſcendently ſublime and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to ſurpaſs the power of deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore we are only told "it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but when he, who is our life, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we ſhall be like him; for we ſhall ſee him as he is!"</p>
            <p>Our buſineſs then is not to pry into the ſecrets of the future ſtate, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for it; to imitate thoſe graces and virtues which appeared in Chriſt, if we expect to have "our bodies faſhioned
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:028256_0138_0FD8490859E1D6D8"/>
like his glorious body," and to comfort ourſelves, and one another with the bleſſed hope of being "changed into his image from glory to glory." <hi>Amen.</hi>
