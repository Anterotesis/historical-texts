            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>HOW d'ye, how d'ye, Neighbour? Well, how goes the World?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>I am pretty well I thank you, only troubled a good deal in Mind.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Why what's the Matter, Man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Matter! Matter enough: I have been at the Warehouse, to have some of my Tobacco inspected.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! Well, pray how is it? I want sadly to know a little: How do you like these new Officers?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>By my Troth, <hi>Tommas,</hi> I can't tell what to say to it; I am really nonplust.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee tell me how it fared with you: Let me hear a little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Hear a little! You shall hear a great deal, if you go to that. Can any Body say, that it is not very hard upon a poor Man, to have Part of his Labour burnt by these Inspectors, because, forsooth they don't like our Tobacco? when at the same time, for aught I can see, they are no better Judges of it than any of us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very hard indeed Neighbour: For my Part, I can't by any manner of Means approve this new Law.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Approve it! No, who can? For they tell me, that if our Tobacco is not 800, they won't pay us for the Cask.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>How so?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>You may depend upon what I tell you, and something worse: For, when I was at the Warehouse, Neighbour <hi>Seconds</hi> brought Two Hogsheads of Tobacco to be viewed, which, to please these Men, he had made above 800: But so it fell out, the Tobacco not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039991_0003_1015884E9E41C210"/>
having been well handled in the Curing, by pressing it hard to make it that Weight, it turn'd black, (as you know Tobacco will do that is not well lookt after;) and what do you think these unmerciful Officers said to him—Why truly, that it was such black Stuff, unless he would pick it, they must burn it all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>What, and so if our Tobacco is not 800, they won't pay us for the Cask; and if, to make it that Weight, it turns black under the Press, which, as you say, all Tobacco will do that is'nt well handled, they'll burn it, will they? Things are come to a fine Pass indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Burn it! Ay, up it goes in a Funk, unless you'll pick it; I must say for them, they'll suffer a poor Man to do That. But there's another Circumstance harder than what you've heard: If our Casks are not exactly of such a Gauge, be our Tobacco never so good, they won't pass it: What think you of that? This seems to me to exceed all the rest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>No, there's nothing new in that, d'ye see: There has been for some Years a Law ord'ring us not to make our Hogsheads above such a Size.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed! Well that's what I never knew before: One of our Neighbours, sometime since, did say that's the Truth on't, that we must make them so and so, and luckily I did, but I never knew there was a Law for it; and till this Year, I am sure we never minded it; every Body made their Casks as big as they pleased.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>That can't be denied, but we—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>What then, this that I thought so very hard, is come to Nothing?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Not to be charged to this new Law, it being—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>It signifies Nothing to talk of it then.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Nothing, d'ye call it? I always thought we were obliged to con—</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Alas, I mean 'tis not material, not worth Noticing in this Case, in this new Law, where there are so many other Things that pinch us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>There I agree with you: I wish with all my Heart <hi>Will,</hi> I could but once understand what our Assembly meant by making such a Law.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Then, as we were saying,—oh—Notwithstanding what so many Folks say, I can't discover One good Thing in the Law.</p>

               <p>Folks say! Why Man, tho' some Folks say as I told you, there are other Folks that say quite contrary: I am sure I have heard a great many Speeches against it at the Race-Grounds, and at the County-Courts, when the Courts were over, and Men were got together in the Ordinary, speaking their Thoughts freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Liking to it, nay, they have publickly curs'd it: And sure we can't all of us be mistaken.—Why, pray is it not a clear Case, don't we see our Tobacco burnt by the Humour of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors? Who can bear such Usage?</p>

Force your self headlong into Rebellion, be hanged, lose your Land, and ruin your Family, rather than submit to a Law, the Great Ones and the Rich Ones must submit to as well as we; a Law, whatever at present we may think of it, was undoubtedly designed by our Burgesses for the Good of the Country.</p>

               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Grumble at! Why, Sir, don't they burn our Tobacco; and is not that enough to make any Man grumble?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>I own they do burn Tobacco, and this Year they'll burn a great deal of Tobacco; for a worse Year for Tobacco we have not had these 20 Years: But what then? If they burn Yours, they'll as readily burn mine, and some of every Man's they'll burn, if we don't sort it carefully before we carry it to them. And now let me ask you a Question, answer me honestly? Is the Tobacco the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors burn, fit for any thing else? Can either of you say, 'tis fit for any Market? If not, then such Trash ought to be destroy'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Why Master, since you have put it so very home to us, we must own, the Tobacco they burn, is not good for much; but then, as bad as it is, we always got something for it, and so, I don't doubt, we should this Year, were we at Liberty; which, we confess, has been a very indefferent Year for Tobacco.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore pray consider: The Accounts we have had for several Years past, from every Port in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> our Tobacco is carry'd to, are full of Complaints, that we make more than all <hi>Europe</hi> can consume, and a great Part of it such Trash, as no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser will meddle with.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>If this be true, Why then, Master, don't they stint us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Stint you! It has been tried, and found ineffectual: And no wonder; for tho' it lessen'd the Quantity, it did not mend the Quality; there was Trash still in Proportion to clog the Markets; and so there would be, reduce the Number of Plants as low as you please: Let us be restrained never so much, we find Ways to make it up, and you own you can fell all.</p>

               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>If you don't send any Home, you must know all of it goes Home; and that a great many of us ship our Tobacco on our own Venture to the Markets: Thousands of Hogsheads are every Year consigned upon Freight to the Merchants in <hi>London, Glascow, Bristol,</hi> and other <hi>Ports:</hi> And can you be such a Simpleton, as not to consider, that the better the Markets are in <hi>Europe,</hi> the more Money you'll sell your Tobacco for here: Or, that when all Trash is destroyed, and our Staple gets a Reputation, the Price for it will advance, and in all Likelihood the Consumption of it increase.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>There seems to be some Sense in that, Master; the better the Commodity, the better it will sell, to be sure.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Thou hast hit it, <hi>Will:</hi> The Lowness of the Markets, I have been long since convinced, is not altogether occasion'd by the Quantity: Therefore, if under the Direction of this Law, we lessen the Quantity, and mend the Quality, by destroying the Trash, we drive the right Nail.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>

               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>No less, my Word for it: If, when your Tobacco is well cull'd, you get as much for 800 that is Clean and Neat, as you could do before this Law for 1200 Tag-rag and Bob-tail, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or Injustice pray will this Law do you? The naked Truth, <hi>Tom,</hi> is this, <hi>Bad Tobacco destroyed, stamps a Value upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Good,</hi> which will for ever be depreciated by a Mixture.</p>

               <p>I grant it, Sir; but I fear we must wait some Time to see all this come to pass.</p>

               <p>A pretty Business indeed! Don't both of you boast that you know good Tobacco as well as they?

And then, the devious and designing Men would not have that Handle for Clamour and Noise, nor would it be so much in their Power to raise foolish Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries against the Law, because they see Tobacco burnt, that a right honest Man, tender of the Welfare of his Country, would not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to Sale.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>As I am inclined to think what your Worship has told us is the Truth, I must acknowledge the Imposition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Imposition with a Witness. But as I was saying, by Virtue of these Inspectors Notes, I dare to promise you Goods much cheaper than hitherto you have had them: So that by this Law, you'll not only get more Money for your Tobacco, but you'll pay less for your Goods.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Ah Master, that's rare News indeed: But how, Sir, how is that to be?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Every Man must say, that knows any thing of your way of Dealing in these Upper parts of the Country, nay, the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers will own it, that they were always obliged to be very sharp in the Sale of their Goods, on the Score of the Badness of the Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co they were generally paid in, and the Risque they run of being Losers by it at Home; and therefore they valued their Goods, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>per Cent.</hi> upon them, not from the prime Cost, but by the Quality of the Tobacco: Insomuch, that when you have had the Name of selling your Tobacco for 10, 12, 15 Shillings per Hundred, in Reality you had not above 4, 5, or 6 Shillings.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, marry have you: I have known in a scarce Year, one of these Gentlemen give 3l. 2s. 6d. per Hundred for Tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, in Goods, the first Cost of which Goods was not above 20<hi>s.</hi> if so much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>If so, we have paid through the Nose.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; but it was with Tobacco not fit to be put there.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>But Sir, the Season is far advanced, and I don't hear that any Price is set upon Inspected Tobacco, or, that many Goods are in the Stores.</p>

               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>The Ships are very late in this Year, they came out late; those that failed the first, have had long Passages; they are but just arrived, and few Goods are yet imported: But assure your selves, in a little Time the Face of Affairs will be much changed for the better.</p>

               <p>Rest satisfied: <hi>Rome</hi> was not built in a Day: Laws are never made to oppress People, but to relieve them: And this very Law against which there is so much Cavil, is calculated to redress all our Grievances in Trade. The Clamours that oppose it, only shew how corrupt Men are, nothing else.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed!—Well, but Master, woudn't a Stint do all these fine Things as well; and then, mayhaps, the Country would be easy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>A Stint, Noodle! <hi>Tom.</hi> you are enough to provoke me: Are we not now under a Stint? And let me tell you, the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Stint that could be propos'd for us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>How's that, Sir! Clear that same Indulgence, if you please.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>It wants no Clearing, it speaks its self: But if I must tell you my Story over again, and beat into your Head by Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, you shall have it. You remember, before this Law, we were limited by an Act of Assembly to 6000 Plants per Taxable, and some were for reducing us lower, to a less Number; but did that, or will such a Method, remedy the Mischiefs the Country lay under?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>I can't say it did.</p>

               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Say it did! No, it would not do: And therefore I tell you again, we must mend our Staple, as well as lesson the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. But answer me faithfully, Did you make more Tobacco un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Stint, than what, by this Law, in a favourable Year, you may get pass'd by the Inspectors? If you did, then this Law les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the Quantity, and mends the Quality: If you did not, you have no Reason to complain.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>I can't say any thing to it one Way nor t'other; but by your Leave, Sir, under the Stint Law, I could sell all that I made, and that I can't do now: There's the Grievance.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>For my Part, I must think, if any Law may be called grievous, 'tis that which cuts us short in the Management of our own Land.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, but Sir, where's the Difference between cutting a Man short in his Labour, and in the Fruit of his Labour; these Laws considered together, the Stint appears the more favourable of the Two, for by That I reap some Advantage from all my Labour.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>If you were the only Person concerned in making of Tobacco, and carried on the whole Trade by your self, it would then be cruel, not to say unjust, to restrain you either Way; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the Consequence of your Management would advantage no other Man, neither would it injure any other; but when the Public is taken into the Account, 'tis quite another Argument; and as the whole Country is engaged in the same Trade, every Man in the Country will be more or less affected by the Contrivances of unfair Dealers. This was the Reason why the Assembly, the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of our Trade and Property, entred into these Measures, to prevent, if possible, in this general Commerce, all Fraud and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, by making every Man honest.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>This is what our Assembly meant, it is Sir? In troth, I think they're honest Gentlemen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>But let me answer the Bounce you made of Advantage from all your Labour, by which, you declare the Stint the more favourable Law: Don't you know, that the Reward of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour depends upon the Profit you make at the Winding up of the Bottom? For Instance, suppose now you had 100 Bushels of Wheat
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039991_0013_10158867C1CCF7D0"/>
in the Ear, in several Stacks in your Yard, which you might sell for 2 Shillings the Bushel; and that by the Accident of Fire, half of it was destroyed. Now, only suppose the like Misfortune had befallen every Man in the Country, and that the Price of Wheat by this Casualty advanced, as no Doubt it would, and you could sell the remaining 50 Bushels at 4 Shillings; what's become of the Produce of all your Labour, as you term it? Have you any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on the Account of Interest to bewail Burning?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>No, I think not.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>The Case is the same in Tobacco, with this Difference, Tobacco is made better by Part of it (the Trash) being destroied; and for that one Reason, will fetch a better Price: So that, to the extraordinary Labour you are at, in making more Tobacco than you are allow'd to sell, be pleased to place the Advantage you will reap by mending the Quality; and rest assured you'll be well paid for your Pains.</p>
               <p>What, perhaps you are resolved not to be convinced.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Will.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, we are not obstinate; but you must needs think, we have been strangely prepossest. For, notwithstanding 'tis so very plain, to shew you the Roguery of some that shall be nameless, 'twas confidently buzzed about, as if, by this Law, the Rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ruin the Poor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>None but the worst of Villains could suggest such a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: No such Thing, upon my Honour: Consider the Persons concerned in making this Law; Are they not all of them Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Probity and great Integrity? And have they not, by this very Act of theirs, sufficiently testified their Regard for the Public, and their tender Concern for the poor Planters?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Well, for my Part, I am resolved never to quarrel for the future with what I don't understand: And whenever they din any idle Reports against Laws in my Ears, that are beyond my Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if your Worship will give me Leave, I'll wait on your Worship with them.</p>

               <p>Nay, it may be, this is a Rout about Nothing too: But the Thing <hi>Will.</hi> means, is the Charge the Country is put to on those Two Accounts, the Houses, and Officers Salaries.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>The Country put to! Why the Whole is defray'd out of the Money paid by the Shippers, for Passing their Tobacco.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>But we poor Men don't ship any Tobacco.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Then you are not concerned in it one Way nor t'other; it rests upon the Merchants. But, if Charges and Expences are drawn in to make the Cry the louder, let what follows make a thankful Impression upon your Minds, to the Assembly; who, by this Law, have released us from the Tax we paid, under the Stint-Law, to Tellers, for Counting our Plants; from the One Shilling per Hogshead we paid to Rolling-houses; and from the Expence of Receivers.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>These Things were nothing to us.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>If you did not pay them, they did who purchased your Tobacco; and if they are relieved from these Charges, and are to be paid by the Captains of the Ships, 4<hi>s.</hi> per Hogshead, for the Trouble and Expence of Shipping their Tobacco themselves, can't they for this Reason afford to give you the better Price?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Cry-mercy: But, Sir, the Shipping of the Tobbacco occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions great Murmurings; they say the Country is not able to do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>Willing Minds would go a great Way towards it: In the Lower Parts of the Country, where the Rivers are broad, and the Navigation difficult, they may not be able; but towards the Heads of the Rivers it might be done: But this Complaint is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for, if the Publick are not in a Condition to comply with That Clause of the Law, they may depend upon Relief, when the Assembly meet; who, without any Question, will make such Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039991_0015_1015886BC482DC88"/>
and Amendments, as they find, in the Execution of it, are wanting, to make all Parties concerned in it, easy. And we shall deserve to be branded for the maddest People on the Face of the whole Earth, not to acquiesce; but by malicious and ignorant ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Judgments, endeavour to defeat such good Purposes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tom.</speaker>
               <p>Why one is, That tho' they are at no Charge for Rolling-Houses, they say they are strangely hamper'd, having no Place to lay the Goods in, they import: Indeed this is no Concern of ours who buy our Goods in the Country. Then they cry, that many of them had Wharfs and Landing Places, which are become useless.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice.</speaker>
               <p>As to convenient Places for lodging their Goods, Are not the former Storehouses still in Being, where they may put their Goods? No Man that imports Goods, is destitute of Friends that live on the River, where so many Wharfs and Landing Places, you say, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come useless, but he may have the Benefit of the most commodious in Situation near his Dwelling, to lodge his Goods, since the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Ships are so obliging to put them or. Shore where-ever they are desired. As to their Uselesness on other Accounts, 'tis of no Weight; if it doth deprive some People of any Profit they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to them, 'tis a private Stake, and must be given up to the Good of the Publick. This is all you have to say. I presume?</p>

               <p>But then, they may be more nice in Transfer-Tobacco, on Account of the Penalty, if, upon a second View, 'tis not found good; and most of That belongs to poor Planters.</p>

               <p>The Inspectors are bound by Oath, to take Care of the Goodness of the Crop-Tobacco, as well as the Transfer; and, I don't question, they perform their Duty in both: But the Cause why the Transfer-Tobacco is more found Fault with, is, Many more are concerned in That than the Other; and, as 'tis generally carried to the Warehouse in Parcels, People think it hard to see so much of each Parcel rejected, as is often done, and as this Year it deserves: But, at the same Time, they should consider, that the Crop-Tobacco undergoes as strict an Examination, and has as much in Proportion, condemned to the Fire. The Truth is, The great Noise that's made, about the Strictness used in Transfer-Tobacco, proceeds from a malicious Insinuation, as if the Inspectors only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded their own Interest, lest the Transfer-Tobacco should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and turned upon their Hands by the Publick Creditors, if found faulty; but I can see no manner of Reason to apprehend any ill Consequence to any Planter, from this Observation.</p>

               <p>If we are under no Hardship from hence, I must say, No Man living, and dealing in Tobacco, has any Fault to find with this Law.</p>

               <p>Well, let me end with you: And, if under this Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, we send Home more good Tobacco than can be consumed, fear not, my Lads, with this Method we may expect a Stint; there is no other Way to recover our Trade, which, This Year, had it not been for This Law, would have demolish'd us all. God be with you. Farewel.</p>
