            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>2 COR. III. 17.</bibl>
               <q>—WHERE the Spirit of the LORD is, there is LIBERTY.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE glorious character, and the righteous, wiſe and good adminiſtration of the Deity, lay the foundation of piety in all its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. From the conſideration hereof internal worſhip as well as public and ſocial, reſult: The latter, as well as the former, is a rational act of homage paid to him who rules in the kingdoms of men, and conducts the grand as well as minute affairs of the univerſe: it is alſo a proper and natural expreſſion of our belief of his ſuperintendency and government of all things: a firm and practical belief of which fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truth of religion hath a tendency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the whole moral conduct. The practice
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009017_0005_10306B75013AFCB8"/>
therefore of aſſembling in the houſe of God upon this day, as it is coeval with our civil eſtabliſhment, is laudable, rational and juſt; and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an act of homage paid by the whole community to him who is the head of the ſocial ſyſtem, the beſtower of every bleſſing, and the ſupreme guardian of all our rights.</p>
            <p>VARIOUS are the ſubjects relative to this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which are truly intereſting. But as we are juſt arrived at that happy period, in which by the ſmiles of heaven on our juſt arms, we have obtained the entire conqueſt of Canada; whereby we hope in God we are delivered from the tyranny and miſery which threatned us, "and the future ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our liberties civil and religious put into our hands:"—As it is alſo the happy day in which we are called to improve ſome of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant privileges and liberties we enjoy by his grant, who delivered us from arbitrary power both in church and ſtate; I could think of no ſubject which more juſtly claims our attention than that which our text without any forced conſtruction will ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>BUT without any farther introduction, after humbly imploring the ſpirit of Chriſt which is a ſpirit of liberty—and aſking the candor and patience of all preſent, I ſhall proceed to the conſideration of my ſubject:—My concern ſhall be to ſpeak with that freedom which the ſpirit of the divine Redeemer
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009017_0006_10306B780BEE9890"/>
inſpires, and at the ſame time with that reverence and decency which is due to ſo reſpectable an auditory.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT ſpending time to review the whole paſſage of ſcripture to which our text hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, I ſhall conſider the words as a general truth, laid down upon a particular occaſion; and ſimilar in their intention to thoſe of our Lord,<note n="*" place="bottom">John VIII. 34, 36.</note> "Ye ſhall know the truth and the truth ſhall make you free".—And again "If the Son of GOD make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed." Whether the apoſtle here intends a liberty from that darkneſs which tyrannized over the underſtanding of the Jews, or the liberty of the children of GOD in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, I ſhall not pretend abſolutely to determine: but ſay, that liberty in every reſpect ſtands in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with the Spirit of Chriſt. The goſpel is ſtiled "a law of liberty."—Being conformed to this, and animated and influenced by the ſpirit of its divine author, we ſhall be free from the ſervitude of Satan the grand tyrant, and the ſlavery of ſin, which is the worſt of ſervitude, and from whence reſult all the tyrannies, diſorders and confuſions that have been in the world.</p>
            <p>As civil government, which was inſtituted for the preſervation of civil liberty, effects in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect degree ſome of thoſe deſigns in GOD's righteous adminiſtration, which he is carrying on in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009017_0007_10306B79CA50F5F0"/>
the world by his word and ſpirit; and as liberty in a political ſenſe is mentioned by a ſacred writer as one of the privileges of chriſtians, as well as other men;<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. II. 16.</note> and as chriſtians are commanded <q>to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free</q>—what I propoſe from theſe words of the apoſtle, is
<list>
                  <item>I. To ſhew, That liberty both civil and religious is the ſpirit and genius of the ſacred writings.</item>
                  <item>II. THAT the ſpirit of Chriſt prevailing in the hearts, and influencing the lives of mankind, is the greateſt ſecurity of liberty in both theſe reſpects.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>NEITHER the time nor my ſtrength will admit any thing more than a curſory and imperfect conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of theſe two particulars. But before I proceed to prove the truth of theſe obſervations, it is neceſſary to premiſe a few things relative to the nature of civil and religious liberty.</p>
            <p>I WOULD premiſe in general, that to ſtate the nature of each, and exactly limit their bounds—to ſay in all reſpects what prerogative and powers the ſovereign ſhall be veſted with, excepting this in general, a power to do every thing which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the preſervation and happineſs of the ſtate:—to determine alſo what are the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009017_0008_10306B7E71BE8AF8"/>
of the ſubject, and to fix the meaſures of his ſubmiſſion—I ſay, the determining theſe points with preciſion, would be attempting what would be beyond my line, and would require more time than the limits of a diſcourſe upon this occaſion would allow.—Therefore I ſhall give you the definition of civil liberty from an approved writer,—<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> AMAQUI.</note> 
               <q>that it is natural liberty it ſelf, diveſted of that part which conſtitutes the independence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals by the authority it confers on ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, attended with a right of inſiſting on his making a good uſe of his authority, and with a moral ſecurity this right will have it's effect.</q> As civil liberty is founded in civil government, a well conſtituted ſtate requires that the magiſtrate be ſecure of the allegiance of the ſubject, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the protection of the magiſtrate: and civil liberty is in the greateſt perfection, and thoſe are the freeſt governments, where, on the one hand, the ſovereign is ſecured from tyranny and an abuſe of power, and the people from anarchy, confuſion and diſobedience. And though in ſuch a ſtate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty is in many reſpects given up, yet if civil liberty, the liberty of civil ſociety is ſecured, conſidering the ſtate of the world, it is vaſtly to be preferred:—For hereby each one becomes ſecured of the protection and united force and counſel of the whole ſtate, whereby life, property and every thing elſe that is valuable, is almoſt infinitely better ſecured, than in a ſtate of natural liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:009017_0009_10306B802802CC40"/>
I WOULD further premiſe, as civil authority extends to the good of the community in all reſpects, it muſt extend to religion; piety and vertue being connected with the good of civil ſocieties as well as individuals: we may add, how far ſoever civil authority may think it requiſite to interpoſe in affairs of religion, as the right of private judgment is unalienable—and ſince it is eſſential to true religion that we act from conſcience and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that what we profeſs and practiſe is agreable to the divine will—religious liberty ever ſuppoſes, and it is requiſite to its being that the conſcience be leſt free, and that none pretend to aſſume an empire over it. Religious liberty ſuppoſes that there be not only free inquiry, but equal freedom of profeſſion and action, when thereby no diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance is given to others. Indeed ſhould any under pretence of conſcience, act in direct violation of the laws of GOD, to the injury of the peace of civil or religious ſocieties, they ought to be reſtrained.—For there is no liberty but what ſuppoſes our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon GOD, and our obligations to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with his will. And under the pretence of liberty to act as we liſt, or to diſregard the dictates of reaſon or the will of GOD, however made known, or any authority he has conſtituted, is libertiniſm and licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>ONCE more, it may be premiſed, that altho' chriſtianity was properly eſtabliſhed by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his ſon Chriſt Jeſus—it being that kingdom
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009017_0010_10306B822620D570"/>
which the prophet Daniel foretold, "the GOD of heaven ſhould ſet up, and ſhall never be deſtroyed, but ſhall ſtand forever;<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dan. ii. 44.</note>—And although this kingdom was founded when the power of the civil magiſtrate was armed for it's deſtruction:—yet ſhould the civil authority think it neceſſary, as they have in almoſt all chriſtian countries, to eſtabliſh any particular form of chriſtianity, let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that all ſuch eſtabliſhments are evidently human; and unleſs there be a general toleration, are inconſiſtent with religious liberty. It is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble declaration of a writer of the firſt claſs,<note n="†" place="bottom">Bp. BUTLER's Serm. on 1 Tim. II. 1, 2.</note> that <q>a religious eſtabliſhment, without a toleration of ſuch as think they cannot in conſcience conform to it, is it ſelf a general tyranny, becauſe it claims abſolute authority over conſcience; and would ſoon beget particular kinds of tyranny of the worſt ſort, tyranny over the mind, and various ſuperſtitions, after the way ſhould be paved for them, as it ſoon muſt by ignorance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE things being premiſed, I ſhall proceed to the proof of the firſt obſervation I mentioned, viz. that liberty, both civil and religious, is the ſpirit and genius of the ſacred writings.</p>
            <p>THE great deſign of infinite wiſdom in the various revelations there have been made in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009017_0011_10306B85126FC5B8"/>
different ages of the world, has been to promote the cauſe of liberty in the nobleſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſenſe. As accompliſhing the amazing plan of the redemption of a fallen world by the Son of God, and recovering us from the penal effects of ſin, which were a moſt terrible bondage and miſery; as this is the general intention of revelation, liberty, without any impropriety, may be ſaid to be the general intention of revelation. And altho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing infinitely greater and more valuable than what relates to this world is deſigned; yet we ſhall find that he who accompliſhes various important ends at the ſame time by the ſame means, conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man's happineſs in this as well as the future ſtate.</p>
            <p>LIBERTY being the foundation of almoſt every temporal bleſſing, and alſo thoſe which are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting being in a near connexion with it, upon an examination of the ſacred writings, we ſhall find through the whole, a particular regard to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable favour. Were we to trace the whole book of God, as every part was wrote by the ſame unerring ſpirit of truth, we ſhall find nothing that tends to countenance anarchy, or ſupport tyranny either civil or religious; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a ſpirit of liberty breathing thro' the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009017_0012_10306B88C29F8628"/>
So large a field opens when we take a view of the ſacred books, that I muſt confine my ſelf to a very few paſſages.</p>
            <p>To begin with the writings of Moſes, there we ſhall find that in the execution of the grand plan before-mentioned, heaven appears in a moſt ſignal manner to reſcue a particular people from a ſtate of the moſt miſerable tyranny and ſervitude. The whole hiſtory of that important event, the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Iſrael from their Egyptian bondage, ſhews in the ſtrongeſt manner, God's tender compaſſion for the rights of his people, and that he will ſooner or later appear to take vengeance on the tyrants and cruel oppreſſors of mankind. The nobleſt eloquence, inſpired by the warmeſt ſpirit of liberty, could not uſe ſtronger expreſſions than are found in the ſacred writers when they touch upon this ſubject. The infinite Being is thus repreſented as ſpeaking upon this occaſion,<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. III. 7, 8. Acts VII. 24.</note> 
               <q>I have ſeen, I have ſeen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt: I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them</q>. And he, who never manifeſted his power in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner but for purpoſes becoming the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the deity, by a ſeries of moſt amazing miracles, ſet his people free. And as the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people, and taking vengeance on his
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009017_0013_10306B8B733684F8"/>
enemies ſtood in connexion, which has been the general courſe of the divine adminiſtration:—by the amazing deſtruction of the latter, the divine power was made known in ſuch a ſtriking manner, as that hereby the remoteſt nations and diſtant ages were taught God's righteous abhorrence of ſuch oppreſſive meaſures, as Pharoah and his court impiouſly and cruelly purſued.—God who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played his power in ſo remarkable a manner to vindicate the rights of his people, appears by the ſacred writings to have the greateſt regard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per government and order. This people were not delivered from the tyranny of Egypt to be given up to a ſtate of anarchy or their own law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs luſts, nor to be delivered over into the hands of tyrants of their own nation; but to be formed into a kingdom under the government of the Lord Jehovah.—He, whoſe right to dominion is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible, and whoſe qualifications for government are unrivalled, condeſcended to become in a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and peculiar ſenſe their king. Their ſtate is therefore called, in ſcripture language, the kingdom of Jehovah: and the LORD is ſaid to be "their lawgiver, their king and judge": and he ſtiles them "my people" and "my nation":—and their government is commonly called a Theocracy. Not that we are to conſider this as barely a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical conſtitution. The firſt and grand deſign of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009017_0014_10306B8E2A713C00"/>
infinite wiſdom was, to ſecure that people in their allegiance to him as the moral governor of the world, and to redeem them from idolatry and wickedneſs—or, as the ſcripture expreſſes it, to be "a kingdom of prieſts and a holy nation". But not only the recovery of that people to the practice of true religion, the moſt effectual ſecurity of all government, were in view, in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of heaven towards them, but their happineſs in every reſpect. Therefore he who had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his favor to them, regarded with peculiar kindneſs their civil or political ſtate.</p>
            <p>THE time will not allow a particular examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the civil government of the Hebrews; therefore I ſhall only ſay in general, ſo far as the plan of this government was of divine original, we ſhall not only find the higheſt marks of politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal wiſdom, but that it was a polity which with the utmoſt propriety might be termed a free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and was intended in the beſt manner to ſecure the liberties, happineſs, peace and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of that people; had they adhered to this excellent conſtitution, it would have ſecured them from all tyranny, oppreſſion and anarchy, and from foreign invaders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009017_0015_10306B902F99B310"/>
THE right of legiſlation, the firſt branch of ſovereignty, was in the Lord Jehovah himſelf, All their laws as well civil as religious were from him—"whatever he commanded, that they were to obſerve and do, and not to add thereto or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh from it<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. XII. 32.</note>." And as good laws are one of the greateſt ſecurities of the civil liberties of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we ſhall find ſuch enacted by the Lord Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, relative to their conſtitution and form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the private adminiſtration of juſtice, as would in the moſt effectual manner have preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the peace and happineſs of the community, and the liberty and property of each individual.</p>
            <p>Again, THO' he who has an abſolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derived right to ſovereignty, and to whom all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings owe ſubjection, was at the head of this ſyſtem;—yet this government, like all other free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was founded on compact. The whole congregation of Iſrael, as a political body, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Lord Jehovah to be their king, took an oath of allegiance to him, and he receives them for a people to himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut.

Their ſupreme magiſtrate under the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009017_0016_10306B93D4B55888"/>
Lord Jehovah muſt be conſidered as his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy or deputy—and Moſes who was the firſt in this office was commiſſioned immediately from God. Joſhua who ſucceeded him was alſo pointed out by the oracle; yet his authority was recognized by the people<note n="‖" place="bottom">Joſh. 1. 16, 17, 18.</note>. Theſe judges or leaders in the jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh polity were poſſeſſed in a limited ſenſe of regal power—though let it be obſerved, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a king afterwards was a deviation from their original conſtitution. But whatever was the authority of their ſupreme magiſtrate, he could aſſume no arbitrary power; and by this conſtitution there was the greateſt ſecurity that the power would be improved for the end for which it was given. The law was to be his rule in all things—the oracle was alſo to be conſulted in the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs. There was alſo a national ſenate formed out of the princes of the tribes and heads of families<note n="†" place="bottom">Joſh, XXIII. 1, 2.</note> as his privy council, which was to be conſulted; and the whole congregation of Iſrael were by the conſtitution one branch of government, and were inveſted with as many rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges perhaps, as any of the moſt antient and freeſt governments.</p>
            <p>FREEDOM and property ſtand in connexion; property ever carrying power and authority—the grant of the land of Canaan, from the great
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009017_0017_10306B9680C192B0"/>
and univerſal Proprietor, being made to the whole nation of the Jews; each tribe (except that of Levi) having an equal part, and each Iſraelite a certain proportion—a proportion ſufficient with frugality and induſtry to maintain them in plenty—and as theſe lands were to deſcend to their poſterity, and were alienable but for a limited time; a proper and natural foundation was hereby laid, for keeping up the ballance of power among the ſeveral tribes, the ſecurity of the liberties of the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the rights of each individual. In arbritary governments there is no ſecurity of property, if there are freeholders; but the Iſraelites, holding their lands of Jehovah their King, and no ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate magiſtrate however great, having power to invade the property of the meaneſt of his ſubjects; the law alſo prohibiting the loan of money upon intereſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">The peculiar plan of the Hebrew polity ſheweth the reaſon of the law prohibiting uſury, and the loan of money upon intereſt not being forbid to ſtrangers, proves that law not to have been of a moral nature.</note> prevented any from ingroſſing large quantities of land; hereby all were ſecured from a ſtate of ſervitude. The ſpirit of freedom which appears in all the Hebrew conſtitution, is likewiſe peculiarly manifeſted in the proviſion it made for the preſervation of the liberties of the loweſt and pooreſt among them. Providence having endued perſons with different capacities and abilities, and giving different ſucceſs, even to the endeavors of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009017_0018_10306B992A992AA8"/>
honeſt induſtry, all will never enjoy the ſame degree of freedom. But this conſtitution made proviſion for the relief of the natural incapacities of perſons, and the ill ſucceſs that might attend their endeavors. The poor were not only to be relieved by charity, but no Iſraelite was to be ſold as a bond-man, or made a ſlave<note n="*" place="bottom">Lev. 25. 42.</note>:—every ſeventh year debtors were to be liberated<note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. 15. 1, 4.</note>—and every, fiftieth year there was to be a general releaſe of ſervants; and a reverſion of houſes and lands to ſuch original proprietors, or the heirs of ſuch, as through neceſſitous circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had been obliged to part with them<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lev. 25. 40.</note>. The year of jubilee, or proclamation of liberty among the Jews, being a grand periodical feſtival, and uſhered in with ſuch ſolemn joy and pomp, was as well calculated to inſpire the whole nation with a love of liberty, as the <hi>Olympick</hi> feſtival games were to inſpire the Greeks with the love of glory.</p>
            <p>MANY other things might be obſerved relative to the civil polity of the Jews, pointing out its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and ſhewing the admirable proviſion there was thereby made for the ſecurity of civil liberty, viz. the qualifications and characters preſcribed for their magiſtrates—the obligations all in power were under ſtrictly to conform to law, in the execution

of their office<note n="§" place="bottom">JEHOVAH their ſupreme ruler enjoined that their kings when they ſet upon the throne of his kingdom ſhould write a copy of the law, &amp;c. as in Deut. 17. 18.—And that there ſhould be officers and judges in their gates through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their tribes.—The God of Iſrael alſo ſaid, he that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God—he muſt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor honour the perſon of the mighty, but in righteouſneſs judge his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

            <p>FURTHERMORE, We find in proportion as the ſpirit of their religion influenced thoſe who were conſtituted guardians of their civil liberties, and the people in general, they enjoyed the happy effects of this bleſſing. Moſes, Joſhua, Samuel and others, who were ſupreme rulers in the Jewiſh ſtate, and perſons of the firſt rank for piety and virtue, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the moſt tender regard for the rights of that people; as appears not only from the writings of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009017_0021_10306BA19B6532E8"/>
Moſes, but the other ſacred hiſtorians who ſucceeded him.—Inſtead of improving their power to enſlave them, they did every thing that the wiſeſt and beſt of men could do to preſerve them from vaſſalage, and perpetuate their liberties.—Joſhua, as well as Moſes, was eminent for his fidelity in his high office; and left the appointment of a ſucceſſor to the divine determination, and the diſcretion of the people; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them doing any thing to entail the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it to their poſterity, or aggrandize their families. And Samuel appears worthy of perpetual renown, not only for his great integrity, in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice as chief magiſtrate in Iſrael; but his truly patriot zeal for their ſacred conſtitution, and the liberties of the people. How ſolemnly doth he proteſt againſt a change of government, when the people impiouſly and fooliſhly propoſed it to him? and how fully doth he repreſent the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and miſery that would attend them in a ſtate of monarchy, and having a king like the neighbouring nations?<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. 8th chap.</note>

            <p>WERE we to proceed to a farther examination of the ſacred hiſtory, after the ſettlement of the Hebrew nation, in the land of Canaan, either before or after their change of government, we ſhould find many things which point out in the cleareſt light the many and great advantages of civil liberty:—As we ſhould ſee the many and fatal effects of a deviation
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009017_0022_10306BA4539DD9C0"/>
from their original, ſacred conſtitution; how it at times involved them in a ſtate of great confuſion, diſorder and miſery—how it prevented their full and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyment of the good land God had promiſed to them—how it cauſed them to become an eaſy prey to almoſt every invader—how it expoſed to civil diſſentions, and all the evils that ariſe from a ſtate of anarchy, as well as the tyranny of arbitrary power.</p>
            <p>WERE we alſo to trace the writings of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, we ſhould find them animated with a noble ſpirit of liberty: Inſpired by the ſpirit of truth, they characterize perſecuting, oppreſſive and tyrannical powers in a manner that proves they are deteſtable as well to God as man. Pharaoh king of Egypt is, by the prophet Ezekiel, ſtiled the great Dragon;<note n="†" place="bottom">Ezek. 29. 3.</note> a name often given in ſcripture to cruel tyrants, as they reſemble the old ſerpent the firſt deceiver, the grand adverſary and deſtroyer of mankind.

And the manner in which the prophets predict the fate, and future circumſtances of theſe arbitrary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, plainly ſhews, how diſpleaſing their tyrannies
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009017_0023_10306BA6584A98F0"/>
and oppreſſions were to the univerſal ſovereign, <q>who executeth righteouſneſs and judgment for all that are oppreſſed.</q> But, beſides theſe four grand monarchies, all of which were oppreſſive to God's people, others of the like character are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to the righteous vengeance of heaven: And the prophets repeatedly aſſure us from the mouth of HIM who declareth the <q>end from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done,</q>

The legiſlative authority, as has been before ſaid, was ſolely in him; and no power was given to any human authority in this reſpect. Even Moſes, in every thing relative to the ritual of their worſhip, was to conform to the pattern ſhewn him in the mount. And by that conſtitution there was no power, either eccleſiaſtical or civil, given to men, inconſiſtent with the ſacred rites of conſcience, and the exerciſe of private judgment. Nay, ſo far was it from this, that we find it refer'd to the impartial judgment of that people to chooſe whom they would ſerve, the gods of the heathen or the Lord Jehovah<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſhua 24. 15.</note>; and in conſequence hereof the people of Iſrael ſolemnly declare, "All the Words which the Lord hath ſaid, we will do"<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 21.</note>. And altho' that diſpenſation was far leſs liberal, than the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and the numerous rites and ceremonies enjoin'd by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is not poſſible that we ſhort-ſighted mortals ſhould fully underſtand all the deſigns of infinite wiſdom; and we may juſtly ſuppoſe, there were many reaſons for
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009017_0029_10306BB716F0E108"/>
the inſtitution of the hebrew ritual unknown to us; but as that nation was to be kept a ſeparate people, and to be retain'd in their allegiance to the true God, many of their rites and ceremonies might be neceſſary, to anſwer theſe ends; and to prevent their falling in with the idolatrous practices of the neighbouring nations, to which they were ſo greatly prone.—But if, the eccleſiaſtical polity, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtitutions of the Jews, are compar'd with that of all other nations, none will be found equally free.—The monſtrous power even in things ſacred, claimed by the civil magiſtrate and the prieſthood at that day; and the various ſuperſtitions and vices eſtabliſhed by authority, under the ſevereſt penalties, was a ſtate of bondage almoſt infinitely more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and intolerable, than that of the Jews.—The ſervices which the Iſraelites were commanded to perform to the true God, and the ſubjection they were under to any power, either civil or eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, was the perfection of liberty, compar'd with the ſtate of the whole heathen world at that time.—For while the Jews were favour'd with a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of divine original, which tho' intermixed with a variety of poſitive Inſtitutions, yet requir'd every thing that was of a moral nature; the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had religious rites and ceremonies eſtabliſh'd by human authority, many of which were greatly impure, barbarous, and immoral; and ignorance, ſuperſtition, idolatry and wickedneſs tyrannized over thoſe nations.</p>

BUT to proceed to a brief examination of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the new teſtament; there we find the ſame ſpirit of liberty breathing through the whole, and there we ſee an accompliſhment of the prophecies reſpecting the redemption of mankind. "Out of Zion is come a deliverer, to proclaim liberty to the captive, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound." We do not find, indeed, that tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prince and mighty conqueror which the carnal Jews expected, to free them from the Roman yoke, and to exalt them to univerſal dominion; but one who came to procure benefits infinitely greater and more valuable to mankind.</p>
            <p>OUR Lord when he firſt entered upon his public miniſtry declared, he came not to deſtroy the law and the prophets: But as his kingdom was not of this world he intermedled not with civil affairs, but left the Jewiſh polity as he found it. The ſame may be ſaid of all the other kingdoms of the earth: ſcarcely any thing is recorded by the ſacred writers as ſaid by him relative to civil government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting this; "Render to Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's, and to God the things that are God's;" in which he not only diſcovered the moſt conſummate prudence and integrity in avoiding the ſnare laid for him, but has given a direction which if attended to, will be the beſt ſecurity of liberty both civil and ſacred. For if rulers as well as people conform to this precept, neither the prince will aſſume any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009017_0031_10306BBC85CD0BE0"/>
prerogative, or abuſe his power; nor will the ſubject refuſe that allegiance which is due to the prince, but perform the duties which they reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owe to each other; both keeping in mind the ſuperior obligations they are under to the univerſal ſovereign.</p>
            <p>THERE are but few paſſages in the writings of the apoſtles relative to this ſubject. Religion and civil government being things entirely diſtinct in their nature, however they may coincide in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in their deſign, the apoſtles ſay but little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the civil rights of mankind—intimating that chriſtianity makes no alteration in this reſpect—and that chriſtians are under the ſame obligations, to the duties that reſult from civil relations, with other men.</p>
            <p>THE moſt remarkable paſſage upon this ſubject is the beginning of the 13th chapter of the epiſtle to the Romans:—a paſſage of Scripture which has been moſt horridly perverted by the flatterers of tyrants, to eſtabliſh a doctrine contrary to reaſon, to the dictates of nature, and the general intention of revelation. And the exorbitant power they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is hereby given to the civil magiſtrates—the unlimited and unreſiſting ſubmiſſion and paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience required of the ſubject, is directly ſubverſive of civil liberty. But after all that the ſupporters of tyranny have been able to ſay, it is too evident to need any laboured proof, that St. Paul in this paſſage
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009017_0032_10306BBF313F5C60"/>
in ſuch a manner points out the origin and lays the foundation of civil government—ſo particularly limits and defines the nature and ends of political power—and, from its being exerciſed to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and end, deduces the obligations of obedience: And the Duties of the magiſtrate, as well as the correſpondent duties of the ſubject are ſo connected, and the latter ſo plainly intimated to reſult from the due performance of the former, that it was ſcarcely poſſible more ſhould be ſaid, in ſo ſhort a compaſs in favor of civil liberty.—The true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples upon which it is founded, and upon which it will ever ſubſiſt and flouriſh, are here briefly laid down, as might be ſhewn at large, would the time allow<note n="*" place="bottom">THE author thought it needleſs more particularly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this paſſage of ſcripture, as it has been ſo fully vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many able writers, from the unjuſt interpretations of the friends of ſlavery and the abettors of tyranny, either civil or eccleſiaſtical; and as it is ſo apparent to every unprejudiced reader, that this general precept, of ſubmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion to the civil magiſtrate, is to be taken with thoſe limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and exceptions, which other general precepts and prohibitions in the ſacred oracles are—yea, that as the power of the civil magiſtrate is limited, in all reaſon muſt the obedience of the ſubject.—But to imagine the apoſtle is ſpeaking of the then form of government in the Roman empire—and of Nero the then reigning Emperor, who was not only a cruel perſecutor of Chriſtians, but one <q>whom the Senate had condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:009017_0033_10306BC2D876B5E8"/>
THERE is a paſſage in the writings of St. Peter ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in ſome reſpects to this of St. Paul: the former as well as the latter is recommending the great duty of ſubjection to the civil magiſtrate, (1 Ep. 2d Chap. 13.—) That which St. Paul calls the ordinance of God, St. Peter ſtiles the ordinance of man: As all civil governments, the Jewiſh excepted, are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conſtitutions; that is, their form whatever it be, is the inſtitution and contrivance of men; but it is the will of God, plainly made known by the make of man, and his circumſtances in the world, as well as by revelation, there ſhould be civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the nature and end of political autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the deſign and buſineſs of the magiſtrate's office, are by both theſe apoſtles ſaid to be the ſame—or the great end of government, and the buſineſs of the magiſtrate's office is, "the puniſhment of evil-doers, and the praiſe and protection of them that do well." When civil power is thus employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009017_0034_10306BC5CF087320"/>
it is neceſſary, as we would act up to our ſacred engagements as chriſtians, and preſerve the dignity of that honorable character, as well as our civil rights, that we ſubmit to it. The apoſtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins a caution and direction, a regard to which, will be of great uſe to ſecure the bleſſings of the goſpel, and the advantages of civil ſociety, viz. Altho' chriſtians are "free, they are not to uſe their liberty for a cloak of maliciouſneſs," or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; but ever act "as the ſervants of God."—Chriſtian liberty, inſtead of deſtroying our obligations to God, or any authority he has inſtituted, rather increaſeth it; and is never to be made uſe of, for a pretence for rebellion, or ſedition, or to palliate any other wicked arts, whereby civil government may be diſturbed.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER elſe is recorded in the new teſtament, to have been ſaid by our Lord or his Apoſtles rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to civil government, either the exerciſe of it, or ſubmiſſion to it, is friendly to civil liberty. Altho' they teach chriſtians to conſider themſelves as not of this world, but as ſubjects of the heavenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet they preſcribe to them a temper and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, which will make them uſeful in the world, and good magiſtrates or good ſubjects of any earthly kingdom.</p>
            <p>As the conduct of our Lord and his Apoſtles was agreeable to their doctrine and teaching, their
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009017_0035_10306BC7DB599258"/>
behavior was ſuch as becomes the friends of liberty. The Son of God was a pattern of the moſt dutiful ſubmiſſion to all lawful authority: And tho' meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhone in his character with the greateſt luſtre, he ſpeaks with ſome ſeverity of that ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WERE we to trace the conduct of the apoſtles, we ſhould find it becoming the dignity of their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inſtructive to the lovers of liberty. Never in any inſtance could they be juſtly accuſed of flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering tyrants, or ſtirring up ſedition and rebellion. And while they diſcovered a proper ſubmiſſion to thoſe in authority, at the ſame time we find them upon ſuitable occaſions, claiming their rights and privileges as men and chriſtians. This was the principle they ever acted upon, "that God was to be obeyed rather than man."

WHEN we read the acts of the apoſtles we not only find a ſpirit of liberty animating their conduct, and their example inſtructive to us as chriſtians and ſubjects of a free ſtate; but from their hiſtory the magiſtrate may learn many uſeful leſſons: To omit others that might be mentioned—The conduct of that wiſe and good magiſtrate Gallio, teacheth them not to interfere in matters that fall not within their cognizance ("queſtions of words and names") or in religious diſputes where civil rights are not affected. And from the behavior of Felix towards Paul, they learn how dangerous it is to be influenced by an undue regard either to riches, power or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity; what temptations they are to act contrary to equity, and the dictates of conſcience. An imitation of the former<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>GALLIO is mentioned with great reſpect by his brother the famous Seneca; and ancient writers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> give him the character of a wiſe and equitable magiſtrate: And it is the opinion of moderns, "that he judged well of the rights of civil government and of the power of his office, and diſcountenanced civil puniſhments on religious accounts." And "that he had more honor and generoſity than to make Paul anſwer under the notion of a criminal, when by the Roman law the matter did not come within his cognizance, and there was nothing criminal in the charge."—DR. Dodderidge obſerves, That the prudence and moderation, of Gallio is truly amiable. That wiſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well knew the extent of his office, as a magiſtrate, and was aware that it gave him no title, no pretence to dictate in matters of conſcience, or to reſtrain men's reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious liberties, ſo long as they abſtained from injuſtice or miſchievous licentiouſneſs, by which the public peace might be diſturbed, and the rights of ſociety invaded.

UPON a view of the prophetic writings of the apoſtles we find the ſame ſpirit of liberty breathing in them, as in the predictions of the former prophets—St. Paul's portrait of the man of ſin—the hateful features with which he delineates him—the ſpirit of domination he would diſcover, and tyranny he would exerciſe—the wicked and deluſive arts he would make uſe of to acquire and ſupport his unjuſt claims—the apoſtle's ſtiling him "the wicked one," and "ſon of perdition"—and aſſuring us, he is doomed by the righteous vengeance of God to deſtruction, proves that ſuch a character, let it be found where it will, and however it may pretend to a divine right to ſuch a plenitude of power, is really in its nature directly oppoſite to the ſpirit and genius of chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:—which is further proved by the apoſtle's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, that no ſuch perſon or power ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the chriſtian church till there was a great
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009017_0039_10306BD2A0BAA980"/>
apoſtacy from its primitive purity—and that the perſons who ſhould ſubmit to this wicked tyranny, were ſuch as are "given up to ſtrong deluſions," and "have pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs."</p>
            <p>IN the apocalypſe of St. John we have a variety of ſtriking emblems, or hioroglyphic repreſentations of thoſe oppreſſive and perſecuting powers that were to ariſe to the diſturbance of the church in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ages. But tho' there are many expreſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that ſuch tyrannical powers ſhould ariſe and continue a long time—that they ſhould "blaſpheme God," and "make war with the ſaints, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them," and "that none ſhould be permitted to buy or ſell, ſave he that had the mark, or the name of the beaſt;" yet for the ſupport of God's people under all, they are aſſured that when the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, in ſuffering ſuch wickedneſs to prevail, the reign of the grand tyrant, and of all the enemies and perſecutors of God's people ſhall have an end: And that all the oppoſers of religion and liberty ſhall finally meet with a puniſhment, great in its extent, and laſting in its duration, adequate to the enormity of their crimes. And the ſongs of triumph and victory with which the moſt benevolent beings are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented celebrating the happineſs of thoſe, who adhere with fidelity to their duty, notwithſtanding the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and oppoſition they had to encounter; the hymns of praiſe, alſo, that are given to God for
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009017_0040_10306BD45B2B75A8"/>
executing judgment upon theſe cruel tyrants and oppreſſors, prove that the cauſe of liberty is the cauſe of God.</p>
            <p>BEFORE this head is diſmiſſed, it may be proper to add a few words, more fully to ſhew that religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty is the ſpirit and genius of the new-teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is ſo apparent to every one who has read thoſe writings with any attention, that it ſeems little leſs than an affront offered to the underſtanding to undertake a formal proof of this point.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH in the new-teſtament an entire aſſent and abſolute ſubmiſſion is required to be paid to what God has revealed as his will; (a belief and practice of which is true liberty) yet we find no authority given to men to employ force or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in things ſolely religious; no authority over conſcience:—yea, no power to men to make laws for the ſubjects of Chriſt's kingdom,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>ALTHO' chriſtians as members of civil ſociety, owe the ſame ſubjection to the civil magiſtrate with other men; yet as chriſtians they are ſubjects of Chriſt their only King. "Every ſociety is ſubject only to its own legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which holds equally in reſpect to religious as civil ſocieties." And when it was before ſaid, the civil ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates power extended to religion, it was intended only as it ſtood in connexion with the civil intereſts of the community.</p>
                  <p>IT may be added, As the civil magiſtrate is to protect all in their juſt rights; and as many invaluable privileges are granted by the goſpel charter to the church of Chriſt, as a religious ſociety—And as theſe rights are no ways inconſiſtent with the civil rights of the reſt of mankind; the church in general, and each member of it, have the ſame claim to protection, and the unmoleſted enjoyment of all their privileges, that any other ſociety or individual have in the enjoyment of their natural or civil rights.</p>
                  <p>AND it is humbly queried, whether if the civil magiſtrate was to grant this protection and defence to chriſtians, and chriſtian ſocieties, he would not more effectually anſwer the character of <hi>a nurſing father to the church,</hi> and be leſs likely to invade the prerogative of the ſupreme head of the church, than by decreeing articles of faith and modes of worſhip?</p>

               </q> And the government which belongs to the chriſtian church, is only that authority which is given by the word of God.</p>

            <p>WE find alſo our Lord and his apoſtles in the courſe of their miniſtry, referring religion to the free enquiry and impartial judgment of their hearers: If there was not evidence for what they taught, they gave liberty to reject it; but if truth, it was not to be diſregarded under the ſevereſt penalties,

not of a civil kind, but the anger of God, and the effects thereof in the future world. And although Chriſt forewarns his diſciples to expect perſecution, yet there are the fulleſt intimations that every ſpecies and degrees of it are directly oppoſite to the ſpirit of his religion. When his diſciples, and as we may juſtly ſuppoſe, from an affectionate regard for their maſter, and a zeal for true religion, deſired he would command fire from heaven, for the deſtruction of the Samaritans<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 9. 35.</note>; Chriſt rebuked them, telling them, they knew not what manner of ſpirit they were of.—And with what indignation and ſeverity doth St. Paul reflect upon himſelf for perſecuting the diſciples of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>IN a word, Chriſt's yoke is eaſy, and his burden light: He aboliſhed the ceremonial law:—He has alſo granted by his goſpel invaluable privileges and liberties to his church and people. His apoſtles alſo, when a ſpirit of bigotry and domination early appeared in the chriſtian church, diſcovered a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard to the liberties of chriſtians. And an adherence to thoſe grand apoſtolic canons, "to ſtand faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt has made us free,"—and "let every man be fully perſuaded in his own mind;" will ever ſecure us from ſpiritual tyranny; and moſt effectually advance the peace of Chriſt's church, and the intereſt of true religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:009017_0044_10306BE0839EF8B0"/>
BUT it is more than time to proceed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the SECOND general head; which was to ſhew, That the ſpirit of Chriſt prevailing in the hearts and influencing the lives of mankind, is the beſt ſecurity of liberty, both civil and religious. Or, in other words, A conformity to the amiable and divine character of Jeſus Chriſt, or his holy religion having its due effect on our hearts, influencing our tempers, and directing our whole conduct, will lead to a behaviour, which will moſt effectually ſecure theſe invaluable bleſſings.</p>
            <p>As it is not ſufficient to entitle us to the glorious bleſſings of Chriſt's heavenly kingdom, that we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his religion, or pay a regard to his poſitive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirements; but our hearts and lives muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into a correſpondence to the holy example which he exhibited; for we are expreſsly aſſured "If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is none of his;" and that "it is not every one that ſaith unto Chriſt, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven:" So neither will our bearing the ſacred name and title of chriſtians, if we are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin, be any ſecurity of thoſe beſt of temporal bleſſings, which any earthly kingdom can enjoy.</p>
            <p>BUT where there is the ſpirit of Chriſt, and that glorious liberty which reſults therefrom, there is a conformity to Him, effected by the agency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his ſpirit, and by beholding his ſpotleſs
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:009017_0045_10306BE425CE7398"/>
and perfect character, as it is reflected from the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of his goſpel, transforming us into his likeneſs. This the apoſtle plainly intimates in the verſe following our text: His words are, <q>But we all, with open face, beholding<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>[BEHOLDING—the glory of the Lord.] <q>Here is one of the moſt beautiful contraſts that can be imagined. Moſes ſaw the Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </p>
                     <p>Dr. DODDRIDGE in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> as in a glaſs, the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image, from glory to glory, even as by the ſpirit of the Lord.</q> Now where there is this divine effect produced by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and his goſpel, the vail of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being removed, and the tyranny of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions occaſioned by ſin, being deſtroyed; and having "the ſame mind which was in Chriſt Jeſus," we ſhall be led to ſuch a conduct as will effectually maintain our independence, and ſecure our liberty and happineſs.</p>
            <p>BUT as the ſpirit of Chriſt implies a conformity to him, it may not be improper to give you a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of ſome parts of his character: Then little
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009017_0046_10306BE6D8F97E60"/>
need be ſaid to prove, that our being transformed into his likeneſs, will lead to a behavior moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the advancement and ſecurity of civil and religious liberty.</p>
            <p>EVERY divine and ſocial virtue ſhone with the greateſt luſtre in his character. The moſt exalted piety influencing his whole conduct, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fidelity he diſcharged all the duties of his high office as mediator: He has this character given him by the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews, that "he was faithful to him who had appointed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. 3. 2.</note>"<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It might largely be ſhewn, were it neceſſary, that Chriſt anſwered this character in all reſpects. But I go on to ſay, that a conformity to this example in civil rulers, whether ſupreme or ſubordinate, will lead them in every office they ſuſtain, to act in a regard to his will and authority who is the ſupreme governor of all; and to whom all are accountable. As the Son of God is repreſented in the ſacred oracles, ſaying to his heavenly Father, upon his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his entrance into this world, "Lo, I come to do thy will, O God;" the like temper prevailing in the ſovereign, and in all inferior officers, will lead them in the firſt place to make enquiry, what are the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ies of their ſtation, and what muſt be done to diſcharge them with fidelity. They will then ſee that the more elevated their ſtation, the greater the importance of acting up to the deſign and dignity
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009017_0047_10306BE8EF4E7D28"/>
of it; and the more fatal and extenſive the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a neglect. Which conſiderations will lead them with the greateſt care to learn, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to diſcharge, the duties of every truſt. And if all in office, in any ſtate, from the higheſt to the loweſt, exhibit this fidelity, and are juſt, ruling in the fear of God, none of the rights of mankind will be invaded; but power and authority will be improved for the honor of the ſupreme ruler, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſecurity of all. Then, neither a love of power or intereſt, pleaſure or eaſe, private animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or friendſhips, will tempt them from their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, or lead them to an omiſſion of the duties of their office.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER ſhining part of our Lord's character was, the moſt noble and extenſive benevolence. The whole plan of our redemption, and the part which the Son of God performed in the execution of it, diſcover unparrallelled goodneſs, grace and compaſſion. Not only the moſt ſelf-denying and diſintereſted benevolence, productive of the moſt ſubſtantial bleſſings to mankind, appears in the character of our divine Redeemer; but he ever ſhewed a peculiar regard to the intereſt of his own nation: His perſonal miniſtry was confined chiefly to the Jews. How unweariedly did he exert himſelf in their ſervice? How pathetically did he lament the calamities he foreſaw coming upon them? So that we may juſtly ſay, that PATRIOTISM, as well
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009017_0048_10306BEBA11F89B8"/>
as more extenſive benevolence is recommended by his example. And if we are taught of God to love one another, taught by the example and ſpirit of Chriſt, there will not only be a love to the whole human ſpecies, as children of the ſame parent with ourſelves, and to all who are diſciples of the ſame maſter; but from ſocial connections and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and one common intereſt, there will be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar regard to the intereſt of our country,—or <q>a fixed diſpoſition of mind to promote the ſafety, reputation and welfare of the community in which we are born, and the conſtitution under which we are protected.</q>—And while a love to our country is accompanied with a more extenſive bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, it will lead to a conduct productive of the independence and welfare of the community and each individual, as well as prevent an invaſion of the rights of others. Then, inſtead of ſeeking every one his own, as is too commonly the caſe, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good will be our main purſuit.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, The ſpirit of Chriſt and his holy religion is a ſpirit of union and peace. Our Lord is ſtiled the prince of peace; and he came not only preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, but his whole behaviour wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> expreſſive of that bleſſing: And the ſtrongeſt expreſſions are uſed in the goſpel to repreſent his union with his diſciples, and their near and intimate union one with another. Now this ſpirit being found in all,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009017_0049_10306BEF56055828"/>
will not only prevent thoſe factions and diviſions, which are the bane of every ſociety, and which have often deſtroyed the liberties of a free people, but will beget harmony of councils, and joint endeavours for the public tranquility.</p>
            <p>OTHER virtues might be mentioned which ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the character of the Son of God, and which are found in thoſe who are poſſeſſed of his ſpirit.—As the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oſt artleſs ſimplicity and ſincerity: guile was not found in his mouth. To which was added, dignity of deſign, and greatneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of intention: His whole deſign was the moſt exalted that the heart of man can conceive; and not only executed with an heroic fortitude and conſtancy, amidſt oppoſition and difficulties; but carried on with the greateſt ſincerity and openneſs. A conformity to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the univerſal prevalence of this ſpirit in a community muſt advance its glory, promote its happineſs, and ſecure its liberties; as it will inſpire thoſe entruſted with the public intereſt with the moſt noble deſigns and generous intentions; and lead them to proſecute them, if called to it, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of eaſe, intereſt and life; and as it will prevent thoſe political and factious views, cloaked with falſe pretences to patriotiſm, which lead to a conduct ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of the liberties of a people.</p>
            <p>IF theſe principles inſpired all, and theſe virtues of the chriſtian life, and others which might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009017_0050_10306BF208911998"/>
were practiced by all, ſuch a ſtate, whatever was its form of government, muſt be free. Even in abſolute monarchies, if the ſovereign is influenced by the ſpirit of Chriſt and his religion, without any checks to his power, or fundamental laws or compact to regulate his conduct, he will make the ſupreme law of all governments <hi>the ſafety and happineſs of the people,</hi> and not arbitrary will, his rule. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in mixed governments, however the ſovereignty may be ſhared, theſe principles will lead all in their reſpective ſtations and ſpheres to ſeek the public welfare. Then thoſe who have the power of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will enact ſuch laws, and ſuch only, as are agreeable to the laws of the ſupreme Ruler, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and exigencies of the people, and their ſafety and happineſs. Thoſe alſo in executive power will act in conformity to law: And the ſalutary effects of government being experienced by all, authority will be revered, and from principle and conſcience ſubmitted to. Indeed, the univerſal prevalency and influence of the ſpirit of Chriſt and his religion will in a great meaſure render human laws needleſs—all being a law to themſelves, and from principle and conſcience acting in conformity to the laws of their great Lord and maſter.—How happy muſt ſuch a ſtate be! To what grandeur will it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced! And how ſecure will be its liberties!</p>
            <p>THE virtue and happineſs of that people would anſwer thoſe ſtrong and beautiful deſcriptions we
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009017_0051_10306BF3E95F4F00"/>
have in the prophetic writings, reſpecting the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious times, which are in ſome future period to take place under the reign of the Meſſiah: When the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the kingdom of Chriſt.—A belief of the accompliſhment of which predictions may comfort and ſupport the mind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gloomy proſpect which the greateſt part of this world now affords, oppreſſed with tyranny, and over-run with wickedneſs. Thoſe times when <q>all officers ſhall be peace and exactors righteouſneſs. Violence ſhall no more be heard in the land, nor waſting or deſtruction:—The people ſhall be all righteous, and inherit the land forever:—The voice of weeping ſhall no more be heard, nor the voice of crying:—They ſhall build houſes, and inhabit them; and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them:—They ſhall not labour in vain, and bring forth for trouble</q> (as thoſe do now who are groaning under tyranny;) <q>and there ſhall be nothing to hurt or deſtroy in all God's holy mountain.</q>—After which nothing can be added deſcriptive of the liberty and happineſs of ſuch a people.</p>
            <p>MANY uſeful reflections might be deduced from this ſubject, but my diſcourſe has already been protracted to ſuch a length, that I may only hint at a few.</p>
            <p>FIRST, THE ſpirit and genius of the ſacred oracles may be conſidered as a preſumptive argument in
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009017_0052_10306BF7B1BC19F8"/>
favour of their truth and divine original. Not only the external evidence, but the internal marks and characters of a revelation are to be taken into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.—The repreſentation now made of the nature and deſign of the ſcriptures, ſhew them not to be unworthy of God, or unſuitable to the ſtate and circumſtances of man. Had theſe writings been dictated by impoſture or enthuſiaſm, ſo great and good a deſign could not have been expected.</p>
            <p>WE may alſo infer, That thoſe who plead for the divine right of abſolute monarchy, or of it's indefeaſible lineal ſucceſſion, and abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to arbitrary will and lawleſs ſway—or who would deſtroy all order and government, and ſubject mankind to the confuſions and miſeries of anarchy, muſt have ſome other ſupport for their reſpective ſchemes than the word of God.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, It may be inferred from this diſcourſe, that the ſpirit of Domination, that has appeared in the chriſtian church, and the perſecutions and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, with which it has been accompanied and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, are truly antichriſtian.</p>
            <p>THIS ſubject likewiſe teaches us, as we value our liberties, either civil or ſacred, to prize the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to ſeek and cultivate the ſpirit of it's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine author. Not only thoſe ſtates that were once moſt famed for liberty, as Greece and Rome, ſunk into ſlavery when they loſt their virtue; but when
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:009017_0053_10306BFA5EA9A7B8"/>
the kingdom of God was taken from the Jews, they were given up to the oppreſſions of the moſt cruel tyranny—This alſo is in general the ſtate of thoſe places who were once bleſſed with the goſpel, but have now loſt it.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt proceed to a more particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of my ſubject—And beg leave upon this occaſion, in the firſt place to addreſs my ſelf to THE GUARDIANS OF OUR CIVIL LIBERTIES; under which denomination, I comprehend all our honoured Rulers and political Fathers, poſſeſſed either of legiſlative or executive power.—</p>
            <p>MY honored Fathers will permit me, with all due reſpect, to remind them of the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt committed to them by God and Man.</p>
            <p>ALL power is originally from God, and civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment his inſtitution, and is deſigned to effect ſome of the great deſigns of his moral adminiſtration, and to advance the happineſs of his creatures. Civil power ought therefore ever to be employed agreable to the nature and will of the ſupreme Sovereign and Guardian of all our rights.</p>
            <p>BUT tho' civil power is the ordinance of heaven, yet is it to be conſidered as granted alſo by the people—and granted for very important ends: the natural independence they give up, and liberty they part with, is for the ſecurity of civil liberty. And
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009017_0054_10306BFD0F4CCF20"/>
civil ſociety is a moſt ſalutary inſtitution—a ſtate far beſt adapted to the happineſs of man, according to the preſent conſtitution of things. Unnumber'd are the bleſſings that reſult from this ſtate, when civil authority is improved for the purpoſes for which it is granted. Then each individual enjoys all thoſe rights which are the gift of the univerſal Parent; having alſo the protection of government, and the ſecurity of laws; from whence reſult too many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be now enumerated. But the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Bleſſings mainly depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe veſted with civil power. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a moſt important truſt that ſuch perſons have committed to them: and upon a faithful diſcharge of it, the happineſs of the whole civil ſociety mainly, under God, depends. You do well therefore, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to conſider the happineſs of this people, not only in the preſent time but in future genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (for few acts of government are limited in their operations to the preſent time) committed to your care. Viewing things in this light, the duties of your reſpective ſtations are important, and your obligat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>BUT the following things, which you will ſuffer me to remind you of, give an additional ſtrength
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:009017_0055_10306BFFC76324D0"/>
to your obligations, to act well your reſpective parts, to ſecure to us our liberties, and advance our welfare.</p>
            <p>WE have long had the happineſs of enjoying a moſt excellent conſtitution of government: A go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in which the prerogative of the ſovereign and the priviledges of the people are ſo tempered, that they mutually ſupport one another—"A conſtitution formed on common reaſon, common conſent, and common good: A conſtitution of free and equal laws, ſecured againſt arbitrary will, and popular licence, by an admirable temperament of the governing powers, controling and controled by one another". The Engliſh conſtitution is not only the pride of Britons, but the envy of its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.—We have alſo thro' the goodneſs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, been favoured with Princes, eſpecially ſince the acceſſion of thoſe of the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nover,</hi> that have been Guardians of our rights, and Fathers of the people.—Indeed a renowned Prince of the houſe of <hi>Orange</hi> is not to be forgotten, but ever to be remembered with gratitude, as our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer from tyranny.</p>
            <p>BUT the goodneſs of that God, by whom kings reign, is not to be paſſed by unnoticed, in having given us ſo excellent a Monarch, as his late illuſtrious Majeſty—His goodneſs alſo in continuing him ſo long, and in making him ſo great a Bleſſing to his
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009017_0056_10306C018361DC28"/>
wide extended dominion—A monarch who reigned in the hearts of his numerous ſubjects:—A monarch who had repeatedly this honorable teſtimony from the repreſentative body of the nation, that he never, in one inſtance, during the courſe of his long reign, violated the conſtitution, "but that under his royal protection we had lived in an uninterrupted and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure enjoyment of our religion, laws and liberties:"—A monarch whoſe ſhining virtues in private life, and whoſe public character, and many illuſtrious deeds, will cauſe him ever to be numbered with the beſt of kings, that have ſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'d the Britiſh Scepter, and to be remembered, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eſteem and gratitude: And whoſe paternal care of all his ſubjects, even thoſe that were moſt diſtant from the throne, and his attention to what was the common cauſe and the intereſt of the whole, manifeſted in his wiſe meaſures and vigorous endeavours to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his rights, ſo unjuſtly invaded here in America, and to defend and preſerve the Britiſh colonies, will render the name of GEORGE the SECOND ever ſacred and dear to us.</p>
            <p>AND altho' a ſucceſſion of ſuch Princes, ſeems a bleſſing almoſt too great to be expected, yet that God "who removeth Kings and ſetteth up Kings", has favored us with one to ſucceed him, formed by his gentle conducting hand, and by the force of his attractive example, to the ſame happy temper.—A Prince poſſeſſed of ſuch amiable virtues and excellent accompliſhments, as give ground to
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009017_0057_10306C052B0EE360"/>
expect the continuance and advancement of all thoſe bleſſings we enjoyed under the reign of his royal grand-father.—A Prince not only born and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in England, but who glories in the name of BRITON—A Prince who has moſt graciouſly aſſured us, that it is his firm and invariable reſolution to adhere to, and ſtrengthen our excellent conſtitution, to maintain the Toleration inviolable, and protect his faithful ſubjects in the greateſt of human bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, the ſecure enjoyment of their civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Rights.</p>
            <p>I may add, To what height is the glory of the Britiſh Nation, at this time advanced! How are the hearts of all united in loyalty and affection to a ſovereign, who eſteems the happineſs of his ſubjects the firmeſt ſtability of his Throne! How great and almoſt unparalled are the ſucceſſes of our fleets and armies; and in all parts of the globe! What happy conſequences have reſulted from the auſpicious conduct of a truly patriot miniſter; and from the fidelity, wiſdom, and intrepidity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the moſt generous humanity, of others employed in public ſervices! By this happy coincidence of affairs, the reputation, grandeur and proſperity of the nation was never carried to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pitch than at this Day.</p>
            <p>BUT to bring our views near home, in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;—We are bleſſed with a conſtitution formed
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:009017_0058_10306C07DBB47BC8"/>
upon the model of the Britiſh Government:—A conſtitution, which if kept inviolate, will ſecure to us the bleſſings of civil ſociety, and the advantages of religious liberty. <q>Under the protection of a royal charter, many valuable privileges and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are veſted in the body of the people, their properties ſecured, and all the liberties of natural ſubjects born in the realm of England, granted and affirmed to them.—And their religious privileges have ever been moſt dear to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS alſo to be remembered, that to enjoy the bleſſings of chriſtian liberty, our pious anceſtors left their pleaſant native country, and came into an inhoſpital wilderneſs: oppreſſed with eccleſiaſtical tyranny, they ſought a retreat in the wilds of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica—and thro' unnumbered difficulties, heaven conducting, protecting and proſpering them, they at length obtained an Aſylum here.</p>
            <p>PLACED as we have been near a rival, perfidious power, with numerous ſavages at it's command, we have ſtruggled with many difficulties, ever ſince our firſt ſettlement, to the laſt year, to maintain our independence and ſecure our rights; and have now ſeen, through the tender mercy of our God, a moſt happy reſult of this long conteſt—the ſchemes of our enemies being defeated, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:009017_0059_10306C09AAAD3778"/>
blaſted, and we delivered from the calamities that attended, and the ſtill greater miſeries, that threatned us.—Heaven has ſhewn a moſt tender regard for our welfare—Heaven has been kind to us beyond our deſerts—and beſtowed its bleſſing with a moſt liberal hand.</p>
            <p>BUT the ſecurity, the continuance, the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe bleſſings, and tranſmitting their ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effects to poſterity, may greatly depend, my honored fathers, upon your wiſe and good conduct.</p>
            <p>THE connection between religion and liberty is apparent, I truſt, from what we have heard at this time. Religion being the only ſolid baſis of this ineſtimable bleſſing, your firſt regard is due thereto. Religion, indeed, is the firſt and principal concern of every man, as the favor of his maker, and his happineſs in time and through eternity depend upon it. No other principle will ſo effectually ſecure the rectitude of your conduct, and lead you with equal uniformity and ardor to ſeek the welfare of this people. Influenced by the ſpirit of our holy religion, we may expect from a regard to the authority of God, fidelity in the offices you ſuſtain. Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, which includes patriotiſm, being alſo a diſtinguiſhing branch of the religion of Chriſt, as this prevails in you, we may expect all thoſe happy conſequences, that reſult from a patriot ſpirit, and patriot meaſures.</p>

POSSESSED of the ſpirit of Chriſt, from a regard to the honor of God, a ſincere deſire to comply with his will, and a tender concern for the happineſs of this people, you will be led ſeriouſly to conſider, what is more eſpecially your duty at this time; and what the preſent conjuncture of affairs demands. The diſpenſations of providence in particular in the ſignal ſucceſſes granted to our arms here in America, call for our attention and religious improvement. It is not for me to ſay, what may be your duty, in all reſpects, in conſequence of theſe remarkable events. Should our valuable acquiſitions for the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a part of the Britiſh dominions (which God almighty grant!) new ſcenes of duty, as well as happineſs may open.</p>
            <p>BUT as Peace, the great object of our purſuit, is not yet obtained, ſuffer me to enquire, whether it is not incumbent upon us at this time, fully to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the reaſonable demands of his Majeſty, to provide for the ſecurity of thoſe conqueſts already made, and for the farther proſecution of the war with vigor? As we hereby ſhall teſtify our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for what hath been already done for us, our loyalty to our new ſovereign, and recommend our ſelves to his royal favor, and poſſibly further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the humbling our enemies, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing peace upon terms of glory and advantage, as well as manifeſt our deep ſenſe of the importance of theſe conqueſts being annexed to the Britiſh crown.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:009017_0061_10306C1056234068"/>
From theſe conſiderations, altho' our burdens are great, ſhould we not be excited once more to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert our ſelves with the utmoſt vigor and chearfulneſs in the important cauſe, upon which the intereſt of the whole Britiſh dominions, and our future ſecurity and tranquility ſo greatly depend?</p>
            <p>To return, As no natural or civil advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges will ſecure the happineſs of a people without religion and public virtue, the connexion between vice and ſlavery being as natural and unavoidable to a community, as to an individual; as he that committeth ſin, is a ſervant of ſin, ſo the general prevalence of vice in a ſtate will bring on ſlavery: therefore as you would ſecure our freedom, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your regard is due to the moral and religious ſtate of this people.</p>
            <p>THRO' the pious care and wiſe conduct of the adminiſtration in times paſt, good proviſion has been made by the legiſlature, to keep up the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the goſpel, and to bring men to the practice of it's precepts. We have alſo many good laws for the promoting of piety and virtue, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of vice and immorality: But it deſerves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether a more vigorous execution of theſe laws is not neceſſary. It is weakening the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of government and laws, to have any enacted and not put in execution. Among other things that are recorded to the honor of one of the beſt of

            <p>PERMIT me to enquire, as an Oath is ſuch a ſolemn act of religion, and one of the great ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of government; as our lives, property and liberty often depend upon it; whether ſomething further may not be requiſite to render that ſacred obligation more to be depended on, and to bring all to pay the greateſt reverence to that moſt ſolemn tye?<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following queries may not be unworthy notice,—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether Oaths ſhould be required where there are great temptations to perjury, unleſs in caſes of extreme neceſſity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether the form of words ought not to be the moſt ſolemn and ſtriking that can be invented?</p>

                  <p>AN approved writer upon Ethicks has this obſervation,—<q>Where perjuries grow frequent in any ſtate, the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates or legiſlators are generally chargeable with much of the guilt. If they frequently exact oaths without neceſſity; or where oaths give no ſecurity in the point in view; or if oaths are required where there are great temptations to perjury, with hopes of impunity from men.—They alſo do bad ſervice to religion, who don't appoint an awful ſolemn form of words, fit to ſtrike the minds of men with reverence in ſuch an action.</q>—</p>

AGAIN, As fathers of the people, whoſe duty it is to attend to the intereſt of the whole family; the children and youth demand your attention: a due regard is therefore to be paid to their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, early to form their minds to knowledge, piety, virtue, induſtry, and a love of liberty.—May not ſome farther proviſion be made, more effectually to promote theſe ends?<note n="‖" place="bottom">ALL wiſe ſtates have thought the good education of children and youth, to be connected with the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare—and it has ever been conſidered as one of the duties of civil magiſtrates to make ſuitable proviſion for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming uſeful members of ſociety.—And altho' we have a law which impowers the Select-men, &amp;c. to take effectual care—that the children and youth (particularly of the poor) do not live idly, &amp;c.—and altho' we have a law obliging towns of fifty families to have a ſchool-maſter, to teach reading and writing, and towns of one hundred families a grammar-ſchool.—Query, Might the firſt of theſe laws be made more extenſive, or be better executed?—And, ſecondly, Is there not the ſame reaſon the other ſhould be extended to pariſhes: And is it not equally neceſſary in many caſes to anſwer the ſalutary intentions of that law?</note>

ONE thing more permit me to hint at.—Our ſituation and circumſtances demand a particular at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our huſbandry and trade,<note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <p>THAT our lands in general might be better cultivated—and that we might do more towards raiſing the proviſions we conſume in this Province, all will allow. To effect theſe ends there are things pointed out worthy the public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in a Pamphlet lately reprinted, intituled, <q>Eſſays upon Field-Huſbandry in NEW-ENGLAND. By JARED ELIOT.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT would be going out of my line, if not deemed arrogance, to pretend to point out methods for the regulation or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Trade:—Or, by what means our export might be brought to bear a greater proportion to our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: But the following Reflections upon Trade in Dr. NEWTON's diſſertations upon the prophecies concerning TYRE, may not be unacceptable, or without uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>TRADE is a fluctuating thing: it paſſed from Tyre to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, from Alexandria to Venice, from Venice to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twerp, from Antwerp to Amſterdam, and London; the Engliſh rivalling the Dutch, as the French are now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling both. All Nations almoſt are wiſely applying themſelves to trade; and it behoves thoſe who are in poſſeſſion of it, to take the greateſt care they do not loſe it. It is a plant of tender growth, and requires ſun and ſoil and fine ſeaſons to make it thrive and flouriſh. It will not grow like the palm tree, which with the more weight and preſſure riſes the more. Liberty is a friend to that, as that is to liberty. But nothing will ſupport it more than virtue, and what virtue teacheth, ſobriety, induſtry, frugality, modeſty, honeſty, punctuality, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, the love of our country, and the fear of God. The prophets will inform us how the Tyreans loſt it; and the like cauſes will always produce the like effects.</q> (Iſ. 23. 8, 9. Ezek. 27. 3, 4.)</p>

As one of our valuable charter-privileges is this afternoon to be exercis'd, as it's value greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it's being well improved, and as the liberty and independency of a mixed government, and the preſervation of the conſtitution, reſult from each Branch diſcharging the duties of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive departments with fidelity, the affairs of this day are truly intereſting.

The liberty now recommended, and which will lead to freedom of election, requires that you do what is moſt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, what you think is moſt agreeable to the divine will, what will be moſt conducive to the happineſs of your conſtituents, and moſt effectually ſecure the liberties of a free people:—Then, neither the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of cuſtom, the partialities of friendſhip, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate animoſities, or a regard to any particular faction will influence your choice; but you will act with that freedom, which becomes the Dignity of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable a Body.</p>

Theſe are the perſons that will have the votes of this day, if thoſe intruſted with the affairs of it, are influenced by the ſpirit of Chriſt, a ſpirit of freedom.</p>
            <p>UNDER the influence of this ſpirit, their future conduct, in all deliberations, through the approaching year, will be with that freedom and integrity, that unanimity and patriotiſm, which might be expected from the guardians of the liberties and legiſlators of a free ſtate.

            <p>OUR ſubject is inſtructive alſo to the miniſters of Chriſt.—It teacheth us, my reverend Fathers and Brethren, to ſeek and cultivate the ſpirit of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine maſter, whom it is our honor to ſerve, and that holy and excellent religion which it is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and happineſs to promote among mankind.

on the one hand, it will prevent our claiming any undue authority, or lording it over God's heritage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the other hand, it will prevent our calling any man maſter or father upon earth—or ſubmitting to any authority in things of religion, but the word of God. This ſpirit alſo will give us freedom of acceſs in our addreſſes to the throne of grace—and open the mouth with boldneſs in making known the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of the goſpel.—Then ſhall we by the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth commend ourſelves to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God.—This, as it will transform us into the likeneſs of Chriſt, will make our example as well as doctrine inſtructive; and give the moſt rational ground to expect our labours ſhall be crowned with ſucceſs: But if we ſhould fail of this, we obtain the acceptance of our Lord, and the reward, thro' grace, of faithful ſervants.</p>
            <p>LET me add one word to the whole body of this people. As a people we have ever been jealous of our liberties: While our ſubject teacheth us to prize them, it teacheth the moſt effectual way to ſecure them. It is not by clamors for liberty, or oppoſition to legal authority, that our invaluable privileges are to be ſecured; but by ſeeking and cultivating the ſpirit of Chriſt, his holy religion, and a ſacred regard to all its requirements, and wiſe inſtitutions.—This is the moſt certain way to ſecure to us our liberties, and to make us a free and happy people.—The excellent writer<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. BUTLER.</note> before referred to,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:009017_0069_10306C269FF98FE8"/>
juſtly obſerves,—<q>Oppoſition in a legal, regular way, to meaſures which a perſon thinks wrong, cannot but be allowed in a free government: But oppoſition from indirect motives, to meaſures which he ſees to be neceſſary, is it ſelf immoral: It keeps up the ſpirit of licentiouſneſs; is the greateſt reproach of liberty, and in many ways moſt dangerous to it, and has been the principal means of overturning free governments.</q>—Civil liberty, I have already obſerved, is founded on civil government:—Civil government ſuppoſes ſubordination, obedience to laws, and due ſubjection to thoſe in authority.—Titus was commanded in the diſcharge of his miniſterial office, to put the chriſtians in mind "to be ſubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magiſtrates": And St. Jude brands with infamy thoſe that "deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities."—It is our duty as friends to liberty, and as chriſtians, to "ſubmit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupreme, or unto Governors."</p>
            <p>I MAY add, The preſent adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſuch as to challenge our eſteem, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our reverence and ſubmiſſion; and under which we may account ourſelves happy.—If the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive chriſtians were to obey the heathen magiſtrates, that were in power; the Emperor as ſupreme, and Governors or proconſuls ſent by him; is it not then our duty to be loyal to the beſt of Kings, and to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009017_0070_10306C285A4D0C28"/>
our loyalty by paying all due honor and reſpect to his worthy Repreſentative? Having in the chief ſeat of government, a Gentleman<note n="*" place="bottom">His Excellency FRANCIS BERNARD, <abbr>Eſq;</abbr>
               </note> of approved worth—One who has adopted the maxims of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our late, as well as our preſent, illuſtrious Sovereign—One who has generouſly declared, that he will preſerve to us our general rights as Britiſh ſubjects, and our particular privileges granted us by royal charter—And that religion and morality ſhall be encouraged, and vice diſcountenanced under his adminiſtration: And as his Excellency has hitherto exhibited ſuch integrity of conduct, and zeal to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our welfare; it is to be hoped, that we in this province, ever diſtinguiſhed by our loyalty, ſhall by our dutiful and affectionate carriage to our Governor, make his adminiſtration eaſy to himſelf, as well as beneficial to the public.</p>
            <p>IN a word, Let us revere civil government as the ordinance of God, and be thankful for that which we enjoy, as it ſecures to us our Rights as men and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and under it live quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty—Let us fear God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the King; and render to all, that honor and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute which is due—Piety and loyalty ſtand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection; and loyalty or ſubmiſſion to lawful autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is equally neceſſary for the preſervation of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as oppoſition to corruption and reſiſtance of tyranny.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:009017_0071_10306C2B51E1CA10"/>
BUT, Whatever civil or religious liberties and privileges we may glory in, if we are the ſervants of ſin, we are in a ſtate of diſhonourable ſervitude, and cruel tyranny: but if the Son of God makes us free we ſhall be free indeed; and ſhall enjoy the glorious liberty of the children of God. This which may be called a moral liberty, which above all other is to be prized, is the glorious effect of the ſpirit of Chriſt and his goſpel. Then, the underſtanding is by the ſpirit of light and truth freed from darkneſs and error—or, as the apoſtle expreſſes it, that God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, ſhines into the heart, to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.—Then the will and affections are alſo freed from the dominion of ſin, and brought to a ſubjection to his will; a conformity to which is the perfection of liberty—This alſo will give a ſpirit of adoption, or the liberal diſpoſition of the children of God. And as Chriſt has aboliſhed death, and obtained eternal redemption for us, this will free the mind from the bondage which reſults from the fear of death, and finally give a victory over the grave, and compleat redemption—or a deliverance from all the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſequences of ſin, and the perfection of liberty and happineſs in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>IN fine, Let it be the great concern of us all to be made free from ſin, to become the ſervants of God, and to have our fruit unto holineſs, that ſo the end may be everlaſting life.</p>
