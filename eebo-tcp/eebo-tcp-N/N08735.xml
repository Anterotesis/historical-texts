            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Scheme of a Public Hoſpital for the Reception of the poor Sick of this Government and City, is a Subject, which for a long Time paſt, has employed the Attention of many charitable and benevolent Inhabitants; particularly of thoſe Gentlemen engaged in the practice of Phyſic, and Offices of Religion, whoſe Profeſſions afford them the moſt frequent Opportunities of knowing the great Neceſſity there is for ſuch an Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>In particular, a Plan has often been propoſed, and the moſt proper Method for putting it in Execution conſidered, by a Set of Medical Gentlemen, who have formed themſelves into a Society for promoting the Knowledge, and extending the Uſefulneſs of their Profeſſion: and it has been a Reſolution entered upon the Minutes of that Society, from its firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould Addreſs the Legiſlature upon that Subject, on the firſt favourable Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:011168_0006_0F857EEADA9D4350"/>
It likewiſe has repeatedly been mentioned by the different Profeſſors of Medicine, (particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Doctors Middleton, and Jones,) in their public Lectures, and earneſtly recommended to the Conſideration of the Inhabitants; the unhappy Diſputes however, in which we have lately been engaged with our Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, have hitherto rendered their Endeavours fruitleſs; but, they nevertheleſs (convinced of the great Neceſſity there was for ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the very great Advantages which all Orders of People muſt derive from it) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to perſiſt in their Endeavours, until ſome happy Occaſion ſhould offer of puſhing it with ſome Probability of Succeſs. Such an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion now preſents itſelf, and the Warmth and Zeal, which his Excellency the Governor, and moſt of his honorable Council, have expreſſed for it, and the Liberality, with which they have ſubſcribed towards it, induce them to think the preſent, the fitteſt Time, for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it, to the ſerious Conſideration of the Public.</p>

               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:011168_0007_0F857EEE99FF1EF0"/>
And as an Inſtitution of this Nature, muſt neceſſarily be calculated for the Benefit of the diſtreſſed of all Sects and Perſuaſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it is hoped, that the generous and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirited of every Denomination, will enter warmly into the Deſign, and promote it with that Zeal, which ſhould actuate the Breaſt of every Man, who thinks it his Duty to relieve the Neceſſities of his Fellow Creatures, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Happineſs of Society.</p>

                  <hi>There is nothing by which a Man approaches nearer to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Deity, than by reſtoring the Sick, to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Bleſſings of Health.</hi>

            <p>THAT this Country has, ever ſince its Diſcovery and Settlement, laboured under the greateſt Diſadvantages, from the imperfect Manner, in which Students have been inſtructed in the Principles of Medicine; and from the Conſequent prevailing Ignorance of but too many of its Profeſſors; is a Truth which cannot be conteſted; and of which many unhappy Families have ſeverely felt the fatal Effects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:011168_0009_0F857EEF89946098"/>
The preſent Occaſion therefore muſt give the moſt real Pleaſure to every conſiderate Man, or Lover of his Country; and ſurely there is no Friend of Learning, but muſt rejoice to ſee theſe Gentlemen, who have given the moſt public and ample Teſtimony of their Abilities, now ſoliciting the Honors of this Univerſity, in a Profeſſion hitherto (at leaſt in a regular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) uncultivated amongſt us.</p>
            <p>I am therefore particularly happy in having this Opportunity of congratulating every public ſpirited Friend and Patron of this College, and eſpecially thoſe of the medical Inſtitution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the preſent Inſtance of its Succeſs, which affords ſo pleaſing a Proſpect of its riſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and future Utility.</p>
            <p>But it is to you, Gentlemen, who are Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates for medical Degrees, that I mean in a more particular Manner to addreſs my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcourſe; receive then my Thanks for the Honors you have already reflected upon us, and as both for your Sakes and our own, I cannot but be anxious for your future Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011168_0010_0F857EF022BEB2F8"/>
let me once more, before we part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt your Attention for a few Moments, whilſt I endeavour to explain to you the weighty duties of your Profeſſion—A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, in the Practice of which, Integrity and Abilities, will place you among the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and Ignorance and Diſhoneſty, among the moſt pernicious Members of Society.</p>
            <p>And be not alarmed, if I ſet out with tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, that your Labours muſt have no End. No leſs than Life, and its greateſt Bleſſing Health, are to be the Objects of your At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and would you acquit yourſelves to your own Conſciences, you muſt ſpend <hi>your</hi> Days in aſſiduous Enquiries, after the Means of rendering thoſe of others long and happy.</p>
            <p>Do not therefore imagine, that from this Time your Studies are to ceaſe; ſo far from it, you are to be conſidered as but juſt entering upon them; and unleſs your whole Lives, are one continued Series of Application and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, you will fall ſhort of your Duty. For, if in the Eye of the Law, the Man who does not afford, to all immediately under his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011168_0011_0F857EF0DD6494F8"/>
Care and Protection, as far as in him lies, the neceſſary Means of preſerving Life, is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as acceſſary to Murder, how will that Phyſician excuſe himſelf to his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or what Palliation of his Guilt, will he plead at the awful Bar of eternal Juſtice, who inſtead of embracing and induſtriouſly cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting every Opportunity of Improvement, ſhall (conſcious of his own Inability) raſhly tamper with the Lives of his Fellow Creatures; and, at the riſk of their Safety, defraud them of their Property? Would not any one conſider the Lawyer an Impoſtor, not to uſe a harſher Phraſe, who, conſcious of his own Ignorance, ſhould give Advice, which might endanger the Eſtate of another? And is not the Phyſician who impoſes Ignorance upon me for Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and puts my Life to the hazard of an uncertain die; ſo much the greater Impoſtor, in as much as my Life, is of greater Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than my Eſtate. In a Profeſſion then, like that you have embraced, where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is of ſo great Importance as the Life of a Man; you are accountable even for the Errors of Ignorance, unleſs you have embraced every Opportunity of obtaining Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011168_0012_0F857EF1AF6EF990"/>
And to a Man, who has any Conſcience at all, it will be but a ſlight Alleviation of his Remorſe, to ſay, after ſome fatal Blunder, <hi>I knew no better!</hi> Unleſs he can likewiſe add, that it is to be attributed to the Frailty of his Nature, and not to the Negligence of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that he was not better informed. Nor will a weeping Parent receive much Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Reflection, that by the fatal Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of his Phyſician, and not by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy of the Diſeaſe, he has been robbed of the Staff and Support of his Life, the Joy and Comfort of his declining Age.</p>
            <p>Did I know a Wretch among the Practiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners of Medicine, whoſe inſenſible Soul nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feels for the Diſtreſſes he may Occaſion, nor partakes in the Joys he may give riſe to; I ſay, did I know a Man ſo void of every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of Tenderneſs, and Humanity; I would adviſe him, from Motives of Intereſt and Gain, to endeavour at the Attainment of Skill in his Profeſſion. But to you, Gentlemen, I will point out the Gratification inſeparable from the Acquiſition of Knowledge, that ever to be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011168_0013_0F857EF262AC30B0"/>
wiſhed for Praiſe, which falls from the Lips of the Wiſe and the Virtuous, the Applauſe of an approving Conſcience, and the unſpeakable Pleaſure of doing good, as the Reward of all your Toil, and as the ſtrongeſt Spur to your future Induſtry.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who have neither Emulation nor Honeſty, who neither have Abilities, nor will give themſelves the Trouble of acquiring them; I would recommend it to ſuch, ſeriouſly to conſider the Sixth Commandment,</p>
            <p>'THOU SHALT DO NO MURDER.'</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of your Studies, let ſuch Authors as have tranſmitted to us Obſervations founded upon Nature, claim your particular At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Of theſe, HIPPOCRATES ſhines the foremoſt; his unwearied Diligence in obſerving and collecting the Symptoms of Diſeaſes, his Fidelity and Accuracy in relating them, his happy Facility in diſcovering their Cauſes, his almoſt prophetic Knowledge of their Events, and his ſucceſsful Treatment of them, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſufficiently admired, and will hand down his Name, with Honor and Applauſe to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:011168_0014_0F857EF34DAEF1E8"/>
A few others among the Ancients, who have followed the Steps of Hippocrates, are well worth your Peruſal; but whilſt you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>their</hi> Merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not affect the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry of deſpiſing the Moderns; and carefully avoid that Rock, upon which moſt of the fond Admirers of Antiquity have ſplit, a blind and ſlaviſh Attachment to its Opinions; the Bar where Truth has been ſo often Shipwrecked, and which more than the want of Ingenuity or Capacity, ſtopped the Progreſs of Learning for above twelve hundred Years.</p>
            <p>Why ſhould we give more to thoſe Times, than they attributed to themſelves? Read the Writings of the wiſeſt among the Ancients, and they are filled with Modeſty and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, why then ſhould we aſcribe to them, Infallibility and Omniſcience? They doubted the Aſſertions, and controverted the Opinions of the Times which preceded them; why ſhould not we doubt and controvert theirs; and leave to Poſterity the Liberty of controverting ours? Let us then examine their Writings with Candour, but with Freedom, and embrace or

reject their Opinions; as they ſhall be found conſiſtent, or inconſiſtent with later Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>Without therefore depreciating the Merit of the Ancients, let us do Juſtice to their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and do not from an over Zeal for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſacrifice Sydenham and Boerhaave, to the Manes of Hippocrates and Galen.—I ſee no Reaſon why Time only ſhould leſſen our Abilities, and ſurely Experience muſt increaſe our Knowledge: and although I think ſome of the Ancients may be read with great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; yet it is the moſt celebrated Moderns (who with equal Abilities enjoy the additional Advantage of near 2000 Years of Experience) whom I would recommend to your moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive Peruſal; particularly thoſe great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Profeſſion, SYDENHAM, BOER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAAVE, HUXHAM, PRINGLE, and WHYTT; and ſome others of our lateſt Engliſh and Scotch Phyſicians, <hi>"Horum Scripta nocturna verſate manu, verſate diurna."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In your Intercourſe with your Fellow Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, let Integrity, Candour, and Delicacy
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011168_0016_0F857EF78088D358"/>
be your Guides. There is a particular Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Diſpoſition, which ſeems eſſential to delicate Honor, and which I believe is the beſt Counterpoiſe to Self-Intereſt. This I would by all Means adviſe you to cultivate, as you will meet with many Occaſions where it only can direct your Conduct.</p>
            <p>Never affect to deſpiſe a Man for the want of a regular Education, and treat even harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Ignorance, with Delicacy and Compaſſion, but when you meet with it joined with fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardineſs and Preſumption, you muſt give it no quarter.</p>
            <p>On no Pretence whatever, practice thoſe little Arts of Cunning and Diſſimulation, which to the Scandal of the Profeſſion, have been but too frequent amongſt us. Nor ever attempt to raiſe your Fame on the Ruins of another's Reputation; and remember that you ought not only to be cautious of your Words, a Shrug or a Whiſper, the ſtare of Surpriſe, or a piteous Exclamation of Sorrow, more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wound another's Reputation, and more clearly betray the Baſeneſs of a Man's own Heart, than the loudeſt Expreſſions.</p>

Do not pretend to Secrets, Panacea's, and Noſtrums, they are illiberal, diſhoneſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with your Characters, as Gentlemen and Phyſicians, and with your Duty as Men—For if you are poſſeſſed of any valuable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, it is undoubtedly your Duty to divulge it, that as many as poſſible may reap the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it; and if not, (which is generally the Caſe) you are propagating a Falſehood, and impoſing upon Mankind.</p>
            <p>In your Behaviour to the Sick, remember always that your Patient is the Object of the tendereſt Affection, to ſome one, or perhaps to many about him; it is therefore your Duty, not only to endeavour to preſerve his Life, but to avoid wounding the Senſibility of a tender Parent, a diſtreſſed Wife, or an affectionate Child. Let your Carriage be humane and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, be intereſted in his Welfare, and ſhew your Apprehenſion of his Danger, rather by your Aſſiduity to relieve, than by any harſh or brutal Expreſſions of it. On the other hand, never buoy up a dying Man with groundleſs Expectations of Recovery, this is at beſt a good natured and humane Deception, but too often

it ariſes from the baſer Motives of Lucre and Avarice: beſides, it is really cruel, as the ſtroke of Death is always moſt ſeverely felt, when unexpected; and the grim Tyrant may in general be diſarmed of his Terrors, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered familiar to the moſt timid, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; either by frequent Meditation, by the Arguments of Philoſophy, or by the Hopes and Promiſes of Religion. But even overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the important Concerns of Futurity; the Buſineſs of this Life may render ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct highly dangerous and criminal; as thoſe to whom the thoughts of Death are painful, are too apt when flattered with the Proſpect of Recovery, to neglect the neceſſary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt a Diſappointment, and by that Means involve their Families in Confuſion and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Above all Things, avoid any ridiculous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Humour, at the bed-ſide of a ſick Man; you cannot chuſe a more unſeaſonable Opportunity for your Mirth; nor will you find a Perſon of a generous and benevolent Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who can ſmile even at the Repetition of a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011168_0019_0F857EF920DBCDE0"/>
Witticiſm, which carries with it the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſo much Inhumanity.</p>
            <p>Let your Preſcriptions be ſimple, and as neat and agreeable as the Nature of the Remedy will permit—Nothing can be more abſurd than the Farrago of ſome, nothing more diſguſtful than the Slovenlineſs of others; for it is impoſſible to learn the true Virtues of Medicines, from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Preſcriptions; and Inelegance frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappoints us of their Effects.—And as it is probable, from the Mode of Practice in this Country, that you will not only be the Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but likewiſe the Diſpenſers of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, let your Integrity be proof againſt the Temptation of unneceſſarily multiplying Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and truſt rather to the Liberality of your Patient, than to the Quantity of your Phyſic, for your Reward. For altho' perhaps by this Method you may ſometimes think your Services undervalued, yet you will always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſuperior Satisfaction of conſcious Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which, by an honeſt Man, will ever be preferred to a trifling Emolument.—</p>

In the Infancy of this Country, the preſent Mode of practiſing Medicine was neceſſarily introduced, from the Scarcity, both of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and Phyſicians. But in ſo populous a City as this, it is beyond a Doubt, that the Regulations it is now under, are both injurious to the Inhabitants, and diſhonorable to the Profeſſion: yet I confeſs it is not very eaſy to point out a Remedy to the Inconveniences at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant on it. There is but one, and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at preſent would not be thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient; but until it is, thoſe who are in good Circumſtances muſt rely wholly upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of their Phyſicians; and for the Poor who are the greateſt ſufferers, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out ſome other Source of Relief.</p>
            <p>Whenever you ſhall be ſo unhappy as to fail, in your Endeavours to relieve; let it be your conſtant Aim to convert, particular Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes into general Bleſſings, by carefully inſpecting the Bodies of the Dead, inquiring into the Cauſes of their Diſeaſes, and thence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011168_0021_0F857EFA9F10B688"/>
improving your own Knowledge, and making further and uſeful Diſcoveries in the healing Art.</p>
            <p>Nor can I help regretting the many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles you will meet with in proſecuting this ſo neceſſary an Enquiry; from the Prejudices of the People in general, and a falſe Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſtaken Delicacy in Relations. Time and Perſeverance however muſt overcome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Prejudices, and will I hope before long, remove theſe Difficulties, and open this Door to Medical Improvement.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe who are at once the unhappy Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, both of Poverty and Diſeaſe, claim your particular Attention; I cannot repreſent to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a more real Object of Charity, than a poor Man with perhaps a helpleſs Family, labouring under the complicated Miſeries of Sickneſs and Penury. Paint to yourſelves the agonizing feelings of a Parent, whilſt labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under ſome painful Diſeaſe, he beholds a helpleſs Offspring around his Bed, in want of the neceſſaries of Nature; imagine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of an affectionate Wife, and a tender
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011168_0022_0F857EFB5929F4A0"/>
Mother, who can neither relieve the Pain and Anxiety of her Huſband, nor ſupply the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate cravings of her Children; and <hi>then</hi> deny them your Aſſiſtance if you can—but the Suppoſition is injurious to Humanity, and <hi>you</hi> in particular, I know want no ſuch Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Duty and Benevolence. I cannot however help regretting, the very frequent Opportunities you will meet with, particularly in this Place, of exerciſing your Humanity upon ſuch Occaſions; owing to the want of a proper Aſylum, for ſuch unhappy and real Objects of Charity, it is truly a reproach, that a City like this, ſhould want a public Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, one of the moſt uſeful and neceſſary chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Inſtitutions that can poſſibly be imagined.</p>
            <p>The labouring Poor are allowed to be the ſupport of the Community; their Induſtry enables the Rich to live in Eaſe and Affluence, and it is from the Hands of the Manufacturer we derive, not only the Neceſſaries, but the Superfluities of Life; whilſt the poor Pittance he earns will barely ſupply the Neceſſities of Nature, and it is literally by the ſweat of his Brow, that he gains his daily Subſiſtance; how
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011168_0023_0F857F009DAFE638"/>
heavy a Calamity muſt Sickneſs be to ſuch a Man, which putting it out of his Power to work, immediately deprives him and perhaps a helpleſs Family of Bread!</p>
            <p>Nor would the good Effects of an Hoſpital be wholly confined to the Poor, they would extend to every Rank, and greatly contribute to the Safety and Welfare of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. Every Country has its particular Diſeaſes; the Varieties of Climate, Expoſure, Soil, Situation, Trades, Arts, Manufactures, and even the Character of a People, all pave the Way to new Complaints, and vary the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of thoſe, with which we are already acquainted; Hence AEgypt is ſubject to the Plague; Holland to Intermittents; the Weſt-Indies to Putrid; and the Northern Countries to inflammatory Diſeaſes; and Spain and England to Hypochondriocal Complaints; which reigning Diſeaſes of a Country, not only have Peculiarities of their own, but often vary the Characters of ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to that Country with others, and theſe Peculiarities with their Antidotes can properly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011168_0024_0F857F01DF3BAE88"/>
be learned only in public Hoſpitals, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a number of Sick at one Time, not only affords an Opportunity of the better comparing and remarking their Symptoms, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a certain Diſcipline and Regulation, the Faces of their diſeaſes are not changed, either by the indulgence of friends or the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of Nurſes; which is too often the caſe in private practice. Another argument, (and that by no means the leaſt,) for an Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Nature, is, that it affords the beſt and only means of properly inſtructing Pupils in the Practice of Medicine; as far therefore, as the breeding good and able Phyſicians, which in all Countries and at all Times has been thought an object of the higheſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, deſerves the Conſideration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, this Inſtitution muſt likewiſe claim its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Encouragement.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Scheme of a Public Hoſpital I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſo impracticable, nor the Execution of it, I hope at ſo great a diſtance, as at firſt ſight it may appear to be. There are Numbers in this Place I am ſure (was a Subſcription once ſet on foot,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011168_0025_0F857F02B616C570"/>
upon an extenſive and generous Plan) whoſe Fortunes enable them, and whoſe Benevolence would prompt them, liberally to contribute to ſo uſeful an Inſtitution; it wants but a Prime Mover, whoſe Authority would give Weight to the Undertaking, and whoſe Zeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, would promote it. Such a one I hope e'er long to ſee riſe up amongſt us, and may the Bleſſing of the Poor, and the Applauſe of the Good and Humane, be the Reward of his Aſſiduity and Labour.</p>
