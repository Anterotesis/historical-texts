            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſins</hi> hath been dark and obſcure in the Church, from the very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, and hath had more of <hi>human No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than of <hi>divine Truth</hi> in it; and therefore <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> writing touching this Point, ſpeaks thus, in the Beginning of his Book, intituled, <hi>De Bap. Tom. 2. f. 57. Illud mihi ingenuè circa Libri Initium diſcendum eſt, ferè omnes eos, quotquot ab ipſi Apoſtolorum Temporibus, de Baptiſmo ſcribere inſtituerunt, non in Paucis (quod Pace omnium Hominum dictum eſſe velim) à Scopo aberraviſſe:</hi> That is, <hi>In the Beginning of my Book</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I muſt ingenuouſly profeſs, that almoſt all thoſe that have undertaken to write of Baptiſm, even from the very Time of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, have (which I deſire may be ſpoken with the Favour of all) not in a few Things erred from the Scope.</hi> And as he affirms, that almoſt all before him had erred in many Things touching Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo did he himſelf alſo err, as well as they, not in a Few: And it is as free for me, or any Body elſe, to differ from him, and other late Writers; eſpecially if that be true which godly and learned <hi>Chemnitius</hi> affirms out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that theſe Things are not <hi>Tanquam Articuli Fidei, à quibus diverſum ſentire Piaculum ſit Anathemate dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> Chemnit. <hi>Examen Concil. Trident. l. de Bapt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Reader,</hi> I acquaint thee before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that in this Point, I ſhall ſpeak much <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:008338_0003_102F330508074C40"/>than all former, or latter Writers whatever, that I have met with; and though I do not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> diſſent from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>worthy</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Men, that have been, and are, otherwiſe <hi>minded;</hi> yet it is the leſs grievous to me, becauſe I differ from them (I can ſay it in Truth before the Lord) not out of any Deſire to be <hi>ſingular,</hi> or for any <hi>worldly</hi> or <hi>carnal End</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, but only that I might cleave to the <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evident Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> alone, even <hi>there</hi> where I ſee the very <hi>Faithful</hi> to leave it; ſeeing I am rather to join to the <hi>Word</hi> without <hi>Men,</hi> than to join to <hi>Men</hi> without the <hi>Word;</hi> and where I find the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Men</hi> in the World, and the <hi>Word</hi> parting, I am there to leave them, and to <hi>go along</hi> with the <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, in all <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> I tender this Diſcourſe to thee; <hi>deſiring</hi> that if thou <hi>canſt</hi> not at the preſent <hi>agree</hi> to what is therein contained, yet that thou wouldſt not raſhly <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> it, ſeeing, thro' God's <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> it may come to paſs, that <hi>what thou knoweſt not now, thou mayeſt know afterwards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe I ſee this preſent <hi>Generation</hi> ſo <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>built</hi> up in the Doctrines of <hi>Men,</hi> I have the leſs Hope that this Truth will <hi>prevail with them;</hi> and therefore I <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>next Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> wich will be <hi>farther removed</hi> from thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and will be <hi>brought nearer</hi> to the <hi>Word;</hi> but eſpecially that <hi>People</hi> whom God hath, and ſhall form by his <hi>Spirit</hi> for <hi>himſelf;</hi> for theſe only will be <hi>able</hi> to make <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Judgment in this <hi>Matter,</hi> ſeeing they have the <hi>Anointing</hi> to be their <hi>Teacher,</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> to be their <hi>Light.</hi>

            <head>THE DOCTRINE OF <hi>BAPTISMS,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Lord,</hi> foreſeeing how great an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil it would be in the <hi>Church,</hi> to leave Men either to their own, or other Mens <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> in the Things of God, did, in the very Beginning of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> command and bind all the Faithful, to hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone; ſaying from <hi>Heaven</hi> (that we might give abſolute <hi>Credit</hi> to his Voice) <hi>This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him;</hi> And the more the <hi>Faithful</hi> have kept to the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the more they have been free from <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> and the more they have left <hi>this,</hi> and turned aſide after the <hi>Doctrines of Men</hi> (though <hi>Men</hi> in ſome Meaſure <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>holy</hi>) the more have they been <hi>perverted</hi> and <hi>ſeduced;</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>true Church of God,</hi> and the very <hi>Faithful</hi> themſelves, have received, held and maintained, divers <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>falſe Doctrines,</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> even for many Ages and Generations; yea, and have not been altogether free from ſome, from the very <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Time: And becauſe many, or moſt, <hi>godly Men,</hi> in former Ages, held ſuch and ſuch <hi>Opinions;</hi> therefore the <hi>following</hi> Ages have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008338_0005_102F330A3AAF6448"/>taken them upon <hi>Truſt</hi> from them, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them as <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain,</hi> though not at all <hi>conſulting,</hi> in thoſe Points, with the great <hi>Doctor</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the New Teſtament, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And thus have the very <hi>Elect</hi> themſelves been drawn into much <hi>Error,</hi> though they have ſtill had <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their <hi>Foundation,</hi> and were <hi>built</hi> on him ſo firmly by <hi>Faith, that the Gates of Hell could not prevail againſt them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, to free the <hi>Faithful</hi> from the <hi>former Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake</hi> (and conſequently from all <hi>Error</hi>) there is no other Way than this, <hi>wholly to forſake the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Men,</hi> and to <hi>lay by</hi> all thoſe <hi>Opinions</hi> that we have ſucked in from our very <hi>Cradles,</hi> and which are now become even a <hi>natural Religion</hi> to us; I ſay, utterly to <hi>lay by,</hi> and wholly to forget all theſe Things, and to come <hi>immediately</hi> to the <hi>pure unerring Word of God,</hi> and to the Voice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, by his <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherein all Things are <hi>true, ſincere</hi> and <hi>perfect;</hi> and not bring <hi>Hearts</hi> to the <hi>Word,</hi> that are prepoſſeſſed with <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> learned of <hi>Men,</hi> but to come thither with Hearts and Conſciences <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unengaged,</hi> and in all Meekneſs, Uprightneſs and Simplicity of Heart, to hear what <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>true Witneſs,</hi> will ſay by his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> which alſo is the <hi>Spirit of Truth;</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and believe <hi>that alone,</hi> though never ſo <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> from the <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Doctrines</hi> of this <hi>preſent Age,</hi> as well as of the <hi>former,</hi> and tho' perhaps the whole <hi>Nation</hi> would be <hi>offended</hi> with it.</p>

And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Courſe</hi> that I have obſerved, to come to ſome <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>certain Knowledge</hi> in the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſm:</hi> For, having <hi>read much,</hi> and <hi>diſcourſed</hi> with <hi>many</hi> touching this <hi>Point,</hi> and having ſeriouſly conſidered what they ſay, as <hi>one</hi> that ſearched after the <hi>Truth,</hi> for itſelf only, and for the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of my own <hi>Soul;</hi> I do profeſs I could not find any Thing almoſt ſpoken, for my Spirit <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>ſafely</hi> to lean on, as perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of what they ſaid, to be but the <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions</hi> and <hi>Thoughts</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and that they ſpoke very much by Conjecture, and at Uncertainty in this <hi>Matter;</hi> and thereupon I reſolved, <hi>wholly</hi> to withdraw from ſuch <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> and to lay down whatever <hi>Opinions</hi> I had before entertained, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Point,</hi> and to come to the <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Scriptures;</hi> and from <hi>thence</hi> (after much ſeeking God) to <hi>learn</hi> whatever the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhould pleaſe to <hi>teach</hi> me; chuſing rather to <hi>build</hi> on the <hi>clear Word,</hi> though <hi>alone,</hi> than on any <hi>uncertain Inferences,</hi> and <hi>blind Conjectures of Men,</hi> though embraced and magnified by all <hi>the World.</hi>

            <p>Firſt for his <hi>Office.</hi> For he begins to ſhew the Difference from <hi>thence,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Newneſs</hi> of his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> was the Occaſion of the Peoples conceiving, that he was the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> whereupon he vilifies his own <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s,

               <hi>clear Scriptures,</hi> and Evidences from them, that <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, are diſtinct.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s are diſtinct in their <hi>Appellations</hi> in Scripture; for <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> was ſtill ſo called, even when the Apoſtles uſed it; and it was not called by <hi>their Names</hi> who adminiſtered it, but was ſtill called <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> Yea, after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> came in, <hi>John</hi>'s ſtill retained its Name, as being <hi>diſtinct</hi> from it; and therefore, <hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 24, 25. it is ſaid, <hi>Apollos taught diligently the Things of the Lord,</hi> knowing only <hi>the Baptiſm of</hi> John.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was to follow <hi>John</hi>'s, and did not accompany it at the ſame Time; for <hi>Matth.</hi> iii. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I do baptize you with Water, but he that come after me,</hi> i. e. in Order of Time, <hi>he ſhall baptize you.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> iii. <hi>I have baptized you,</hi> but <hi>he ſhall baptize you;</hi> which Places plainly declare <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did not <hi>go along</hi> with <hi>John</hi>'s, but was to <hi>follow</hi> it, and that he was to <hi>baptize</hi> with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> after <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> had had its <hi>full Courſe,</hi> to wit, when he was <hi>riſen</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and <hi>aſcended</hi> into Heaven.

               <hi>but wait for the Promiſe of the Father, which,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you have heard of me; for</hi> John <hi>truly baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Spirit, not many Days hence;</hi> and this was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did not <hi>go along</hi> with <hi>John</hi>'s, and make that up <hi>one entire Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>itſelf,</hi> ſeeing it <hi>followed almoſt</hi> four Years after, an therefore <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s muſt needs be diſtinct.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s were diſtinct, in as much as the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt</hi> was neceſſary for thoſe very Perſons, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore been baptized with the Baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> whereas, if <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm had been <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> with Chriſt, that only had been ſufficient; but now, thoſe whom <hi>John</hi> had baptized with <hi>Water,</hi> Chriſt was to baptize again with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as in that Place before mentioned, <hi>I have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized you with Water, but one comes after me, who</hi> ſhall <hi>baptize you with the Spirit;</hi> even you whom I have before baptized with <hi>Water:</hi> And this was not a ſecond Baptiſm, but the firſt Baptiſm of the <hi>New Teſtament, John</hi>'s Baptiſm being more <hi>legal</hi> than <hi>evangelical;</hi> and <hi>evangelical</hi> only, in ſo much as it pointed out this Baptiſm of Chriſt at Hand.</p>
            <p>Again, the Baptiſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>I have Need to be baptized of thee;</hi> ſo that the very Author, or chief Miniſter of <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> ſtood in Need of <hi>ſpiritual Baptiſm</hi> himſelf: <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> xix. when he found certain Diſciples baptized only with the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> he baptized them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008338_0011_102F3318EE7C73A0"/>in the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they had not received the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and this Baptiſm into the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> was not the repeating of any <hi>Water,</hi> but meerly the <hi>Gift of the Spirit;</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them largely the Doctrine of Faith in Chriſt (for the Text relates but the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the Thing) <hi>and laid his Hands on them,</hi> and through his Miniſtry the holy Spirit came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and this was Chriſt's Baptiſm indeed, and no renewing of Water at all, as the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> would fain inforce from this Place.</p>
            <p>By theſe Things it is evident, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s are diſtinct; and therefore as what God hath joined, no Man ought to put aſunder, ſo what God hath put aſunder, no Man ought to join; as if the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt</hi> was <hi>inſufficient</hi> and <hi>incompleat,</hi> except we ſhould add to it the <hi>Baptiſm of John;</hi> which is exceedingly to eclipſe the Brightneſs of the Son of God, as to draw a Vail over the greateſt Glory of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which is the <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If the ordinary Objection ſhall be offered againſt this, to wit, that <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine was the ſame with Chriſt's, and therefore his Baptiſm alſo was the ſame with his;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, it is moſt true, that <hi>John</hi> did preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> clearly, both in Regard of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Offices;</hi> but this was not his <hi>proper Work,</hi> as he was the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> but in ſo much as he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he belongeth to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, which is <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> as alſo, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Moſes, David, Iſaiah,</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> did in the ſame Senſe: But ſo far forth as he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008338_0012_102F331BA938D370"/>preached the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and adminiſtered the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and both theſe not <hi>really</hi> and <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> but only in the <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Sign,</hi> ſo far he belonged to the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> rather than to the <hi>New:</hi> Here was <hi>John</hi> in his proper <hi>Office.</hi> I ſay, ſo far as <hi>John</hi> preached Chriſt <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> he did not that as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, but as <hi>John</hi> a Believer; and ſo the ſame <hi>John,</hi> in Regard of his <hi>Baptiſt's Office,</hi> belonged to the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> but according to the Revelation which he had from the Father, touching Chriſt, and his Faith in him, and Confeſſion of him, he belonged to the <hi>New.</hi> And except we learn thus to <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> of <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine, to wit, what he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and in his proper <hi>Office,</hi> and what as a Believer, who had the Revelation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall never underſtand his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: For <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was the <hi>Seal</hi> of his Old Teſtament Doctrine, and not of his New, or of his own immediate Miniſtry, and not of Chriſt's; at the higheſt, <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm pointed out Chriſt, but neither of them were the ſame with Chriſt's.</p>
            <p>And thus having cleared from the Word, that <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is diſtinct from Chriſt's, I ſhall proceed to ſpeak of each of theſe Baptiſms apart by themſelves, and to hold forth to others what myſelf have learned touching them from the ſame Word.</p>
            <p>And firſt I begin with <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt in Order of Time.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John</hi> was brought in beſides the <hi>Rite</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008338_0013_102F331E13F3BE08"/>ſo was a Sign of a great Change to follow: The <hi>Jews</hi> indeed had their <hi>Baptiſms</hi> in the Law, for they waſhed their <hi>Members, Garments, Veſſels,</hi> &amp;c. and by this they were cleanſed from <hi>legal Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but not from any <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Stain</hi> that did cleave to their <hi>Conſcience;</hi> but <hi>John</hi> was the Author, or firſt Miniſter of a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>unwonted Baptiſm,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all Men to <hi>Repentance for Sin,</hi> and to <hi>flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> and awakening them to <hi>Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Amendment of Life,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pointing out one to come, and now at Hand, who ſhould do all theſe Things for them indeed, which neither he nor his Baptiſm, could do.</p>

2. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was from Heaven, and not from Men; it had its Inſtitution from God, and was not an Ordinance he took up of his own Head. <hi>Luke</hi> iii. 2. it is ſaid, that at the Beginning of <hi>John</hi>'s ſetting forth to his Baptiſm and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, <hi>That the Word of God came to him in the Wilderneſs;</hi> that is, he was inſpired, inſtructed and taught by a Word from God himſelf touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Miniſtry-Baptiſm, and the Diſcovery of Chriſt's his was to make; and <hi>John</hi> i. 6. <hi>There was a Man ſent from God, whoſe Name was</hi> John, and Verſe 33. <hi>He that ſent me to baptize with Water, ſaid unto me.</hi> He went not of his own Accord, but God ſent him to baptize; ſo that as God was the Author of thoſe inferior Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo of this more high and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Baptiſm of <hi>John;</hi> and hereupon the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> that received <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, are ſaid to <hi>juſtify God;</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> that refuſed it, to <hi>reject againſt themſelves;</hi> that is, to their own Harm, the <hi>Counſel of God,</hi> Luke vii. 29.30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt himſelf,</hi> who was born under the Law, and ſubject to the Law, ſubmitted himſelf alſo to the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> as the <hi>laſt</hi> and <hi>livelieſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,</hi> Matt. iii. 13. <hi>Then cometh Jeſus from</hi> Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee <hi>to</hi> Jordan, <hi>to be baptized of him,</hi> and ſo Chriſt, who had ſubmitted himſelf to the <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſubmitted himſelf alſo to the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John;</hi> and as he ſubmitted himſelf to all the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> not for his own Sake, but for ours; ſo alſo to the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John.</hi> For ſeeing Chriſt was free from Sin, he ſtood in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008338_0015_102F3322DE9BE060"/>no Need of <hi>Repentance,</hi> and ſo not of that <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> which was the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sin;</hi> but there the <hi>Head,</hi> who was free from Sin, was baptized for the <hi>Body,</hi> which was full of Sin, <hi>that he might fulfil all Righteouſneſs</hi> in his own <hi>Perſon.</hi> And this was a great Honour to the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> that Chriſt (though in Reference to our Fleſh more than his own) <hi>ſubmitted himſelf</hi> to it.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John</hi> was very <hi>Honourable,</hi> and of <hi>high Account</hi> in its Time, ſo that the very <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> took it up, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſuffered them, becauſe <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> was the Sign and Fore-runner of his, and becauſe the Time of his own <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was not yet come; but Chriſt himſelf uſed it not, as <hi>John</hi> witneſſes, Chap. iv. 2. ſaying, <hi>Jeſus himſelf bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized not, but his Diſciples;</hi> to wit, with <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which was <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi> For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not the <hi>Son of God</hi> to <hi>baptize</hi> with a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; nor the <hi>Lord</hi> of all, to uſe the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of a Servant.</p>
            <p>And thus, having ſhewed how <hi>Honourable John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was in <hi>itſelf</hi> (wherein I conceive I have not done him, though a Servant, the leaſt Prejudice, but have fully attributed to his <hi>Office,</hi> whatever the Word, or he himſelf, a Meſſenger from God, attributes to it) I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, <hi>That the</hi> Baptiſm <hi>of</hi> John, <hi>how honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and excellent ſoever, is yet far beneath and below</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s; yea and moſt weak and imperfect in Compariſon of his.</hi>

For firſt, <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was with a <hi>Creature,</hi> with the <hi>Element of Water,</hi> for the <hi>Creature</hi> could baptize but with the <hi>Creature;</hi> that is, <hi>John</hi> with <hi>Water;</hi> and ſo this was far beneath the Baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was the Work of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> the Work of the Father by the <hi>Son,</hi> and of the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was <hi>tantum exterius Lava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> but <hi>outward,</hi> and reached the outward Man only; the Baptiſm of Water reached but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it could pierce no deeper; and after all the Waſhing of the Body with Water, the Soul ſtill remained as full of <hi>Filth, Sin,</hi> and <hi>Corruption</hi> as ever; and ſo it was far beneath <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, which reaches the <hi>Soul:</hi> The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was the Baptiſm of Bodies, but the Baptiſm of Chriſt the Baptiſm of Souls; and only the Baptiſm of the Spirit reaches the Spirit, and attains to the Soul, Conſcience and inner Man, to purge and purify them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was but a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> though it had more <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Light</hi> in it than any of the <hi>Signs</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> as being nearer to Chriſt, and more newly revived by God; and ſo thought uſeful in its Seaſon, yet the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of it (after the Manner of all Signs) was but weak.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Firſt,</hi> It did not give the Spirit one Drop of the Spirit; yea, ſome who were baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> did not <hi>know the Way of the Lord</hi> perfectly; that is, had no certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, the only Way to God, as <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, Acts</hi> xviii, yea, ſome of them did not ſo much

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither did it give <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion of Sin</hi> (for what was the Plunging of a Man in cold Water towards <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin?</hi>) but theſe were the Works of Chriſt's own Baptiſm, which is the <hi>Baptiſm of the Spirit;</hi> for no Man can repent of Sin, but by the Preſence of the Righteouſneſs of God in his Heart, which is the Work of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is given in <hi>Chriſt's Baptiſm;</hi> neither can any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin, but God: Our Sins are never forgiven by God, till God dwell in us through Jeſus Chriſt, by the Work of the Spirit; ſo that <hi>Repentance</hi> was given, and <hi>Sin</hi> forgiven, not in Hope only in <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but really and truly in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, which was the real Baptiſm of <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither did it give Entrance into the the <hi>Kingdom of God;</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> is a <hi>ſpiritual Kingdom,</hi> and no <hi>earthly</hi> or <hi>corporeal</hi> Thing can give Entrance into it: The <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the Water of <hi>Jordan</hi> could deliver no Man up into the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> but the <hi>Baptiſm in that River that makes glad the City of God,</hi> Pſal. xlvi. 4. in that <hi>River clear as Chryſtal, that proceeds from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb,</hi> which is the Spirit, which delivers up all that partake of it, firſt, into the Kingdom of the Son, and after, through that into the Kingdom of the Father The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> left Men in that old World, wherein it found them, but the Baptiſm of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008338_0018_102F332988746208"/>Chriſt delivers them up into the new World, or the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Now, in all theſe Regards, it appears that <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did not do the Work of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the New Teſtament,</hi> for then that only had been ſufficient, and there had been <hi>no Need</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s to come.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee that the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> as it is diſtinct from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, ſo it is far inferior to his. And therefore great hath been the Miſtake of many, for ſeveral Ages, who have made <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> equal to <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> for what is this, but to make the <hi>Servant</hi> equal to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to ſet down the <hi>Creature</hi> in the Throne of the only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father? Yea, and it is the quite perverting of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> for <hi>John</hi> was to be a <hi>burning and ſhining Light,</hi> to uſher in Chriſt the <hi>true Light;</hi> he was to be as the <hi>Morning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar,</hi> to uſher in Chriſt, the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and was not to be ſo much <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkneſs</hi> to obſcure him; he was but to point out Chriſt, and depart again, and not to ſit in equal Glory with him, on his Throne, in the New Teſtament. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>he was not worthy to bear his Shoes;</hi> and therefore they do not well, who have prepared an equal Crown for him with Chriſt, who is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore we muſt take great Heed that we do not ſo magnify <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Office,</hi> as to intrench on Chriſt's, and to make the Son, out of the Boſom of the Father, to take up the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> a Servant, and to adminiſter one entirely his
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008338_0019_102F332CB4C016E0"/>own; ſurely this would not have been ſuitable to the <hi>Glory of the only begotten Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third Thing I propound to ſpeak to, touching <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is the <hi>Time of its Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> or <hi>Continuance,</hi> and that was but very ſhort; for <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as all the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was but for a Time; yea, this being nearer the Truth and Subſtance than they, was of leſs Duration; as the Morning Star, though brighter than the Reſt of thoſe heavenly Lights, ſhines leſs While than they, becauſe the haſty Appearance of the Sun ſwallows it up. And ſo <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was of great Uſe a little before Chriſt's Manifeſtation to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and continued till the Time of his Aſcenſion; and then when Chriſt's <hi>Baptiſm</hi> began, the Shadow was to give Way to the Subſtance, and the Sign to the Truth, and the Letter to the Spirit, and the Servant to the Son; ſo that Chriſt's <hi>Baptiſm</hi> put an End to <hi>John's, Free-Baptiſm</hi> to <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-Baptiſm</hi> to <hi>Creature-Baptiſm:</hi> For as all the Prophets were until <hi>John,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> was until <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> muſt no more exceed his Bounds, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> theirs; but as the <hi>Prophets</hi> gave up to <hi>John,</hi> ſo <hi>John</hi> muſt give up to <hi>Chriſt. John</hi>'s <hi>temporary Miniſtry</hi> had a <hi>temporary Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm;</hi> but the <hi>everlaſting Goſpel</hi> (which is that Word in our Fleſh) hath an <hi>everlaſting Baptiſm,</hi> which is <hi>the pouring out of the Spirit.</hi> So then, <hi>John</hi> being a <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Forerunner</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, Chriſt</hi> was not to take up his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but <hi>John</hi> was to reſign up his <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea, and as a <hi>Servant,</hi> to deliver up all Things into his
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008338_0020_102F332F1B141548"/>Hands, as <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Lord:</hi> And ſo <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> was to laſt but till <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Fire-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould come in, and then the <hi>Fire</hi> ſhould lick up the <hi>Water;</hi> and as <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould increaſe, <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould decreaſe. So that <hi>John's Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> (which is all one) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Kingdom,</hi> which is a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> not of the <hi>Letter,</hi> but of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> not of <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Shadows,</hi> but of the <hi>Truth;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we leave it where we found it, even without the <hi>Bounds</hi> and <hi>Reach</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom; for <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm</hi> reached unto <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom, but hath no Place in it; and to bring <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> into the Kingdom of <hi>Truth,</hi> is (if rightly underſtood) to act againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> glorified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, this is ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould have no Place in the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and therefore pray ſtay a little, for we have many Things to object againſt it.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, No; for it is not <hi>Water,</hi> but <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-Baptiſm</hi> that makes us <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> hath been an unlawful <hi>blending</hi> or <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>World</hi> together; ſo that hitherto they could not be well <hi>differenced</hi> from each other, to the great Prejudice of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Object. 2. <hi>But have ſo many Ages erred, who have uſed</hi> Water-Baptiſm?</p>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> For the Errors of former Ages, and their great Miſtakes in many of the <hi>Truths</hi> of God, I have nothing to ſay, but that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out.</hi>

            <p>Object. 3. <hi>But you are the firſt Man, for ought we know, that ever oppoſed it.</hi>

            <p>Object. 4. <hi>But Chriſt himſelf was baptized with Water, and ſurely that perpetuates it in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt's being baptized with <hi>Water</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>John,</hi> no more perpetuates <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, than his being <hi>circumciſed</hi> under <hi>Moſes,</hi> perpetuates <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in the Chriſtian Church; or his ſubmitting to other <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Ceremonies,</hi> perpetuates them; <hi>Chriſt</hi> brings no <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>carnal</hi> Thing into his everlaſting or ſpiritual Kingdom, though himſelf ſubmitted to them under their ſeveral Diſpenſations in the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of them.</p>
            <p>Object. 5. <hi>But Chriſt juſtifies and commands</hi> Water-Baptiſm <hi>in</hi> John iii. Except a Man be born of Water, <hi>&amp;c. And</hi> Mat. xxviii. Teach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I confeſs theſe are Places that many have miſtaken, to juſtify the Practice of <hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi> but ſhall ſhew you, that they do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed miſunderſtand them. For that firſt Place, John iii. 5. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God;</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:008338_0022_102F33342D1D7FE0"/>I confeſs, many of the Ancients have, by <hi>Water</hi> here, underſtood <hi>material Water,</hi> and have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Place of <hi>external Baptiſm,</hi> which was <hi>John</hi>'s only: And hereupon divers of them have exceedingly magnified <hi>Water,</hi> and aſcribed it to the Waſhing of <hi>Souls,</hi> and the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of Chriſtians in ſome Meaſure, they not conſidering, in the mean time, what <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith in the very next Verſe, <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> by which they might have learned, that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and corporeal Water can do nothing but outward and corporeal Things, and can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to the Cleanſing of <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi> from Sin.</p>
            <p>So that this Place cannot be underſtood of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Water;</hi> and I could produce the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of many godly Men, of good Note, to this Purpoſe, but do forbear, becauſe I would not have <hi>our Faith</hi> built upon the Authorities of Men; but the Thing is evident from the Text itſelf, for it ſaith, <hi>Except a Man be born of</hi> Water, which ſhews the Water he ſpeaks of, muſt be ſuch as is able to <hi>give a new Birth,</hi> and to make a Man <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,</hi> that is, a ſpiritual, holy, heavenly Creature; and no <hi>Water</hi> can do this, but the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> adds to <hi>Water</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> by Way of Explication; as if he had ſaid, <hi>No Man can enter into the Kingdom of God, except he be born again of</hi> Water; but the Water I ſpeak of is no material Water, but the Spirit, which is able to produce in us a heavenly Nature, through which only we can have an Entrance into an heavenly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008338_0023_102F3335BB70A108"/>Kingdom, ſeeing <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> ſo that the Water Chriſt means in this Place is the Spirit; and many other Places give Witneſs to this, <hi>John</hi> iv. 10. <hi>If thou didſt know who it is that ſaith unto thee, give me to drink, thou wouldſt have aſked of him, and he would have given thee</hi> living Water. And Verſes 13, 14, <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, whoſoever drinks of this</hi> Water (meaning the Water of the Well, called <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well) <hi>ſhall thirſt again; but whoſoever ſhall drink of the</hi> Water <hi>that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt; but the</hi> Water <hi>that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a</hi> Well of Water, <hi>ſpringing up unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi> and John vii. 37, 38, 39. <hi>Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, if any Man</hi> thirſt, <hi>let him come unto me and</hi> drink; <hi>he that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of</hi> living Water; <hi>but this ſpake he of the</hi> Spirit, <hi>which they that believed on him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by <hi>Water,</hi> in all theſe Places, is not meant <hi>material Water,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf explicates; and ſure his Teſtimony alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>But again, if in this Place, <hi>except a Man be born of Water and Spirit,</hi> you will needs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>material Water;</hi> why then, upon the ſame Ground, you muſt needs underſtand that Place in <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>material Fire,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> iii. 11. <hi>He ſhall baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and with Fire;</hi> which is abſurd to very Reaſon to think; but <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> in each Place, added to the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſhew only the <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:008338_0024_102F333AAB061190"/>of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and ſo you may as well bring in the Uſe of <hi>material Fire</hi> in Baptiſm, from the <hi>Text in Matthew,</hi> as of <hi>material Water,</hi> from the Text in <hi>John.</hi> So that this Place in <hi>John</hi> proves no Authority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> in his Kingdom, which is the Church of the New-Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Now the other Place, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 19. <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is alſo of as little Force as the former, to prove <hi>Water-Baptiſm to be an Inſtitution of Chriſt.</hi> Indeed I find, that where ever Men have met with the Word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> or <hi>baptize</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, preſently their Thoughts have deſcended to <hi>material Water;</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> not ſo well conſidering or underſtanding that <hi>Water,</hi> which is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the only <hi>Water</hi> that performs all the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> in the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p>Now for that Place, <hi>Go teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them,</hi> they underſtand it thus, <hi>teach them,</hi> and <hi>baptize them</hi> with material <hi>Water,</hi> uſing this Form of Words, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. But herein they err from the Mind of Chriſt; for by theſe Words Chriſt leads his Diſciples from <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to his own; as if he had ſaid, <hi>John</hi> indeed baptized with Water, and ye have hitherto uſed his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> but I ſhall now ſhortly baptize you with my own <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and from that Time I would have you <hi>go teach all Nations,</hi> and by the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> not baptize them, or dip them in <hi>cold Water</hi> (as <hi>John</hi> did in his <hi>own Baptiſm,</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008338_0025_102F333C5322F8B8"/>you in his) but <hi>baptize</hi> them, or dip them into the <hi>Name of God the Father, Son and Spirit;</hi> and note, that he ſaith not here, <hi>in the Name,</hi> but, <hi>in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by the Name of God,</hi> is meant the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> of God, or <hi>God himſelf;</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>in my Name they ſhall caſt out Devils;</hi> that is, in my <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Virtue;</hi> ſo that the Senſe lies thus, <hi>teach the Nations, and baptize them into the Name,</hi> &amp;c. that is, by your Miniſtry, which ſhall be of the Spirit, and not of the Letter; you ſhall <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize</hi> them, or <hi>dip</hi> them, or <hi>intereſt</hi> them into the <hi>Name</hi> of God, who is the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> as he hath diſcovered himſelf, in his laſt and moſt glorious Diſcovery of himſelf in the Goſpel; you ſhall (I ſay) dip them into his Name, or ſprinkle his Name upon them, that they may be <hi>holy, juſt, true, merciful, righteous, good,</hi> &amp;c. that is, your Miniſtry, after you have received the Spirit, ſhall have ſuch Efficacy, that it ſhall clothe Men with the Name of God, and transform them into his very Nature.</p>
            <p>So that this Place cannot be underſtood of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but inſtead of baptizing in material Water, as <hi>John,</hi> he tells them, they ſhould <hi>baptize into the Name of God,</hi> in ſuch Sort, that they that were before ſinful, corrupt, and evil Men, ſhould now be taken up into the Glory of the <hi>Name</hi> of God. Neither can this Place be underſtood of a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> which the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors ſhould uſe in baptizing, as moſt Men have thought and taught, ſeeing no Place of <hi>Scripture</hi> can be named, wherein the Apoſtles, in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008338_0026_102F333E07F4DD80"/>baptizing, uſed this Form of Words, ſaying, <hi>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son and Spirit,</hi> which they had undoubtedly done, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had commanded it as an abſolute Form. And becauſe many will preſently be ready to be enraged at this <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> I will a little cool their Heat with what <hi>Zuinglius</hi> ſaith of this Place, who was one of the greateſt Enemies to the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> that was in his Time; <hi>Chriſtus Jeſus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Baptiſmi Formulam, qua uteremur his Verbis, non inſtituit, quemadmodum Theologi hactenus falſo tradierunt,</hi> Zuing. Lib. de Bap. P. 56. Tom. 2. Oper. that is, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt did not in theſe Words inſtitute a Form of Baptiſm, which we ſhould uſe, as Divines have hitherto falſly taught;</hi> and he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it upon the ſame Ground I have mentioned before.</p>
            <p>Again, if by this Place, <hi>go teach and baptize,</hi> be meant <hi>Water-Baptiſm, Paul</hi> did very ill obſerve the Command of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>baptized</hi> but two or three believing Families at the moſt, with <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Baptiſm,</hi> and yet preached the <hi>Word</hi> in a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Illiricum, Acts</hi> xv. 19. through many <hi>Kingdoms, Countries, Villages, People;</hi> but I ſay <hi>Paul,</hi> though he uſed not <hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> yet did punctually fulfil the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>did teach them, and baptize them into the Name of God.</hi> So that, no Queſtion, there were many Churches planted in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Time, who believed in Chriſt, and received the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and walked in Fellowſhip with the <hi>Father and the Son,</hi> and with one another in the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> who never were waſhed at all with <hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008338_0027_102F333FC7259318"/>but <hi>Paul</hi> knew well, that no outward Thing is of any Account in the Kingdom of God; and that as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Uncircumciſion</hi> were nothing, ſo neither <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> nor the Want of it, were any Thing, but a <hi>new Creature is ALL;</hi> and if there be <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> they are ſufficient to the Kingdom of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward Ceremonies whatſoever.</p>
            <p>So that neither of theſe two Places prove any Inſtitution of <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> of Chriſt, but that ſtill remains <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and not Chriſt's.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 6 The laſt, and that which ſeems the ſtrongeſt <hi>Objection,</hi> is, <hi>that the Apoſtles practiſed Water-Baptiſm,</hi> not only before Chriſt's Baptiſm came in, but <hi>after;</hi> and this is moſt evident in very many Places in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Wherefore, ſeeing theſe Things are ſo, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſts</hi> have extremely miſtaken, who have made their <hi>Water-waſhing</hi> ſo eſſential a Work of the New-Teſtament, that they would neither <hi>hear the Word,</hi> nor have <hi>Chriſtian Communion</hi> with any
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008338_0029_102F3346E60B1ED8"/>one that was not ſo waſhed; yea, though they were convinced touching them, that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Spirit;</hi> this, I ſay, hath been the great Error of very many honeſt and well meaning People, through miſunderſtanding the Word, to make waſhing with <hi>material Water</hi> ſo neceſſary a Thing in ſpiritual Worſhip; yea, and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> than the very <hi>Spirit itſelf,</hi> whom I do not therefore <hi>judge,</hi> but <hi>pity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much for <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> which was <hi>John</hi>'s, and belonged only to that middle Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, betwixt the Prophets and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now the other <hi>Baptiſm</hi> I am to ſpeak of, is <hi>Chriſts,</hi> which is <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Fire-Baptiſm;</hi> and this is the one and only <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the New-Teſtament, as we find <hi>Paul</hi> affirming, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 6. where he ſaith, that in Chriſt's Kingdom, where is but <hi>one Body,</hi> and <hi>one Spirit,</hi> and <hi>one Hope</hi> of our Calling, and <hi>one Lord,</hi> and <hi>one Faith,</hi> there is alſo but <hi>one Baptiſm;</hi> and this is the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle elſewhere ſhews, ſaying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii. 13. <hi>For by</hi> one Spirit <hi>we are all baptized into</hi> one Body; <hi>and have been made all to drink into</hi> one Spirit.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm</hi> did not go along with <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> but followed it about four Years after (as you have heard) and as appears by the fore-mentioned Place of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> i. 5. where he tells his Diſciples, ſaying, John <hi>verily baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the holy Spirit, not many Days hence;</hi> and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt, and of the Father, was fulfilled

               <hi>Progreſs</hi> of <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm.</hi> And after, when <hi>Peter</hi> preached to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his Family and Friends, the holy <hi>Spirit fell upon them,</hi> Acts x. And <hi>Peter</hi> gives this Account to thoſe of the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts xi. 15. <hi>And as I began to ſpeak, the Holy Spirit fell on</hi> them <hi>as on</hi> us <hi>at the Beginning;</hi> then <hi>remembered I the Word of the Lord, how that he ſaid,</hi> John <hi>indeed bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with Water, but ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;</hi> ſo that <hi>Peter</hi> evidently declares the Gift of the Spirit, by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, to be the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>Fire,</hi> which Chriſt promiſed at his Aſcenſion into Heaven.</p>
            <p>And this is the <hi>only Baptiſm</hi> wherein all the Church of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> are to partake with Chriſt, I ſay, not the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> but of the <hi>Spirit; he</hi> and <hi>we</hi> drinking into one <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> deſcending on us as it did on him. The pouring out of the <hi>Spirit</hi> on the Fleſh of Chriſt, was his <hi>New-Teſtament Baptiſm,</hi> and it is ours too; and all our <hi>true</hi> and <hi>ſound Comfort</hi> and <hi>Happineſs</hi> lies in this, that we are <hi>baptiſed</hi> with the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> that he was; for it would be as little ſpiritual Comfort to be dipped in the <hi>ſame Water</hi> with Chriſt, as to eat with him at the <hi>ſame Table,</hi> or to drink with him in the <hi>ſame Cup,</hi> or to go along with him in the <hi>ſame Ship,</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> did, and divers of the <hi>unbelieving Jews;</hi> but to drink with him in <hi>one Spirit,</hi> is to partake of <hi>one Fleſh</hi> with him, and to be <hi>one Chriſt</hi> with him; and this is a Comfort indeed.</p>

Now the outward Inſtrument of Chriſt's, or Spirit-Baptiſm, is not material Water, but the Word, as Chriſt ſhews, <hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. where he ſaith, <hi>teach and baptize,</hi> ſhewing that <hi>teaching the Word,</hi> is the outward Means of <hi>baptizing</hi> with the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And again, <hi>John</hi> xvii. <hi>Now are you clean through the Word,</hi> not which <hi>Moſes,</hi> but <hi>which I have ſpoken to you</hi> (and therefore is the <hi>Goſpel</hi> called the <hi>Miniſtration</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it proceeds from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and Chriſt baptizes with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> through the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> which is the Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) and <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 26. <hi>Chriſt gave himſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it, with the Waſhing of Water by the</hi> Word; that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> cleanſes his <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>ſuch</hi> a Waſhing of <hi>Water,</hi> as is brought about by the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Water</hi> with which the <hi>Word</hi> waſhes in the <hi>Spirit;</hi> for by the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> is given; and the <hi>Word</hi> cleanſes by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> by the <hi>Word;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is alſo ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 1. <hi>Having theſe</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>let us cleanſe ourſelves from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit.</hi>

            <p>From all this it appears, that <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm</hi> is not to be performed by Water, but by the Word; and no Man, under the New-Teſtament, receives the Spirit through the Baptiſm of Water, but through the Miniſtry of the New-Teſtament, which is the only <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit.</hi>

            <p>And again, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 26, 27. <hi>Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Church, that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it with the Waſhing of Water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf, a glorious Church, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any ſuch Thing, but
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008338_0038_102F17B9D3C3EBD8"/>that it ſhould be holy, and without Blemiſh;</hi> and nothing doth thus purify the Church, till it be without <hi>Spot, Wrinkle</hi> or <hi>Blemiſh,</hi> and till it be perfectly holy, but the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> And therefore, though the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John</hi> was adminiſtred but once, yet the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a continued <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> for as long as Corruption is in the Fleſh, the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in Uſe; ſo that the Nature and Life of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a conſtant and continual <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> God every Day pouring forth his <hi>Spirit</hi> upon a Believer, for the <hi>purifying</hi> and <hi>ſanctifying</hi> of him, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him meet for the <hi>immediate Preſence of God,</hi> whither no <hi>unclean Thing</hi> comes, nor the <hi>leaſt Uncleanneſs</hi> in any <hi>Thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm</hi> ſaves: Whatever in us is waſhed with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is ſaved as well as ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and how much any one hath received of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo much is he already ſaved, <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 5. <hi>According to his Mercy he hath ſaved us by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and renewing of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour:</hi> Where the Apoſtle teaches us how God ſaves, and that is not by <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Batpiſm,</hi> or <hi>Water-waſhing,</hi> but by the <hi>Laver</hi> of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> which is the renewing of the holy Spirit, poured on us abundantly thro' Chriſt; ſo that he calls the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Laver</hi> of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> ſuch a Laver that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the old Nature; yea, and begets a new one; ſo that a Man through this <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is wholly changed, not in a few good Works, but in his whole Nature; and from his Newneſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:008338_0039_102F335E919F4AA0"/>flows Newneſs of Life; ſo that he is no more as he was, but is, and lives, and loves, and thinks, and ſpeaks, and acts otherwiſe than he was wont, and this cannot be the Work of Water in any Meaſure, but wholly of the Spirit, for where Men are deſtitute of the Spirit, though waſhed with Water a thouſand Times, there is no Change of Nature in them; but the Change of Nature, wrought by <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm,</hi> is ſo much preſent Salvation, even in this preſent World. There is another Scripture witneſſes the ſame Thing, and it is 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 20, 21. <hi>A Few (that is, eight Souls) were ſaved by Water, to which Figure Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm anſwering, doth now alſo ſave us, not that whereby the Filth of the Fleſh is caſt away, but whereby a good Conſcience anſwers well to God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, Peter</hi> having ſaid, that Baptiſm anſwers to the Flood, and ſaves the <hi>Church</hi> now, as the Flood did the <hi>Church</hi> then; yea, ſaith he, but I mean not the outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or the Waſhing away of the Filth of the Body, but the <hi>Anſwer of</hi> a <hi>good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Which Place is difficult; but I thus conceive it, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Chriſt's Reſurrection is the Gift of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in a Believer, rectifies his Conſcience, and makes it good, ſo that it can return a ſweet Anſwer to God upon every Word of his; for the Work of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Heart anſwers every Word of Faith ſpoken from God; particularly it can ſay to God, I was indeed filthy and unclean throughout, but I am now waſhed, and juſtified, and ſanctified in the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008338_0040_102F33620C9B2088"/>Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of my <hi>God;</hi> and this <hi>Spirit-Baptiſm</hi> is that that ſaves, and not the <hi>Water,</hi> which puts away the Filth of the Fleſh only, but leaves the Filth of the Spirit as much as ever.</p>
            <p>So that, in this Place, <hi>Peter</hi> puts an End to Baptiſm in the Fleſh, as <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> ii. 28. puts an End to Circumciſion in the Fleſh, ſaying, <hi>He is not a Jew that is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a Jew that is one inwardly, and Circumciſion is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe Praiſe is not of Men, but of God;</hi> that is, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Kingdom of Chriſt, where all Things are ſpiritual; Circumciſion in the Spirit puts an End to Circumciſion in the Fleſh; and in the ſame Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Baptiſm in the Spirit puts an End to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in the Fleſh; for he is not a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who is one outwardly, neither is that Baptiſm which is outward in the Fleſh; but he is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> who is one inwardly, and Baptiſm is that of the Heart in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe Praiſe alſo is not of Men, but of <hi>God.</hi> For under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is the Miniſtration of the Spirit (as ye have been often minded) we can find nothing among all outward Things, through the Uſe and Exerciſe whereof we may attain the Cleanneſs and Purity of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in our Natures; and therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath put an End to all outward, carnal and earthly Things of the firſt Teſtament, by the inward, and ſpiritual, and heavenly <hi>Things</hi> of a ſecond, and better, Teſtament; and by his
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:008338_0041_102F33646AF17820"/>own Death and Reſurrection only, not without us, but within us, through the Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Spirit, all the Baptiſm of the New-Teſtament is fully and perfectly performed.</p>
            <p>And thus, in all theſe Particulars, you ſee the infinite Excellency and Glory of the <hi>Spirit-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> above <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> and this only is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in the Days of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as being the true and proper <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtament;</hi> for as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf only is ſufficient to the Faithful without <hi>John,</hi> though <hi>John</hi> were of Uſe in this Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to point out <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> only is ſufficient to the Faithful, without the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> though the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John</hi> were of Uſe in its Seaſon, to point out the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> himſelf was of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>I have Need to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of thee;</hi> which he means not of <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> (for ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as you have heard, <hi>did not baptize</hi>) but with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> himſelf, who was never baptized with <hi>Water,</hi> neither by Chriſt nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, nor any Body elſe, yet was baptized with the Spirit; and the Baptiſm of the Spirit was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> without any Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and ſo Chriſt's Spirit-Baptiſm, by the Word, is ſufficient for all the Faithful now, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>John</hi>'s Water-Baptiſm; for he that is truly waſhed from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit, and hath the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in him, to renew his Nature, and to conform him exactly to Chriſt's own Image, and to work him in this preſent World into the true Similitude of Heaven, and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008338_0042_102F3366CAE67B48"/>to be in him a <hi>Fountain of Water ſpringing up unto everlaſting Life;</hi> what Need hath he of cold material Water to be poured on his Body, under the Pretence of any Sign whatever, either of <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> when as he hath the Truth, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and heavenly Thing itſelf?</p>
            <p>Now this, it may be, may ſeem ſtrange and dangerous to ſome of low, and fleſhly, and cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary Religion, but let all ſuch (if it be poſſible) conſider, that where the Subſtance comes the Shadow is at an End, and the Ceremony where the Truth comes, and the Creature where <hi>God</hi> comes: And if they underſtand not this for the preſent, I hope they may underſtand it afterwards, for we ſpeak not at Uncertainties in this Point, but what we have in ſome Meaſure ſeen, and felt, and <hi>handled of the Word of Life, that we deliver to you, that ye may have Fellowſhip with us; and truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> through the Spirit.</p>
