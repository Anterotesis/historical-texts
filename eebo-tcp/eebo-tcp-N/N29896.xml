            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

UPON the twenty fourth or twenty fifth of <hi>April</hi> last, Capt. <hi>Benjamin Norton</hi> of <hi>Newport,</hi> arrived at <hi>Tarpawlin Cove,</hi> in a Ship of about two hundred and fifty Tons, Loaden with White Sugar, Cocoa, and Negroes: the which Ship, (by the Testimony of the Sailors that did belong to her) was a <hi>Dutch Guinea</hi> Trader, that lay at Anchor at the Island of <hi>Dominico,</hi> one of the <hi>French</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribbee Islands, and was there disposing of their Cargo of Slaves among the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> in Exchange for <hi>Sugar, Cocoa,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>WHEN one <hi>Roberts</hi> a Pirate took her at said Island, and after about two Months Possession of her, (at the Island of <hi>Hispaniola</hi>) gave the said Ship and Cargo to the abovesaid <hi>Benjamin Norton,</hi> who was then their Prisoner, and had been taken by them some time before they took the aforesaid Ship.</p>
            <p>AND this Government being inform'd of said <hi>Norton</hi>'s Arrival at <hi>Tarpawlin-Cove</hi> with said Ship, and that he had broke Bulk, and put on Board several Sloops and Boats, several Negroes, and great quantities of Sugar and Cocoa; and also that several of said Slaves, and some of the said Sugar and Cocoa was Imported into this Colony, out of the said Ship, in a small Sloop belonging to <hi>Newport;</hi> His Honour the Governour immediately issued forth a PROCLAMATION, Requiring all Persons within this Colony, that had Received any of the sail Negroes, Cocoa or Sugar, or was knowing to the same; should forthwith Discover and Deliver the same into the Hands of the Authority of this Government; And that on the Contrary, he or they so Concealing the same, should be Prosecuted as Accessories of PIRACY: Which PROCLAMATION was Published in every Town in the Colony, and a Warrant granted forth to the Sheriff, to Search for the same. WEEREUPON, Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Negroes, Twenty Bags of Cocoa, and Seven Hogsheads of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar were deliver'd up to the Government, and by them Secured, until the Council and Assembly should give further Order for the same.</p>
            <p>ON the twenty seventh of <hi>May,</hi> during the Recess of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

Assembly, between their <hi>May</hi> Sessions, and Adjournment in <hi>June,</hi> Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> (without the Knowledge of this Government) opens his Court of Vice-Admiralty, and Decrees, That the twenty Bags of Cocoa, and seven Hogsheads of Sugar, were Forfeited to the KING, the GOVERNOUR and the Informer: But before any Copies were given of that Decree, the said Judge made another Decree, of the same Date, different from the Former, and orders the same to be Sold by Publick VENDUE, and the Price to be Lodged in the Collector's Hands, for the space of three Months; and if no Claimer in that time, then to be Forfeited. (As was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his first Decree that was stifled) The Negroes likewise were ordered to be Sold, and the Price to be Lodged with the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector; and if no Claimer within the time of three Months as aforesaid, then to be Forfeited to the Vice Admiral, or as His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty should Determine; or to the King, the Governour, and the Collector: But before the time appointed for the Sale, the Judge makes two other Decrees of the same Date, (out of Court, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Published) much different to the two former; wherein he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Price of the Cocoa and Sugar, to be Lodged twelve Months and a Day in the Collector's Hands, without any Claimer appear to Avouch the same, or to the Vice-Admiral, or others Authorized by His Majesty, or to the Informer, as in Case of Seizures. And fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any such Claimers within the twelve Months, then the same was declared Lawful Seizure, and to belong to the King, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Collector. The Price of the Negroes was to be Lodged in Mr. <hi>Augustus</hi> L<hi>ucas</hi> his Hands, until the Judge should otherwise Determine: The which was to be conveyed out of the Colony, as the said L<hi>ucas</hi> did Declare some time after.</p>
            <p>ON the thirteenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Assembly Met according to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, and they being Inform'd of the Judge's indirect Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Recommended the Matter to the Governour and Council; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring them to take the same into their Consideration, and to take such proper Measures as would be for the Profit of the Owners of said Goods, and the Credit of the Government.</p>
            <p>THE Governour and Council taking the Premises into their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:039750_0005_1015C0A58C104D78"/>
serious Consideration, and upon due Debate of the Matter, it was Voted, That whereas the Honourable <hi>John Menzies,</hi> Judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty in this Colony, had without their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Advice or Concurrence, Ordered, and Decreed, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the aforesaid Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar as he thought fit, and to Convey the Price of the same out of the Colony, was a Contempt of the Government.</p>
            <p>AND the Governour and Council was at the same time inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in some of His Majesty's Governments in the <hi>West India</hi> Islands, Piratical Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had in the like Nature (though not with the like Contempt) been Condemn'd and Disposed of by the Admiralty Courts, whereby the said Governments have, and are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Satisfy and make good the same.</p>
            <p>IT was therefore Resolved by the Governour and Council, That as Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> had acted in the aforesaid Premises without their Knowledge, Advice or Approbation, so they would have no Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to what he had done; but to prevent his further Proceeding in the like Nature, gave Orders to the Sheriff, not to Deliver the Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar, without their Directions: And on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of <hi>June,</hi> the Governour and Council Ordered, That the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Nineteen Negroes, Twenty Bags of Cocoa, and Seven Hogsheads of Sugar, being <hi>bona peritura,</hi> should be Sold at Publick Vendue, on the twenty third of <hi>June;</hi> and that the Governour, Deputy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and Collector of His Majesty's Customs, should Order the Conditions of Sale, and Receive the Price, to be Secured for One Year and a Day for the Claimers: And if none Appeared in that Time, till His Majesty's Pleasure should be known thereon.</p>
            <p>ON the twenty second of <hi>June,</hi> about Ten of the Clock before Noon, the aforesaid Judge <hi>Menzies,</hi> Mr. <hi>Augustus Lucas,</hi> Deputy Judge, and Mr.—<hi>Boydell,</hi> Register of said Court, came to the Governour's House, and soon after them, the Deputy Governour and three Assistants. (After the usual Complements) Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> said, That the Governour and Council had interrupted him in the Execution of his Office; and demanded the Delivery of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:039750_0006_1015C0A760ECA278"/>
Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he might Proceed according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees without Interruption: And then produced his Commission, and Read a Paragraph thereof Relating to Pirates, Amplifying upon the same; and one other Paragraph, wherein the Government was to give him Assistance in the Execution of his Office: After which Mr. <hi>Boydell,</hi> having a Paper in his Hand, Read it; wherein the Judge Required sundry Things, much as he had done by Word of Mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which, the Governour Requested a Copy of what was Read, that he might be capable to Answer it: Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> Replied, That we had heard it, and that was sufficient.</p>
            <p>THE Governour told the Judge, That his Proceeding was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Knowledge or Approbation of the Government; and that he design'd (as they were informed) to carry the Price, or Produce of the Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Colony; and that the Government deemed themselves Responsible for the same: For which Reasons, they had taken Methods to Secure themselves, and Read a Copy of the Council's Order to the Judge. After which, the Judge requested the Governour to give him that Copy which had been Read: The Governour told him, it was a Copy he kept for his own Service; and that if he pleased, he might have a Copy from the General Recorder.</p>
            <p>THEN the Judge said, That the Price of the Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in case of no Owners, belong'd to the Vice-Admiral, and that he design'd to secure it for him. The Governour then asked the Judge, Who he deemed to be Vice-Admiral of this Colony? Who reply'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Excellency Colonel SHUTE. The Governour told the said Judge, that Matter had often been Debated, and particularly in Col. <hi>Dudley</hi>'s Administration, but it was never granted by this Government. Then the Judge Reply'd, For which Reason it was incerted in his Commission, and he deem'd himself to be Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Admiral here. The Governour told him, Tho' our Charter did not expresly say any thing about the Vice-Admiralty, notwithstanding he presumed there was the like Authority given, and that the Power of Vice-Admiral was vested in him, during his present Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, throughout the Jurisdiction of this Colony. The Deputy
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:039750_0007_1015C0A90390EB08"/>
Governour told the Judge, that by our Charter, all Fines and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures were given to the Colony; and Read that Paragraph to the Judge, the which caused some needless Discourse, foreign to the Matter then before us; but it was not insisted upon, nor once mentioned, that the Price of the Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or any other Fines or Forfeitures belong'd to the Governour as Vice-Admiral. This is the Truth and the Substance of what pass'd at the Governour's House. About two of the Clock in the Afternoon, the Marshal of said Court delivered to the Governour from said Judge, a Paper wherein (after setting forth how he had Read his Commission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Great Seal</hi> before the Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) the said Judge De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and Requires the Governour in his Majesty's Name, to deliver up the Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he might not be interrupted in the Sale thereof; and that the Court-House and Town School-House be ordain'd for the holding his Court, and that he might have Access therein at all seasonable Hours.</p>
            <p>ABOUT four of the Clock <hi>Post Meridiem</hi> the same Day, the Governour return'd Answer to the Judge, That as he had done, so he should upon all Occasions, give all due Aid and Assistance, as well as Encouragement to him in the due Execution of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, according to his Commission, so far as he kept within the Bounds and Limits of the same, and did not Intrench upon the Liberty and Property of this His Majesty's Colony: And for what he Required in the several Paragraphs, he had no Authority as Governour to make any Answer to the same, until he had advised with the Council and Assembly, and received their Instructions thereon. That as to the Court-House and Town School-House, he had not the Disposing of either; but that as he had not met with any Obstruction therein, so he presumed he would meet with no other Treatment for the Future: PROVIDED he did not meddle nor set up any Court there that should any ways Intrench upon the Acts and Orders of the General Assembly, or General Council; in which Cases, he was advised to Obstruct his Accession into either of said Houses.</p>
            <p>JUDGE <hi>Menzies</hi> made no further Application for the said
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:039750_0008_1015C0AA931D0160"/>
Houses, but opens his Court at a Publick House; and on the same Day, passes a Fourth Decree about the Cocoa and Sugar, and at the same time Decrees the Survey <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>

            <p>ON the twenty third of said <hi>June,</hi> early in the Morning, a Citation came out against the Deputy Governour and Collector, citing them to appear before him, to answer for some Contempt (as he said) by them committed against his Court, upon the Penalty of <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> each. The Governour being inform'd thereof, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised with such of his Council as was near at Hand, and it was thought Advisable to grant forth a Prohibition, to prohibit the said Judge from proceeding in Opposition to, and Contempt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Council's Acts and Orders. A Prohibition was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon drawn up, and Read in the Presence of the Judge and his Officers, (by the Sheriff) before the Judge opened his Court that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Notwithstanding the said Prohibition, the Judge opened his Court, and in Contempt of said Prohibition. Decreed that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty Governour and Collector should each of them pay a Fine of <hi>Fifty Pounds</hi> for their Contempt, as is set forth in said Decree: And upon passing said Decrees, he immediately mounted his Horse, and Rode the <hi>Back Way</hi> out of Town in a <hi>Violent Rain,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>—At two of the Clock in the Afternoon of said Day, the Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar, were Exposed to Sale at Publick Vendue, pursuant to the Council's Order; and in a few Hours was all Sold at a good Price, and is Secured according to the Governour and Council's Order.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Judge's Departure, the Governour was informed, That the Deputy Register was seen to out a Leaf out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Governour upon the said Information, sent for the said Deputy Register<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and upon his Examination, he readily confessed that he had cut a Leaf out of said Book by the Judge's Order. The Governour then demanded of the said Deputy Register, the Copies of all the said Judge's Decrees about the Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar; and in two or three Days after, the said Deputy
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:039750_0009_1015C0AE9D0C7660"/>
Register delivered several Copies to the Governour; who upon Examination, and Perusal thereof, found that the first and second Decrees were missing, with the first Conditions of Sale. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour then Demanded Copies of them also; to which the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Register answered, That he had given his Honour Copies of all the Decrees that he had Registred in his Office, and that he could give no other. The Governour then told the Register, that the Collector had Copies of the second Decrees Attested by him. (The first as the Governour was informed, was stifled before any Copies were given out) The Deputy Register made answer, He might make the best of them he could, for they were not Registred in his Book; so that the Governour could not obtain the said Copies any other ways than from the Collector's Copies; by which it may justly be presumed, that the Judge's first and second Decrees were cut out of the Register Book; for he that will cut out one Leaf, will not scruple to cut out more to serve the like Turn.</p>
            <p>THIS is a true and exact NARRATIVE of the Governour and Council's Proceedings, relating to Judge <hi>Menzies,</hi> about the Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar, which the said Judge has so Unfairly and Erroniously set forth by way of <hi>Advertisement</hi> in the <hi>Boston <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>1<hi>st.</hi> JUDGE <hi>Menzies</hi> in his said <hi>Advertisements,</hi> Charges the Governour and Council, That they Illegally and Unwarrantably Obstructed his Sale of the aforesaid nineteen Negroes, Cocoa and Sugar, expresly contrary to His Majesty's Commission, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> The Governour and Council were at great Trouble, Charge and Expence, in Recovering and Securing the said Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Lawful Owners, or in Default thereof, as His Majesty should Dispose of the same; and that Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> was never possess'd of the said Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor did he ever apply himself to the Government for their Advice, Approbation or Concurrence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but on the contrary, in an Arbitrary and Contemptuous manner, Condemns the same, in such manner as his several Decrees set forth; thereby to Defraud the Owners, and impose upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

            <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> Judge <hi>Menzies</hi> in his <hi>Advertisement,</hi> charges the Governour and Council with refusing him a Copy of their Act, when demanded by him, on Pretence that the Ordering and Disposing of such things did belong to them by their Charter; and that the Governour as Vice-Admiral, has a Right to the Value thereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> THE Governour Affirms to the Contrary, that the Judge was not denied a Copy; but that he told the Judge in his own House, that he might have a Copy out of the Recorder's Office<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Deputy, as he has inform'd since, did say, That if the Judge would not give a Copy of his Demands (by Words) in Writing, that he ought not to have a Copy of the Council's Act. However, if that had been Concurr'd with by the Governour, and Council, (as it was not) it would not have amounted to a Denial, as the Judge unfairly Affirms: Neither was there any Pretence made by the Governour and Council, that the Ordering and Disposing of such belonged to them by their Charter; or that the Governour had a Right to the same as Vice-Admiral: Neither was any such thing insisted on, any other ways than Transiently by the Deputy Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as is aforesaid.</p>
            <p>3<hi>dly.</hi> THE Judge Affirms in his <hi>Advertisement,</hi> That <hi>John Wanton</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel Kay</hi> Esqrs; had ordered two Parts of the Produce of said Negroes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be Lodged in their own Hands, and the third to be given to the Governour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> THE Council requested the Governour to Receive the whole Price and Secure it, as was ordered; but the Governour Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing, without some other was joined with him, the Council there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to gratify the Governour, added the Deputy Governour and

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> THIS Article is very unfairly and unhandsomely Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented; for the Judge had no positive Denial of Access into the Court-House, but as the Governour intimated to the Judge, as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
