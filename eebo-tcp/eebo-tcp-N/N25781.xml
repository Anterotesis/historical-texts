            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PREVIOUS to entering upon the ſubject of the following pages, I would merely premiſe, that I was but a ſhort time in the practice of phyſic, until I obſerved the influence of the New and Full Moon, in occaſioning the firſt attacks, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing relapſes, in the diſeaſes of the city of Philadelphia. Upon firſt putting my obſervations on paper, I intended to have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them, without taking notice of any of the authors upon the ſubjects; but, after ſhewing my notes to one of my medical friends, a profeſſor, and taking his advice, I ſuſpended the deſign of printing, until I examined thoſe writers who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of the Influence of the Moon on the diſeaſes of the human body in other climates.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations are now preſented to the Public, ſupported by quotations from the learned: Some of the facts which I looked upon as my own, were, I find, known before; this, although a diſappointment, has ſtrengthened thoſe which I now give to the world; and which, I hope, will meet with a candid examination before they are rejected; for new truths are always at firſt badly received, becauſe, the celebrated Helvetius obſerves, "they ſhock the vanity of ſome men, and contradict opinions generally received."</p>

            <p>IN taking notice of the influence of the moon on the diſeaſes of the human body, I ſhall make a few obſervations on her effects in the climate of the United States; ſhow her influence on perſons in perfect health; and, in ſpeaking of diſeaſes, follow the ſyſtematic order as laid down by Dr. Cullen.</p>

               <p>ABOUT forty-eight hours previous to, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the new and full moon, all nature appears to be affected; a warm ſouth-weſt wind generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; the barometer ſinks to 29 and 28½ and the thermometer riſes from 15 to 25 degrees:<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In the Ephemerides of the Palatine Meteorological Society of Mannheim for the year 1781, Mr. Hemmer obſerves "of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer, the greateſt elevation, in the courſe of the year, coincided with the new moon, and the day after its apogee. All the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt elevations of each month, except one, and all the leaſt, except four, coincided with a lunar point, or the day preceding, or the day following one. From the new moon to the full, the mercury has a tendency to aſcend; from the full, to the new moon, it has a tendency to deſcend; it is, alſo, higher towards the apogee, than towards the perigee of the moon. Of rain and evaporation, it is obſerved, that the moſt rainy days coincided with the day prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the eve of a lunar change, ſeldom with the apogee or perigee of the moon."</p>
                     <p>Under the New-York head of October 9th, 1797 we have the following: "Laſt Tueſday was a very warm day for the ſeaſon, the thermometer riſing to 78″ in the country, and ſomething high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in town; during the day, a ſudden change took place in the weight of the atmoſphere; the mercury, in the barometer, fell half an inch in a ſhort time: the effect on the ſprings of the muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal clock, in Mr. Baker's Muſeum, was ſo great as to render its movements uncommonly rapid; and to reduce them to their uſual celerity, it was neceſſary to relieve the machinery of fifteen or twenty pounds of its uſual weight. The fact is related by Mr. Baker himſelf, and deſerves to be recorded, as a curious and not unuſeful fact. The hot unelaſtic or light air, was obſerved about 36 hours before the full of the moon.</p>

denſe and heavy air from the north-eaſt ruſhes in to ſupply the place of this rarefied air, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to blow ſometimes two or three days, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with thick clouds and rain, obſcuring the whole atmoſphere, and often does conſiderable damage along the coaſt and wharves<note n="*" place="bottom">An antient author ſays, "the moon, by rendering the air ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lays a foundation for a greater quantity of vapours being raiſed, and, is therefore, found to occaſion rainy weather."</note>: it was one of theſe ſtorms that prevented Dr. Franklin from obſerving an eclipſe of the moon in the year 1760.</p>
               <p>Within the periods, or on one of the two days which immediately precede and follow the new and full moon, high winds, ſtorms,<note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. Winterbotham, in his account of Bermudas, ſays, "the ſtorms generally come with the new moon."</note> hurricanes,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Three moſt violent hurricanes of Great Britain have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by an eclipſe of this luminary.</note> tempeſts,<note n="§" place="bottom">The moon is thought by the Indians to preſide over tempeſts.</note> tornadoes, and earthquakes,<note n="‖" place="bottom">
                     <p>An earthquake was felt at Mancheſter, Bolton, and Bowdon in Cheſhire and other places in England, on July 17th, 1795, at half paſt three o'clock in the morning: The particulars were publiſhed in London on the ſame day, including the ſtate of the atmoſphere, as follow, "the moon had changed the preceding morning at half paſt ſeven, the barometer changeable, thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter temperate, the air obſcured with clouds, thick and much agitated with guſts of wind and rain at intervals from the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern quarter."</p>
                     <p>At nineteen minutes paſt ſix o'clock in the morning of the thirty firſt of January 1794, the ſun was in an eclipſe. At the ſame hour we had a new moon, and about two o'clock at Goſhen, a noiſe ſimilar to diſtant thunder, with a tremulous motion of the earth, was heard in this town and adjacent country; it proceeded from north-weſt, and continued three or four ſeconds—This earthquake was certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the revolutions of the Moon.</p>

commonly moderates it<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Philadelphia Gazette of January 2d, 1797, we have under the New-York head of December 31, 1796, the following fact: "it is an obſervation juſtified by long attention, to the courſe and changes of weather, that the prevailing winds and weather of the laſt quarter of the moon run into the three ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding quarters. We may, therefore, expect, that, excepting ſlight or temporary variations, the laſt quarter of the moon will afford a ſpecimen of weather for the three ſucceeding weeks.— The ſevere cold weather, and weſterly winds, this laſt autumn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the laſt week in November, and in the laſt quarter of the moon. The ſevere winter of 1779, 1780, began about the ſame time; very ſoon after the 20th of November, with a fall of ſnow in the laſt quarter of the moon.</note>. Within the periods, our tides in the Delaware generally riſe from one to two feet higher than in the intervals.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Ramſay of S. C. ſays, "tides in Aſhly and Cooper rivers, in common, riſe and fall five feet; but at the new and full moon ſeven feet."</note> This is ſo wellknown, that ſome of our ſhip-carpenters wait for the periods before they launch their veſſels.</p>
               <p>I believe the water, when the moon comes towards her meridian, is at its greateſt heighth; becauſe the atmoſphere, from the elevation of the column of air directly under her meridian, is diminiſhed in weight and preſſure; and not more depreſſed, according to Dr. Franklin, who ſays, "the tide is a wave, and a wave, a tide in miniature; and that the wave follows her two hours, after ſhe paſſes the meridian."</p>
               <p>The United States are moſt ſubject to inundations at the new and full moon; which is to be accounted for by the high winds, occaſioning the ſea to flow in the rivers with a ſtrong current, which check the tides, and cauſe them to overflow the low lands.<note n="‡" place="bottom">On the twenty-eighth of May 1794, we had a new moon, thirty-five minutes paſt ſeven in the afternoon, the tide was higher in our river, by three inches, than it has been known to be by the oldeſt inhabitants.</note> The lakes on our continent are, likewiſe, it is well known, influenced by this luminary.</p>

               <head>Of the influence of the moon on people in health.</head>
               <p>The influence of this planet, on the animal eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, has been remarked by many authors, from the venerable Hippocratis to the ingenious Darwin, and particularly by the Arabian phyſicians; by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Baglivi, Van Helmont, Ballonius, Ramazzini, Pitcairn, Mead, Sir Hans Sloan, Floyer, Grainger, Gregory, Balfour, Muſgrave, Lind, Wilſon, Moſely, Leake, Tyſon, Wade, Jackſon, Laing, and the late Dr. Smith of New-York.</p>
               <p>Within the periods, the pulſe is generally more quick and tenſe than in the intervals; and reſpiration is more free and eaſy: hence, an agreeable ſenſation of heat is perceived, and vigour is imparted to the whole ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Perſons in health appear to drink more at the full and change; a plethora is induced in the ſyſtem; the appetite of thirſt is much increaſed, and, perhaps, one-third leſs of the uſual quantity of liquor is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to make a man drunk at this time, than in common. This has been particularly obſerved by the friends and acquaintances of Mr. J— R—n of this city.</p>
               <p>The appetite for animal food is not increaſed; the determination to the alimentary canal is diminiſhed, while that of the inſenſible perſpiration of the body is much increaſed; the quantity of fluids in the vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſyſtem is more conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Impreſſions, made on the ſenſes, excite quicker ſenſations and reflections. The ſecretions are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed; and hence, I have often obſerved mothers and nurſes, in general, who are ſucking children, afford more milk at this time.</p>
               <p>The young and old, from their accumulated ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citability, are more ſenſibly affected than the

middle-aged. A Mr. Roſs, rope-maker, of this city, has a daughter ſeven years old, who enjoys a good ſhare of health, except at the periods, when ſhe falls in a ſyncope, which laſts ten or fifteen minutes: when ſhe recovers from this ſtate of inſenſibility, ſhe enjoys her uſual good health until the periods return, when, unconſcious, ſhe is ſeized as before.</p>
               <p>In Hartford, ſtate of Connecticut, Dr. T. was found dead in the ſtreet: he was going from his neighbour's to his own houſe, January 31, 1794, and on the ſame day, hour, and minute the ſun was in an eclipſe with a new moon.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Mallet, in his life of lord Bacon, page 147, ſays, "one ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity there was in his temperament not eaſily to be accounted for. In every eclipſe of the moon, whether he obſerved it or not, he was ſuddenly ſeized with a ſudden fit of fainting; which left him without any remaining weakneſs, as ſoon as the eclipſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded."</p>
                     <p>Sully, in his Memoirs, Vol. 4. p, 285, ſpeaking of the total eclipſe of the ſun, which happened in the year 1605. ſays, "this remarkable old man, Theodore Beza, was ſeized with an illneſs in the eighty-ſeventh year of his age, which, before the eclipſe of the ſun, was very flight, but grew fatal from that moment; and a few days after, put a period to his exiſtence."</p>
                     <p>In a note to the above ſentence, there are theſe obſervations: "many ſtrange maladies, of different kinds, raged at Paris at that time; and together with the eclipſe, eclipſed many perſons who have never been ſeen ſince. Dyſenteries, eſpecially, were very mortal and dangerous, and more in other places than at Paris, few who were atacked eſcaping them"</p>

               <p>On the mind it produces the moſt powerful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;<note n="†" place="bottom">We are informed by Dr. Gregory, that the full moon had a moſt wonderful effect on the mind of the celebrated Chatterton, his poetic vein ſtowing impetuouſly upon him at this time.</note> as an equanimity of temper, a diſpoſition to cherefulneſs, and an averſion to anger in people of iraſcible diſpoſitions; perhaps there may be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the atmoſphere, a mixture of airs at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods favourable to the intellectual faculties: in this ſtate of the mind, phyſicians viſit their patients and relations; their friends labouring under contagious diſeaſes, and are not ſo liable to receive infection.</p>

               <p>The influence of this luminary in this claſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, is more powerful on one of the two days, which immediately precede and follow the full and change, than thoſe on the intervening days, or intervals; ſo, when I ſhall ſpeak of theſe periods, I ſhall conclude four complete days at each.</p>
               <p>I obſerve the moſt influence, the nearer we are to thoſe periods; with reſpect to the two, the full ſeems to have moſt power, which is agreeable to her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proximity.</p>
               <p>The firſt attacks of fevers, (particularly the bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, remitting, and intermitting,) are moſt frequent, their ſymptoms more violent, and more difficult to cure at the periods.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Dr. Benjamin Moſely, ſpeaking of the climate of the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, p. 112, ſays, "and though the moon has unqueſtionably great influence on criſis, and relapſes in continued and intermittent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, yet lunacy is almoſt unknown."</p>
                     <p>And in a note, at the bottom of the ſame page, he ſays, "In the ſpring of the year 1777, I remarked that moſt of the patients whom I attended in fevers, were much affected in the head at every new and full moon; I have obſerved the ſame thing often, but never ſo uniformly as in that year."</p>
                     <p>Dr. Robert Jackſon, in his treatiſe on the fevers of Jamaica, p. 58, ſays, "the approach to new and full moon, appears to be connected with the invaſion and relapſe of fevers, in a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner."</p>
                     <p>In page 63 and 64, he ſays, continuing his obſervations in America; "at the beginning of Auguſt, 1778, the encampment was at Kingſbridge, where it occupied a very unhealthy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when the regiment moved from their ground in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of November, of one hundred caſes of intermitting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which were marked in the almanac, eighty were found to have commenced in the uſual period of invaſion; that is, in the ſecond and laſt quarter of the moon. This regiment embarked for Georgia in November, and remained there until the capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at York-town. The ſentence is concluded by this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "of this, however, I am certain, that even at times of the greateſt epidemic ſickneſs, when the connection was evidently weakeſt, the number of the ſick was generally doubled in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods approaching to new and full moon."</p>

               <p>The effects of the moon's influence upon the human body, may, in ſome degree, be accounted for, by a change in the qualities of the air, and not by any ſupernatural or incomprehenſible manner.</p>
               <p>The proportion of oxygene empyreal or vital air is encreaſed, and hydrogene or inflammable air dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed—firſt, by the winds that prevail at the periods, which unite, abſorb and carry off, an over-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of noxious vapours, generated by the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, warmth, and cloſeneſs of the atmoſphere in the intervals, ſo pernicious to animal and vegetable life: ſecondly, the rains: thirdly, thunder and lightning: fourthly, by riſing of the lakes and rivers, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a larger ſurface to abſorb and attract impure air: fifthly, by the increaſed perſpiration of vegetables, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbing impure, and giving out pure air: ſixthly, the influence of the light of the moon at night, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Dr. Prieſtley, who ſays, "vegetables don't give out pure air from the dark:"<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Wilſon, from experiments, ſays, "the moon-ſhine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens fruits, and encreaſes the growth of plants."</note>) and ſeventhly, by the exhilarity obſerved in people in health; as it is generally allowed, the more pure air, the more the ſpirits are raiſed.</p>
               <p>Of the bilious remitting, or yellow fever, of the year 1793, the firſt attacks, relapſes, and deaths, were more frequent at the periods, than during the intervals. This was obſerved of the plague of Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, by Dicerrerbraeck in the year 1636.</p>

A brother to this child was ſeized with this diſeaſe in the intervals, who had them very moderate, and recovered without the aid of a phyſician. At the periods, the lungs and throat are often moſt affected, the bloody puſtules ſometimes appear. The fever, from being an intermittent, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently degenerates into a continued type; and I have known the contagion, in two caſes, to lay dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſixteen days in the ſyſtem, and not become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive until the full moon. I had a patient, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the contagion on the beginning of the firſt quarter of the moon, and nine days after no ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the diſeaſe appeared; but two days before the moon filled, the arm was inflamed, a fever came on, and my patient received the infection.

On the 28th, as no more convicts had received the infection ſince we left England, we began to flatter ourſelves that the diſeaſe had run through all thoſe who had not had it: but I was ſurpriſed on the 29th and 30th, to find ſix or ſeven more attacked, all within the ſpace of twenty-four hours. As the weather was now more favourable than it had been, my ſurpriſe was encreaſed. On reflection, I could not diſcover any ſatisfactory reaſon for the ſudden re-appearance of the diſeaſe; having heard ſomething of lunar influence in fever and infection, I was induced to look into my almanack, when I found that the moon had changed about this time; and I likewiſe found, that, the firſt ten or twelve attacked, muſt have happened a month before."</p>

               <p>A coſtive habit, being peculiar to the periods, and a remote cauſe of haemorrhois, people, and more generally women of a plethoric and ſanguine habit, when the ſyſtem is more often affected in a general than partial manner, with the characteriſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034264_0017_0FFC3ED7973D1CA8"/>
of a pain in the head and rectum, are ſubject to firſt attacks and relapſes at the periods. On the ſixteenth of July, 1795, I was called to ſee two caſes of this diſeaſe, in the morning of which day, we had a new moon.</p>
               <p>As the return of the catamenia depends on the force of the uterine arteries, impelling the blood to their extremities, and this force is always conſiderably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed at the new and full moon, I never knew or heard of a woman, whoſe periodical diſcharge was not, in ſome degree, influenced by this planet. The moſt barbarous nations, and all antiquity, are of this opinion. Hippocrates, Galen and Dr. Mead has made ſome obſervations ſimilar to the above.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. E. Darwin in his Zoonomia, vol. i. page 498, ſays, "the periods of female menſtruation, are connected with lunar peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, to great exactneſs, in ſome inſtances even to a few hours!!"</note> In plethoric females this diſcharge ſometimes proceeds to exceſs, and produces a complaint, known by the name of menorrhagia.</p>
               <p>The amenorrhea uſually attacks females, a little after the time of puberty, and generally returns every new and full moon, with an exceſs of action, in both the arterial and venous ſyſtems, with a fever in the beginning; the face becomes pale, and then aſſumes a greeniſh, livid or yellow colour; the eyes are ſunk in their ſockets, with a blue circle round them; the lips are colourleſs, and the whole body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſwelled. In the cure of this affection, evacuants may be uſed with more ſafety at the periods, than in the intervals.</p>
               <p>Diſeaſes of pregnancy are apt to appear and return at the periods, perhaps from a diminiſhed proportion of oxygene in the atmoſphere; and may be relieved by the liberal uſe of the lancet.</p>
               <p>Parturition is often more difficult at the periods than in the intervals, and alſo in delicate conſtitutions. Large evacuations takes place at this time. Hence there is the greateſt poſſible danger. This I experienced in an amiable, delicate lady, in the month of Auguſt

1792, who enjoyed life only four hours after delivery.</p>
               <p>Weakly women, of lax ſolids, who have had many children, are often liable to an abortion at the new and full moon. Perhaps the reaſon why we find the ſame parents produce one child healthy and robuſt, and another ſickly, weakly, and delicate, is, that the former was born in the encreaſe, the latter in the decreaſe of the moon.<note n="*" place="bottom">The venereal orgaſm of birds and quadrupeds, ſeems to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, or return about the moſt powerful lunations at the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or autumnal equinoxes; but if it be diſappointed of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is ſaid to recur at monthly periods; in this reſpect reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the female catamenia, whence it is believed, women are more liable to become pregnant at or about the time of their catemenia, than at the intermediate times; and on this account, they are ſeldom much miſtaken in their reckoning of nine lunar periods from the laſt menſtruation. The inattention to this may, ſometimes, have been the cauſe of ſuppoſed barreneſs, and is therefore worth the obſervation of thoſe who wiſh to have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Darwin's Zoonomia, vol. i. p. 499.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall digreſs a moment, in order to corroborate this obſervation further, by a few facts taken from the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Firſt, I have often heard it ſaid, fattened meat killed near the full moon will not ſhrink from the bone nor decreaſe in weight, but will look full and plump when cooked, but if killed in the intervals, will do ſo; I would alſo obſerve here, that, animal food, killed at the periods, is rather more alkaleſcent and of more eaſy digeſtion, owing, perhaps, to the encreaſed circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blood in the animal. Second, young bees, if they lodge in the decreaſe of the moon, appear to produce little or no honey, and a number die; but if in the encreaſe, they commonly produce as much, if not more, than the old. Third, oyſters, crabs, lobſters and muſcles<note n="†" place="bottom">This obſervation is confirmed in Hughes's Natural Hiſtory of Barbadoes.</note> are more fat and plump at the full than new moon. Fourth, at the periods crabs often change their coats or ſhells, and clams, at thoſe times, moſt always change their beds, where they had remained ſunk during the winter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:034264_0019_0FFC3ED359B05AE0"/>From the vegetable kingdom, I ſhall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two, among many facts in my poſſeſſion. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make trees of any kind durable, cut them down on the day on which there is a new moon; the grain will be fine and devoid of ſap, but if deferred for a few days, the grain of the wood will be coarſe and full of juice. This is attended to by ſome of the planters of the ſouthern ſtates of America.<note n="*" place="bottom">Marſhall, in his Arbuſtum Americanum, ſpeaking of the oak rags, ſays, it may not be improper here, to make ſome remarks with reſpect to felling or cutting of timber. Long experience I think has ſufficiently aſcertained, that timber in the third and laſt quarter of the moon's age, is much more durable than when cut at any other time. That the moon materially affects timber, is a fact well known to thoſe who ſtrip bark for the uſe of tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is a fact ſufficiently well known, that timber whoſe bark has been ſeparated and pealed round the butt, if done in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the moon, retains its greenneſs often a conſiderable time, but if in the encreaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> withers in a much ſhorter time. From hence, I think, we may conclude, that the ſap of trees has a kind of monthly circulation, aſcending in the moon's decreaſe, but deſcending in the encreaſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The epidemic catarrh, of the fall 1789, and of the ſpring, 1790, appeared to be propagated a greater diſtance, affected a greater number of people, and was more univerſal within the eight days of the change and full moon. I have known whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and even different animals, attacked with it at the above periods. In many caſes, there was an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon afflux of fluids to the head, with a conſiderable diſcharge of blood from the noſe, and in ſome, the diſeaſe was attended with ſymptoms of pneumonia notha, coma and mania; when the pulſe was hard, fever continued, reſpiration laborious; perſons of both ſexes, between the age of eighteen and thirty ſix, of irritable habits, were moſt ſubject to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſymptoms at the periods.</p>
               <p>Firſt attacks and relapſes of the dyſentery, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attend the periods: the fever is remitting, ſometimes continued and inflammatory; a nauſea is a more frequent ſymptom at the periods, than in the intervals, from the excretion of a larger portion of bile in the primae viae: bleeding is only neceſſary, if at
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034264_0020_0FFC3ED062CE5EB0"/>
all, in our climate, to diminiſh the encreaſed action of the arterial ſyſtem, and vomits for the removal of the bile, which ſhould be perſiſted in, as long as the ſymptoms that required them continued.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the reaſon why apoplexy ſo frequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the periodical revolutions of this influential planet, is the calm that attends her, occaſioning a ſtagnation of the air and noxious exhalations from our earth; the winds that ſucceed purify this air: the ſudden change of the ſenſible and inſenſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this fluid, by producing indirect debility, which this diſeaſe is chiefly founded in, and which encreaſes the afflux of fluids in the arteries of the head, and produces diſtention, or more frequently effuſion, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troys the mobility, or energy of the nervous power in the brain. Hence a ſtagnation, and its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rupture, effuſion, and death. Of the many and numerous caſes which came under my notice, in this city, I ſhall mention in theſe obſervations but three. Friday, May 16, 1793, I viſited a young man, twenty-five years of age, who was ſeized with an apoplexy, which proved fatal in five minutes. On the twenty-ſecond of June, I ſaw another caſe, which alſo termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in death; and on the thirty-firſt of Dec. a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, aged fifty-three, was inſtantly carried off in the ſame manner: theſe caſes were within the periods of the moon. In Providence, Rhode-Iſland, on Monday morning, January thirteenth, 1794, died of an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic fit, Miſs B— R—, in the bloom of youth and health; having gone to bed the preceding even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, ſhe was found the next morning affected with this complaint: the moon was full on the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, at ten minutes paſt ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>That ſpecies of apoplexy formerly denominated ſanguineous, in which there is a plethoric ſtate of the veſſels of the head, attended with red face, laborious reſpiration, often comes on ſuddenly at the periods, with ſymptoms violent and fatal, eſpecially to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above fifty; whereas the ſerous apoplexy, with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034264_0021_0FFC3ECE1D69FFB0"/>
a defect of action ſometimes attacks in the intervals. Bleeding is moſt beneficial at the periods, from the carotic arteries or jugular veins, which ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our firſt attention; alſo ſhould be uſed to take off the irritation from the brain.</p>
               <p>The hydrocephalus internus frequently attacks full, robuſt, healthy, active and lively children at the periods: in the recent ſtate, there is an intollerance of light from the great ſenſibility of the eyes, which obliges me to favour Dr. Quinn's theory, delivered in his inaugural diſſertation, "that, it depends on an inflammation of the brain, and that the effuſion is the effect and not the cauſe." I have cured one caſe by bleeding.</p>
               <p>Periodical palſies often appear within the periods, (Piſo and Tulpius, ſpeaks of her bringing on periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal palſies,) which are cauſed by an overflow of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid bile in the ſtomach at this time, and which a puke ſometimes has cured.</p>
               <p>Women, and people of delicate conſtitutions, are ſometimes ſubject to ſyncope at the periodical revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of the moon, when the face has not that death-like appearance, but is florid, the eyes are troubled, and the mouth is ſhut; the cauſes of this diſeaſe are to be particularly avoided at this time; blood-letting is abſolutely neceſſary at the periods, a recumbent poſture and cold water thrown on the head and face ſucceeds here, Syncope often attends at the periods; in the recent ſtate of acute diſeaſes, it is by no means a favourable ſymptom. By attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lunar influence, I am enabled to prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with more certainty the return, iſſue, and cure of theſe diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Dyſpepſia is both ideopathic and ſymptomatic, whenever it attacks weak and delicate habits, at the periods. It is produced by various cauſes, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſecretion of bile, in the firſt paſſages, which act immediately on the ſtomach, or on it through the medium of the whole ſyſtem: the ſick head-ach
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034264_0022_0FFC3ECBD4246328"/>
in nine out of ten caſes, accompanies this diſeaſe at the periods; and in ſome caſes the circulation is ſo languid that the blood ſtagnates and the face becomes livid, ſwelled and has an unuſual appearance. As there is always an uneaſineſs in this organ, an emetic is the cure, with an attention to the relation of aliments.</p>
               <p>Convulſions often attack and return at the new and full moon, in middle-aged robuſt men, rather than women or old people: it is no uncommon diſeaſe for children to have at the periods<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Pitcairne alſo ſpeaks of a "violent convulſion of the arm returning periodically twice a year, viz. in March and Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, at full moon near the vernal and autumnal equinoxes."</note>. Acrid matters, as bile in the alimentary canal, is the moſt frequent cauſe of it in them. There is often a conſiderable action of the nervous ſyſtem at the periods, which is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down by bleeding, vomits and cold air. In May 1793, I was called to ſee a child five years old, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in convulſions, for the firſt time, within the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods. This child was bled three times before ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. Fits at the beginning and cloſe of fevers, and pregnant women, at the periods, are unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>Strong people, men and children delicately educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are often ſubject to firſt attacks and relapſes of epilepſy within the periods, the paroxyſms are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with highly inflammatory ſymptoms, which generally continue thro' life. The moon, ſays Galen, governs the periods of epileptic caſes, which is alſo confirmed by Drs. Pitcairne, Tyſon, of Bethlehem hoſpital, and the celebrated Mead.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. John Leake on the diſeaſes of the viſcera, page 400, ſays "many inſtances might here be brought to ſhow the remarkable effects of lunar influence in diſeaſes of the brain and nerves. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptic fits moſt frequently occur at the new and full moon; and madmen are then more violently affected with frantic ravings."</note> There are many occaſional cauſes of epilepſy; two of which I ſhall mention, being the moſt frequent by the moon's in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluence at the periods; firſt, the periodical occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al recurrence of the plethoric ſtate of the brain, or an over-diſtention of the blood-veſſels of that organ,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034264_0023_0FFC3ECA4C911E08"/>
which is favourable to epilepſy; and the retention of acrid matter in the alimentary canal, occaſioned by the encreaſed ſecretion of bile, together with a coſtive habit. Among many, ſhall notice but three caſes. S— H—, ſtone cutter, November 18th, 1793, the moon being full, was ſeized with two paroxyſms by ten o'clock in the morning. He told me his fits always returned within the periods. Miſs S— A—, aged nineteen, in the year 1785, was engaged to be married to a gentleman from Maryland, who diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing her by marrying another lady, it occaſioned an indiſpoſition in the former lady, in which epileptic fits appeared, and continued after her recovery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned periodically within the periods of the moon until her death, in the beginning of 1795. Mrs. W—, whoſe fits were brought on by the loſs of an only brother, were continued near twelve years, and were governed by lunar influence. Theſe obſervations were made from a long perſonal acquaintance with the above ladies<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Darwin ſays, "the periods of hemicrania and of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful epilepſy, are liable to obey lunar periods both in their diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal returns, and in their greater periods of weeks, but are alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by other exciting cauſes."</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſpaſmodic ſpecies of the aſthma, attended with an excels of action in the veſſels of the lungs, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurs at the periods; which Van Helmont and Sir John Floyer, have obſerved:<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. John Leake, on diſeaſes of women, vol. i. page 384, ſays, the changes of air at the new and full moon, eſpecially a little before the vernal and autumnal equinoxes have conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the health of all animals. At this time, ſtorms and tempeſts generally prevail; the air is rendered too light, and being inſufficient to blow up the lungs, the blood cannot paſs too freely through them. Hence difficulty of breathing and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation of the heart, attended with ſleepineſs and oppreſſion.</note> Bleeding is proper here; alſo fixed air breathed into the lungs, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a remedy in this ſpecies of this diſeaſe within the periods.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved that coſtiveneſs, and an encreaſed ſecretion of bile in the alimentary canal, to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:034264_0024_0FFC3EC80452B850"/>
at the periods; now colic is generally produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by coſtiveneſs, and bile is ſuppoſed, by Dr. Quere, of Jamaica, to be a frequent cauſe of this complaint. Hence perſons are moſt liable to firſt attacks and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes of colic, accompanied with exceſs of action in the muſcular fibres of the alimentary canal. On Wedneſday, May 14th, 1794, being within the peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of the moon, I ſaw near ſix caſes of the bilious colic; obſerving at the ſame time a coſtive habit, and the encreaſed ſecretion of bile, to be the effects of the moon's influence. One of theſe caſes was a girl, ten years old. I obſerved it for a few <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>Single and married women, of a ſanguine ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoric habit, between the age of puberty and thirty-five, are moſt frequently attacked with hiſteria with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the periods of the moon; when the face is preternaturally fluſhed, and an exceſs of action of the arterial ſyſtem: Auguſt the 21ſt, 1793, at ten o'clock, A.
