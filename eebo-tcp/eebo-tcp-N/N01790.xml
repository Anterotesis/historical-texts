            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE open Contempt that is put upon revealed Religion by ſome, while they prefer Mans corrupt reaſon before it, and advance the Oracles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as they call them, above the Oracles of GOD, as a more Infallible rule of Humane Practice; makes it the neceſſary duty of all that have a due regard to the Honour of GOD, and the Credit of our holy Religion, that they evidence, upon all occaſions, a high and honourable eſteem of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002122_0003_0FBC201E2EB6F430"/>
AND we cannot better, I am perſwaded, Manifeſt the great value we put upon thoſe Sacred Records, than by our thankfulneſs for them, our earneſt endeavours to acquaint our ſelves with them, by the diligent Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all Means that GOD hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in order there-unto, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a frequent, reverent and attentive Reading &amp; Hearing of them Read; both in Publick and Private; and by regulating our Faith and Practice by them, as the Infallible Rule of both.</p>
            <p>THE Publick Reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures hath been, I think, the general Practice of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> not only under the <hi>Law,</hi> but under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> alſo, from the days of CHRIST, and His Apoſtles, to our Times; and why this Practice ſhould be diſcontinued by any of the Diſciples of the bleſſed JESUS, I ſee no reaſon: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it cannot be alleged to be any part of our Reformation from <hi>Popiſh Superſtition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the enſuing Diſcourſe ſhall, thro' the bleſſing of GOD upon it, be made a Mean to ſtir up any of better parts, and greater abilities, to Examine this Matter Impartially,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002122_0004_0FBC201FA6125680"/>and ſet it in a clearer light; ſo that the Practice of the Reading of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> in our Publick Aſſemblies, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived among us, I ſhall rejoyce in it.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that the performance is mean, and bears no juſt proportion to the dignity of the Subject, therein handled; and all the Apology I ſhall make for it is, That when I ſtudied the Sermon, I had no thoughts that ever it ſhould be made more Publick, than the Preaching of it in a ſmall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, ſhould make it. But after I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered it in Publick, a Friend of mine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the peruſing of my Notes, which I made no difficulty to grant him; and he ſhewed them to others, and ſome of thoſe, whoſe judgment I highly value and eſteem, being of Opinion that the making the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe Publick may be of ſome uſe: I have ſubmitted to their judgment, tho' I know it muſt appear under ſome diſadvantages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your honour,</hi> I chearfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Opportunity to offer you my grateful acknowledgments for all the favours and marks of reſpect which you have been pleaſed to confer upon me, and particularly upon my Arrival in this Country with my Family.</p>

THAT GOD may ſignally bleſs your Honour with all needful Bleſſings; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue you long a uſeful Inſtrument of the advancement of His own Glory, and of the good and welfare of your Country; and that after you ſhall have ſerved your own Generation by the will of GOD, you may fall aſleep in the LORD, our Exalted SAVIOUR, is the ſincere Prayer</p>

            <p>THEY that believe that there is a GOD; muſt acknowledge that He is to be worſhipped by His Reaſonable Intelligent Creatures.</p>
            <p>THE Notion we have of the glorious GOD, as the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> of all things; neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily leads us to Conceive of Him, as the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002122_0007_0FBC202434752360"/>
               <hi>Chief Good;</hi> and that every thing in the Creatures, that doth any way contribute to their Safety, Comfort, or Uſefulneſs; muſt be derived from Him.</p>
            <p>AND the Idea we have of GOD as a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infinitely and Tranſcendently Excellent in Himſelf; and Independent upon all other Beings; and that all His Creatures do intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend upon Him, in their Beings and Operations; leads us to Conceive of Him, as the Supreme Governour of the World, and that all His reaſonable Creatures ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to offer up to Him, ſuch Service as is agreeable to His own Nature, and to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity that He has given them.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe Conſiderations of GOD, it naturally follows, that it belongs unto Him only to give Rules and Directions how He will be worſhipped by His Creatures: and that all ways of worſhip, that are not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules and Directions which He hath given concerning it; muſt be <hi>diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> to Him, and <hi>unprofitable</hi> to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>AND I think, that Proteſtants are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agreed in this, that the Holy Scriptures contain the Revelations of GOD's Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning His own Worſhip, both as to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Manner of it: and therefore when any Queſtion ariſes among them, relating to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002122_0008_0FBC2025AE33AAD0"/>the Worſhip of GOD; they muſt have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Revealed Will of GOD, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Scriptures, for the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it; as that alone, which may be ſafely depended upon.</p>
            <p>THE Worſhip that the LORD requires of His People, is either <hi>Internal,</hi> or <hi>External,</hi> anſwerable to the two principal parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Man Conſiſts, <hi>viz. Soul</hi> and <hi>Body.</hi> Internal religious Worſhip conſiſts in the Soul's being rightly affected towards GOD the object of divine Worſhip. When the mind is Inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Supernatural Knowledge whereby we are inabled to conceive of GOD, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſcoveries He hath given of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and when He is feared, &amp; loved above all; when He is ſubmitted unto <hi>in all things,</hi> truſted unto, and depended upon <hi>at all times;</hi> and when we entertain a deep and abiding ſenſe of His Goodneſs, in His dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our ſelves, and others. <hi>External</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip conſiſts of ſuch words, actions, geſtures, duties and performances as ſerve to ſignifie and declare the <hi>Inward</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of our Soul to GOD; and our being ſuitably affected towards Him; and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our entertaining becoming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Him, and to promote and increaſe our Eſteem of Him, and ſubjection to Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002122_0009_0FBC20271DABFA50"/>
THE External Worſhip due to GOD by Man, is either <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>Publick.</hi> Private, is that religious Worſhip which the LORD'S People offer up to GOD Privately, either in their Families, or by themſelves alone. Publick, is that religious Worſhip that the LORD's People offer to GOD Publickly, whereby they do Publickly and Solemnly declare their ſubjection to GOD, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Him.</p>
            <p>IN the words we have now read, we have one of thoſe pieces of <hi>External</hi> religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which GOD requires His People to offer up to Him, in their Publick Aſſemblies; <hi>viz. The Reading of the Holy Scriptures;</hi> and all ranks of Perſons are Commanded to hearken thereunto, Men, Women, Children, and Strangers; all muſt reverently attend upon this part of Divine Worſhip.</p>
            <p>THE Doctrine that falls under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conſideration, is,</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>THAT the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the bearing of them Read, is a part of that Worſhip which GOD requires of His People, in their Publick Religious Aſſemblies.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002122_0010_0FBC202BFA52FC08"/>
IN proſecuting this Doctrine, I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the following Method:</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) I ſhall endeavour to ſhow that the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the hearing of them read, is a part of GOD's Publick Worſhip.</item>
               <item>(2) I ſhall give ſome account how this part of GOD's Worſhip ſhould be performed by His People.</item>
               <item>(3) I ſhall draw ſome Practical Inferences from the whole.</item>
            </list>
            <p>AS to the firſt of theſe, that the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, and the hearing of them read, is a part of GOD's Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, will appear, if we conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT the LORD doth very expreſsly require the Reading and hearing of His Word, as a part of His Publick Worſhip.</hi> In the Text now under Conſideration, <hi>When all Iſrael come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the Place which he ſhall chuſe: thou ſhalt read this law before all Iſrael, in their hearing. Gather the people together, Men, Women, and Children, and thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the Lord your GOD, and obſerve to do all the words of this law.</hi> This Command is ſo expreſs, plain, and full, for the Publick Reading of the Holy Scriptures, that all who take the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002122_0011_0FBC202EDDD77720"/>Will of GOD for the Rule of their performances, and acknowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament, to be of equal authority with thoſe of the <hi>New;</hi> muſt alſo own their obligation to the performance of this, as a part of GOD's Publick Worſhip; if they duely conſider the matter: for all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Precepts, given to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the Law are as binding upon us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as they were upon them. Neither can it be alleged, with any ſhew of Reaſon, that this is a <hi>Ceremonial</hi> or <hi>Temporary</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, which did concern the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, under the former diſpenſation only; ſeeing the end of the Command, and the reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it, by the Spirit of GOD, to inforce it, concern <hi>all the profeſſed People of GOD,</hi> to the end of the World, as much as they did the <hi>Jews,</hi> under the Law. The Reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this Command are two, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1) THOU ſhalt read this Law before all Iſrael in their hearing, <hi>That they may hear and ſcarn,</hi> i. e. That they may ſo hear as to learn. We muſt ſtudy ſo to read and hear the Word of GOD, that we may underſtand the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our holy religion out of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Diſcoveries He hath given of them in His word. We muſt read and hear the Scriptures that we may learn what is our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002122_0012_0FBC203020081A90"/>duty, towards GOD, towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and towards our ſelves. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt be read &amp; heard, that the LORDS People may learn what they are to expect at the hand of GOD; provided they ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Conſtant, and faithful in their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Him: and what they have to fear, if they neglect their duty, and tranſgreſs His Law.</p>
            <p>(2) THE Law muſt be read before all Iſrael, <hi>That they may hear and fear the LORD their GOD,</hi> i. e. That they may Worſhip and Serve the LORD, after an acceptable manner. The LORD will have His People to learn their Obedience to Him, out of His Own Word: for the Revealed Will of GOD, contains the Rule and Meaſure of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Obedience which we owe unto Him: therefore it is added, <hi>That they may obſerve to do all the words of this Law:</hi> i. e. that they may obſerve to do every thing that the Law commands to be done.</p>
            <p>NOW theſe are the things that <hi>we</hi> have as much need to learn, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had; and are as much obliged to do, as they were: and therefore ſeeing the Reading, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the holy Scriptures, in our Publick religious Aſſemblies, is a mean appointed by GOD to theſe Important purpoſes; it ought
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002122_0013_0FBC2031A08F4808"/>not to be neglected by us. And the Reaſons of GOD's Command, being the ſame to us, that they were to the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law; the Command it ſelf muſt oblige us, as much as it did them. And that it was the Will of GOD, when He firſt gave this Law to His People, that this Ordinance ſhould be kept up in His Church, in all ſucceeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that it ſhould be made a part of their ſtated Publick Worſhip every Sabbath-day, ſeems to be clearly intimated in theſe words in the 13th verſe. <hi>That their Children which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the Land, whither ye go over Jordan to poſſeſs it.</hi> And thus the pious <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law, did underſtand this Precept, ſeeing they made the Publick Reading of the Law and the Prophets, always a part of their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-days worſhip, Of which <hi>Ainſworth</hi> out of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors gives us the following account, in his Annotations on <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.
<q>Theſe three Letters in the Hebrew Bibles do ſignifie the <hi>Paraſha,</hi> or great Section of Moſes Law, which was a Lecture on the Sabbath-day, read in the Jews Synagogues, as is obſerved, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. to which was added a Lecture out of the Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.15. And the firſt Paragraph or Section
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002122_0014_0FBC2033414DA610"/>(which is from the Creation hitherto) they call <hi>Bereſhith,</hi> i. e. in the beginning. The ſecond, which reacheth to the XII. Chapter, they call <hi>Noe;</hi> and ſo the reſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There are in all, 54 Sections in the Law, which they read in the 52. Sabbaths, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two of the ſhorteſt twice together; that the whole may be finiſhed in a Years ſpace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Here the Jewiſh Doctors write thus. <hi>It is a Common Cuſtom, throughout all Iſrael, that they finiſh wholly the</hi> (reading of the) <hi>Law in one Year: beginning in the Sabbath, which is after the feaſt of Tabernacles, at the firſt Section of Geneſis: In the ſecond Sabbath,</hi> at, <hi>Theſe are the Generations</hi> of <hi>Noe. In the third,</hi> at, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Abram,</hi> Gen. 12.1. <hi>So they read and go on in this order, till they have ended the Law,</hi> at <hi>the feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi>
               </q> So far he.</p>
            <p>THAT this was the continued practice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> even in CHRIST, and His A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles time, is evident from ſeveral paſſages in the New-Teſtament. As that in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. <hi>For Moſes of old, hath in every City them that Preach him, being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath-day.</hi> Here we may obſerve, (1) That the <hi>Reading</hi> of the holy Scriptures, is called, by the Inſpired Hiſtorian, <hi>Preaching.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002122_0015_0FBC2034CD282DE8"/>(2) That the Practice of Reading the holy Scriptures in their Synagogues, was, by the <hi>Jews</hi> repeated every Sabbath-day; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, was a part of their ſtated Publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>IT is recorded alſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.14. <hi>That when they;</hi> viz. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Piſidia, and went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and ſat down; And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue ſent unto them, ſaying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of Exhortation to the People, ſay on.</hi> Here we may obſerve, (1) That the reading of the Law and the Prophets was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended upon by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as a part of GOD's Publick Worſhip; ſeeing it was performed by them, in their Synagogue, the Place of GOD's Publick Worſhip; and on the Sabbath-day. (2) That this Reading of the Law and the Prophets did precede Exhortation, (or that which we commonly call Preaching) and that it was diſtinct from it. (3) That the Apoſtles of our Lord JESUS CHRIST did attend the Reading of the Law and the Prophets, as a part of GOD's Publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>AND our Saviour alſo Himſelf did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and approve this Reading of the holy Scriptures, in Publick, as a part of GOD's
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002122_0016_0FBC203626D4A898"/>Worſhip, by His frequent attending upon it; and by His practiſing of it Himſelf. We are informed by the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> Luk. 4.16, 17. <hi>That he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up: and as his cuſtom was, he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue on the Sabbath-day, and ſtood up for to Read.</hi> Here we may obſerve, (1) That it was our Saviours <hi>Cuſtom</hi> to attend the Publick Worſhip of GOD, as performed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogue on the Sabbath-day; where the Reading of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets was a conſiderable part of that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. (2) That our Saviour did Read the holy Scriptures himſelf, as a part of GOD's Publick Worſhip, and that it was His Cuſtom ſo to do; which no doubt is recorded for our Inſtruction and Imitation.</p>
            <p>AND from the Practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogues in making the Reading of the Scriptures a part of their ſtated Publick Worſhip, the like order was brought into the Chriſtian Church; and the Reading of the Scriptures is made part of the Office of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, as it had been of the Prieſts and Levites under the Law. <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded by the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. <hi>To give attendance to Reading, as well as to Exhortation and Doctrine.</hi> Theſe Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> have been conſidered as a
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002122_0017_0FBC2037D9F69F28"/>Directory, given by the Spirit of GOD, to theſe two Evangeliſts, how they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themſelves in the Houſe of GOD; and in them, to all Goſpel-Miniſters in all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages of the Church; and as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and Doctrine, which the Evangeliſt here is directed to give attendance unto, are of a Publick Nature; ſo the Reading poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at, ſeems alſo to be. The thing he was to read, no doubt, was the holy Scriptures; and the Reading it ſelf a Publick act of his ſacred Office, &amp; cannot be reſtricted to his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Studies, which he was to follow in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his being fitted &amp; prepared for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Work.</p>
            <p>THE inſpired writings alſo of the Apoſtles were Commanded to be Read by Chriſtians, in their Publick religious Aſſemblies. It is Commanded by the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.16. <hi>When this Epiſtle is read amongſt you, Cauſe that it be read alſo in the Church of the Laodiceans; and that ye alſo read the Epiſtle from Laodicea.</hi> The Apoſtle gives a very ſolemn Charge to the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>I charge you by the Lord that this Epiſtle be read unto all the holy Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND it is highly probable that what was enjoyned theſe Churches mentioned, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from, and practiſed by all the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002122_0018_0FBC203A2DB73770"/>Churches, to whom the Apoſtle wrote. And this will appear, if we conſider, (1) That the Apoſtolical Epiſtles ſent to particular Churches, are directed to them as a Society. (2) The Doctrines inſiſted upon in theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles are of a Publick Nature, and concern all the Members of the Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all had a right to be acquainted with them.</p>
            <p>THIS Publick Reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was appointed by GOD as a mean for the preſerving the Knowledge of Himſelf among His People, &amp; to ſtir them up to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their Obedience to Him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenever this came to be neglected, the LORD's People did quickly ſink into Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry &amp; Immorality. In the wicked Reigns of <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Amon</hi> his Son, it ſeems the book of the Law of GOD was loſt; which was found by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> while they were repairing and cleanſing the Temple. And in theſe two Reigns the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church was degenerated to an aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing degree. And the moſt glorious Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations that were ſet on foot in that Church, were begun, and carried on, by reſtoring this Ordinance. It is recorded of King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> that pious Prince and great Reformer, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.29. <hi>Then the King ſent, and gathered
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002122_0019_0FBC203B6FDFA168"/>all the Eldors of Judah, and Jeruſalem, and the King went up into the houſe of the Lord, and all the men of Judah, and Inhabitants of Jeruſalem. And the Prieſts, and the Levites, and all the People great and ſmall; and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the Covenant, that was found in the houſe of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſame Method was followed by <hi>Ezra</hi> the Prieſt, in his pious endeavours towards the carrying on a univerſal Reformation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the LORD's People, after their return from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, as is recorded, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.2, 3. <hi>And Ezra the Prieſt brought the Law before the Congregation, both of men and women, and all that could hear with underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; upon the firſt day of the ſecond Month and he read therein, before the Street, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the water gate, from the Morning, until mid-day, before the men, and the women, and all thoſe that could underſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we have ſeen that the Reading and Hearing of the holy Scriptures Read, in the Publick Aſſemblies of GOD's People, hath been expreſsly commanded by GOD Himſelf, both in the Old and New-Teſtaments: And that this Publick Reading, and hearing of the Scriptures, hath been practiſed by the godly, both under the <hi>Law,</hi> and under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> as a ſtated part of GOD's Publick Worſhip,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002122_0020_0FBC20400E0F4DE0"/>and that CHRIST Himſelf and His holy Apoſtles, did countenance and approve of it, both by their being frequently preſent at it, and by their own practice.</p>
            <p>AND it is highly reaſonable that the LORD's People ſhould continue the practice of Reading the holy Scriptures in their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religious Aſſemblies, not only becauſe GOD hath expreſsly commanded it, which indeed ſhould have the moſt powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us, in all our undertakings &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; but alſo becauſe of the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able advantages which we may expect from it. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>That the Scriptures are able to make a man wiſe to Salvation thro' faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE holy Scriptures may be conſidered as an Epiſtle ſent down from Heaven, by GOD Himſelf, to the Children of Men here below, containing in it, a plain and full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of all the Myſteries of our holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and a Declaration of thoſe Divine Truths which muſt be known and firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by us, in order to Salvation: and the Infallible Rules by which our Lives and Practices muſt be regulated: And the ſure Charter by which we hold our Title to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to all the valuable Bleſſings &amp; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges made over to us, in the Goſpel-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002122_0021_0FBC2041D4C81950"/>And indeed, the moſt excellent, uſeful, and edifying Sermons that can be Preach'd, are ſo, only as they ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the holy Scriptures, and to ſtir up Men to comply with the Will of GOD revealed in them; and to follow the Directions which GOD hath given us in His Word. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our acquainting our ſelves with theſe bleſſed Records, by the diligent Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every mean that the LORD is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us, in order there-unto; muſt be both our <hi>Duty</hi> and our <hi>Intereſt;</hi> of which, frequent Reading, and hearing of them Read, both in Publick and Private, is one, and perhaps, as proper, and as frequently bleſſed of GOD, as any. What is ſaid concerning the Book of Revelation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this Prophecy, and keep thoſe things that are written therein,</hi> holds true of all the reſt of the Books of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>THE holy Scriptures, in all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, are plain and eaſy to be underſtood, and are as well-accommodated to humane weakneſs, as the diſcourſes of the moſt Celebrated Preachers ordinarily are, or indeed can be: and therefore the Reading of them to a Publick and vulgar Auditory, muſt be as likely to promove a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002122_0022_0FBC2042EE95A0F0"/>Peoples Inſtruction and Edification, as Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; eſpecially conſidering that it is a mean of GOD's own appointment, in order to this end, as well as that. And it looks too like our putting a ſlight upon the holy Scriptures, and our being too regardleſs of GOD Himſelf, the Author of them, when we thruſt the Reading of them out of our Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick religious Aſſemblies: and that even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the LORD hath ſo plainly ſignified His Will to us, that He would have the Publick Reading of His Word continued among His People, and practiſed by them, as a part of His Publick Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. IF it be objected againſt the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures, that Bibles are now plenty, &amp; moſt of Chriſtian Families are well ſtored with them, and the LORD'S People are, almoſt univerſally, capable of reading them in Private; and therefore our Reading them in Publick, is needleſs.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT tho' Bibles are plenty, and moſt of Chriſtian Families are well ſtored with them, and the LORD'S People are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally capable of reading them; which is a Mercy that ſhould be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by us, with all Thankfulneſs: yet we have no aſſurance that they do univerſally do
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002122_0023_0FBC204474ABCF78"/>ſo, or even that the greater part of them make Conſcience of the doing of it, either by themſelves, or in their Families; tho' this be their duty, and they Sin if they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE LORD hath Commanded the Reading of His Word in <hi>Publick,</hi> as a part of His own Worſhip; and therefore our <hi>Private</hi> reading of it, how diligent ſo ever we may be therein; can never free us from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this Command. <hi>This ought to be done, and the other not left undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE LORD'S People may warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expect a ſpecial Bleſſing upon their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing the Scriptures in Publick, beyond and above, what they can expect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Private reading of them, eſpecially when the Publick Reading of them is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglected: for the LORD hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.23. <hi>In all Places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and bleſs thee.</hi> When we make Conſcience of attending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the LORD in His own Ordinances, Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Appointments, to which He has annexed His Promiſes; we may, with ſome degree of Conſidence, hope that the Spirit of GOD will concur to the making of them effectual to the promoting and carrying on our Edification and Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002122_0024_0FBC2045E9D895E0"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. IF it be alleged, that the Publick Reading of the Scriptures would conſume much time, which otherwiſe might be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to greater advantage. I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT ſeeing the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures is GOD's own Ordinance, Time muſt be allowed for it. If GOD has Commanded His People to Read the holy Scriptures in Publick, that they may learn to Fear Him; it muſt be great preſumption and undutifulneſs in them, to think or ſay that it is either needleſs, or that it is not a proper mean for reaching the end we propoſe to our ſelves therein, and therefore that it Deſerves not Time to be ſpent in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT muſt be a putting ſome degree of Contempt upon the holy Scriptures, to think or ſay that it is not worth while to ſpend Time in the Publick Reading of them. They that make this objection againſt the Publick Reading of the Scriptures, are not likely to ſpend much Time in the Private Reading of them; ſeeing they have ſo low an eſteem of them. They that can ſay with holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.97. <hi>O how love I thy Law! It is my meditation all the day:</hi> will not begrudge the Time that is neceſſarily ſpent in the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of proper means, in order to their being more throughly and univerſally acquainted with it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002122_0025_0FBC204AD613F658"/>
BUT ſeeing it is generally acknowledged by Chriſtians, that the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures is a duty which GOD hath enjoyned His People the performance of, and that the far greater part of profeſſed Chriſtians do actually practiſe it, I ſhall not, at preſent inſiſt any longer in the proof of it, but proceed to the ſecond general Head, Which is to Inquire, How this part of GOD's Publick Worſhip ought to be performed by the LORD'S People? And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT ought, without doubt, to be performed with much Reverence &amp; Solemnity.</hi> Thus did the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> attend upon it. It is recorded in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. That our Saviour <hi>ſtood up,</hi> when He addreſſed Himſelf to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures, as an evidence, no doubt, of the reverent regard He had to theſe Sacred Records, and that He might Inſtruct us by His holy Example. We are informed, <hi>Neb. 8.5. And Ezra opened the book in the ſight of all the people; (for he was above all the people) and when he opened it, all the people ſtood up.</hi> And indeed it is highly reaſonable, that this part of GOD's Publick Worſhip ſhould be attended by His People with holy fear and reverence, ſeeing herein GOD ſpeaks to us in a more Immediate way; and that about matters of the greateſt Importance.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002122_0026_0FBC204BDF5D8698"/>If reverence be due when we ſpeak more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to GOD, as in Prayer, It muſt be very becoming &amp; neceſſary, when He ſpeaks to us.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Jews</hi> before they ingaged in this part of GOD's Publick Worſhip, did addreſs themſelves to GOD, whoſe Word they were about to Read, in ſolemn Prayer. It is ſaid in <hi>Neb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>And Ezra bleſſed the Lord, the great God, and all the People anſwered, Amen, amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their beads and worſhipped the Lord, with their faces to the ground.</hi> And it was uſual with them alſo to conclude the Publick Reading of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>w, with ſolemn Prayer: As <hi>Ainſworth</hi> out of the Jewiſh Doctors, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, upon the Text now under our Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE holy Scriptures ought to be Read and Heard, by the Lord's People, with much Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and Attention, with a heart prepared, and very deſirous to Learn and Underſtand the mind of GOD held ſorth to us in His Word.</hi> When the great GOD ſpeaks, Careleſneſs and Indifferency in us, is very unbecoming, and unſuitable. It is recorded in <hi>Neb.</hi> 8.3. <hi>And he read therein before the ſtreet that was before the water gate, from the morning until mid-day, before the men, and the women, and thoſe that could underſtand; and the ears of all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002122_0027_0FBC204DA6000AE8"/>the People were Attentive unto the book of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>THE holy Scriptures ought ſo to be Read, that they may be Underſtood by the People, before whom they are read.</hi> The end of this Publick Reading is, that the People may learn to fear the LORD; and therefore they are ſo to be read, that this end may be effectually reached. They are therefore to be Read in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage wherewith the People are acquainted: and the difficulties that may occur in our Reading, ought to be cleared to the capacity of the Hearers. And ſuch obſervations made upon what we Read, and ſuch Inferences drawn from it, as may contribute moſt effectually, to it's being put in practice. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this Method, it is obſerved in <hi>Neb.</hi> 8.8. <hi>So they read in the book, in the law of the Lord diſtinctly, and gave the ſence, and cauſed them to underſtand the reading.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>THE holy Scriptures ſhou'd be Read, by the LORD's People, in their Publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, Orderly.</hi> What was practiced by the Jewiſh Church, with reſpect here-unto, we have ſeen already; they began at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Old Teſtament, in the Sabbath after the feaſt of Tabernacles; and ſo read the whole over in order in the ſpace of a Year. This they did no doubt, that the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002122_0028_0FBC204EE14FF440"/>People might be acquainted, with the <hi>whole</hi> revealed Will of GOD. There is no part of holy Scripture unneceſſary; no part of it is unprofitable; it is all uſeful, edifying, and inſtructive: and therefore no part of it is to be paſſed over in our Reading; no part ſhould be omitted: we are told, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed, unto all good works.</hi> The Command of GOD to His People is, that His Law be Read in their Publick Aſſemblies; and the deſign of the Command cannot be fully anſwered by them, if any part of it be omitted in their Publick Reading of it. It is obſerved of <hi>Joſhua</hi> to his Commendation, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 8.35. <hi>That there was not a word of all that Moſes command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which Joſhua read not, before all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Iſrael, with the Women, and little Ones, and the Strangers that were converſant among them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE have this Reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in <hi>Order,</hi> recommended to us by the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> in their Directory for Publick Worſhip, in theſe words;
<q>It is requiſite that all the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal books, be read over in Order, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002122_0029_0FBC20505D24CCD8"/>the People may be better acquainted with the whole body of Scriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE LORD hath not determined in His Word, how much of the holy Scriptures ſhould be Read at one time by His People, in their Publick Aſſemblies; that ſeems to be left to Chriſtian prudence to determine. The whole revealed Will of GOD muſt be Read; and therefore it ſhould be Read in ſuch Portions, that the LORD's People who attend upon this Publick Reading, may be acquainted with the whole counſel of GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Publick</hi> Reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth by no means, free the LORD'S People from the <hi>Private</hi> Reading of them: GOD hath Commanded both, and therefore both muſt be made Conſcience of by all that would approve themſelves to GOD. As to the Private Reading of the Scriptures, we have the following direction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thy peart and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them, when thou ſitteſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up. And thou ſhalt bind them for a ſign upon thy band: and they ſhall be as frontles between thine eyes. And thou ſhalt write
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002122_0030_0FBC20540C2D1890"/>them upon the poſts of thine houſe, and on thy gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>The APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>HENCE we may infer, That it muſt be Culpable in any who profeſs themſelves to be the LORD's People, to live in the neglect of the Publick Reading of the holy Scriptures in their Religious Aſſemblies, as a part of GOD's Worſhip;</hi> upon what pretence ſoever this may be done, ſeeing we have GOD's expreſs Command for the doing of it, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of CHRIST and His Apoſtles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, for our Imitation therein.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be ſuppoſed that our Reading a verſe or two for a Text, on the LORDS day, or a few verſes quoted by us, in the courſe of our Sermons, for the Confirmation and Illuſtration of the Doctrine we undertake to explain and apply to our hearers; can be any tolerable anſwering of the deſign of this Command; ſeeing it is certain that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the People hear out of the holy Scriptures this way, they may remain great Strangers to no ſmall part of GOD's revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Will.</p>
               <p>AND the diligence of ſome, in Reading the Scriptures in <hi>Private</hi> (for I do not take this to be univerſally practiſed by the LORD's
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002122_0031_0FBC20551A7715E0"/>profeſſed People) can no way ſatisfie for our neglecting to Read them in <hi>Publick.</hi> GOD's Commands ſhould be obeyed by all that have ſubjected themſelves to His Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It would he very undutiful in any of the LORD'S Servants, when He Commands them to Read His Word in <hi>Publick,</hi> to anſwer, No. there is no need of our doing ſo, we can Read it in <hi>Private</hi> to as much advantage. This would be to arraign the Wiſdom of GOD as defective, in appointing a thing to be done by His People, and that in His own Worſhip, that is unprofitable and needleſs, and a calling in queſtion His Authority over us. It belongs to Him to give Direction how He will be worſhipped and ſerved by His Subjects &amp; Servants, and He doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that any of His Commands be debated by them. It is our duty to Obey GOD; and not preſcribe to Him. It is without doubt, the neceſſary duty of all, who have any true zeal for the Glory of GOD, and the credit of Religion, that they manifeſt an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble regard to the holy Scriptures, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring publickly &amp; practically, that they look upon them as the Infallible Rule of faith and practice, at a time when all revealed Religion is decry'd by many; and whole volumes written againſt it by Men who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002122_0032_0FBC205671E90DC8"/>to a greater ſhare of underſtanding and penetration than others. Surely it muſt be our duty to do what we can towards the ſtopping the awful progreſs of the preſent prevailing Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THEY that live in the allowed Omiſſion of this part of GOD's Publick Worſhip, becauſe they do not look upon it as any part of their duty; are hence exhorted to allow this matter a Serious and Impartial Examination.</hi> You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe acquit your ſelves of too great a degree of negligence about the Worſhip of GOD. It is very reaſonable that when we are Charged as guilty of a culpable Omiſſion in any part of our practice; eſpecially in the Worſhip of GOD; that we examine and try whether the Charge be juſt and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or not. And this matter, as all others relating to the Worſhip of GOD, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the revealed Will of GOD: The Rules &amp; Directions GOD hath given us, how He will be worſhipped and ſerved by His People, muſt be carefully Inquired into.</p>
               <p>WE muſt, by no means, make the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> and uſage of thoſe we live among, the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard by which this is to be tryed; ſeeing the prevailing Cuſtom of the Places Men live in, doth too often miſlead them in point of Practice. Neither is this matter to be tryed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002122_0033_0FBC2057DCB3B7A0"/>by the <hi>example of Men,</hi> though otherwiſe great and good; ſeeing the beſt may err, and therefore are to be followed no further than they have followed CHRIST, and have conformed themſelves to the Rules of the Goſpel. Here therefore we would propoſe ſuch Queſtions as theſe to our ſelves, to be fairly debated by us.</p>
               <p>QUEST. 1. <hi>IS the Reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures a duty that the LORD hath commanded His People to perform in their Religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, as a part of His Publick Worſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>IS that Law whereby GOD hath ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly Commanded the Publick Reading of the Scriptures,</hi> a Ceremonial, <hi>or a</hi> Moral <hi>Law? For without doubt, if it be a Moral</hi> Law, we are as much obliged to the obſervation of it, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the former Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>IS the Reading of a verſe or two for a Text, and a few quotations, in the courſe of our Sermons each Lords day, a ſufficient anſwering of the deſign of this Law, whereby GOD hath enjoyned the Publick Reading of His Word?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>IF it be a Moral Law, and conſequently of perpetual Obligation; and our Reading a verſe or two for a Text,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>each Lords-day, doth in no meaſure anſwer the deſign of that Law; how can we fairly account for our living in the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002122_0034_0FBC205A83342508"/>Omiſſion of a Duty, that GOD hath ſo expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commanded us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is very reaſonable that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe Queſtions ſeriouſly, and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, in order to our coming to ſuch a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of each of them, as may be ſafely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon by us. And what I have ſaid in this diſcourſe, may, I hope, be of ſome uſe towards our framing a ſafe anſwer to each of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>IF upon Examination we find, that the Publick Reading of the Scriptures is a Duty that GOD hath Commanded His People the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of, as a part of His Publick Worſhip, and that we have lived hitherto in the culpable neglect of it; Let us now reſolve upon a ſpeedy Reformation; as that which will be moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to GOD, and moſt ſafe for our ſelves.</hi> It is ſinful in any to go about to juſtifie their practice in that wherein they are evidently faulty. And it is no leſs dangerous for Men to perſiſt in a practice, after they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it is wrong; upon what conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſo ever this may be done. What tho it be alleged againſt us by ſome, That we are bringing in a <hi>New Practice,</hi> contrary to the received Cuſtom and Uſage of the Country wherein we live. If we be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar herein, it is but by our returning to the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002122_0035_0FBC205CA200AA88"/>
                  <hi>good Old Way,</hi> that GOD Commanded His People to walk in, that we are ſo; and this can be no culpable ſingularity.</p>
               <p>HE that has Commanded us, <hi>Not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a Multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23.2. Will, without doubt, approve of our Reforming what we find amiſs in our own way. And it is a Truth of perpetual Verity, that <hi>they that have reſpect to all God's Commandments, ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> Pſal. 119.6. GOD will ſhow a tender regard to <hi>their</hi> honour and reputation, who make Conſcience of honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Him,</hi> by doing their duty faithfully and conſtantly. The LORD hath laid it down, as a conſtant and fixed Rule of His procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings with the Children of Men. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2 30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR love to GOD and His Laws ſhould Conſtrain us to comply with every thing that He makes known to be our duty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cuſtom, nor the Example of Others, nor our own Inclinations muſt be our Rule in the Matters of GOD and Religion: but the revealed Will of GOD: To this we muſt ſtudy to conform our ſelves in all things; not turning to the right nor to the left hand from that ſtraight path that GOD (who is our <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> and ſhall be our <hi>Judge</hi>) hath
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002122_0036_0FBC205DF1354658"/>directed us to walk in. <hi>Bleſſed is that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom his Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Mat. 24.46.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude what I deſign upon this ſubject at this time, with the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>WHEN we Read, or Hear the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Read; We ſhould Conſider them, not as the words of Men, but as the Words of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and True GOD, whereby He diſcovers to us matters of the biggeſt Importance.</hi> And therefore that they ought to be Read and Heard with the profoundeſt Reverence, and the greateſt Attention and Application of Mind that we are capable of. It is recorded to the honour of the believing <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>For this cauſe thank we God without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but (as it is an truth) the Word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</hi> When we are Reading, or Hearing the Scripture Read; we ſhould think with our ſelves, Now the great GOD the Creator &amp; Supream Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World is Speaking, and He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recis His Speech particularly to me, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wherein His own Glory, and the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002122_0037_0FBC205F5D2E2378"/>of my own Soul are nearly concerned; and He is obſerving how I behave my ſelf in the preſent duty; and will call me to a particular and ſtrict Account how I behave my ſelf herein: and therefore I had need to manage the Duty I am engaged in, with all ſeriouſneſs and circumſpectneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>IN our Reading and Hearing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we ſhould ſeriouſly Conſider, to what End the <hi>LORD</hi> gave his revealed Will to Men, and hath ſo clearly revealed Himſelf to them therein.</hi> We are told that all Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by Inſpiration of GOD, and is profitable for doctrine for reproof, for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs, that the Man of GOD may be perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works. The Scriptures are given that we may learn to fear GOD, that we may be directed how we may glorifie GOD, and enjoy Him for ever; and therefore in our Reading and Hearing of them Read, we ſhould ſtudy to fall in with GOD's glorious Deſign in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His Word to us: Otherwiſe we muſt fall mort of the <hi>End</hi> which we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves in theſe religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002122_0038_0FBC2063E064FBE8"/>
3. <hi>WE ſhould ſeriouſly Conſider, that we muſt give an Account to GOD, how we have Improved His Word, how we have Read it, and how we have Heard it, and what profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage we have had by both, and what effect the Word of GOD hath had upon us.</hi> Have we been led thereby to frame right Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of GOD, of our ſelves, and of the World? And what Influence it hath had upon our Converſation? Have we been thereby induced to ingage in the Study of a <hi>Univerſal Holineſs?</hi> to a ready and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience to <hi>all GOD's Commands?</hi> And to an <hi>Intire</hi> Reſignation of our ſelves to the Will of GOD in all things?</p>
               <p>IF we receive no advantage by our Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing of the Scriptures, we may conclude that there muſt be ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs in our way and manner of doing of it, which we ſhould ſearch and try, until we have found it out; and when we have found it we ſhould immediately ſet about the Reforming of what has been amiſs in our managing of that Important Duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:002122_0039_0FBC2065623B90A8"/>
To Conclude, In our Reading and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Scriptures, we ſhould look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and depend upon GOD for His Bleſſing upon His own Word, that it may become the Power of GOD to Salvation to all of us. That we may be gradually prepared for Heaven, and for the Immediate Enjoyment of GOD the chief Good; <hi>For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto us abundantly, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour</hi> JESUS CHRIST, 2 Pet. 1.11.</p>
