            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHILE we were yet in affliction, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the death of our late EXCELLENT GOVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOR, taken from the head of this Commonwealth, at the meridian of his life, uſefulneſs and honour; we have been called to a freſh occaſion of public grief and mourning. It hath pleaſed Heaven to commiſſion the deſtroying angel to take the life of that ILLUSTRIOUS MAN, whom we have ſo long delighted to honour, as the moſt diſtinguiſhed friend and benefactor of our nation; and one of the brighteſt ornaments of the human race.</p>
            <p>WHEN the mournful tidings firſt reached our unwilling ear, what heart did not endeavour to find conſolation in the hope, that the painful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence might prove premature? But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation was tranſient as the hope that inſpired it: and we are left to the full impreſſion of the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy truth, that the Father of our country is no more.—Yes; a nation involved in undiſſembled grief; the mourners, who, in ſlow and ſad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, go about the ſtreets; this ſolemn aſſembly; theſe ſable ſigns of ſorrow and of death; the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038305_0005_10119D918D43D7F0"/>
gloomy rites and ſervice to which we devote this day, proclaim, that WASHINGTON has departed, never to return.</p>
            <p>HE has, at length, retired beyond the reach of his country's call, at which he ſo often came to her aid. And the knowledge that he lives is no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a ſource of pleaſing reflection to our minds, and of ſecurity to our nation. The public has, indeed, ſuſtained a loſs, which true patriotiſm will deeply deplore; and every heart experiences a wound, on its individual peace, which will not be ſoon healed. But it would be unworthy of the preſent occaſion, to indulge that extravagant and ſelfiſh ſorrow, which, precluding reflection, gratitude and piety, refuſes to be comforted.</p>
            <p>IT is true, our WASHINGTON is taken away; but this implies, that he was firſt given: And we have leſs reaſon to grieve at his recal, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, that he was ſo long lent to our country, and to the world. It is conſoling alſo to reflect, that he departed in a manner worthy of himſelf. He died as he had lived—like a Hero and a Chriſtian. Thus he conſummated his character, and acquired freſh glory in death.</p>
            <p>THE painful void in our minds, occaſioned by his removal from earth, is in ſome meaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the bright image of what he was; and the contemplation of the benefits which have flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may ſtill flow, to his country, and to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038305_0006_10119D931BBBCAE0"/>
from his glorious life and example. Such is the juſt pride we take in his character; and ſuch the gratitude we feel for his ſervices, that we love to dwell on his great actions; and feel intereſted in every circumſtance of his exiſtence.</p>
            <p>TO ſelect with judgment, and relate with impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial truth and dignified ſimplicity, the principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, tranſactions and ſervices of his life, would be pronouncing the beſt eulogy on his talents and virtues; and thus would be fulfilled, to your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction, one of the duties of this great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. But the ſpeaker foreſees, with regret, the very imperfect manner, in which, at a ſhort notice and unexpected call, he will perform a ſervice, to which, had he ample time for reflection; for the choice and arrangement of materials; and for ſeeking out acceptable words, he could not flatter himſelf, that he would be able to do juſtice. Nor can he hope to diſcharge the duty aſſigned him, in that impreſſive manner, in which it would have been performed, by another, could entreaty have prevailed with him to have made the attempt.</p>
            <p>IN the country, which WASHINGTON was deſtined gloriouſly to defend, and eſſentially ſerve, he "viewed the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral generations." He was born in the year 1732, at the pariſh of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, on the banks of the Rappahannock, in Virginia. The 22d of February, according to the preſent ſtyle, has been too long diſtinguiſhed in our calendars;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038305_0007_10119D96360237B8"/>
and its annual return too often celebrated with feſtivity and joy, not to be known as the day of his birth. Never may it be blotted from the days of the year; nor ceaſe to be numbered in the months. Let the light ſhine upon it; let no cloud obſcure its luſtre: And as for the night thereof, let the ſtars appear, in all their number, magnificence, and beauty.</p>
            <p>"HIS education having been principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a private tutor, at fifteen years of age he was entered a midſhipman on board a veſſel of war." He appears to have poſſeſſed a native for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mind, which did not ſhrink at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of toil and danger. But Providence had deſtined him to other, if not leſs toilſome and hazardous, ſcenes, than thoſe he contemplated. Of his father he had been deprived by death, at the age of ten years. The affection of his ſurviving parent rendered her reluctant at his engaging in the naval profeſſion; in conſequence of which, he relinquiſhed his purpoſe. His regard to filial duty, the obligation of which the wiſe and good have, in all ages, felt and acknowledged, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by days not only long, but glorious.</p>
            <p>IN the nineteenth year of his age, he received an appointment in the militia, with the rank of major. When he had completed but twenty-one years, ſuch was the opinion entertained of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and addreſs, that he was employed on an important public miſſion; the objects of which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038305_0008_10119D9A69DB7FF8"/>
were, to inquire into the ſtate of facts, relative to the encroachments, by the French, on the weſtern frontier; to remonſtrate againſt their hoſtile pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure; and to treat with the natives of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. The ſurpriſe occaſioned by employing a youth on a miſſion of ſuch difficulty and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, was exceeded only by that, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, by his diſcharging its duties, with a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, judgment, and preciſion, that would have reflected honour on the matureſt age and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
            <p>THE following year, we find him the Colonel of a regiment; raiſed by Virginia, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of reſiſting the French aggreſſions. With the troops, intruſted to his command, he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſcene of conteſt. In an attack, which he made on a conſiderable party of the enemy, he proved victorious. But aſſailed, in his turn, by a greatly ſuperior force, he was obliged, after a brave defence, in which were killed and wounded more than one third of his men, to accept an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable capitulation.</p>
            <p>IN the fatal expedition of Braddock, in the year 1755, COLONEL WASHINGTON attended that unfortunate general, in the capacity of an extra aid-de-camp. The wiſdom of his advice, and the valour of his conduct, on this occaſion, have been univerſally acknowledged. The firſt was unhappily rejected; but the laſt was of ſignal
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038305_0009_10119D9D46171CD0"/>
ſervice, in ſecuring the retreat, and ſaving the remnant of a ſurpriſed and defeated army.</p>
            <p>"NOT long after this time, the ſupreme authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Virginia, impreſſed with a due ſenſe of his merits, gave him, in a new commiſſion, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all the troops raiſed, and to be raiſed, in that Colony. In the year 1758, he commanded the van brigade of General Forbes's army, in the capture of Fort Duqueſne."</p>
            <p>THE many dangers through which he had paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the uniform wiſdom and valour of his conduct, excited attention and admiration, on the other ſide of the Atlantic, as well as in America. As though under the impulſe of a prophetic ſpirit, a reſpectable writer, of that day, expreſſes himſelf in the following manner: "I may point out to the public that heroic youth, Col. WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto preſerved, in ſo ſignal a manner, for ſome important ſervice to his country."</p>
            <p>IN the year 1759, hoſtilities on the frontiers having, in a good meaſure, ſubſided, and his health being greatly impaired, by a pulmonary complaint; he was led to a meaſure, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the extreme regret of his troops, the reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his military command. Happily for his country, his health was gradually reſtored. Fond of agriculture, which was congenial with the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his mind, and the ſimplicity of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he ſettled as a planter and farmer, on the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038305_0010_10119DA08D543F28"/>
banks of the Potowmac, at his ſeat, which, from reſpect to the gallant Admiral of the name, was called Mount VERNON. About the ſame time, he formed that tender connexion of human life, that ſerved to alleviate the cares and burdens of his elevated ſtations, and which was diſſolved but by that event, which breaks aſunder the deareſt ties, and which we this day lament.</p>
            <p>HE continued, without any conſiderable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, at his favourite reſidence; attending to agricultural purſuits; and diſcharging the duties of a member of the Aſſembly, a Magiſtrate of the county, and Judge of the Court; till he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the memorable Congreſs of 1774, as a Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egate from Virginia. He was alſo a member of the Congreſs, in the following year, when the revolutionary war commenced.</p>
            <p>A MOST intereſting and important criſis, in our public affairs, was now arrived. A ſcene was opening, which called for great talents and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and was adapted to put them to the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt trial. In particular, a Commander in Chief, to conduct our military operations, was required; one who had the fortitude and patriotiſm, the ſkill and addreſs, to qualify him for the arduous and adventurous undertaking of organizing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to order, and ſucceſsfully directing againſt a powerful foe, an army, compoſed of troops, in a great meaſure, without diſcipline, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out habits of ſubordination, without military
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038305_0011_10119DA355062BF0"/>
ſtores; and at a time when our country had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no alliances, provided no funds, and eſtabliſhed no form of national government.</p>
            <p>WHERE was ſuch a character to be found? Heaven, that had decreed the ſucceſs of our bold, but righteous, appeal to arms, foreſeeing the great occaſion, had provided THE MAN. He was in the midſt of the aſſembled patriots and ſages of the land. His noble perſon, his nobler mind, his mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary achievements, his fair fame, his wonderful combination of great and requiſite qualities, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him out to the venerable guardians of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſafety, as with a ſun beam. With one voice, they called him to the arduous employment, and bid him go and SAVE HIS COUNTRY.</p>
            <p>"THE HERO comes;" but with that amiable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of his own abilities, and that reliance on the aid of Divine Providence, which are characteriſtic of great minds; and which he manifeſted, on all occaſions. The ſatisfaction and joy, with which he was welcomed to this vicinity, then the ſcene of war, cannot be eaſily conceived, by thoſe, whoſe age and power of recollection do not ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to recall to their minds that intereſting period. When the eye ſaw him, then it bleſſed him; and they were thought the happieſt, who could firſt gain a ſight of his perſon. It would not be indulging to fancy, but reciting a fact, ſhould it be ſaid, that ſuch were the diſpoſitions with which he was regarded, as that it was deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038305_0012_10119DA7702BE8C0"/>
an opportunity, too precious to be loſt, "to touch the hem of his garment."</p>
            <p>THE effects of his perſonal influence, and of his wiſe counſels and orders, in the introduction of ſyſtem; in the adjuſtment, and prevention of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes relating to rank; in promoting order, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and economy, through the military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, were ſoon felt; and, during the war, proved of unſpeakable advantage.</p>
            <p>IT was not long before our enemies, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the judicious and ſpirited meaſures, which were adopted under his direction, were obliged to evacuate the adjacent capital. This important event delivered you from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate evils and deſolating effects of war. The preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent increaſed and proſperous condition of this town, compared with the decayed and ruinous appearance it then exhibited; while it excites your gratitude to Heaven, may well ſerve to increaſe your affectionate regard to the memory of him, who was employed as a principal inſtrument in producing the agreeable change.</p>
            <p>NEARLY as the various events and circumſtances of the war are connected with WASHINGTON's glory, it will not be expected that I ſhall attempt to recite them. You have, indeed, ſeen with your eyes, and heard with your ears, the glorious and ſucceſsful manner, in which he conducted our mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary operations. Innumerable were the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſcouragements, that he had to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038305_0013_10119DAA378BC9A0"/>
and aſtoniſhing the wiſdom, fortitude and perſeverance, with which he met and ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. The toils and anxieties he endured; the perſonal dangers he braved; the important victories he won; and the glorious concluſion of his military career, are already recorded in the annals of his country; and will be handed down by the faithful hiſtorian, for the inſtruction and admiration of future ages.</p>
            <p>HAVING ſet the ſeal to his patriotiſm, and evinced the moderation and greatneſs of his ſoul, by cheerfully reſigning his military commiſſion into the hand of the Civil Power that gave it; and withdrawing to the humble ſcenes and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of private life, we were ready to imagine, that the meaſure of his glory was full. Not ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately conceiving of the amplitude of his mind, and wonderful diverſity of his talents; nor fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the future exigencies of the public, we thought nothing remained for him to perform, by which he could increaſe the obligations of his country; and acquire an acceſſion of fame. But how were we deceived in our views! Obedient to the voice of patriotiſm, he again appeared on the great theatre of action; rendering exalted ſervices to our nation, and reaping a freſh harveſt of glory.</p>
            <p>HE aſſiſted and preſided in the deliberations of the Convention that formed, and recommended to the adoption of the people, that Conſtitution
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038305_0014_10119DABF22BAC78"/>
of national Government, which has proved ſo rich a bleſſing to our land. When this Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was introduced, in the year 1789, he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unanimous ſuffrages of his country, to the high ſtation of PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES: and at the expiration of the firſt preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential term, the ſame ſignal proof of the public affection and confidence, was repeated.</p>
            <p>IN the exertions he contributed towards organ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing and bringing into operation our new Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; in watching over the public peace, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and happineſs; in defending our rights, as a free and independent nation, againſt the dangers, which threatened them, from abroad, and at home; and in the manner of his diſcharging, for eight years, the multiplied and arduous duties of the Supreme Executive Power, without the aid of precedents, or footſteps, to guide him in the doubtful courſe, he diſcovered a vigilance and foreſight, integrity and firmneſs, patriotiſm and ability, which excited admiration, in foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and greatly increaſed that debt of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which was before due to him, from his own. But judging it compatible with duty, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting ſtate of public affairs, he declined the future ſuffrages of his country, and indulged his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in relinquiſhing the power and elevation of office, for the ſhade of retirement.</p>
            <p>HIS country was again in danger; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his aid. Still animated by the patriotiſm
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038305_0015_10119DAD88162120"/>
which had ſo long been the ruling principle of his conduct, he conſented to reſume the military char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; and accepted the command of our armies. He appears, however, not to have relinquiſhed, on the preſent occaſion, the generous reſolution to which, during his former high employments, he had uniformly adhered, of not accepting any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary conſideration, exceeding the amount of expenſes actually incurred, in the public ſervice. His appearance in the field, not becoming neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he continued his dignified retirement at Mount Vernon; where, with a fortitude and compoſure that agreed with the tenour of his life, he has at laſt fallen in that "war in which there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge."</p>
            <p>HE diſplayed a wonderful conſiſtency of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In all ſituations and circumſtances, whether proſperous or adverſe, he was like himſelf; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſerene, wiſe and temperate, firm and dignified. He appeared, in the various ſcenes of his life, to be under the commanding influence of a principle ſuperior to every other, in forming a conſiſtent, uſeful, and truly great character; a principle of moral rectitude, or duty. "He put on righteouſneſs, and it clothed him: his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was as a robe, and a diadem."</p>
            <p>PRUDENCE, if not the moſt ſplendid, is one of the moſt uſeful, virtues; and it belonged to WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, in an eminent degree. His prudent and cautious temper, originating, not in ſiniſter
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038305_0016_10119DB347B9FB48"/>
views, but in a ſolicitude to conduct with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and uſefulneſs, was always combined, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the path of rectitude was obvious, with deciſion and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>HE viewed ſubjects accurately and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, or in their various connexions, tendencies, and remote, as well as immediate, effects: and knew how to wait for the beneficial, though diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, reſult of wiſe meaſures and upright conduct. Such was his excellent judgment of men and things, that it not only indicated a natural ſtrength of mind, and a habit of attentive obſervation; but implied the poſſeſſion of thoſe amiable moral qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, which, by precluding prejudice, paſſion, and all unworthy motives, ſerve to clear the mental ſight, prevent illuſions, and cauſe every object to appear in its true form.</p>
            <p>HIS private life, as well as his public, was a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of propriety and greatneſs. It was diſtinguiſhed by temperance, ſelf-government, ſimplicity and purity of manners; by integrity and honour; by induſtry, perſeverance, and the love of order; by the mild virtues of humanity, and pervading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of rational piety.</p>
            <p>THE more we examine and contemplate his character, in the various parts, and in the ſublime whole; the more it excites our admiration. It is not every country, nor every age, that produces a WASHINGTON. Might I not, with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038305_0017_10119DB79403B010"/>
aſk, what country, or what age, has this honour, but our own? If we compare this great Man with the moſt diſtinguiſhed characters of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, or modern, times, will he not appear ſtill greater by the compariſon? ALEXANDER has been called the Great; but how contemptible did he appear, in his ſcenes of intemperance and riot! How deſerving of the deepeſt abhorrence, when he ſlew his friend, becauſe he would not flatter! But what act of injuſtice and cruelty; what unmanly vice, or ſcene of deliberate guilt, injured the private rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utation; diminiſhed confidence in the public char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter; and tarniſhed the bright fame of WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON?</p>
            <p>MUCH has CAESAR been celebrated, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the world. But he was not great enough to overcome his own ambition and luſt of power. Refuſing to ſurrender his military command, he paſſed the Rubicon, that bounded his province; deſtroyed the liberties of his country; and ſeized the government of the Roman empire. But when was WASHINGTON known to paſs the line, which bounded his rightful authority? Did he ever invade the liberties of the people? or attempt to eſtabliſh himſelf in the poſſeſſion of deſpotic power? No. He knew how to uſe power, when intruſted with it for the public good; and that end being accompliſhed, how to reſign it. Poſſeſſing the government of himſelf, he was greater than the maſter of Rome, and of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:038305_0018_10119DB9426D79A8"/>THE retirement of CHARLES the Fifth has been often mentioned. But did the gratitude and bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a nation follow him in his retreat? It is true he retired; and well he might, for penitence and tears. Conſidering his perſidy and crimes, and the devaſtations and miſeries that were the effects of his ambition, it would not have been ſtrange, if, through ſhame and remorſe, he had ſought a refuge in the grave.</p>
            <p>THE late FREDERICK, of Pruſſia, was a great warrior, and renowned monarch. But who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſurpriſe and indignation, can contemplate him ſcoffing at religion, and endeavouring to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe everlaſting truths, which are the great ſupports of ſociety, order and happineſs, in this life; and open to the virtuous, bright proſpects of felicity and glory, beyond the grave? So did not WASHINGTON. He venerated religion, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved its precepts, and reſpected its inſtitutions.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! the uniformly great and good Man, whoſe character we ſo juſtly admire and celebrate, now lives, only in the hearts of his grateful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen; in the admiration of the world; and in our national independence, peace, and proſperity, to which he ſo eſſentially contributed, by his mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary achievements; and the conſummate wiſdom of his civil adminiſtration. When he had done more than any other man for his country; when time had ſcattered ſilver locks over his venerable brow; when he was ripe in virtue; when he
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038305_0019_101184D809357BA0"/>
was full of glory; he was taken to the ſkies: and ſhall one, who has long watched and toiled in the ſervice of others, never enter into reſt? Shall the wiſe and faithful never receive their reward?</p>
            <p>WHEN a virtuous and beloved parent dies, how natural and becoming is it for the children of the family, not only to mingle their ſorrows, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of reſpect to his memory, on the ſad occaſion; but to regard his faithful counſels and example; and, baniſhing forever their animoſities, feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more endeared to each other, by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon relation to the deceaſed! How natural is it for them to honour thoſe whom he regarded, and who were the partners of his cares and toils! And how reaſonable, that they ſhould make a wiſe uſe of the means and advantages, which they may inherit from him, of promoting their mutual wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, honour and happineſs!</p>
            <p>WE, my Friends and Brethren, with the citizens of the United States, have, indeed, loſt a Father; one, who, in the infancy of our nation, has been pre-eminently uſeful, in protecting us by his arm, and guiding us by his counſel. In the ſincerity of our hearts, we this day offer to his memory the tribute of our tears, gratitude and veneration. Let us never forget his wiſe maxims and faithful advice, as expreſſed on various occaſions, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as communicated, in his laſt ſolemn and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate addreſs, "The Legacy of the Father of his Country."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:038305_0020_10119DC1565EDE20"/>ANIMATED by his reſplendent example, may we lead a virtuous, patriotic, pious, life, which is true glory. Let contention, prejudice, party views and ſpirit, yield to the love of truth, to kind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and a pure zeal to perpetuate the free gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, honour, peace and proſperity of our common country.</p>
            <p>LET us manifeſt our veneration for the deceaſed, by regarding, with due affection and reſpect, his patriotic companions in arms, and wiſe aſſociates in council and government. ADAMS, his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſucceſſor, as Preſident of the United States; a man whoſe abilities, integrity and patriotiſm have been long tried and approved, has peculiar claims to the eſteem and confidence of his country, not only on account of his own great talents, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and ſervices; but in conſequence of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial friendſhip, approbation, and ſupport, which he received from his great Predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, like the great Jewiſh leader and law-giver, "put a portion of his honour on" his ſucceſſor, perceiving in him "the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom." In one of his laſt official communications, he explicitly declared, as his opinion, That the meaſures of the preſent adminiſtration were "wiſe and prudent," and "ought to inſpire univerſal confidence."</p>
            <p>THERE is a ſorrow for the dead, which is injuſtice to the living; and which will by no means correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with the character of the great and good Man,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038305_0021_10119DC2E021FB90"/>
whoſe death we deplore; and who ſo well knew how to appreciate, and acknowledge, the abilities and virtues of others. By an exceſs of grief, or the affectation of it, on the preſent occaſion, we implicitly reproach ſurviving patriotiſm and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and departed worth may be emblazoned, with the view of placing living merit in the ſhade.</p>
            <p>AMERICANS! prize the rich inheritance handed down to you from WASHINGTON and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Unimpaired, let it be tranſmitted to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations. Pour the fervent prayer to HEAVEN, that licentious principles and manners; "the infidious wiles of foreign influence;" domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic diviſions, contempt of government, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive anarchy; eſtabliſhed deſpotiſm and tyrannic power, may never prevail, and ſpread their debaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence and deſolating effects, in this favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed land.</p>
            <p>AS an incentive to every thing wiſe, virtuous, patriotic and great, cheriſh the memory of the departed HERO, PATRIOT and SAGE. Love and defend the country that gave him birth; was the object of his pure affection; the ſcene of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life; and contains his hallowed duſt.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to adminiſter the executive government of the United States, being not far diſtant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts muſt be employed in deſignating the perſon, who is to be clothed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſolution I have formed, to decline being conſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
            <p>I beg you, at the ſame time, to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without a ſtrict regard to all the conſiderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:038305_0023_10119DC9F379CBA0"/>
the tender of ſervice, which ſilence in my ſituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs: but am ſupported by a full conviction that the ſtep is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with both.</p>
            <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your deſire. I conſtantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſtently with motives, which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclination to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the preparation of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of perſons entitled to my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns, exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as well as internal, no longer renders the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of inclination incompatible with the ſentiment of duty, or propriety; and am perſuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my ſervices, that, in the preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſapprove my determination to retire.</p>
            <p>The impreſſions, with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and adminiſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:038305_0024_10119DCD1A1A9630"/>
outſet, of the inferiority of my qualifications, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrengthened the motives to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of myſelf; and every day the increaſing weight of years admoniſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retirement is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have given peculiar value to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, patriotiſm does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it.</p>
            <p>In looking forward to the moment, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt confidence with which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable attachment, by ſervices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to my zeal. If benefits have reſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered to your praiſe, and as an inſtructive example in our annals, that under circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead—amidſt appearances ſometimes dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous —viciſſitudes of fortune often diſcouraging—in ſituations in which, not unfrequently, want of ſucceſs has countenanced the ſpirit of criticiſm—the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I ſhall carry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to unceaſing vows, that Heaven
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038305_0025_10119DCFF39C47C0"/>
may continue to you the choiceſt tokens of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence —that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual—that the free conſtitution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſacredly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained —that its adminiſtration, in every depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue— that, in fine, the happineſs of the people of theſe States, under the auſpices of liberty, may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, the affection, and adoption, of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
            <p>HERE, perhaps, I ought to ſtop. But a ſolicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehenſion of danger, natural to that ſolicitude, urge me, on an occaſion like the preſent, to offer to your ſolemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, ſome ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are the reſult of much reflection, of no inconſiderable obſervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a people. Theſe will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only ſee in them the diſintereſted warnings of a parting friend, who can poſſibly have no perſonal motive to bias his counſel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my ſentiments on a former and not diſſimilar occaſion.</p>
            <p>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is neceſſary to fortify or confirm the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The unity of government, which conſtitutes you one people, is alſo now dear to you. It is juſtly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038305_0026_10119DD182DAFCD0"/>
ſo; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the ſupport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your ſafety; of your proſperity; of that very liberty which you ſo highly prize. But, as it is eaſy to foreſee, that from different cauſes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point, in your political fortreſs, againſt which the batteries of internal and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enemies will be moſt conſtantly and actively (though often covertly and inſidiouſly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you ſhould properly eſtimate the immenſe value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happineſs; that you ſhould cheriſh a cordial, habitual and immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able attachment to it; accuſtoming yourſelves to think and ſpeak of it as of the palladium of your political ſafety and proſperity; watching for its preſervation with jealous anxiety; diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing whatever may ſuggeſt even a ſuſpicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the firſt dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the reſt, or to enfeeble the ſacred ties which now link to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the various parts.</p>
            <p>For this, you have every inducement of ſympathy and intereſt. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, muſt always exalt the juſt pride of patriotiſm, more than any appellation derived from local diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. With ſlight ſhades of difference, you have the ſame religion, manners, habits and polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical principles. You have, in a common cauſe,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038305_0027_10119DD456192A60"/>
fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you poſſeſs are the work of joint coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>But theſe conſiderations, however powerfully they addreſs themſelves to your ſenſibility, are greatly out-weighed by thoſe which apply more immediately to your intereſt.—Here every portion of our country finds the moſt commanding motives for carefully guarding and preſerving the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>The North, in an unreſtrained intercourſe with the South, protected by the equal laws of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional reſources of maritime and commercial enterprize, and precious materials of manufacturing induſtry. The South, in the ſame intercourſe, benefiting by the agency of the North, ſees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the ſeamen of the North, it finds its particular nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouriſh and increaſe the general maſs of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime ſtrength, to which it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is unequally adapted. The Eaſt, in a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Weſt, already finds, and, in the progreſſive improvement of interior communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by land and water, will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The Weſt derives from the Eaſt ſupplies requiſite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of ſtill greater conſequence, it muſt of neceſſity owe the ſecure enjoyment of indiſpenſable outlets for its own productions to the weighty influence, and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038305_0028_101184D9902B30D0"/>
future maritime ſtrength of the Atlantic ſide of the Union, directed by an indiſſoluble community of intereſt as one nation. Any other tenure, by which the Weſt can hold this eſſential advantage, whether derived from its own ſeparate ſtrength, or from an apoſtate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, muſt be intrinſically precarious.</p>
            <p>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intereſt in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united maſs of means and efforts, greater ſtrength, greater reſource, proportionably greater ſecurity from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal danger, a leſs frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of moſt ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable value! they muſt derive from Union an exemption from thoſe broils and wars between themſelves, which ſo frequently afflict neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countries, not tied together by the ſame gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; which their own rivalſhips alone would be ſufficient to produce, but which oppoſite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and embitter. Hence, likewiſe, they will avoid the neceſſity of thoſe overgrown military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, under any form of government, are inauſpicious to liberty, and which are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as particularly hoſtile to Republican Liberty. In this ſenſe it is, that your Union ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a main prop of your Liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation of the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations ſpeak a perſuaſive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of patriotic deſire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace ſo large a ſphere? Let experience ſolve it. To liſten to mere
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038305_0029_10119DD9CAF943E0"/>
ſpeculation, in ſuch a caſe, were criminal. We are authoriſed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the reſpective ſubdiviſions, will afford a happy iſſue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With ſuch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment ſhall not have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated its impracticability, there will always be reaſon to diſtruſt the patriotiſm of thoſe, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</p>
            <p>In contemplating the cauſes which may diſturb our Union, it occurs as matter of ſerious concern, that any ground ſhould have been furniſhed for characterizing parties, by geographical diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions —<hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern—Atlantic</hi> and <hi>Weſtern;</hi> whence deſigning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular diſtricts, is to miſrepreſent the opinions and aims of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts. You cannot ſhield yourſelves too much againſt the jealouſies and heart-burnings which ſpring from theſe miſrepreſentations; they tend to render alien to each other thoſe who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Weſtern Country have lately had a uſeful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on this head: They have ſeen, in the negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Executive, and in the unanimous ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univerſal ſatisfaction at that event, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the United States, a deciſive proof how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded were the ſuſpicions, propagated among them, of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States, unfriendly to their intereſts in regard to the Miſſiſippi: They have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038305_0030_10119DDC9BE1DCF8"/>
to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which ſecure to them every thing they could deſire, in reſpect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their proſperity. Will it not be their wiſdom to rely, for the preſervation of theſe advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be deaf to thoſe adviſers, if ſuch there are, who would ſever them from their brethren, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect them with aliens?</p>
            <p>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indiſpenſable. No alliances, however ſtrict, between the parts, can be an adequate ſubſtitute; they muſt inevitably expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Senſible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your firſt eſſay, by the adoption of a Conſtitution of Government, better calculated than your former, for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of your common concerns. This Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the offspring of your own choice, uninflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and unawed; adopted upon full inveſtigation and mature deliberation; completely free in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; in the diſtribution of its powers, uniting ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity with energy; and containing within itſelf a proviſion for its own amendment, has a juſt claim to your confidence and your ſupport. Reſpect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquieſcence in its meaſures, are duties enjoined by the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxims of true liberty. The baſis of our political ſyſtems is the right of the people to make and to alter their conſtitutions of government— But, the conſtitution which at any time exiſts, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is ſacredly obligatory upon all. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038305_0031_10119DDE28AF96A0"/>
very idea of the power and the right of the people to eſtabliſh government, preſuppoſes the duty of every individual to obey the eſtabliſhed government.</p>
            <p>All obſtructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and aſſociations, under whatever plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible character, with the real deſign to direct, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the conſtituted authorities, are deſtructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They ſerve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a ſmall, but artful and enterpriſing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumph of different parties, to make the public adminiſtration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of conſiſtent and wholeſome plans, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by common councils, and modified by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intereſts.</p>
            <p>However combinations, or aſſociations, of the above deſcription, may now and then anſwer popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends, they are likely, in the courſe of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſubvert the power of the people, and to uſurp for themſelves the reins of government; deſtroying, afterwards, the very engines which have lifted them to unjuſt dominion.</p>
            <p>Towards the preſervation of your government, and the permanency of your preſent happy ſtate, it is requiſite, not only that you ſteadily diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance irregular oppoſitions to its acknowledged authority, but alſo that you reſiſt, with care, the ſpirit of innovation upon its principles, however ſpecious the pretexts. One method of aſſault may
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038305_0032_10119DE2AA75B488"/>
be to effect, in the forms of the Conſtitution, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which will impair the energy of the ſyſtem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at leaſt as neceſſary to fix the true character of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernments, as of other human inſtitutions; that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is the ſureſt ſtandard, by which to teſt the real tendency of the exiſting conſtitution of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypotheſis and opinion, expoſes to perpetual change, from the endleſs variety of hypotheſis and opinion; and remember, eſpecially, that for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient management of your common intereſts, in a country ſo extenſive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is conſiſtent with the perfect ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of liberty, is indiſpenſable. Liberty itſelf will find in ſuch a government, with powers properly diſtributed and adjuſted, its ſureſt guardian. It is, indeed, little elſe than a name, where the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is too feeble to withſtand the enterpriſes of faction, to confine each member of the ſociety with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits preſcribed by the laws, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all in the ſecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of perſon and property.</p>
            <p>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in a ſtate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical diſcriminations. Let me now take a more comprehenſive view, and warn you, in the moſt ſolemn manner, againſt the baneful effects of the ſpirit of party, generally.</p>
            <p>This ſpirit, unfortunately, is inſeparable from our nature, having its root in the ſtrongeſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the human mind. It exiſts, under different ſhapes, in all governments, more or leſs ſtifled, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, or repreſſed; but in thoſe of the popular
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038305_0033_10119DE5A9AFCC78"/>
form, it is ſeen in its greateſt rankneſs, and is truly their worſt enemy.</p>
            <p>The alternate domination of one faction over another, ſharpened by the ſpirit of revenge, natural to party diſſenſion, which, in different ages and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, has perpetrated the moſt horrid enormities, is itſelf a frightful deſpotiſm: But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent deſpotiſm. The diſorders and miſeries, which reſult, gradually incline the minds of men to ſeek ſecurity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the abſolute power of an individual; and, ſooner or later, the chief of ſome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this diſpoſition to the purpoſes of his own ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, on the ruins of public liberty.</p>
            <p>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheleſs ought not to be entirely out of ſight) the common and continual miſchiefs of the ſpirit of party are ſufficient to make it the intereſt and duty of a wiſe people to diſcourage and reſtrain it.</p>
            <p>It ſerves always to diſtract the public councils, and enfeeble the public adminiſtration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealouſies and falſe alarms; kindles the animoſity of one part againſt another; and foments, occaſionally, riot and inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acceſs to the government itſelf, through the channels of party paſſions. Thus the policy and will of one country are ſubjected to the policy and will of another.</p>
            <p>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are uſeful checks upon the adminiſtration of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and ſerve to keep alive the ſpirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038305_0034_10119DE730F31508"/>
in governments of a monarchical caſt, patriotiſm may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the ſpirit of party. But in thoſe of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a ſpirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that ſpirit for every ſalutary purpoſe: and there being conſtant danger of exceſs, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its burſting into a flame, leſt, inſtead of warming, it ſhould conſume.</p>
            <p>It is important, likewiſe, that the habits of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a free country, ſhould inſpire caution in thoſe entruſted with its adminiſtration, to confine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within their reſpective conſtitutional ſpheres, avoiding, in the exerciſe of the powers of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, to encroach upon another. The ſpirit of encroachment tends to conſolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the form of government, a real deſpotiſm. A juſt eſtimate of that love of power, and proneneſs to abuſe it, which predominates in the human heart, is ſufficient to ſatisfy us of the truth of this poſition. The neceſſity of reciprocal checks in the exerciſe of political power, by dividing and diſtrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uting it into different depoſitories, and conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each the guardian of the public weal againſt invaſions by the others, has been evinced by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ancient and modern; ſome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To preſerve them, muſt be as neceſſary as to inſtitute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the diſtribution or modification of the conſtitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way which the Conſtitution deſignates.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038305_0035_10119DEBE12C2830"/>
But let there be no change by uſurpation; for though this, in one inſtance, may be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good, it is the cuſtomary weapon by which free governments are deſtroyed. The precedent muſt always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any partial or tranſient benefit which the uſe can at any time yield.</p>
            <p>Of all the diſpoſitions and habits, which lead to political proſperity, religion and morality are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable ſupports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotiſm, who ſhould labour to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert theſe great pillars of human happineſs, theſe firmeſt props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to reſpect and to cheriſh them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be ſimply aſked, Where is the ſecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a ſenſe of religious obligation <hi>deſert</hi> the oaths which are the inſtruments of inveſtigation in courts of juſtice? And let us with caution indulge the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of refined education, on minds of peculiar ſtructure; reaſon and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of religious principle.</p>
            <p>It is ſubſtantially true, that virtue or morality is a neceſſary ſpring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends, with more or leſs force, to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies of free government. Who, that is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere friend to it, can look with indifference upon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſhake the foundation of the fabric?</p>
            <p>Promote, then, as an object of primary import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, inſtitutions for the general diffuſion of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038305_0036_10119DF0104BAD38"/>
In proportion as the ſtructure of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives force to public opinion, it is eſſential that public opinion ſhould be enlightened.</p>
            <p>As a very important ſource of ſtrength and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, cheriſh public credit. One method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it is, to uſe it as ſparingly as poſſible; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions of expenſe by cultivating peace; but remembering alſo, that timely diſburſements, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater diſburſements to repel it; avoiding, likewiſe, the accumulation of debt, not only by ſhunning occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of expenſe, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to diſcharge the debts which una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable wars may have occaſioned, not ungener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly throwing upon poſterity the burden which we ourſelves ought to bear. The execution of theſe maxims belongs to your repreſentatives, but it is neceſſary that public opinion ſhould co-operate.</p>
            <p>To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is eſſential that you ſhould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there muſt be revenue; that to have revenue there muſt be taxes; that no taxes can be deviſed, which are not, more or leſs, inconvenient and unpleaſant; that the intrinſic embarraſſment inſeparable from the ſelection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deciſive motive for a candid conſtruction of the conduct of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in making it, and for a ſpirit of acquieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the meaſures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</p>
            <p>Obſerve good faith and juſtice towards all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; cultivate peace and harmony with all: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038305_0037_10119DF1995AA190"/>
diſtant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple always guided by an exalted juſtice and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. Who can doubt, that in the courſe of time and things, the fruits of ſuch a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages, which might be loſt by a ſteady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, at leaſt, is recommended by every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impoſſible by its vices?</p>
            <p>In the execution of ſuch a plan, nothing is more eſſential, than that permanent, inveterate antipathies againſt particular nations, and paſſionate attachments for others, ſhould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, juſt and amicable feelings towards all ſhould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondneſs, is in ſome degree a ſlave. It is a ſlave to its animoſity or to its affection, either of which is ſufficient to lead it aſtray from its duty and its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Antipathy in one nation againſt another, diſpoſes each more readily to offer inſult and injury, to lay hold of ſlight cauſes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occaſions of diſpute occur. Hence frequent colliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, obſtinate, envenomed and bloody conteſts. The nation, prompted by ill will and reſentment, ſometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the beſt calculations of policy. The government ſometimes participates in the national propenſity, and adopts, through paſſion, what reaſon would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; at other times, it makes the animoſity of the nation ſubſervient to the projects of hoſtility, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by pride, ambition, and other ſiniſter and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious motives. The peace often, ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038305_0038_10119DF422EEB408"/>So, likewiſe, a paſſionate attachment of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for another, produces a variety of evils. Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy for the favourite nation, facilitating the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an imaginary common intereſt, in caſes where no real common intereſt exiſts, and infuſing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It leads alſo to conceſſions to the favourite nation, of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conceſſions; by unneceſſarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealouſy, ill will, and a diſpoſition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themſelves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or ſacrifice the intereſts of their own country, without odium, ſometimes even with pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous ſenſe of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the baſe or fooliſh compliance, of ambition, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or infatuation.</p>
            <p>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, ſuch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domeſtic factions, to practiſe the arts of ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to miſlead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a ſmall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the ſatellite of the latter.</p>
            <p>Againſt the inſidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealouſy of a free people ought to be conſtantly awake; ſince hiſtory and experience prove, that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038305_0039_10119DF820FA5648"/>
foreign influence is one of the moſt baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealouſy, to be uſeful, muſt be impartial; elſe it becomes the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the very influence to be avoided, inſtead of a defence againſt it. Exceſſive partiality for one foreign nation, and exceſſive diſlike of another, cauſe thoſe whom they actuate to ſee danger only on one ſide, and ſerve to veil and even ſecond the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may reſiſt the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become ſuſpected and odious; while its tools and dupes uſurp the applauſe and confidence of the people, to ſurrender their intereſt.</p>
            <p>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign nations, is, in extending our commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to have with them as little political connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion as poſſible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.—Here let us ſtop.</p>
            <p>Europe has a ſet of primary intereſts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence ſhe muſt be engaged in frequent controverſies, the cauſes of which are eſſentially foreign to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. Hence, therefore, it muſt be unwiſe in us to implicate ourſelves, by artificial ties, in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary viciſſitudes of her politics, or the ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and colliſions of her friendſhips or enmities.</p>
            <p>Our detached and diſtant ſituation invites and enables us to purſue a different courſe. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al injury from external annoyance; when we may take ſuch an attitude, as will cauſe the neutrality, we may at any time reſolve upon, to be ſcrupulouſly reſpected; when belligerent nations, under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of making acquiſitions upon us, will not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038305_0040_10119DFAE84D0058"/>
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may chooſe peace or war, as our intereſt, guided by juſtice, ſhall counſel.</p>
            <p>Why forego the advantages of ſo peculiar a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? Why quit our own, to ſtand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our deſtiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and proſperity in the toils of European ambition, rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, intereſt, humour or caprice?</p>
            <p>It is our true policy to ſteer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; ſo far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be underſtood as capable of patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing infidelity to exiſting engagements. I hold the maxim no leſs applicable to public than to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs, that honeſty is always the beſt policy. I repeat it, therefore, let thoſe engagements be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in their genuine ſenſe. But, in my opinion, it is unneceſſary, and would be unwiſe, to extend them.</p>
            <p>Taking care always to keep ourſelves, by ſuitable eſtabliſhments, on a reſpectable defenſive poſture, we may ſafely truſt to temporary alliances for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary emergencies.</p>
            <p>Harmony, liberal intercourſe with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity and intereſt. But even our commercial policy, ſhould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither ſeeking nor granting excluſive favours or preferences; conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the natural courſe of things; diffuſing and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifying, by gentle means, the ſtreams of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but forcing nothing; eſtabliſhing, with the powers ſo diſpoſed, in order to give trade a ſtable courſe, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to ſupport them, conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rules of intercourſe, the beſt that preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038305_0041_10119DFE8600D998"/>
and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned or varied, as experience and circumſtances ſhall dictate; conſtantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for diſintereſted favours from another; that it muſt pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by ſuch acceptance, it may place itſelf in the condition of having given equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alents for nominal favours, and yet of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illuſion which experience muſt cure, which a juſt pride ought to diſcard.</p>
            <p>In offering to you, my countrymen, theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the ſtrong and laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I could wiſh; that they will control the uſual current of the paſſions, or prevent our nation from running the courſe which has hitherto marked the deſtiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myſelf, that they may be productive of ſome partial bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſome occaſional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party ſpirit, to warn againſt the miſchiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard againſt the impoſtures of pretended patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; this hope will be a full recompenſe for the ſolicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</p>
            <p>How far, in the diſcharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, muſt witneſs to you and to the world. To myſelf, the aſſurance of my own conſcience is, that I have at leaſt believed myſelf to be guided by them.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:038305_0042_10119E00105C08B8"/>In relation to the ſtill ſubſiſting war in Europe, my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repreſentatives in both Houſes of Congreſs, the ſpirit of that meaſure has continually governed me; uninfluenced by any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deter or divert me from it.</p>
            <p>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the beſt lights I could obtain, I was well ſatisfied that our country, under all the circumſtances of the caſe, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intereſt to take, a neutral poſition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as ſhould depend upon me, to maintain it with moderation, perſeverance and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>The conſiderations which reſpect the right to hold this conduct, it is not neceſſary on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to detail. I will only obſerve, that, according to my underſtanding of the matter, that right, ſo far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</p>
            <p>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which juſtice and humanity impoſe on every nation, in caſes, in which it is free to act, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inviolate the relations of peace and amity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards other nations.</p>
            <p>The inducements of intereſt for obſerving that conduct will be beſt referred to your own reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to ſettle and mature its yet recent inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to progreſs, without interruption, to that degree of ſtrength and conſiſtency, which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give it, humanly ſpeaking, the command of its own fortunes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:038305_0043_10119E0293000B50"/>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration, I am unconſcious of intentional error, I am nevertheleſs too ſenſible of my defects, not to think it probable that I may have committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope, that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as myſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</p>
            <p>Relying on its kindneſs in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations; I anticipate, with pleaſing expectation, that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government—the ever favourite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I truſt, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</p>
