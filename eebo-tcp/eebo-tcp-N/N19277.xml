            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN the following pages, the Public, according to the promiſe of the Publiſhers, is preſented with a Volume of American Poems; partly Selected, and partly Original. In undertaking this Work, they have been actuated by a variety of motives, and drawn onward by a number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. When looking round them, they ſaw many Poems, written by the moſt eminent American Authors, from the looſe manner of their publiſhment, known only to a few of their particular acquaintance, and unheard of by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their Countrymen. The value of the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and the regard which authors generally feel for their literary offspring, left them no room to doubt, but that, at ſome future period, each perſon would think it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth the while to collect what he had ſcattered. But this period was uncertain; and the publiſhers tho't that it would not be rendering an unacceptable ſervice to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, if they undertook the buſineſs of collecting, and arran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging each Author's productions in a volume, which from its ſize ſhould claim a more univerſal attention.—Beſide the ſmaller Poems of Gentlemen, diſtinguiſh'd for their poet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical talents, many others, of very great merit, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the different Periodical publications of the United States. Performances of this kind, falling from the pens of perſons not intent on literary fame; or intent on repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation different from poetical reputation; or whoſe names have not yet been dignified by national applauſe; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

as many of them are adapted to particular and local oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; notwithſtanding their deſert, are conſtantly lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be forgotten and loſt. And the publiſhers have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it to be a matter of much regret, among perſons of reading and taſte, that the frail ſecurity of an obſcure news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper, was the only one they had for ſome of the hanſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſpecimens of American Poetry. To afford a ſtronger, and more durable ſecurity, is one of the objects of this Publication.—Among other things, it did not appear to be a matter altogether deſtitute of uſefulneſs, to bring togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in one view, the ſeveral poetical productions of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent States. By this means a more certain eſtimation can be made of the comparative merit of their various wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; a more thorough acquaintance may be obtained of the ſtate of the belles-lettres in the individual parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and hereby will be promoted a more intimate combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of literary intereſts.—It eſpecially ſeemed a matter of importance, to draw forth, for the amuſement of the lovers of poetry, thoſe Poems which, for want of a Repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itory of this kind, alone, were withheld from the Public. It was eaſy to foreſee, that many perſons, acting with a proper regard to the worth of their own writings, would readily give up that advantage, which news-papers beſtow, of having them known to every body; if they could by means of a Work like the preſent one, ſecure them a certain conveyance to the attention of the ſcientific and refined. It was l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> poſſeſſed of talents and leiſure, to ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar purſuits; by holding out to them a Work where, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the like performances of the moſt celebrated among their Countrymen, their Poems may be equally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

of preſervation and notice.—Theſe have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the Publiſhers. How far their deſign is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, is not for them to determine. That it ſhould be completely ſo, was not to be expected. This is but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of an Undertaking; and they hope, not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing one. The Public alone, have the power to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſupport them in its accompliſhment.—Should the Volume, now publiſhed, meet with that ſucceſs which the value of the Poems it contains ſeems to warrant, it is the intention of the Publiſhers to add another; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Collection as long as the <hi>preſent ſupply</hi> of Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and <hi>that</hi> for which, in future, they may be indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the generoſity of the literarty, will enable them.</p>
            <p>They have, now, only to return, to their ſubſcribers, their moſt unfeignedly grateful acknowledgments for the generous ſupport which they have afforded them; and to expreſs a hope, that tho' the publication owing to ſome unfortunate circumſtances, has been delayed longer than their firſt purpoſe, no other expectation, which they have held forth, may be diſappointed on a careful examination of the Work.</p>

            <p>IT is the intention of the Editors, as mentioned in the Preface, to purſue their deſign; and, ſhould ſufficient encouragement appear, to publiſh a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Volume, in the courſe of the next two years. —Many diſappointments, the ill health of one of the Editors, and other circumſtances, too complicated and painful to mention, have contributed to render their part of this Work leſs perfect than their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and promiſes. They intend to finiſh the ſucceeding Volume, or Volumes, in a more el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egant manner; and, if a ſecond edition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent volume ſhould be called for, it is their further intention to make it equal, in beauty, to the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; to all of which ſuitable, and well-executed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations ſhall be added.</p>

                  <l>The deeper glooms lead on the ſolemn hour,</l>

<q>The incloſed Poem is handed you for publication. I have long thought that the Bible furniſhed many ſubjects for poetry, far more deſerving the ambition and efforts of genius, than thoſe to which it is commonly dedicated. I do not mean merely that they are ſubjects more friendly to virtue, but to poetry. They are more ſublime, novel, beautiful, agreeable, and in every way intereſting.— Perhaps this experiment may not have been ſo happily made, as to elucidate the truth of this opinion. But as it is, it is ſubmitted to the judgment of your readers. Should it have the happy influence to induce even one perſon of poetical talents, to apply thoſe talents to this method of ornamenting his own character, and that of his country, I ſhall think my labours not unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</q>

<q>It may not be amiſs to inform the ſubſcribers for the following performance that a copy was not given at the time it was requeſted, on account of its containing ſeveral paſſages taken from a larger work which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has by him, unfiniſhed.

The paſſages are thoſe that reſpect the affairs of America at large, and the future progreſs of Society. As to the other parts of the Poem which are confined to the ſtate of education in Connecticut, although the ſubject may be thought too particular to be reliſhed beyond the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of a Commencement Auditory, yet if they ſhould ſerve to turn the attention of any part of the Public to the real ſituation of Yale College, it may juſtify the publication.</q>

                  <p>ADDRESS—the folly and danger of diſſention—the Orator enumerates the enemies of the fraternity—reminds them of a late unſeaſonable interruption—a night ſcene in the Potter's Field—he laments the want of true zeal in the brotherhood —and boaſts of his own—the force of a ruling paſſion—the earth conſidered as a great animal—the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love not the ſame in a true ſon of Eſculapius as in other men—his own amour—a picture of his miſtreſs in high taſte—ſhews his learning in the deſcription of her mouth, arm and hand—his miſtreſs dies—his grief—and extraordinary conſolation—his unparallel'd fidelity—he apologizes for giving this hiſtory of his amour—the great difficulties Anatomiſts have to encounter in the preſent times, ariſing from falſe delicacy, prejudice and ignorance—a ſtrong inſtance in proof that it was not ſo formerly—curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous argument to prove the inconſiſtency of the preſent opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions reſpecting the practice—he mentions many obſtacles in the road to ſcience—and reproaches them for their inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine broils, at a time when not only popular clamour is loud, but even the powers of government are exerted againſt them—he then encourages his brethren with hopes of better times, founded on the eſtabliſhment of the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians—is inſpired with the idea of the future glory of that inſtitution—and propheſies great things.</p>

                  <l>Our godlike fathers bore no ſlaviſh chain;</l>
                  <l>To Pharaoh's face the inſpired patriarchs ſtood,</l>

                  <l>Then to theſe climes the illuſtrious exiles ſped,</l>
                  <l>'Twas freedom prompted, and the Godhead led.</l>
                  <l>Eternal woods the virgin ſoil defac'd,</l>

                  <l>With hopes that we ſhould never part,</l>
                  <l>And thus theſe hopes deſtroy?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Amid the much-admiring crowd,</l>
                  <l>While thus I ſigh'd my griefs aloud,</l>
                  <l>I ſcarce refrain'd to ſpeak;</l>
                  <l>Shame held my tongue, while from my eye</l>
                  <l>The pearly drops, full plenteouſly,</l>

                  <l>Thus, near fair Tibur's ſilver flood,</l>
                  <l>The Roman Bard, gay Horace, ſtood,</l>

                  <l>And thrice he warn'd her, o'er, and o'er,</l>
                  <l>And told the fates Europa bore,</l>
                  <l>In hopes he might avail.</l>

                  <l>From ſuch a dangerous choice.</l>
                  <l>But all in vain, like me, he tried,</l>
                  <l>Galatea ſtill did firm abide,</l>

                  <l>THOU know'ſt, O Eſther! from thy infant years,</l>
                  <l>To rear thy form, to nurſe thy opening mind,</l>
                  <l>To teach thee every virtue, every truth,</l>
                  <l>To form thee finiſh'd, lovely, great, and wiſe,</l>
                  <l>Was all my care ſupreme. Friendleſs, alone,</l>
                  <l>An orphan ſcarcely budded, well thou know'ſt</l>
                  <l>I found thee; as a darling flower (the roſe,</l>
                  <l>That blooms in Sharon, or at Hermon's foot</l>
                  <l>The lilly of the vale) from midſt the wild,</l>
                  <l>With every care remov'd thee to my field,</l>
                  <l>And ſaw thee riſe, and bloom, and ſend abroad</l>
                  <l>A fragrance, richer than the Arabian gale.</l>
                  <l>Why all adorn'd with beauty's living bloom,</l>

                  <l>Where heaven was pleas'd to move in mortal guiſe;</l>
                  <l>Why form'd with ſoul, ſuperior to thy kind,</l>

                  <l>Why all accompliſh'd, and why angel all,</l>
                  <l>I ponder'd long, and now from Heaven I learn.</l>
                  <l>This mighty hour the Eye Omniſcient mark'd,</l>
                  <l>While fair, beneath his forming hand, uproſe</l>
                  <l>Thy varied excellence. For this Heaven gave</l>
                  <l>Thy virtue, gift ſupreme, that virtue crown'd</l>
                  <l>With wiſdom's power; that wiſdoms cloth'd divine</l>
                  <l>With beauty's angel form; that form around</l>
                  <l>Diffus'd the light of Heaven; and all adorn'd</l>
                  <l>With grace and ſweetneſs, dignity and love.</l>
                  <l>On that proud day, when, from an hundred realms</l>
                  <l>Summon'd, came many a lord, and chief, and king,</l>
                  <l>Magnificent, to grace the monarch's feaſt,</l>
                  <l>And all the pomp of Perſia round him ſpread;</l>
                  <l>When Vaſhti's inſolence, beyond all thought,</l>
                  <l>Her preſence to the illuſtrious train refus'd;</l>
                  <l>When, taught by Memucan he wiſely bade</l>
                  <l>The haughty fair one wear the crown no more;</l>
                  <l>Even then a field I ſaw, by Heaven outſpread,</l>
                  <l>To give thy virtue ſcope, and rich reward.</l>
                  <l>Pondering, I brought thee to the eunuchs' Prince;</l>
                  <l>Amaz'd, amid all Perſia's beauteous maids,</l>
                  <l>Thee, thee alone he gaz'd. Convinc'd, I knew</l>
                  <l>The crown reſerv'd for thee. With no ſurpriſe,</l>
                  <l>I ſaw thee lifted to the world's great throne:</l>
                  <l>'Twas thus the Skies decreed. But, O bleſs'd fair!</l>
                  <l>Not for thyſelf the Heavens thy beauty gave,</l>
                  <l>Thy grace, thy wiſdom; nor, for thee alone,</l>
                  <l>Did Mordecai uprear thy precious bloom.</l>
                  <l>Heaven's gifts are virtue's aids; for virtue us'd,</l>
                  <l>Are us'd aright; or elſe are given in vain.</l>
