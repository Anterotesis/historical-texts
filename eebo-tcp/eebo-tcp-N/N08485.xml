            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the author has nothing to fear from the world, and as little to hope from it, he has not been very ſolicitous about the public acceptance of the following pages. But as he ſoberly thinks the ſentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them to be true and important, he cannot but wiſh them to prevent his readers miſtaking him, which is the only reaſon he has for writing a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. For this end it may be proper to inform the reader before hand, that the expreſſion of diſguſt againſt the pulpit in the title, and whatever like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions may occur in the following pages, are by no means intended to ſignify that the office of a clergyman, or miniſter of <hi>GOD</hi>'s word, is itſelf a proper ſubject of ridicule: but as ſomebody ſays of kings, they have a divine right to rule <hi>well,</hi> but that will by no means infer that they have a divine right to be tyrants: ſo we may ſay of the goſpel miniſtry, that ſuch as <hi>GOD</hi> has fitted for that ſervice, have a divine right to ſpeak the truth of <hi>GOD</hi> as they are able, but we cannot ſay they have a divine right to betray or corrupt it.</p>
            <p>AS the author whoſe performance gave occaſion to the following thoughts does not, by the ſtage, mean that frame of wood, &amp;c. on which the actors perform, but the performances thereon; ſo the author of the following pages has no diſguſt at the pulpit, but at the uſe commonly made of it.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be denied, that the truth of the goſpel was propagated at the firſt to the nations by preaching, and that it is ſtill the appointment of <hi>GOD</hi> for calling the attention of mankind to his divine grace, and for building up his people in that grace; but it is the pulpit being now generally uſed in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to that grace which bringeth ſalvation, that is the deteſtable thing herein cenſured. The ſcorn that is caſt on the clergy of all denominations, by infidels and libertines, is certainly very unjuſt; as is every thing elſe that
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010852_0003_0F852363B3307630"/>
they ſuffer from the miſtaken conceit that they are friends to the religion of <hi>JESUS CHRIST.</hi> If therefore the following eſſay could but ſerve to clear them of this charge, it might, by that means, reconcile to them the men of moſt repute in the polite world for philoſophy and enlarged ſentiments.</p>
            <p>NOR ought the author to be charged with ſo much as the remoteſt wiſh for any change in the national eſtabliſhment ſince he is ſo well pleaſed with the preſent national church, as to be fully ſatisfied it could never be ſucceeded by a better. If the preſent eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment ſerves the purpoſes of government, and is for the benefit of civil ſociety, (as ſeems very evident) it is all we can have from any ſuch eſtabliſhment of religion: and as ſome religious precedency ſeems abſolutely neceſſary in every ſtate, ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, and ſuch a toleration as we enjoy in this land, is all that any chriſtian can wiſh for. For he muſt greatly miſtake the religion of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> who ſhould think it was at all fit for a national church, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be practiſed by any whole nation of this world.</p>
            <p>EVERY man muſt ſee the truth of that propoſition of Archbiſhop <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon</hi>'s (with whatever propriety his lordſhip could maintain it) that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this world as ſuch, can only be the ſubject of temporal promiſes and threatnings, as it is not, as a nation, capable of any other than temporal rewards and puniſhments. But all the promiſes and threatnings, all the rewards and puniſhments connected with the religion of <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> are eternal; conſequently it cannot be a national religion.</p>
            <p>ANY man that thinks it may, would do well to conſider the laws given to <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s diſciples, and try if he can think of any nation of this world being governed by them, ſuch as, <hi>I ſay unto you, reſiſt not evil, &amp;c. Seek not ye what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, neither be ye of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind. For all theſe things do</hi> the nations of the world <hi>ſeek after, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS all polite nations have found it neceſſary to have an eſtabliſhed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſo they have alſo thought it proper to admit and authorize ſome public entertainments and diverſions.</p>
            <p>IF the former ſerves to promote loyalty to the ſtate, good neighbourhood, and decency of character among the ſubjects, theſe are valuable effects, and all we ought to expect from it.</p>
            <p>IF the latter ſerve to poliſh our manners, and keep perſons of leiſure and diſſipation out of worſe miſchiefs, they alſo have their uſe; for as a late

author ſays, "It is better for a man to ſee Sir John Brute acted on the ſtage, than to act him himſelf in the ſtreet." Whether this benefit will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ballance its other miſchiefs, is not for me to determine.</p>
            <p>THIS is all the author has to ſay to ſave himſelf from the change of being an enemy to the clergy, the eſtabliſhed church, or any other body of people wearing the chriſtian name.</p>
            <p>HE aſſures the reader he is far from grudging them any honours or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that they may obtain, only he would warn every one who may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to liſten to him, not to truſt them as ſure guides to heaven, left they too late find their miſtake.</p>
            <p>THE character and ſtation which the government allots the clergy in the church of England, and the perſonal excellencies of many of them of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, demand our veneration and reſpect, and ought to ſecure them from that illiberal and low abuſe which has been very unjuſtly caſt upon the whole body. In ſhort, the following pages do not reflect on the clergy for being clergy, but for corrupting the truth and miſleading their followers. If they can be cleared of this blame, the author promiſes to confeſs his fault in blaming them, as publicly as he now brings the charge. As the reader would be very little the wiſer, and not at all the better, for knowing who wrote this pamphlet, the author has reaſon to think it beſt, for the preſent, to be</p>

            <head>ANOTHER High Road to Hell.</head>
            <p>A MAN who has learned his religion only from the bible, will not be frightned by any alarming thing that may be ſaid of any of his ways, if the warning is unſupported by that ſacred authority.</p>
            <p>THE author of the pamphlet intitled, <hi>The ſtage the high road to hell,</hi> ſeems too much to have neglected this thought, having never produced one part of ſcripture, in which the meer repreſenting the various cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that are in the world is condemned. He may doubtleſs have very good reaſon for his apprehenſions, that attendance on and delight in theatrical performances, is extreamly dangerous to the ſouls of men; and he had certainly a juſt right to give warning of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he ſaw. It may indeed be queſtioned, whether ſeeing the characters in real life, is not yet more dangerous than ſeeing them repreſented on the ſtage; but as it is probable neither of us are diſpoſed for a cell or a hermitage, we may both do well to ſhun the dangers we ſee, and fairly give our neighbours warning.</p>
            <p>THE author of the following pages, without diſputing the miſchiefs done by the ſtage, or attempting to become an advocate for it, claims the ſame right to alarm the public with warning of another way to perdition, much more frequented and much leſs ſuſpected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more dangerous than that which the abovementioned author has deſcribed.</p>
            <p>IF that author has proved that the ſtage is uſed in a way utterly
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010852_0006_0F852365BA2C3640"/>
contrary to its pretence of ſerving the cauſe of morality, ſo the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing pages are intended to prove that the pulpit is uſed in a manner quite as oppoſite to any pretence it can have of ſerving the cauſe of real chriſtianity. So that the concluſion will be, if there is any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality among us, no thanks to the ſtage for it; and if there is any chriſtianity among us, no thanks to the pulpit. It ſhould ſeem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a very little occaſion of grief to a chriſtian, although it be true, that "Many among us are of opinion, that theatrical amuſements preclude the church, and render the preaching of its miniſters unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;" for this is no more to a chriſtian, than it would be to a modeſt man, ſhould he be told that one houſe of ill fame was getting the cuſtomers from another of equal or greater infamy. As the ſtage is charged with recommending evil things under fair appearances, ſo may the pulpit, with much greater aggravation as the greater pretence to ſolemnity and piety can add to it. If performers on the ſtage are to be blamed becauſe, "p. 4. <hi>they aſſume a feigned character and utter ſentiments to which the heart is a ſtranger,</hi>" how much more deteſtable muſt <hi>ſatan</hi>'s <hi>miniſters</hi> be, when <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>transformed as the miniſters of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs!</hi> As to the moral characters either of preachers or players, it ſeems better to drop all contention about them; for if preachers have been found fully as bad, in reſpect of moral character, as ever player was, the greater ſhame and cenſure will fall where the moſt grave and ſacred pretenſions were made. So, with this author's leave we will forget all the evil ſtories he tells of wicked players, leſt fame ſhould incline to compare them with many ſtrange ſtories of naughty clergymen; and inſtead of inſiſting on ſuch compariſons, let us only conſider the evil tendency of their trades. I cannot fully agree with this author in grudging the players their gain, ſeeing 'tis no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to any but ſuch as chuſe it; no man is taxed for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance, as they are for the clergy. As this author aſſures us, both at beginning and end of his performance, that his conſcience obliged him to bear this teſtimony againſt ſtage entertainments, we may well preſume, a man ſo conſcientious will readily agree to an appeal to the ſcriptures, for a determination of any queſtion about what ways lead men to perdition, although he has not himſelf made much uſe of them for this end.</p>
            <p>IF he had been much acquainted with his bible, it might have cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his zeal for the honour of <hi>black cloth,</hi> and have reconciled him to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010852_0007_0F85236660F633B0"/>
the expoſing the clergy as well as other men who may act ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly and wickedly, to the contempt they deſerve; whether by plays or any other way. And it might have ſhewed him too, that however foreign ſtage-entertainments may be from the goſpel, or however op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to it, yet that the doctrine and honour of the clergy are no leſs foreign or oppoſite: at leaſt a better recollection of the bible might have ſaved him from the miſtake of attributing thoſe words to <hi>Solomon,</hi> p. 4. Ded. <note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah xvii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked.</hi> And I the rather take notice of this little miſtake, becauſe if the author had regarded the important connection of thoſe words as they ſtand in the prophet Jeremiah, chap. xvil. 5—9, it might perhaps have ſomewhat abated his devout confidence in the leaders of religion. <hi>Curſed be the man that truſteth in man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>COULD a man, believing the ſcripture account of the Son of GOD, quote with ſuch full approbation that celebrated ſaying of Plato, as this author is pleaſed to give it us:
<q>If virtue was to appear in its native beauty to mankind, its charms would, with irreſiſtable force, captivate all hearts?</q>
Did not virtue appear in its native beauty to mankind, when the Son of GOD went about on earth doing good? But did the charms of virtue made viſible in him, captivate all hearts? A man that has not learning enough to be the wiſer for any thing that Plato or Seneca have ſaid, may clearly ſee that this zeal for virtue is a very different thing from delight in the perfectly virtuous character of the Son of GOD; and that it may ſubſiſt without any inclination to imitate that character.</p>
            <p>THE following pages go wholly on the ſuppoſition that the word of GOD, by which we muſt be judged at the laſt day, is alone ſufficient to point out to us the danger of all the various ways in which men go down to deſtruction. 'Tis only by this word that the perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious nature, and damnable tendency of the modern pulpit-entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can be diſcovered. And if that word does not warrant all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, it will be in vain for the author to talk of good meanings and pious wiſhes. It is regard to the doctrines and commandments of men, that makes the word of GOD of none effect, and leads men to ſtrain at goats and ſwallow camels; and if the author above refer'd to ſhould appear to be doing ſo, he is far from being ſingular. But if the religion of JESUS CHRIST, as preached by him and his apoſtles, be permitted to

determine which is the broad way that leadeth to deſtruction, and which the narrow way that leadeth to life eternal, we may come to find no leſs occaſion to ſound the alarm to the preachers and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, than to comedians and their admirers. And, however ſtrange it is, the purpoſe of the following pages is to ſhew, that the danger of the <hi>devout way</hi> to perdition is by far the greateſt, becauſe moſt trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and leaſt ſuſpected. Whether this is true or no is ſuſpended on the proof of the following propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT there is a devout as well as a profane way to eternal pedition.</p>
            <p n="2">2 THE preſent pulpit-entertainments in general lead men in this way.</p>
            <p>IF the ſcriptures keep us in countenance in maintaining theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, we ſhall not be fatally put to the bluſh, although we ſhould neither pleaſe men diſtinguiſhed by their piety, nor yet the advocates for thoſe amuſements at which devout people make wry faces. Nor indeed can we at all expect to pleaſe either.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT there is a devout way of going to hell</hi> cannot be doubted, if the new-teſtament is to determine upon it, ſo long as CHRIST's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Phariſees is to be found there: for they are poſitively declared to <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 15.</note> be the children of hell, and in a way that <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiil. 33.</note> could not eſcape damnation. He who knew what was in man, teſtified of them that <note n="‡" place="bottom">John viii. 44.</note> 
               <hi>They were of their father the devil, and would do his works:</hi> and he ſcarce pronounced a woe on any of the ſons of men in which they were chiefly intereſted.</p>
            <p>BUT I need not take pains to prove that theſe ancient people found a devout way to hell, for it is of no importance to us, if we are in no danger of going the ſame road. Whether therefore we are in any danger of taking that for the way to heaven in which they went down to hell, may deſerve a ſober inquiry. And we cannot do this without conſidering their way, and diſcovering how ſo plauſible a path came to have ſo fatal an end. That they were hypocrites, is true, but then this was ſeen by none but by him who knew their

hearts; for their conduct and appearance <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xvi. 15.</note> juſtified them <hi>before men,</hi> and they <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 28.</note> 
               <hi>outwardly appeared righteous to men</hi>; which they could not have done if they had not appeared to be <hi>ſincere, honeſt, ſober, chaſte,</hi> and in ſome caſes <hi>bountiful</hi> to the diſtreſs'd, as well as <hi>fervent in their devotions.</hi> No man could appear to be righteous among any people, wanting the appearance of any of theſe.</p>
            <p>THAT the Phariſee is repreſented as exalting himſelf in his prayers <note n="‡" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 10, 14.</note> is true, but he is charged with lying before his Maker when he ſays, "<hi>I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this publican. I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs:</hi> ſo that we are ſtill allowed to think what he ſaid of himſelf was true. Their knowledge about religious matters was ſo highly eſteemed, as that their judgment about CHRIST was thought ſufficient to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the evidence that attended his miracles, and the unavoidable concluſion againſt him is hinted by their ſaying, <note n="§" place="bottom">John vii. 48.</note> 
               <hi>Have any of the rulers or of the Phariſees believed?</hi> Their zeal for the divine law, lead them to be very ſcrupulous of any approach towards a breach of it; therefore they gave tithes of all that they poſſeſſed, even mint, anniſe, and cummin, and all herbs. They obſerved CHRIST's diſciples rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ears of corn in their hands on the ſabbath, and were offended; they deſired the people that needed healing to come on other days and be healed, and not on the ſabbath; ſo that they were a kind of SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIETY FOR REFORMATION OF MANNERS. And then, ſo ſolicitous were they that men of other nations might enjoy the divine law with them, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 15.</note> that they <hi>compaſſed ſea and land to make a proſelyte</hi> from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations.</p>
            <p>THIS ſhort ſketch of the Phariſees character (which might have been much enlarged) ſhews, that as far as men can ſee of one another, they had a good title to the place they held as firſt rate examples of human righteouſneſs. And this JESUS ſeems to allow when (he being about to ſhew how much farther the divine law extended than either his diſciples or the Jews thought) he ſaid to his diſciples, <note n="††" place="bottom">Matt. v. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no caſe enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> which is plainly ſaying, they are going devoutly to hell. Nor can we think that Saul of <hi>Tarſus</hi> was ſingular among them when, <hi>touching the righteouſneſs that is of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010852_0010_0F85236AD22007A8"/>
law</hi> (as they and he underſtood it) <hi>he was blameleſs.</hi> Or that the, were leſs perſwaded of being right, or leſs ſincere than he was, when he VERILY THOUGHT <hi>he</hi> OUGHT <hi>to do many things contrary to the name of</hi> JESUS <hi>of Nazareth.</hi> Accordingly they were as forward to claim a peculiar relation to GOD as any under the chriſtian name can be, and ſaid, <note n="*" place="bottom">John viii. 41.</note> 
               <hi>We have one father even</hi> GOD. And to this they had the ſanction of all that were eſteemed for ſtation in the church, or for wiſdom and piety, ſo that we cannot expect to ſee them outdone, either in their real character for piety and devotion, their attainments in wiſdom and righteouſneſs, or their confident claims on the peculiar favour of GOD. To perſons thus diſtinguiſhed from the common herd of mankind, it muſt be always very provoking to hear JESUS ſay, <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. xxi. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of</hi> GOD <hi>before you.</hi> Or yet more ſeverely, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xxiii. 23,</note> 
               <hi>Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> And in anſwer to their peculiar claim of being the children of GOD; to hear him ſay, <hi>Ye are of your father, the devil, and his works ye will do.</hi> Theſe ſayings and many more that might be mentioned fully prove one propoſition: there is a devout way to hell.</p>
            <p>AND we are as clearly told how this happened. <note n="§" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>They truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others.</hi> And this is the ſame account as Paul gives of the matter when he ſays, <hi>I bear them record that they have a zeal of</hi> GOD, <hi>but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of</hi> GOD<hi>'s righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD. This warrants us to ſay with the greateſt confidence, that all devout people, however diſtinguiſhed by the chriſtian name, if they are truſting in themſelves that they are righteous, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, are following them to perdition in the ſame devout way. This makes our way clear to the</p>
            <p n="2">2d Propoſition. <hi>The preſent pulpit-entertainments in general lead men in this way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE proof of this depends upon the evidence that ſhall be produced of their leading men to truſt in themſelves that they are righteous. 'Tis plain the Phariſees did not think themſelves <hi>abſolutely</hi> ſinleſs, but comparatively ſo, as being much nearer to the kingdom of heaven than
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010852_0011_0F85236B860ACC78"/>
publicans and harlots: but they never meant to deny that they had human infirmities and failings, elſe why did they faſt twice in the week, if they had no ſin to confeſs?</p>
            <p>AND indeed we find them not free of ſuſpicion leſt they were ſtill deficient, and all was not quite right with them: one of them enquires of CHRIST, <hi>What good thing ſhall I do that I may inherit eternal life? I have kept all the commandments, what lack I yet?</hi> So that theſe as well as modern devout people had their doubts and fears leſt they were not quite meet for eternal life. We may alſo obſerve, that they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all the difference between them and others to a work of divine grace, and ſaid, GOD <hi>I thank thee</hi> that I am not as other men are. Nay after all they ſeem jealous that the whole law is too extenſive for them; and therefore they wanted to find what was the <hi>main</hi> thing in religion, that if they ſhould be found wanting in ſome circumſtantials, yet they might be right in the main, being found in fundamentals, and having the root of the matter in them: therefore one of them aſketh of JESUS, <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. xxii. 36.</note> Maſter, which is the great commandment in the law? Their great miſtake was no more than this: they thought GOD would regard and accept them on account of that difference which himſelf had made between them and others, by implanting in them a principle of grace leading them to avoid ſin, and regard his law.</p>
            <p>THE parallel between theſe, and the bulk of devout people in our day, would be too obvious to need any more words about it, were it not that the modern Phariſees confeſs CHRIST in words, and ſay much about ſalvation by him; whereas thoſe ancient Phariſees called him a blaſphemer, and crucified him as ſuch. In order therefore to prove that the modern doctrine of the pulpit leads men to the ſame awful end, in the ſame pernicious way, as that in which the Jews <hi>ſtumbled, and fell, and were broken, and ſnared, and taken;</hi> we muſt prove that it is for ſubſtance the ſame as theirs. And if this doctrine be found to be parallel with the doctrine of thoſe who truſted in themſelves that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others, the concluſion muſt be, that whatever they pretend, they believe not the record that GOD hath given of his Son; and <note n="†" place="bottom">Mark xvi. 16.</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> As the great miſtake both of ancient and modern Phariſees is concerning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD, and a title to his favour, it may be neceſſary to ſtate the ſcriptural account of it, and compare the modern doctrine therewith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010852_0012_0F85236BA07668D8"/>THE ſcriptural account of this matter is, that GOD found <hi>none righteous, no, not one</hi> among the ſons of men; and that he pronounced a curſe on them all, becauſe they had <hi>not continued in all things written in his law to do them.</hi> But that, ſeeing the truth of GOD, declared in his law, could not be maintained, and ſin againſt that law paſs unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, he was pleaſed to lay on his beloved Son the iniquities of all with whom he partook in fleſh and blood, that he might deliver them <hi>from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for them.</hi> When he had fully honoured the law by obeying it, and bearing the curſe of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the guilty, he roſe from the dead, as the aſſurance that his work was perfect, and his offering for ſin accepted. As GOD declared himſelf well pleaſed in his offering for ſin, and has put it out of all doubt by his raiſing him from the dead, we can have a <hi>lively hope</hi> of the eternal <hi>inheritance</hi> no other way but <hi>by his reſurrection from the dead;</hi> for he hath made us accepted no other way but <hi>in the beloved.</hi> Nothing therefore ought (and nothing but ſome deſtructive lie can) deliver us from the fear of the curſe of GOD's law, but his being <hi>made a curſe</hi> for ſinners, <hi>and raiſed again for their juſtification.</hi> This was all he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his ſervant John when ſuffering baniſhment for his ſake, and when dying with fear at the ſight of his LORD; <note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. i. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Fear not, I am the firſt and the laſt: I am he that liveth and was dead; and behold I am alive for evermore, amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.</hi> This then is the great point to be kept in view in trying the ſpirits whether they are of GOD, viz. from what ariſes their hope of GOD's favour, or, what is the reaſon they give that men may not deſpair, when, conſcious of ſin, they think of ſtanding before GOD in judgment. The reaſon of their hope muſt be, either what they themſelves are diſtinction from thoſe who periſh; or elſe it muſt be, the work of the Son of GOD. The former was the Phariſees hope; the latter is the reaſon of hope among CHRIST's diſciples. Whoever lead men to the former as a reaſon of their hope, are as the Phariſees were, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xv. 14.</note> 
               <hi>blind leaders of the blind, and, if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi> And in them is fulfilled what the Prophet complained of, <note n="§" place="bottom">Iſaiah ix. 16.</note> 
               <hi>the leaders of this people cauſe them to err, and they that are led of them are deſtroyed.</hi> Now if the reader is heartily agreed with me that the hinge of good hope is not that by which one man is made more commendable in this world than another, but that in the Son of GOD by which he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from all meer men, even that he did no ſin, nor was guile found in his mouth: if (I ſay) the reader is agreed to ſay, GOD <hi>forbid
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010852_0013_0F85236C7869F4A0"/>
that I ſhould glory ſave in the croſs of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST, I have no doubt of his concurrence, in expoſing every falſe way, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable the names that patronizne it, with ſuch confidence as the Apoſtle had when he ſaid, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gal. i. 8.</note> 
               <hi>If an angel from heaven preach any other goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel unto you than that which the apoſtles preached, let him be accurſed. Let GOD be true, and every man a liar.</hi> Nor will he heſitate to ſay, that he that believes not that doctrine which the apoſtles were ſent to preach to the nations, let him be as morally, devoutly, ſincerely, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally righteous as ever ſinful man was, ſhall be damned. In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the modern doctrines with, and trying them by the divine rule, I ſhall take the liberty to repreſent them in my own words, that I may ſave myſelf and my readers the labour of large and numerous quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In doing this I ſhall confine myſelf to this ſingle, but the moſt Important point, viz. to ſhew how the modern <hi>miniſters of religion</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their followers to hope for eternal life.</p>
            <p>BY ſome we are told, that a <hi>ſober, virtuous, well-ſpent life, is the beſt preparative for death; and that conſciouſneſs of this has been a cordial to the heart of many a well diſpoſed chriſtian, when going out of this world.</hi> They aſſure us that <hi>conſciouſneſs of integrity, and juſt intention in life and action, may make a man ſurvey his paſt life without diſmay, although ſome frailties may be found about him which ſerve to ſhew that he was but a man, and in reſpect of thoſe he may hope for mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I HAVE only to obſerve on this ſource of hope, that if a man has not ſinned, <hi>he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> If he has ſinned, <hi>his righteouſneſs ſhall not profit him</hi>: he is under the curſe which GOD has unalterably pronounced <hi>on ſuch as continue not in all things written in the book of the law to do them</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 19.</note>: ſo there is no difference between him and others, for all have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of GOD. Deliverance from this curſe comes only from CHRIST being made a curſe for us; <hi>and he that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe be hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of</hi> GOD. <note n="‡" place="bottom">John iii. 18.</note> So that if there be any teachers of this hope, there are at leaſt ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the truth of the propoſition. For this doctrine ſtands thus: The virtuous man, although not free from ſin, hath a hope of eternal life, ſuch as the vicious man hath no foundation for, and ought not to entertain. But why not? if GOD will be pleaſed with leſs than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteouſneſs, who told them that he will not be pleaſed without
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010852_0014_0F85236D35DBFAA8"/>
any at all? The law requires perfect righteouſneſs; who hath altered it? or rather who hath diſgraced it, as not <hi>holy, juſt and good?</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Now we know that whatſoever the law ſeith, it ſaith to them that are under the law: that every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before</hi> GOD. This pretence of virtue is one of the ways in which, men, called chriſtians, truſt in themſelves that they are righteous; but it may be doubted whether theſe men of virtue and piety are ſo ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox as to thank GOD that they are not as other men are.</p>
            <p>OTHERS, who ſay leſs about virtue and piety as the reaſon of hope and do not boaſt of the ſupreme energy of theſe to make mens peace with GOD, tell us, <hi>if we ſincerely repent and unfeignedly believe the holy goſpel,</hi> we may entertain ſuch hopes as the unbelievers and impenitent are ſtrangers to, and ought not to entertain. Now this way of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may <hi>ſeem</hi> to have as many ſcriptures for it as there are importing that he that believes in JESUS CHRIST is juſtified by him. Yet if we examine it, we may find that it hinges all the hope of a ſinner on the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of his faith and repentance, as much as, in the former caſe, it is hinged on piety and virtue. If I unfeignedly believe, &amp;c. I may hope. But this is a goſpel that will give me no hope, till I can prove (or at leaſt get a good conceit of) my own ſincerity. And when I get this hope, what is the foundation of it, but a truſt in myſelf that I am righteous, ſo far as ſincerity is righteouſneſs? And thus my hope depends on that by which I am diſtinguiſhed from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and hypocrites. It is true, every ſincere penitent, and unfeigned believer of CHRIST's words, has good hope; but then his hope does not ariſe from any aſſurance of his own ſincerity, but from what the truth which he believes, teſtifies, about the ſincerity of CHRIST's heart and the perfection of his work. The hope that ariſes from our ſincerity in any thing, is certainly a very different hope from that which comes by hearing CHRIST ſay, <hi>Fear not, I am he that liveth and was dead,</hi> &amp;c. This truth, believed in the heart, may and will produce a joy that is unſpeakable and full of glory; while yet the man who believes it, is far from finding, or wiſhing to find, as a ſource of hope, any reaſon to vouch for the ſincerity of his heart, which, this very truth gives him to know, is <hi>deceitful above all things, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked.</hi> It is becauſe this ſincerity is a thing not ſo eaſily proved, that chriſtians, after they have profeſſed faith and repentance, are exhorted to <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</note> 
               <hi>examine themſelves, whether they be in the faith, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010852_0015_0F85236DE49FDEA8"/>
to prove themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. We are therefore confident to ſay, let the faith about which men are ſuppoſed to be unfeignedly employed, be expreſſed never ſo ſcripturally, and believed never ſo ſincerely, yet it is not the faith of GOD's elect, if the hope it gives does not ariſe wholly from the truth they believe, excluſive of any dependance on the ſincerity of their belief. Nothing is more common than for men to take it for granted that their faith is unfeigned, and their repentance ſincere; and yet it is alſo very common to ſee the hypocriſy of both expoſed in the lives of thoſe who are thus flattering themſelves. We muſt therefore conclude, that the goſpel affords a reaſon of hope and joy to <hi>ſinners,</hi> without any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a conceit of their own ſincerity to encourage their hope: and that our faith can never be proved to be unfeigned, but by its having the ſame effects as it uſed to have in all ſuch who knew the grace of GOD in truth. GOD purifies the hearts of men by the faith; and it is only faith working by love to CHRIST's name, that can prove it to be unfeigned; and that our hope and joy are not thoſe of the hypocrite. Now that <hi>hope</hi> of eternal life muſt be falſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, which is not founded on that which gives a <hi>title</hi> to eternal life. Our defective ſincerity does not give a title to eternal life, elſe is CHRIST dead in vain: therefore hope derived from it is only a hope which ſhall periſh, like the hope of the hypocrite. And all the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits uſed for promoting this hope which will make aſhamed, are ſo many inſtances of the pulpit being a way to hell.</p>
            <p>BUT all this cenſure on the buſtle men make about ſincerity will be granted, and the advocates for that doctrine deſpiſed as legaliſts, or ſome other name out of repute amongſt orthodox people; and all this, by ſuch as differ from them only in their taking a wider circuit, to come at laſt into the ſame road. The difference is, that inſtead of calling their idol <hi>ſincerity,</hi> they chuſe to call it <hi>grace, experience,</hi> or the <hi>new-creature,</hi> the better to diſguiſe their deceit and ſecure their party. We may the better underſtand theſe deceivers by attending to their way of ſpeaking comfort to their followers, when dejected with the conſciouſneſs of guilt and fear of divine wrath. This may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in a ſhort experimental dialogue between a leader of this ſort and and of his devout followers.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010852_0017_0F852370764D5630"/>
his righteouſneſs, now the language of your heart is, none but CHRIST. You uſed to ſlight, or it may be deſpiſe the people of GOD, now you love them, and not only in your own party, but in all the profeſſions of chriſtianity. This is ſuch a change as ſhews that you are not now dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, but may ſay, whereas I was once blind, now I ſee.</p>

               <p>But do not be ſuſpicious of the work of the ſpirit of GOD, for you cannot deny but you have found your heart's deſire to embrace CHRIST, and cloſe with him as offered to you in the goſpel. You have found much love to him, and have had many love tokens from him, and have been enabled to ſay, my beloved is mine, and I am his. Now you muſt call to mind theſe years of the right hand of the Moſt High, and not fear that he who hath done all this in you will caſt you off after all; for he hateth putting away.</p>

            <p>THIS is but a ſhort ſketch out of a cart-load of experimental divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but nothing can be plainer than that the hope <hi>ſqueezed</hi> out of this ſort of reaſoning, reſts as much on the truth of their regeneration, as it does in the former inſtance on the ſincerity of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And both of theſe are foreign to the hope given by the goſpel, which reſts neither more or leſs on any thing wrought in him to whom it gives hope, but merely on this teſtimony, that JESUS CHRIST was delivered to death for the offences of ſinners, and raiſed again for their juſtification.</p>
            <p>NOW as that is a man's righteouſneſs which gives him hope before GOD, we muſt ſay of theſe as of all the reſt, they truſt in themſelves that they are righteous, and deſpiſe others.</p>
            <p>ONLY that this latter is the more abominable, as it provides the moſt exquiſite gratification for devout pride, abuſes the moſt important ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſes and declarations to the vileſt purpoſes, and even makes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſilent, or of their party for fear of the grievous ſin of unbelief; and by alarming their apprehenſion, leſt queſtioning this evidence of their being regenerate, ſhould be ſome approach toward the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin againſt the HOLY GHOST.</p>

into the ſame road as the reſt, and without troubling themſelves or their hearers about regeneration or experience, aſſure them and urge them to believe that GOD hath made a grant of CHRIST and all his benefits to all mankind, ſo as to give ſufficient ground for any man to appropriate them to himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſay without reſerve or heſitation, CHRIST loved <hi>me</hi> and gave himſelf for <hi>me,</hi> ſo that I ſhall never periſh, but have everlaſting life. And if this appropriation be warranted in the word of GOD, the abſolute aſſurance of eternal life muſt certainly be inſeparably connected with it. But what is the ground of the hope that comes this way? If CHRIST gave himſelf for all the human race, and ſo for me among the reſt, I can have no aſſurance from thence, of my ſalvation, without being aſſured at the ſame time that the whole human race ſhall be ſaved. If my hope depends on being aſſured that he gave himſelf for <hi>me,</hi> in a ſenſe in which he did not give himſelf for them that periſh, on what evidence peculiar to me does this aſſurance of his having died for <hi>me,</hi> as he did not for them that periſh, depend? Or in other words, as there is no mention or deſcription of me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in the ſcripture account of CHRIST's death, what is there about me to aſſure me that he died for me? The anſwer can only be, becauſe I have been enabled to appropriate CHRIST and all his benefits to myſelf, which thoſe others have not been ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to do. Thus the hope of eternal life does not ariſe ſolely from what CHRIST has done, but in part at leaſt on what I have been enabled to do, and by doing it, to diſtinguiſh myſelf from others. Nay ſo important is this appropriating act, that all that which CHRIST has done can be no comfort to me without it! Now if I might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, with proper deference to my ſuperiors, I would expoſtulate a little with all theſe different parties, and ſay, Why all this difference and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity among people that are really agreed in the main? For ſurely that which can hope to a ſinner before his Maker, muſt be the main thing in religion. As all are agreed that is a good diſpoſition of mind brought forth into act and exerciſe that gives hope, why ſhould they diſagree about the name they call it by? If one calls it the <hi>habits of virtue and piety:</hi> another calls it <hi>ſincere repentance and unfeigned faith:</hi> another, <hi>the change wrought in man by the ſpirit of</hi> GOD <hi>implanting a principle of grace in him:</hi> and another calls it, <hi>the act of appropriation:</hi> why ſhould they differ about words and names, ſeeing they might even exchange names with each other without injuring the main thing in any of their ſyſtems at all? But whether theſe things can be compromiſed or not, matters little to any lover of the goſpel which CHRIST and his apoſtles preached, for neither party have any thing to do with that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010852_0019_0F852371A2B06EA0"/>
goſpel but to corrupt it. After all that has been ſaid, it will be no ſurprize to the reader to be told that modern chriſtianity is a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religion from that which JESUS CHRIST and his apoſtles taught. That it differs from it in that which is the main thing in any religion; even, what it is that can give hope to a dying ſinner, who is to be eternally happy or miſerable. If it ſhould be enquired, where may that religion be ſeen which CHRIST and his apoſtles taught? The anſwer is, In the bible, and no where in any other form than it appears in there. He that has learned from his bible what chriſtianity was, and how it appeared at the firſt, will immediately know it from all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits, if he ſhould ſee it in the world.</p>
            <p>FAIRLY to examine the various modern pretenſions to chriſtianity, we muſt compare the effects of it in the lives of its profeſſors, with the effects produced in the beginning among them that believed and knew the grace of GOD in truth. It cannot be doubted but the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents will produce the ſame effects in all that really believe them to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>THIS is a rule by which CHRIST taught his diſciples to detect falſe teachers. <note n="*" place="bottom">Matt. vii. 15, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Beware of falſe prophets, which come to you in ſheep's cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye ſhall know them by their fruits: do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles? Even ſo every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit: neither can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt tree bring forth good fruit. Wherefore by their fruit ye ſhall know them.</hi> By this divine rule we ought to judge and to be judged. And whenever we ſee among profeſſors of chriſtianity, a ravening after riches, honour, eſteem, influence, or any other thing contrary to the humble and ſelf-denying character of the Son of GOD, we can be at no loſs to know what is hidden under the ſheep's cloathing. If we ſee real chriſtianity, we ſhall find a people, although <hi>in a great trial of affliction and deep poverty, abounding in the riches of their liberality</hi>; and eſteeming this only to be <hi>pure and undefiled religion before</hi> GOD <hi>and the Father, to viſit the fatherleſs and the widow in their affliction, and to keep themſelves unſpotted from the world:</hi> and eſteeming that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and corrupt religion that teaches men apologies for the neglect of this. But if we look on modern chriſtianity we ſee clergymen, of every ſort and ſect, courting applauſe and popularity, maintaining
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010852_0020_0F852375807BCF50"/>
their clerical dignity and pretence to ambaſſadorſhip, enlarging their incomes by every mean in their power, laying up treaſures to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize their families, indulging in voluptuouſneſs and expenſive living, while the poor ſtarve for food and have no covering from the cold. Thus did not CHRIST. Thus do not chriſtians. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them</hi> for, <hi>he that ſaith he abideth in</hi> CHRIST, <hi>ought himſelf alſo ſo to walk, even as he walked</hi> Every one muſt ſee how eaſy it would be to draw the contraſt between ancient and modern chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to a great length; but this ſpecimen may ſuffice to ſhew, that we cannot call the chriſtianity commonly profeſſed in Europe, under various forms, the religion taught by JESUS CHRIST; without putting darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, calling evil good, and good evil. If it appears that the modern doctrine of the pulpits, although diverſified enough to be named <hi>legion,</hi> is calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a deluſive, and deſtructive hope, and that the teachers and abettors of ſuch doctrine are alſo the example of an impure and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt religion, that does not teach its votaries, and influence them, to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world, we muſt conclude and maintain that we have proved, that the pulpit has abundantly more right than the ſtage, to be called the high way to hell.</p>
            <p>PRESUMING on this I ſhall conclude with a paragraph borrowed and a little varied from the ſevere reflection on players in <hi>The ſtage the high road to hell</hi> Only think of preachers inſtead of ſtage-players, and the paragraph will run thus.
<q>What muſt we think of men who make it their whole buſineſs to draw in deluded mortals, to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving hope of eternal life, by diſguiſing the truth, with all the deceitful arts and allurements which their genius and intereſt can ſuggeſt! May they not be conſidered as Daemons in a human ſhape, who thus purſue the ſame end as the firſt deceiver? Are they not the worſt enemies of mankind? Thoſe ſurely who debauch the conſciences of their fellow-creatures are their worſt enemies, and muſt be deemed by all that fear GOD, greater deſtroyers than mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers and highway robbers; for what are life and property if weighed in a balance with eternal ſalvation? Or what is the guilt of thoſe who deſtroy the body only, when compared with the heinouſneſs of their guilt who deceive our ſouls, by leading us to truſt in that which cannot ſave us from the wrath of him who is able to deſtroy both ſoul and body in hell?</q>
