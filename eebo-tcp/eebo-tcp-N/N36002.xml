            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE undertaken a piece of buſineſs of no ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that of eſpouſing the cauſe of a million and an half of human beings, now groaning under the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal yoke of ſlavery: and I have been induced to put this publication under your protection, the rather, becauſe I am convinced, that in many inſtances, the principles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained have been adopted already. In this work, I ſpeak to men of a great variety of ſentiments; but I ſhall claſs them briefly under two heads; viz. thoſe who believe in the ſcriptures and all that is therein contained; and thoſe who take reaſon for their guide: and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the former of theſe, I ſhall only remark, that they may find many and ſtrong proofs in the ſcriptures, of the truth of what I have advanced in the courſe of this work—With regard to the latter, reaſon will not admit, that any man has a right to another man's money or other property; and conſequently that he has not a right to uſurp that time which the Almighty has given every man, to provide ſubſiſtance and comfort for himſelf and family; and I am perſuaded, that many of you, my fellow citizens, have long ſince conſidered the ſlave-trade as both iniquitous and unreaſonable; and however a man may ſay that a ſlave, who has been bought with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:047013_0004_10229051AEFDADA8"/>
is his property; yet that does not alter the fraud of the principle, any more than a man buying ſtolen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a thief, and paying his money for it, gives him a warrantee title thereto; in the one caſe, the property has been clandeſtinely obtained; in the other, the man's li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty has been withheld by force, and in defiance of juſtice and humanity; however, ſome of my fellow-citizens, may not approve this work, yet I hope they will read it with attention, and the time may come when they may ſee the truth contained in it; namely, that juſtice and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are the two greateſt virtues that diſtinguiſh man from the brute creation; and I have long admired the diſintereſted philanthropy of the Quakers with reſpect to the Africans, which in my opinion is their brighteſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic; and though they ſeem to be thwarted in their benevolent intentions at preſent, yet I hope to ſee the time, when their moſt ſanguine expectations on that head will be realized; and I ſhall only add, that if this work ſhould be fortunate enough to meet with approbation, and be the cauſe of bettering the condition of only one human being, I ſhall be happy that I have undertaken it, hoping therefore for your indulgence,</p>

               <p>I AM fully convinced, that ſuch a publication as this will meet violent oppoſition in the minds of many who are bound more by intereſt than juſtice or humanity; and if a man betray no ſigns of flagrant injuſtice in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dealings among the red of mankind, with reſpect to pecuniary matters, be is generally cryed up for an honeſt man, a man of unſpotted reputation &amp;c. but we are too apt to look over his conduct, as it relates to the poor ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant African, groaning under the yoke which he has laid upon him, and that any particular deſcription of mankind whether of one, or another ſtature or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

But altho' this be the general acceptation of the term ſlave-trade yet it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that every ſyſtem, whether political, religions or domeſtic, that tends to ſetter the mind or body of man, and deprive him of the utmoſt extent of his rights in a greater or leſs degree, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047013_0006_10229055AE2752A8"/>
conſider the two extremes, of Deſpotiſm and Slavery, as they apply to individuals only.</p>
               <p>In order to come at the truth of any matter, it is often improper to take it up in that ſtate, in which we find it, as coming through a number of hands; the real ſtate of the caſe may be obſcured by falſehood and deceit, and it is therefore neceſſary to inveſtigate the ſubject to the very ſource, by which means it is more than probable we may come at the true ſtate of the caſe. That it has been cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary in all ages and countries, ſince the earth has been tolerably inhabited, to keep ſlaves, is a truth, which, though it cannot be denied, yet it ought to be lamented for the paſt and avoided for the future; and in the firſt ſettlement of the world after the deluge, there being little or no government among mankind, to reſtrain the ſtrong and turbulant, and protect the weak and more peaceable, it is no wonder if a few ruffians of one neighbourhood, depending more upon their own ſtrength, than any regard to juſtice, ſhould go to another, pillage the place, and carry off not only the ſpoils, but oftentimes the children of the helpleſs inhabitants; which children, being kept continually as ſlaves, and brought up in that ſtate, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no idea of any other ſituation of life, became recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to it, and appeared no way anxious about changing their ſtation; but however reconciled a man may be to a ſtate of ſlavery, or however ſatisfied with his lot he may appear in the eyes of the world to be, yet all this does not alter the fraud of the principle on the part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror or maſter. It is in the above manner that ſlavery has crept in upon mankind by degrees, and been handed down from generation to generation, until it has arrived at the preſent period, in which it is continued and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a more criminal extent than has ever before been equalled in the annals of the world; and that it was cuſtomary in the firſt age after the deluge, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors to make ſlaves or captives of the conquered, can eaſily be proved to the ſatisfaction of any one who believes in the old teſtament, in the caſe of the Sodomites being
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047013_0007_10229057422D6B38"/>
carried away captive, by Chedalaomer, king of the Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites or Perſians, after he had defeated them; and we alſo read, that Abraham hearing of this defeat of the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, and that his nephew's lot was among the captives, armed his own ſervants to the number of three hundred and eighteen, and purſuing the conquerors, overtook them, attacked them and defeated them, recovering all the ſpoils which they had taken, together with the men of Sodom. As we do not read that Abraham ever went to war, either before or after this expedition, it is plain that he could not have got theſe ſervants by conqueſt; and therefore muſt have got them by ſome other means; and the moſt probable preſumption is that he bought them from ſome of the neighbouring conquerors, who either having enough others, or thinking it unſafe to keep too many among themſelves, leaſt they might attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain their liberty, or perhaps in order to enable them the better to carry on their depredations, fell into the method of ſelling them to thoſe who would give the higheſt price for them.<note n="*" place="bottom">As to thoſe who do not believe in the Scriptures, they may find almoſt innumerable proofs in hiſtory of nations and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals making ſlaves of their conquered enemies, particularly the ancient Aſſyrians, and the Romans. Hiſtory abounds with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of this nature, but it is needleſs at preſent to ſay any thing further upon the ſubject.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As I have before ſtated, the avowed object of this publication, is to prove in a ſatisfactory manner the fraud and unreaſonableneſs of the preſent ſyſtem of ſlavery, as it applies to the unhappy Africans; not only as it relates to bringing an additional number into the country, but alſo as it relates to thoſe already here; and it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by many of the advocates for this inhuman traffic, that "the Africans are the ſeed of Cain, and that the mark which the great Creator ſet upon their forefather, was to change his colour from white to black, and that this colour was to follow his poſterity as long as the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047013_0008_10229059CA8B8620"/>
world ſtands, and that ſlavery was to be their unalterable lot, during that time." To this I reply, that the mark ſet upon Cain, as far as I can diſcover from the bible, was no other than a diſtinction of him from the reſt of mankind, in order that no one ſhould lay violent hands upon him and ſlay him; for it evidently appears to me that God intended to puniſh him while here upon earth by thoſe ſtings of conſcience, which guilt, and the merited contempt of the reſt of mankind, never ſail to bring upon the wretch who is ſo unfortunate as to deſerve them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we form any probable opinion, whether the mark ſet upon Cain, was any change in his colour or not; it might have been a crop of the ear, or a thouſand other things, as well as a change of his colour; but admitting that his colour was changed, it might as well have been purple, green, yellow, &amp;c. as black; and the black people might as well contend that before that time, all men were black, and that Cain was made white; and ſtill have as good grounds to argue upon, as the advocates for ſlavery have, when they ſay that Cain was made black; for I do not recollect any paſſage in the bible that ſays what was Adam or Eve's colour, and add to this, we cannot find any paſſage to juſtify an opinion, that any of Cain's ſeed were in the ark; and if there were, it muſt have come from the wives of ſome one or more of the Patriarchs, or have been the wife of ſome one or other of Noah's ſons. As the Chronology in the male line is brought down from Adam, by which it plainly appears that all the males who were in the ark, were deſcended from Seth, the third ſon of Adam; and as we read, and have every reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the deſcendants of Seth held no intercourſe with thoſe of Cain, it amounts almoſt to poſitive proof that Cain's poſterity were all cut off by the deluge.<note n="*" place="bottom">As this work may fall into the hands of many who do not believe that there ever was a deluge which deſtroyed all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, except Noah and the other ſeven perſons mentioned in the account given of that event in the bible; I ſhall only deſerve that if they object to that belief they muſt alſo of neceſſity, object to the belief of there ever having been ſuch a man as Cain; both thoſe accounts reſting upon the ſame foundation, viz. the credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the authors of the bible, let them be who they may.</note> But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047013_0009_1022905C41B96418"/>
for argument ſake, that the wives of Noah's ſons, were entirly of the blood of Cain, it would then follow, of courſe, that their poſterity (being of the ſeed of Cain on the one ſide, and that of Seth on the other) they would be the equal deſcendants of both thoſe anceſtors; and therefore it would be impoſſible to diſtinguiſh between them, which was to be conſidered as the poſterity of the one, and which the poſterity of the other; and for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſuppoſe Cain's poſterity (according to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or rather aſſertions, of the advocates of ſlavery) to have been black, and the poſterity of Seth to have been white, by the intermarriage of Noah's ſons with women deſcended from Cain, and according to the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, their children muſt have been between black and white, or in other words, what we term mulattoes; and thoſe children having no other colour to intermarry with, would never to the preſent generation have varied their colour (except according to the intenſe heat of ſome, and cold of other climates) nor as I have juſt obſerved, would it be poſſible for any one of them to convince the other, that he was the perſon alluded to in God's ſetting a mark upon Cain, and muſt therefore be his ſervant; as the other would have full as good a foundation to retort it upon the firſt, and ſay that he was the ſeed of Cain, and thus would mankind be eternally ſheding the blood of man in vain, without a poſſibility of ever arriving at the right of the ſtory.</p>
               <p>As for my own part I cannot conceive that the Creator ever intended to put ſuch a ſtumbling block in the way of mankind, much leſs how could we (at the diſtance of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of four thouſand years after the flood) pretend to ſay, "this or that man is one of Cain's poſterity; and I being one of the deſcendants of Seth, am his right and

lawful maſter." And again, admitting the wife of one of Noah's ſons only to have been a deſcendant of Cain, and that the diſtinction could eaſily be made between the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the one and the poſterity of the other two; it is hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an idea the moſt derogatory to the juſtice of the great Creator, to ſuppoſe he would be guilty (not only of injuſtice but of double injuſtice) firſt, to inflict a heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary puniſhment upon one man and his poſterity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thouſands, or perhaps millions of innocent perſons muſt ſuffer in an abject ſtate of ſlavery, for the guilt of one man who had ſinned; and ſecondly, that his revenge not being ſatiated upon the firſt, that he ſhould blend the ſeed of the innocent with that of the guilty, and deal out the bitter cup of ſlavery and diſgrace to their poſterity to the end of time. And I believe the Almighty (to uſe the language of Mr. Paine) to be too juſt to do any ſuch a thing, and too Almighty to be driven to the neceſſity of doing it. I never can be brought over to join a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine that requires me to have ſo mean an opinion of my Creator, eſpecially when it reſts on ſo ſlender a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, I truſt I ſhall remove the belief of the Africans now among us, being the deſcendants of Cain, from the mind of every perſon who ſhall ſee this work, unleſs he be a perſon who, loſt to every ſentiment of humanity or benevolence, ſeeks only to hoard up riches at the expence of injured humanity, and by ſtifling reaſon, morality, and every generous ſentiment of the human heart to carry his favorite deſign into execution.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>HAVING in the foregoing chapter offered my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſuppoſing that the preſent generation of Africans, are not the deſcendants of Cain; I propoſe in the preſent one, to inveſtigate this matter a little further; hoping that I ſhall ſufficiently prove at all events, that the ſlave-trade is both unreaſonable and unjuſt. It is ſaid, by another claſs of the advocates for the ſlave-trade, that "they are deſcended from Canaan, the ſon of Ham, and grand-ſon of Noah, and that they lay under this curſe for the ſin which Canaan's father (Ham) committed by making ſport of Noah when he was drunk in his tent;" and that the Africans are deſcended from Ham, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly probable, both from ſcripture, and hiſtory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Both of which agree that Ham was the firſt ſettler of Egypt, from whence it is more than probable his deſcendants penetrated into, and peopled the interior and more ſouthern part of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> But what can be the reaſon that the curſe is only in part put in execution (in that there are millions of Africans ſtill at liberty, and conſequently not fulfilling the ſentence paſſed upon them) I am totally at a loſs to account for. Beſides, it appears from the bible, that Noah had been drunk but juſt before he paſſed the ſentence upon Canaan; and it does not appear to me, that a man who had juſt been laying dormant the powers of reaſon, the greateſt bleſſing that God has given to man, was at that time a fit judge to pronounce ſentence upon a man who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, and much leſs againſt the ſon who was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of what the father had done.</p>
               <p>But what does the ſentence amount to? is it any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary puniſhment which was to be inflicted upon Canaan, for what his father had done? No—it was to lay his whole offſpring under the curſe of ſlavery, for a fault committed by his father, of which he was innocent, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047013_0012_10229063DF7AF9A8"/>
which (it is not probable) was a greater fault than that committed by Noah himſelf, in getting drunk: in ſhort, Noah ſeems by the reading of the paſſage, to have been over-ruled by his paſſion, at the time of his curſing his grand-ſon; and whether or not this may be the caſe, I cannot find from ſcripture or reaſon, whence he derived his authority to curſe him; or the power to give efficacy to his denunciations after they were made. Neither does it appear to me, to correſpond with divine or moral juſtice or mercy, that the ſon ſhould be made liable for the ſins of the father; much leſs, that his poſterity for four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, ſhould continue ſlaves for the expiation of his guilt; and add to all this, that one of the prophets has ſaid (and we are told that it is blaſphemy to diſbelieve them) no longer ſhould the proverb be uſed<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 18, 2.</note> "that the fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth been ſet on edge." From whence I infer that man is to be accountable for his own actions only, and indeed the ſequel of the chapter plainly demonſtrates it to be ſo.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing Noah to have been in a perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed ſtate of mind at the time of his curſing his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I cannot ſee how that curſe ought to effect him or his poſterity, and how many daily inſtances do we ſee of men curſing their brothers, children, &amp;c. and yet we do not ſee that thoſe curſes have any effect whatſoever; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as may be produced by the influence of the curſer among men,<note n="†" place="bottom">By allienating their affections from the curſed.</note> and I ſhould rather take it for an example of the folly of ſuch imprecations, than any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that ought to awe a child into an undue obedience of an unjuſt and unreaſonable command, of a ſordid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and in a word, I diſpute the right of Noah or any other man that ever lived, to curſe his offſpring yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, thereby entailing ſlavery upon them. My father had no right to curſe me, and if he had done it, it would not have had any bad effect upon me: I have no right to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:047013_0013_102290681940D800"/>
curſe my offspring, neither had Noah, or any other man, a right which was not alſo applicable to every other man.</p>
               <p>To ſum up the whole—If Noah had a right to curſe his grand-ſon and his poſterity, it certainly admits, that every other man had a right to do the ſame with reſpect to their grand-ſons &amp;c. and according to that doctrine, we ſhould ſoon have the whole human race curſed into ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ſome real or ſuppoſed miſdemeanor, and none left for maſters, to lord it over them. A thing, that is inconſiſtent in itſelf, and morally impoſſible.</p>
               <p>From theſe conſiderations, I am fully convinced, that the ſentence paſſed upon Canaan has nothing at all to do with the preſent ſtate of ſlavery, into which the unhappy Africans are plunged.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore proceed to offer a few other remarks, in order to ſhew, as far as I am capable, the abſurdity of this hateful traffic of human fleſh and blood.</p>

               <head>CHAP III.</head>
               <p>HAVING mentioned two principle points on which the advocates for the ſlave-trade place their dependence, and having offered my reaſons for viewing the ſubject in a different light, I ſhall next proceed to ſtate a third aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their's, and endeavour to confute it as well as I can both from ſcripture and reaſon. They ſay that the colour, hair, &amp;c. of the Africans, is different from that of a white man, and that theſe differences are ſufficient evidences that the Almighty intended them for ſlaves. What an abſurd argument is this! to ſay that he who knows no difference between man and man, ſhould have ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality for this, that, or the other colour; or if he had, might we not as reaſonably expect him to be partial to the blacks as the whites; or to the tawny coloured Indian as either?</p>
               <p>Reader, if you believe in the old or new teſtament, you may find many paſſages in them which altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the practice of making ſlaves of our fellow creatures; and that they are our fellow-creatures cannot be denied; they have a rational mind, if properly cultivated; many of them are perſons of bright talents, but for the moſt part, thoſe talents are loſt to mankind for want of proper culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and encouragement.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt ſays, that the firſt, and great command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is "thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength;" and that the ſecond is like unto it, namely, "thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf." In the firſt place then ſearch the new teſtament, and you will find it poſſitively proved, that every man breathing is our neighbour, according to the doctrine of the aforementioned great philanthropiſt, who had the moſt unbounded compaſſion for all men, and was a great lover of mercy. That the Africans are men, I preſume the moſt barefaced perſon in America, will not pretend to deny; it therefore reſults, from theſe proofs,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047013_0015_1022906C1A146C10"/>
firſt, that the Africans are men, and ſecondly, that all mankind are our neighbours; that the keepers of ſlaves are guilty of a breach of the commandment that is the ſecond one in magnitude; and as long as that ſin is left unrepented of, he can never enter the kingdom of heaven (according to the Chriſtian religion) and if it is repented of, and the cauſe not removed, it is juſt leaving the ſame thing to be repented of again at a future day. It is as if a thief having repented of his former actions, continues the ſame courſe of life ſaying, that he could repent of his future actions at a future time. <note n="*" place="bottom">This kind of conduct is holding up the idea of keeping a running book account with the Almighty, ſometimes charging, and ſometimes giving credit.</note> Again—Jeſus Chriſt ſays, do injuſtice to no man; how can a follower of his reconcile theſe paſſages to his own conduct, in keeping his brother a ſlave? If a man has wrought hard, and earned a ſum of money, is it juſt that another ſhould come, and take it away from him? I preſume that every man of reaſon will ſay not; if this is not juſtice, neither is it juſt to withhold from him, that time in which, by his induſtry he may acquire that money, whether it be more or leſs.</p>
               <p>Then if Jeſus Chriſt has commanded his followers to do injuſtice to no man, and on a careful examination, a man finds that he is oppreſſing his neighbour (perhaps the widow, or the orphan) and conſequently doing injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to ſome perſon, I ſay, how ill do that man's actions accord with the profeſſions of his lips, or with the amiable conduct of him whom they pretend to follow, who never injured a man in his life, much leſs, enſlaved him. It is further ſaid, by the ſame perſon (Jeſus Chriſt) in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring men to ſervants of a great man, who went a long journey, that one of the ſervants got drunk and began to beat and abuſe the other ſervants in his lord's abſence, and that he was puniſhed ſeverely for it at his lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. From this I draw an inference, that the Almighty
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047013_0016_1022906F6F8A70D0"/>
is the Lord there ſpoken of, and that men are the ſervants; and that they are to be called to account hereafter for their actions; if ſo, what muſt be the ſituation of many who having enſlaved their fellow ſervants, abuſe them without mercy? in ſhort, their conduct is diametrically oppoſite to the mild and philanthropic doctrine taught by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>We come next to take a view of the manner of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſlaves in Africa. This is done in a variety of ways; firſt, two nations being at war with each other, the poor wretches who are ſo unfortunate as to be taken priſoners, are ſold by the captain to the firſt good bidder. Secondly, I am told, that their princes exerciſe a deſpotic ſway over them, by which, they will ſell hundreds annually to all countries that want them. Thirdly, for any offence committed againſt their laws, or rather barbarous and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary cuſtoms, the king will ſell them which bears ſome affinity to the Britiſh government, ſending their (pretended) offenders to Botany-Bay; only with this difference, that the latter ſend them for a certain term, whereas the former ſend them not only during life, but for generations yet unborn. Fourthly, if any man owes a debt which he is unable to pay, the creditor ſeizes upon the firſt of the debtor's family that falls in his way; ſells him, or her at the next ſea-port town, to the beſt bidder; and thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails ſlavery upon a man's poſterity, on account of a trifling debt, which perhaps a few days labour would diſcharge; and fifthly, the officers and crews of ſhips, often kidknap the innocent creatures, particularly children, in the woods and along the ſea coaſt. There may be many other methods of obtaining them, but theſe are the chief with which I am acquainted.</p>
               <p>Let me aſk any man of common ſenſe or reaſon, if he can find the man innocent who having been in the Britiſh or French ſervice, and having taken a priſoner, has ſold him to an American; or would not the purchaſer be equ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty with the ſeller? certainly he would, if he knew that the ſeller came diſhoneſtly by that property which he
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:047013_0017_1022907105C13888"/>
ſold to him; and certainly no man can come ſo honeſtly by another man, as to be authorized to make ſale of him, as of a horſe or a cow. In the like manner let him take any of the other caſes that I have mentioned, and conſider what ought to be done with the man who has been guilty of one of theſe means of oppreſſing his neighbour. In a word, let any man of reaſon or candour (I care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is a religious man or not) take the matter home to himſelf, and ſay how he would reliſh to have his wife and children, or either of them, or perhaps, his brother or ſiſter, torn away from him and dragged to a foreign country, he knows not where, nor how to be uſed. Let him contemplate the wife of his boſom, or a beloved ſiſter, laboring in the open field with little or no cloathing to keep them decent, or guard them from the inclemency of the weather; with an unmerciful wretch of a driver, who knows no more of humanity than a tyger or a panther, to abuſe them on every frivolous occaſion; and let him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them from the field to the wretched hut, in which they ſpend their melancholy nights; and view them with a ſcanty morſel of miſerable food, ſcarce ſufficient to keep nature alive. Having brought his imagination to this point, let him lay his hand upon his heart, and in the preſence of him who made man, ſay whether or not this is juſtice, mercy, reaſon, or religion. If he cannot give it his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, when it applies to himſelf or his connections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither ought he when it applies to others, for that would not be doing what he would wiſh to have done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I am not, as many may think I am, for ſetting the Africans free immediately, in that ſtate of ignorance and darkneſs in which they have been gropeing this long time. But I ſhall, in the enſuing chapter, give ſome hints of a plan, which I have engendered in my own mind, for ſetting them all free in time, and making worthy citizens of them. Permit me reader, to aſk you one queſtion; ſuppoſe yourſelf taken by any means whatever, and carried into a foreign country, and there uſed as many of the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are here; would you hold any attempt too hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047013_0018_10229073773A84F0"/>
to regain your liberty and return to your country and friends? certainly not; why then condemn another man for that which in yourſelf you would eſteem the greateſt virtue in your compoſition, the love of liberty? If you do, you act contrary to that ſublime and glorious principle, "do as you would wiſh to be done by." A few words more, and I will cloſe this chapter. At the time when the American war commenced, it was declared that all men were born, and of right ought to be free; and this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple was held up as the creed of nine tenths of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in America. Let him then, who fought for liberty upon thoſe principles, and he who has any thing to ſay in praiſe of the glorious Fourth of July, 1776, remember that he is acting diametrically oppoſite to thoſe principles, provided he keeps either man, woman, or child in ſlavery.</p>

               <p>IN the former part of this work, I have endeavoured to convince all men of the injuſtice and unreaſonableneſs of keeping ſlaves. I come now to ſuggeſt a plan for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them free: with regard to this, people may differ greatly, it being a matter of great magnitude; for my own part, I ſhall only attempt to drop a few hints on the ſubject. To ſet all the ſlaves in America free at once, in their preſent ignorant ſtate of mind, would be fraught with great danger to the community at large; and ſtill more ſo to individuals. The plan therefore which I would recommend is this; that every perſon having a ſlave, from ten years old, and younger, or that may be born hereafter, be obliged to regiſter the name and alſo the time and place of birth of the ſaid ſlave, in an office to be kept in each diſtrict for that purpoſe. And let each ſuch perſon be obliged upon penalty of forfeiting the ſum of —to teach or cauſe to be taught, to the ſaid ſlave,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:047013_0019_102290750BB1AAE8"/>
the arts of reading and writing by the time he or ſhe ſhall have attained the age of fifteen years. By this means, they may be ſnatched from ignorance and ſuperſtition, and the way fairly paved for making good citizens of them when they come to be ſet free, which might be fixed at the age of one or two and twenty; during which time, they ought not to be allowed to be taken out of one ſtate into another, leaſt they ſhould at laſt be cheated out of their freedom. Perhaps ſome people may ridicule the idea of ſetting the Africans free, becauſe they are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in keeping them ſlaves; but every man who has the feeling of a man, muſt acknowledge, that though the keeping of ſlaves has acquired the ſanction of cuſtom, yet it is unjuſt in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word. Hence I am inclined to hope that my propoſition, after receiving amendments, from abler pens, may meet the ideas of moſt people who are generally agreed that it is not right to keep them, but diſagree as to the method of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them at liberty. If I have offended any man, by the open manner in which I have ſpoken of this infamous traffic, I would not have him blame me for ſpeaking my ſentiments upon the ſubject; but rather blame himſelf for his imprudence in leaving a door open to cenſure. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider man (whoever thou art, that enſlaveſt thy fellow creature) that it would be far better for thee to take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per meaſures in hand for ſetting him free at a convenient time, than by tyrannizing over him all the days of his life; to make him thy enemy and perhaps put thy life in danger from his thirſt for revenge; and above all, render thyſelf obnoxious to the great Creator, who is thy maſter. If the Africans were free, the country would receive a great addition to its preſent ſtrength; becauſe every one of this hardy race of people, who had by their induſtry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a property, though ever ſo little, would no doubt ſtand in defence of it; whereas, at preſent they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for which it is worth their while to venture their lives; for if a man is to be a ſlave all his life, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it to him, whether his maſter is a Frenchman, an Engliſhman, or an American?</p>
