            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE OLD MAN's GUIDE.</head>
            <p>HEALTHFUL old age is the moſt valuable period of human life: Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has rendered the ancient more able than thoſe who have ſeen leſs, and felt leſs, to conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their deſcendants; and being freed from the empire of the paſſions, they enjoy quiet.</p>
            <p>PHILOSOPHY pretends to this condition; but age gives it truly: Whatever our heirs may think, it is worth preſerving; and in that ſenſe I write the preſent Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>A HUNDRED are cut off by diſorders which a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſe of life might prevent; for one who dies of age, or its unavoidable effects: Many fall by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; to one who is fairly called away by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The purpoſe of this Treatiſe is to direct the means, by which theſe accidents may be avoided, and theſe diſorders timely obviated.</p>
            <p>OLD mens diſeaſes are hard to cure; but they are eaſy to prevent. It muſt be a good natural fabric
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014116_0003_0F93006EDB4EB900"/>which has preſerved itſelf ſo long; and the ſame ſtrength may keep it much longer well, under good regulation.</p>
            <p>MODERATE diet, and due exerciſe, are the beſt guardians in all: But in the advanced period here conſidered there are two great preſervatives beſides; theſe are Eaſe and Chearfulneſs: Both are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural offspring of health; and they will continue the bleſſing to which they owe their birth.</p>
            <p>IT may be expected, I ſhould now ſay, at what period of life the ſtate of it that we call aged begins, but nature has herſelf left this undeterminable. The weakneſs and infirmities of age come at different years, in different conſtitutions: I could at this hour point out a very young man of eighty-ſeven: and the purlieus of Covent-Garden abound with very old men at ſeven-and-twenty: but to ſpeak in general terms, it may be ſaid, that the period of life, for which we are giving rules and regulations, begins about fifty-eight; tho' the greater infirmities of age do not advance till ſeveral years after.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. HOW A PERSON IN YEARS IS TO KNOW HE IS IN HEALTH.</head>
               <p>IT is allowed, we know ſo little of nothing, as of ourſelves: It has been ſaid often of the mind, but it is not leſs true of the body. Fancying we have certain diſeaſes will ſometimes bring them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: And there is as great danger in forcing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to believe, againſt our feeling, that we are well; when we have ſome diſorder.</p>
               <p>TO avoid both, let the elderly man read here, with a free mind. Let him not ſuppoſe, becauſe God has bleſſed him with long health, he is above the reach of ſickneſs; nor neglect the care which may conquer, in its beginning, a diſeaſe that would in the end conquer him. Let him be as ready to acknowledge real diſorders, as careful to avoid ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary.</p>
               <p>HEALTH conſiſts in a good digeſtion of the food, and free circulation of the blood. The appetite and the condition of the ſtomach after eating, will ſhew the firſt, and the latter may be known beſt by the pulſe.</p>
               <p>THAT old perſon's digeſtion is always good, who has a ſharp but not voracious appetite; and who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014116_0005_0F930075450D1F10"/>feels no pain nor ſickneſs after food. To preſerve this, let him be content with ſomewhat leſs than he could eat at every meal: To keep the ſtomach in order, do not overload it.</p>
               <p>THE beſt time to feel the pulſe is in the morning a little after getting up; and before breakfaſt. It ſhould be a rule never to omit this examination. A conſtant and regular attention to the pulſe will ſhew its ſlighteſt variations; and when any ſuch happen, let care be taken of the health.</p>
               <p>THERE are methods of counting the ſtrokes by a watch; but 'tis idle and mechanical: A repeated attention in the plain way is better.</p>
               <p>A FREQUENT examination will inform us what is the condition of our pulſe in health; and all devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from this, ſhew or threaten ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>WHILE an old man feels his pulſe regular, finds his digeſtion good, and with a mind at eaſe can take his uſual exerciſe freely, he may be certain he is well. We ſhall tell him how to keep ſo: and when a fault is ſeen in time, 'tis eaſily remedy'd.</p>
               <p>IF the pulſe beat too quick and high, the diet muſt be lower; if too ſlow and weak, the food muſt be ſomewhat richer. This ſhort direction will prevent half the diſeaſes of mankind.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. THE MEANS TO PRESERVE A HEALTHFUL STATE IN OLD AGE.</head>
               <p>THE diſeaſes of aged perſons differ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſtate of body, and natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: the corpulent are in danger of aſthmas; the lean of ſtranguries: Both ſhould be guarded againſt with extreme care; but moſt the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many ſudden deaths have happened from it, that might have been prevented eaſily by a timely care.</p>
               <p>THAT care, and all the neceſſary help, will be ſhewn in a ſeparate chapter on this diſeaſe. With reſpect to ſuppreſſions of urine, beſide all that has been written of Burdock Root, I may add here, that if as much had been known of its virtues but a little while ago, as is now notorious we might ſome years longer have enjoyed that excellent man, Peter Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon. Mr. Joſiah Soames, near dying the ſame way, was ſaved by it.</p>
               <p>EXERCISE has thro' the younger part of life been very in ſtrumental in preſerving health. When we grow old we cannot uſe ſo much; and we muſt therefore be more careful in our food. That will go off well with motion, which will overload when quiet: That will nouriſh while we walk abroad, which, when we ſtay at home, breeds fevers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014116_0007_0F9300766F998818"/>
WE muſt not make a change of diet violently; for all ſudden alterations are dangerous. Our ſtrength for exerciſe will leave us by degrees; and we muſt reduce our nouriſhment accordingly.</p>
               <p>OLD men are leaſt healthy in winter; therefore they ſhould then be moſt careful. They are colder than the young, and therefore cold more affects them. They will perceive the cold has hurt them, when they find the pulſe weaker and ſlower than uſual: and they muſt recover the new damage, by more warmth of cloathing and a ſomewhat richer diet.</p>
               <p>IF perſpiration has been ſtop'd by the cold, and no other ill effect follow, that will be ſeen by the urine being paler, and more in quantity than uſual. In this caſe let flannel be put on carefully: This will ſoon reſtore the perſpiration, and the urine will return to its due colour, and quantity. And after that let the flannel be carefully left off again.</p>
               <p>HEALTH conſiſts in the evacuations having all their proper courſe and quantity: and flannel will diminiſh one as much as it encreaſes another.</p>
               <p>No diſorder is more troubleſome to old men than coſtiveneſs; and the uſe of flannel unadviſedly will ſometimes occaſion this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:014116_0008_0F9300771F339838"/>
A CAREFUL attention to health is the only way to preſerve it; and many things are excellent when properly uſed, which may otherwiſe be deſtructive.</p>
               <p>IF the appetite fail, or wind oppreſs the ſtomach after meals, then take more air and exerciſe, and read or ſtudy leſs. Much ſtudy always hurts digeſtion.</p>
               <p>THE different ſeaſons affect perſons in years very greatly, and they ſhould always be prepared for the changes. The old man is always beſt in ſummer, and grows more ſpirited and free from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints as that period advances toward autumn: Winter we have ſaid hurts age, for age is cold and dry; and for that very reaſon youth feels ſummer moſt hurtfully, and are beſt in winter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. OF THE FITTEST DIET FOR PERSONS IN YEARS.</head>
               <p>LIGHT diet is moſt proper for aged perſons.</p>
               <p>BEEF and pork ſhould be avoided; for the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach will rarely be able to digeſt theſe, when it is not aſſiſted by good exerciſe.</p>
               <p>LAMB, veal, pig, chickens, rabbets, and fiſh are excellent; and out of theſe, if there were no others,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014116_0009_0F930077E8CDADC0"/>tolerable management may produce ſufficient va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</p>
               <p>No aged perſon ſhould eat more than one conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable meal of ſolid food in the day. The ſtomach will manage a dinner, when breakfaſt and ſupper have been light; otherwiſe the load of one meal not being gone off before another is brought in, neither will be digeſted.</p>
               <p>DINNER ſhould not be eaten too early; that the appetite may not be violent for ſupper: The older we grow, the more our food ſhould be diminiſhed. This was the practice of Hippocrates; and by the obſervance of it Cornaro lived to his extreme age.</p>
               <p>WITH reſpect to ſupper, the lighter it is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; though we do not agree with thoſe who adviſe the omitting that meal entirely. Moderation is the rule of health. They were in the right who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the miſchief of heavy ſuppers; but the poets have long ſince told us what ſort of people thoſe are, who, in avoiding a fault, ruſh into its contrary. There is a medium ſure between a heavy ſupper, and emptineſs; and that is beſt. Let the old man eat liquids; and of all liquid diets, thoſe which are partly compoſed of milk are beſt for him.</p>
               <p>THE digeſtive faculties in an old man are weak; but milk is in a manner ready digeſted. He wants
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014116_0010_0F930078A2E015D8"/>an eaſy nouriſhment, and this affords it; without loading the ſtomach, or oppreſſing it during the hours of reſt.</p>
               <p>ASSES milk is moſt eaſy of digeſtion: A pint of that, with a ſmall toaſt, eaten two hours before bed time, will be nouriſhing; and ſit eaſy on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The value of aſſes milk is its lightneſs: that of the cow is richer and heavier. Thoſe who uſe the latter in the country, ſhould mix it firſt with an equal quantity of ſoft water: In London this care is unneceſſary, thoſe who ſell milk do it for them.</p>
               <p>THERE are many other methods in which milk is proper: Milk pottage, and thin rice milk will give a change. But ſome farther pleaſing variety need not be denied. Weak broths, of veal, chicken, or mutton, may be eat occaſionally; and jellies honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made at home, are proper, ſafe, and wholeſome.</p>
               <p>THESE things will anſwer the two purpoſes of nouriſhing and moiſtening: for aged perſons are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally too dry.</p>
               <p>THE breakfaſt is not very important. Thoſe who eat no ſupper are too hungry in a morning; and the ſtomach being loaded with what they take at that time, is the leſs able to digeſt a dinner. This is the reaſon we adviſe old perſons to eat ſuppers of a right
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014116_0011_0F930079619A1CA0"/>theſe take off the too keen edge of the morning's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; and there will remain juſt ſo much deſire to eat as will lead them to get a little into the ſtomach without loading it.</p>
               <p>MEN may faſt away their appetite; and their power of digeſtion goes with it. The conduct of the appetite regulates the health; and this is a point not enough regarded.</p>
               <p>IT is as eſſential not to keep the ſtomach empty, as it is not to overload it. Wind is the conſequence of emptineſs, and this always diſturbs its office. It ſhould be conſtantly kept at its due employment in advanced periods of life; and this by ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of proper food.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE breakfaſts are as neceſſary as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; only thoſe who are troubled with phlegm ſhould eat leſs at this meal than others. A cup of chocolate, not made too ſtrong, is a good breakfaſt. Coffee I cannot adviſe generally: But the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt tea are in a great meaſure groundleſs.</p>
               <p>IF an elderly perſon likes tea, he need not deny it to himſelf for breakfaſt. Let him uſe the plain green ſort of ſixteen ſhillings a pound, and make it well; taking care the water boils, and allowing ſo much tea that it may be of ſufficient ſtrength, without ſtanding too long upon the leaves.</p>
               <p>

LET him drink three moderate cups, with a little ſugar, and a good deal of milk, and take it neither too hot, nor mawkiſhly cool. Let him eat with it a thin ſlice of good bread, with a little butter; and he will find all this nouriſhing and excellent.</p>
               <p>THE virtues of tea thus drank are as conſiderable as its bad qualities when ill managed. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it ſtrengthens the ſtomach and aſſiſts digeſtion; it keeps the body from emptineſs without loading it; the appetite for dinner will be the better for it; and the digeſtion will be alſo more perfect. Tea in this quantity is alſo ſufficient for the great purpoſe of diluting; and it refreſhes the ſpirits more than any other liquid.</p>
               <p>THE beſt drink at meals is malt liquor, not too ſtrong; ſmall ale is better than table-beer, becauſe it will keep to a due time for ſafe uſe.</p>
               <p>SOME wine is neceſſary to old men; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the conſtitution, and former manner of life, may be born by ſome without inconvenience.

               <head>CHAP. IV. OF THE FOODS PERSONS IN YEARS SHOULD AVOID.</head>
               <p>EVERY thing that is heavy and hard of digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be avoided. Tho' vegetables may be thought innocent, too much of them will in ſome caſes prove hurtful; and there are certain kinds that ſhould be let alone entirely.</p>
               <p>CARROTS are to be avoided; no weak ſtomach can digeſt them: Turnips are innocent; and parſnips are nouriſhing.</p>
               <p>SALADS ſhould be ſhunned: Cabbage, and all its kinds, breed wind; But aſparagus is diuretic; and is excellent againſt that common old man's complaint, the gravel.</p>
               <p>BAD cheeſe ſhould be avoided; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe than eating too much butter: But very
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014116_0014_0F93007CA26CE590"/>fine Cheſhire cheeſe; of the Parmezan in a ſmall quantity after other food, are not amiſs.</p>
               <p>ALL ſharp-taſted things, whether in food or drink, are carefully to be ſhunned. They cannot be neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral upon the ſtomach; and they are much more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do harm than good.</p>
               <p>FRUITS of due ripeneſs are innocent; and much more good than this may be ſaid of them: Unripe, they hurt the ſtomach, and often bring on dangerous cholics.</p>
               <p>CUCUMBERS weaken the digeſtion; and greatly prevent the natural and neceſſary ſecretions.</p>
               <p>THE pine-apple, the moſt pleaſant of all fruits, is one of the moſt dangerous: Its ſharpneſs fleas the mouth, and we know what effect ſuch a thing muſt have upon the ſtomach and bowels, when weakened by age. I have known it bring on bloody fluxes, which have been fatal. There are ſeveral kinds of this fruit, ſomewhat differing in quality; and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect degree of ripeneſs, in a great meaſure, takes off its worſt effects: But theſe are nice diſtinctions: He who is wiſe will judge as he does of muſhroons; where many are dangerous, avoid all.</p>
               <p>BESIDE rejecting things which are hurtful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, thoſe who are in advanced years would be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014116_0015_0F93007D2E140158"/>their guard againſt all ſuch as they are not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR conſtitutions will ſhew unforeſeen averſions to peculiar medicines; and it is the ſame in foods. Let him who knows what agrees with him, ſtick to it. Change is always wrong, and it may be hazardous; and 'tis idle to run into the way of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger where there is no advantage.</p>
               <p>ALL mixtures of foods upon the ſtomach are bad; and there is not a greater error in an old perſon than to eat of many diſhes at one meal. He muſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf by arguing that they all are innocent; for two things of known qualities will often, on mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, produce a third that is perfectly different from them both; and theſe are dangerous trials in an aged perſon's ſtomach.</p>
               <p>RIGHT management in theſe articles is nearly as important as a right choice. A regularity of eating is the next care to the ſelecting proper food; and fixing on a right quantity.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. OF AIR FOR ELDERLY PERSONS.</head>
               <p>NOTHING contributes more to health and long life than pure and good air: But by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014116_0016_0F93007DE8115AD0"/>by pure we are not to underſtand bleak; nor are aged perſons at any time to chuſe that kind.</p>
               <p>IT is ſtrange ſo many ſhould live to a great age in London, where the air has neither of theſe characters; where we breathe ſmoke, and the mixt ſtench of a thouſand putrifying ſubſtances; which cannot eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate through the thick and foul atmoſphere of the place.</p>
               <p>BUT though none will queſtion the ſuperior excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a clear country air, yet let not him who has attained to a healthy three ſcore and ten in London, think of leaving it, as a way to continue his days to a longer period. They ſay uſe is ſecond nature. It really becomes nature itſelf; and bad things, to which an old man has been very long accuſtomed, are often better than ſudden changes. It is well known, that many who have reached an uncommon date of life, have periſhed at laſt by a raſh alteration in their food; and 'tis certain the air is ſcarce of leſs conſequence.</p>
               <p>HE who would extend the period, and encreaſe the healthy condition of his days by a country air, ſhould begin at an earlier time; when his conſtitution can better bear the alteration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:014116_0017_0F93007E9C3786A8"/>
IN regard to a choice of air, the reaſon we declare againſt that which is too bleak is plain; for bleak and cold are always found together. Cold air chills the blood; and in old men we want rather to warm it. This ſharp air is natural at the tops of hills; and ſuch ſituations all old men ſhould avoid.</p>
               <p>ON the contrary, the mildeſt air of the country is that of vallies, ſheltered by riſing grounds: But this is uſually damp; and more miſchief may therefore ariſe from it than good.</p>
               <p>THE choice reſts ſolely then upon a gentle aſcent; the beſt place of all is toward the bottom of a piece of ground, which does not in any part riſe to a very great height; and if there be a running water at the loweſt part, it is ſo far perfect.</p>
               <p>MORE than this ſhould be conſulted for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try reſidence of the aged man, or of any who would live to be aged. The ſoil is of vaſt conſequence; and ſo is the expoſure. A clayey bottom muſt be avoided; becauſe it is always cold, and the air about it conſequently raw and damp. Rains cannot get thro' it, and they lodge till they are evaporated, chilling the ground, and loading the air with their fatal moiſture.</p>
               <p>A CLEAN gravel is the beſt ſoil of all. The air over this is always warm, and naturally dry; for rain ſoaks through it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:014116_0018_0F93008085AE3D28"/>
THE north and north-eaſt winds are the worſt for old men; therefore let them ſhelter themſelves from theſe by a proper choice of ſituation. Let the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the ground face the ſouth-weſt; and then the natural riſe behind will keep off the bleak and ſharp air from the oppoſite quarters. This may be aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo by plantations of trees: And thus the true ſeat of health and pleaſure may be eſtabliſhed, ſo far as theſe great points concern them.</p>
               <p>HE is happy who has made ſuch a choice in time; and he's ſtill happier who finds himſelf now in good time to make it. The later ſuch a reſidence is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the more carefully and gradually muſt the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner accuſtom himſelf to it: Firſt in ſummer, and by degrees; and at times, at other periods of the year. An air thus choſen, will then aſſiſt in all the great articles of health which age wants; appetite, digeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a free circulation.</p>
               <p>EXERCISE will be eaſy; and it will be always pleaſant in ſuch a ſpot: But let this alſo be under the regulation of good ſenſe. Nothing is better than walking; but let not the old man do himſelf more hurt, by a raſh and careleſs indulgence in this point, than it can do him ſervice.</p>
               <p>LET him never enjoy the air but when it is in a condition to do him good; nor venture upon the ground but when it is fit for his feet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:014116_0019_0F930080DEA2DD70"/>
No country houſe is without a garden; and the beſt part of this will be upon a good ſmooth gravel walk. Let this be open to the ſouth-weſt, and well defended from the dangerous quarters. Let it be laid tolerably round, that the water may not lodge; and let it be kept well rolled, hard, and even.</p>
               <p>IN very favourable weather he may walk in path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the fields; but in ſuch as is not ſo fair, this garden-walk will be highly uſeful; but let him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come upon it till the due is off the graſs; and let the ſetting ſun be the laſt object he ſees there, even in the beſt weather.</p>
               <p>THE air of early morning and of late evening are both cold and unwholeſome; but ſome hours of the foremoſt part of the day, paſſed conſtantly on ſuch a walk, will add many years to life; and what is much better, will give health with them.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. OF EXERCISE FOR OLD MEN.</head>
               <p>AIR has led us to mention already the firſt of exerciſes, which is walking; and for thoſe who have ſtrength to indulge themſelves in this, there is none better: But feeble limbs, and various
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014116_0020_0F9300820CD022D8"/>accidents often deny its uſe to thoſe who moſt of all want motion.</p>
               <p>IN this caſe riding on horſeback is the next in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence; and the fitteſt hours of the day muſt be choſen for that in the ſame manner as for the other. In ſevere weather it will be neceſſary to ride under ſhelter, and at all times to avoid damp or bleak places.</p>
               <p>MANY diverſions afford alſo excellent exerciſe; bowling is one, but the ſame care muſt be taken, that this be done at a proper time.</p>
               <p>A CHARIOT may ſupply the place of an horſe, to ſuch as are more feeble; and for thoſe who are ſo weak as to find even this too much, there will ariſe a great deal of good from being driven along in thoſe chairs which are made to run upon gravel walks.</p>
               <p>TO ſuch as are fond of gardening, nothing affords ſo happy, or ſo conſtant exerciſe. We do not mean that they ſhould dig or weed the ground; but to uſe ſuch employment as will give exerciſe without labour; and ſuch as no hand will ſo well perform as that of the maſter.</p>
               <p>SUCH are the trimming of ſhrubs, and flowering plants; the management of eſpaliers, the removal of ſeedling flower-roots; the thinning of fruit upon the trees, and the following and overlooking the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014116_0021_0F930082930629B8"/>other ſeveral works. Here will at leaſt be more, and briſker walking than would be otherwiſe; and in many things the little uſe that is made of the hands will complete that exerciſe, by continuing it perfectly through the body.</p>
               <p>THE only danger in this healthy and happy courſe is, that it is too aluring. Let him who delights in it take an invariable reſolution, never to let his fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for the garden carry him out too early, or keep him there too late.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. OF SUCCEDANEUMS FOR EXERCISE.</head>
               <p>THE benefit of exerciſe all know; but all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy it; nor can it be had at all times. The very weather will ſome days deny the uſe of thoſe kinds we have named to ſuch as are moſt able to take them. In this caſe, any buſtling about within doors, whether in the way of buſineſs or amuſement, will in ſome degree anſwer the purpoſe. The adjuſting an eſcritoire, or the new arranging the volumes in a book-caſe, have often produced this good effect; and billiards, or other entertainments which afford the means of ſtirring within the houſe, all anſwer the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:014116_0022_0F9300866EC5BD58"/>
To thoſe who are too weak for exerciſe, even the mildeſt and in the beſt weather, the great relie is a fleſh-bruſh; and the effects of this, when uſed with care and conſtancy, are more than can be imagined. We know what we expect from exerciſe; and in old men, the greateſt of its advantages is the aſſiſting cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. The fleſh-bruſh does this nearly in as great a degree, excepting only for the immediate time: But to have the full benefit, it muſt be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and frequently repeated.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER excellent ſuccedaneum for exerciſe is waſhing the body with warm water, and then rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it very well with repeated dry cloths. This has many peculiar advantages; the warmth aſſiſts perſpiration; the waſhing opens the pores; and the rubbing afterwards is nearly equal to the effect of the fleſh-bruſh. The warmth and moiſture join alſo in ſoftening the ſkin, and rendering it ſupple: And this is a great point; for all are apt to grow hard and dry with age.</p>
               <p>GREAT care muſt be taken to avoid taking cold after this. The beſt time for it is therefore evening, in a warm bed chamber; and the bed ſhould be ready immediately, that the perſon may go into it while he is yet hot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:014116_0023_0F930087D37F0720"/>
THE hands and feet ſhould have their full ſhare in this waſhing and rubbing; for the circulation is weakeſt there; and the pores moſt liable to be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. The hot bath anſwers, in ſome degree this purpoſe, and will be ſpoken of hereafter: But that is rather to be uſed as a remedy than a preſervative; and we are here treating of aged men in health.</p>

            <div n="8" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. VIII. OF A REGULATION OF TEMPER, AND OF THE PASSIONS.</head>
               <p>WITHOUT entering into the province of the moraliſt or preacher, we may affirm here, that the paſſions demand great regard in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the health of old men. The motion of the blood in circulation is greatly affected and altered by them; and the nerves may ſuffer yet more. The whole frame is diſordered by violent paſſions: And I have often ſeen diſeaſes; and ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate death has been the conſequence of giving full ſcope to them.</p>
               <p>NOTHING in this world is worth the trouble and diſtreſs men bring upon themſelves by giving way to immoderate paſſions. Life is the greateſt bleſſing, and health the next; and theſe both ſuffer by that fond indulgence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:014116_0024_0F930088705EB0C0"/>
THAT the circulation is diſordered by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we know from the true and certain indication of the pulſe. In anger, it is violent and hard; in grief, faint and flow; terrors make it irregular; and ſhame impedes its motions.</p>
               <p>THESE are ſure notices of a diſordered circulation; and old men cannot bear this, even for a time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage. The ſtrength of youth reſtores all to its former ſtate, when the ſudden guſt is over; but age is weak, and cannot. Philoſophy teaches the governing our paſſions; and that is true wiſdom. The old man ſhould love himſelf too well to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge them; it is not worth his while. Quiet and regularity of life in every reſpect are his buſineſs: and as he is paſt the fluttering pleaſures of youth, let him place himſelf above its troubles.</p>
               <p>GOOD humour, and a happy ſatisfaction of mind, will give the aged many years, and much happineſs in them. Diſcontent and diſturbance wear out na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but the quiet we adviſe, preſerves her in good condition.</p>
               <p>OF all paſſions, let the old man avoid a fooliſh fondneſs for women. This never will ſolicit him; for nature knows her own time; and the appetite decays with the power: But if he will ſolicit that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014116_0025_0F930089330FD6A0"/>which he cannot enjoy, he will diſturb his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than by any other means whatever: And while he is ſhortening his life, and robbing the poor remainder he allows, of peace, he will be only mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf the ridicule of thoſe who ſeem to favour his vain and ineffectual deſires.</p>
               <p>IN paſſionate people, what we blame as their fault, is often their misfortune. Some indeed, from a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical diſpoſition, have fixed this humour upon themſelves by cuſtom; with no other cauſe; but for one of theſe, there are a hundred whoſe fury of temper is owing to a diſorder in their body.</p>
               <p>We know madneſs is a diſeaſe; and violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is a temporary madneſs. This alſo ariſes often from a redundance of humours; and medicines will cure it.</p>
               <p>LET the paſſionate old man conſider, that he hurts himſelf more than any body elſe, by his anger; and he will then wiſh to be cured of its tyranny. Let him examine himſelf, whether it be a diſorder of his mind; and then his phyſician, whether it lie in the body. In the firſt caſe the remedy is philoſophy: But in the latter, a few medicines will reſtore him to temper; to that temper on which his life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depend.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:014116_0026_0F930089EDFFBDD8"/>
LET the haſty old man cool himſelf by phyſic and a low diet; and let him who is melancholy and gloomy, baniſh the everlaſting fear of death by warmer foods, cordial medicines, and that beſt of cordials, wine.</p>
               <p>THESE will drive away much more than the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of death: They will put off the reality; for melancholy would have ſunk the feeble, long before his time.</p>
               <p>OF all ſtates of the mind, a diſturbed hurry of the ſpirits is moſt to be avoided. The blood and the nerves are diſordered by this much more than by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or bodily motion; and they are much longer in coming to themſelves again. Labour ceaſes abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely when 'tis over: But the ſtorms of the mind leave a ſwelling ſea, which ſtrength of body alone can calm; and in age this ſtrength is faint.</p>
               <p>No diſeaſe is more miſchievous to weak old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than a purging: And I have ſeen this brought on inſtantly by a fit of paſſion; or by a fright. Medicines have attempted to relieve the patient in vain. That flux which would have been ſtop'd, if natural, by a ſpoonful of chalk julep, or a doſe of diaſcordium, has in this caſe reduced the perſon to a ſkeleton, and ſunk him into the grave in ſpite of all help.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:014116_0027_0F93008ABA045B20"/>
WHY ſhould the old man diſturb his mind with anger? or what ſhould he dread; Death is his great terror; and he is very abſurd who brings that on by leſſer fears.</p>
               <p>JOY, tho' it be only a greater ſhare of ſatisfaction, is, in a violent or outrageous degree, as hurtful as the other paſſions: It hurries the circulation vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently and irregularly; it exhauſts the ſpirits; and when exceſſive, it has often occaſioned ſudden death. It is a violence of youth; it belongs to that period of life more properly, that can bear it, and to that let us leave it. Let the old man be as the Quakers in this point, always chearful but never merry.</p>
               <p>LAST, let us caution alſo the aged man who would be happy, and would live longer, to combat with all his power that dangerous enemy covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 'Tis known univerſally, and we have ſacred atteſtation of it, that too great carefulneſs brings age before its time; and in age it brings death premature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The old are in no danger of extravagance; and the care of heaping up for others, when it ſhortens their own life, is more than any heir deſerves.</p>
               <p>EASE and good humour are the great ingredients of a happy life; and the principal means of a long one. Our whole leſſon extends but thus much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014116_0028_0F93008B8CD6D1C8"/>that the old man love his life ſo well; and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue ſo little all the accidents which belong to it, that he do not give a vain attention to a part, which may rob him of the whole.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. OF SLEEP FOR OLD MEN.</head>
               <p>INTEMPERANCE has now converted day to night in the courſe of the gay, young world; but this needs not, nor ſhould influence thoſe in years. Midnight entertainment are no part of the oeconomy of their peaceful lives; and therefore they may come nearer to the courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>THE degree of ſleep is a material article; and the time of it not leſs. The old man has been cautioned againſt the cold air of evenings; and we may now add, that after a light and early ſupper, and an hour of ſocial converſation with his family and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, bed will be his beſt place.</p>
               <p>SLEEP was intended to recruit nature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the waſted ſpirits. This is neceſſary to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but to the aged moſt; becauſe they can leaſt bear the waſte of them. The paſſions will diſturb all conſtitutions, but thoſe of old men moſt of all.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:014116_0029_0F93008C25C75748"/>Sleep compoſes theſe; therefore 'tis of excellent uſe to them; and they may ſafely indulge in it longer than the young.</p>
               <p>SIX hours is as long as a perſon in the prime of life ſhould ſleep; But in age, eight, or even ten, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the peculiar conſtitution, may be more proper.</p>
               <p>THE natural ſeaſon of ſleep is night; and let the old man therefore go to bed in ſuch time, that he may paſs theſe hours of reſt without breaking in upon the morning. In general, the moſt healthful cuſtom for age is, to go to bed at ten, and riſe at eight in the morning.</p>
               <p>IF the mind be hurry'd, or from any other cauſe the perſon finds he cannot compoſe himſelf to reſt ſoon after going to bed; or get ſo much ſleep during the night; let him ſtill riſe at the ſame time the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day; and the next evening prepare himſelf thus for better ſleep: Let him go into a warm bath; and indulge himſelf with a glaſs of wine, beyond his ordinary allowance, a little before bed time. This will take off his watchfulneſs, and he will ſink into the moſt pleaſing ſlumber.</p>
               <p>THE contrary practice, that of lying in bed in the morning, to make up for want of ſleep at night, is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014116_0030_0F93008CEA6A1010"/>every way extremely wrong. As nothing refreſhes like ſeaſonable ſleep, nothing weakens and dejects a perſon more than indulging in bed in the day: There is alſo this farther ill conſequence from it, that the perſon is never ſleepy, at the due time of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding evening; and thus what was at firſt an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, becomes by indulgence a cuſtom; and is then the more difficult to be conquered, and the more hurtful.</p>
               <p>THE old man who has obſerved a temperate diet, and has gone to bed regularly at ten o'clock, will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally wake towards eight. And when he wakes, let him get up. He will then be in ſpirits for the day. If on the contrary he lies doſing, he will get into a weakening ſweat. He will then be low ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited during the whole following day, and waking and watchful at night.</p>
               <p>ON theſe little circumſtances do the health or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the happineſs or uneaſineſs of old perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in a very great meaſure. We often do not perceive them, or we eaſily overlook them: Let us be for the future more careful. There is no pain in living regularly in old age; and the conſequence of it is certain; a longer life, and every day of it more agreeable.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. OF THE PARTICULAR FAULTS IN OLD MENS CONSTITUTIONS.</head>
               <p>I HOPE it will be eaſy, by the preceding and the following directions, for any man of ſenſe, not vers'd at all in phyſic, to know the ſtate of his own health preciſely; and 'tis a moſt important know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Hippocrates, who knew phyſic better than all who have followed him, declares it to be an eaſy ſcience, tho' it requires length of time to learn it; and Boerhaave, the Hippocrates of our ſucceeding times, lectur'd for ever publicly on the ſimplicity and eaſe of phyſic. They perplex themſelves who think it difficult: Only let the plain conſiderate man attend to what he feels, and believe what is here told him will reſult from it; then he may keep his mind at peace, which is a great ingredient in the health of the body; But this full credit is neceſſary; for the origin of his diſorders is often very diſtant from their apparent effects.</p>
               <p>HITHERTO we have treated of the condition of perſons advanced in years who are healthy; and the rules we have laid down are for preſerving and continuing that ſtate: And he who obſerves them duly cannot well fail of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:014116_0032_0F93008E630BB1E8"/>
WE now ſhall conſider the ſeveral more frequent faults of the conſtitution at this period of life; and the diſeaſes ariſing from them.</p>
               <p>THE old man may be ſo far his own doctor, as to amend the general diſtemperature of his body; and often he may prevent thoſe diſeaſes; But if he fall into them, whether by neglect of theſe cautions, or in ſpite of their force, let him then call in a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician.</p>
               <p>We can adviſe him how to preſerve health when he has it; and how to remedy general diſorders, ſo as to prevent more particular ones; ſo far as a due regimen may do that: But he is a very ill judge of the human frame, who will pretend to remedy its diſeaſes without a knowledge both of its ſtructure, and of the qualities of remedies; and he would be a bad member of ſociety, who gave ſuch advice to any. It were as eaſy to teach ſome other art by writing, and as rational to attempt making a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, or a ſhipbuilder by a deſcription of the tools. The whole life of a phyſician, ſpent in attention and experience, hardly qualifies him for the undertaking: How then ſhould a few light words give ſufficient information?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. OF A FULNESS OF BLOOD.</head>
               <p>AN overfulneſs of blood naturally brings on a redundance of the other humours; for as they are ſeparated from the blood, they naturally encreaſe with it in quantity. The one or the other of theſe exceſſes may, and naturally will, occaſion diſorders; much more both.</p>
               <p>THE old man may know when he has too much blood in his veins from theſe plain ſymptoms; his pulſe will be full and ſtrong, and ſomewhat quicker than it ſhould; his complexion will be more florid; and his urine higher coloured. The veins alſo will be ſwelled, and his breathing will grow difficult.</p>
               <p>THE occaſion of all this has probably been too high feeding, and too little exerciſe; therefore the plain method to abate the ſymptoms and prevent the miſchief which they threaten, is by more motion; and an abſtemious diet.</p>
               <p>THIS is plainly the change which ſhould be made; but it muſt not be too ſudden. We have obſerved before, that all haſty alterations are dangerous: But as this is ſlowly, let it be alſo determinately and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly brought on. If therefore no diſeaſe be come
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014116_0034_0F93008FEA8E9F70"/>on as yet from the fulneſs, there will not any come during a gradual courſe of emptying the veſſels by this practice. Nature will be relieved in a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory manner; whereas ſhe would have been too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently diſturbed by any ſudden ſhock.</p>
               <p>THE firſt rule is to retrench one third part from the fleſh eaten at dinner, of whatever kind that be. We have adviſed the abſtaining from beef and pork, but in this caſe mutton ſhould be alſo let alone, or very rarely eaten; and the dinner being made ſolely of the tender and young meats in this reduced quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the next care muſt be, that theſe are always well and thoroughly dreſſed. It is a faſhion to eat meat almoſt raw, and doctors have adviſed it; but they would be better phyſicians for bears and wolves than men.</p>
               <p>LET the perſon riſe an our before his uſual time in the morning; and every day encreaſe the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of exerciſe a little; but great care muſt be taken not to go out at improper hours, to endanger getting cold. In getting rid of one evil, let us not run into another. This fulneſs is a ſtate in which diſeaſes are moſt eaſily brought on, and they will be moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in it. Colds are moſt dangerous of all, to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this condition, and therefore are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be avoided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:014116_0035_0F930090A7C6D898"/>
THE pulſe will ſhew whether or not this method reduces the redundance of blood: If it do not take a viſible effect in four days, it will be proper to be blooded. After this the ſame regimen will probab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complete the buſineſs; and there will be no need for medicines.</p>
               <p>BUT if all ſhould fail, an addition of the warm bath every other day will probably anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. In all old mens caſes 'tis beſt to avoid medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, if it can be done with ſafety; for they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the conſtitution, and the beſt guard of their health is quietneſs.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. OF WASTING AND DECAY.</head>
               <p>WHEN old perſons fall into this declining condition, it generally carries them off; but many may be ſaved by timely care; to whom no remedies will be of ſervice after a firſt neglect. While the ſtomach is able to digeſt any thing, there is hope of recovery; but when its power is loſt, both food and phyſic are poured down the throat in vain.</p>
               <p>WHEN an aged perſon perceives his fleſh waſting, and his ſtrength and ſpirits failing, let him take good
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:014116_0036_0F9300915C5B75E0"/>nouriſhment, and adapt it to the condition of his ſtomach.</p>
               <p>IF it be too ſtrong, or if he takes too much, the digeſtive faculty, already impaired by general weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cannot manage it; and he will haſten his death by ſuch a conduct.</p>
               <p>THE rule is to eat only innocent, tho' the moſt nouriſhing things, and theſe only in moderate quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities; chicken, young lamb, and veal, boiled down almoſt to a jelly, are the proper foods for dinner; but even of theſe let him eat leſs than his appetite demands.</p>
               <p>TWO hours before dinner, let him take half a pint of chicken broth; and as his ſtomach afterwards grows ſtronger, veal or mutton broth; and let him take the ſame again one hour after his light dinner.</p>
               <p>LET his breakfaſt be a yolk of an egg, beaten up with half a pint of aſſes milk, and a quarter of an ounce of conſerve of roſes; and his ſupper veal broth nearly boiled to a jelly.</p>
               <p>EVERY afternoon let him take half a pint of aſſes milk alone; and while all this is doing, let care be taken that there be no violent evacuations. A purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be deſtructive; and morning ſweats are
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:014116_0037_0F930095B5DEA640"/>very hurtful. Let him therefore riſe early; and to complete the cure let him believe theſe methods will perform it. An eaſy mind will do more than food and phyſic.</p>
               <p>QUIET, good humour, and complacency of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, will prevent half the diſeaſes of old people: And they will cure one half of the others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIII. AGAINST SHARP HUMOURS.</head>
               <p>THE firſt ſign of ſharp humours, in the bodies of old perſons uſually is an uneaſineſs at the ſtomach; then comes on a want of appetite, with four belchings, wind, purgings, and defluctions; and laſt, thirſt, and a feveriſh diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>THE fault lies originally in the ſtomach; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally an irregular diet has been the cauſe; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly high ſauces, bad wines, and ſpicy foods. The firſt ſtep to a cure is to abſtain from all theſe; and life depends upon it. For to aggravate thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, is to deſtroy the conſtitution utterly. Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fevers, or fatal purgings follow.</p>
               <p>THE beſt beginning is by a vomit; and after this the diet ſhould be all of the mild and cooling kind.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:014116_0038_0F9300979E2E2E58"/>Every morning let the perſon take two ſpoonfuls of ſyrup of ſnails, made by bruiſing them with ſugar, and hanging them up in a flannel bag till the juice runs out. At meals let his drink be a tea, made of marſh-mallow and liquorice-root, with one third part milk, drank juſt warm. If the ſkin grow yellow, of the white of the eyes appear of that colour, a doſe of rhubarb once in three days will be needful. The beſt method of taking it is by chewing.</p>
               <p>THIS is as much phyſic as we would have an aged man uſe in ſuch a caſe; the reſt muſt be done by a proper regimen.</p>
               <p>FIRST let him regulate his paſſions. Violent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will increaſe this diſorder more than the moſt improper foods. Let him alſo baniſh ſear: If he thinks himſelf in danger, he will bring it on.</p>
               <p>HE muſt never overload his ſtomach; nor muſt ever ſuffer it to be empty. Once in two hours he ſhould conſtantly ſwallow ſomething. Jellies of hartſhorn, truly made, are excellent; but they muſt be prepared at home: For cheating is ſo eaſy, and the method with hartſhorn only is ſo tedious, that few who make them for ſale will do it honeſtly.</p>
               <p>OFTEN this miſchief riſes from a ſtoppage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in ſome part; particularly in the feet.
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:014116_0039_0F930098DE55A000"/>Then the buſineſs is to bring that evacuation on again by additional warmth, by flannel ſocks and yarn ſtockings. This will in many caſes alone perform the cure; and in all others, where ſuch a ſtoppage of perſpiration has been a part of the cauſe, it will aſſiſt the other methods.</p>
               <p>THE pulſe, which was at firſt too quick, will grow moderate as theſe methods of relief take place; and this promiſes a cure. To complete it the patient muſt go to bed in time; and uſe moderate exerciſe in the beſt hours of the day. He muſt eat no fat meats, drink little wine, and avoid care and uneaſineſs of mind.</p>
               <p>IF he do not ſleep well, he muſt take a ſmall doſe of ſyrup of diaſcordium every night.</p>
               <p>THIS method will probably reſtore him to health; and it muſt be preſerved with a due care afterwards; elſe relapſes in this caſe are frequent. A vomit once in ſix weeks, and a doſe of rhubarb every ten days, with a careful diet, will uſually make this a very healthy conſtitution.</p>
               <p>THE great care is taking the defect in time; for new diſorders are eaſily conquered; but long eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed ones are too obſtinate for ſuch weak bodies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. OF PAINS AND INFLAMATIONS.</head>
               <p>IT is proper to treat of theſe together, becauſe they generally come one with the other. We need not tell the old man when he is in pain; But he muſt examine carefully whether there be inflamation with it.</p>
               <p>THIS he will know to be the caſe by his pulſe beating hard and quick; and by high coloured urine: his fleſh alſo will be hotter than uſual. When pains come on without theſe ſymptoms, warmth in the part, and patience, are the remedies: they muſt be conſidered as the lot of age, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red accordingly: but when other ſymptoms join with them, they threaten dangerous conſequences.</p>
               <p>THE firſt ſtep in this caſe is bleeding: and this with abſtinence from all hot foods often performs the cure.</p>
               <p>IF this give no relief, the next day but one a vomit will be proper. If the body be coſtive, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames all the ſymptoms; and if purges be given, they increaſe the violent motion of the blood, and therefore do more hurt than ſervice. Cooling and oily glyſters are the proper method, and the only proper one; and they ſhould be repeated regularly every morning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:014116_0041_0F93009A681E5AF0"/>
THE diet muſt be light and cool: all ſolid foods ſhould be omitted for the firſt four or five days, and in their place aſſes milk ſhould be taken. Chicken broth and jellies muſt be the chief nouriſhment du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this period.</p>
               <p>AFTER this, as the diſorder abates, the ſtrength muſt be conſidered; and by degrees the uſual diet, ſuch as is here recommended for healthy old men, ſhould be introduced. But this muſt be done gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually, and with great caution: otherwiſe, a ſudden change, from low to richer diet, will certainly bring on the complaint again; with more and worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. OF FLUXES.</head>
               <p>AGED people bear a too coſtive habit much better than they do fluxes or purgings: for they are eaſily weakened; and nothing does it more than theſe diſcharges.</p>
               <p>THE great rule, in all the diſorders of aged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is to take them in time. A purging will be cured by proper diet, when it is regarded early: otherwiſe medicines muſt be called in; and perhaps they will be ineffectual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:014116_0042_0F93009B1AC29600"/>
THE quantity of ſolid food muſt in this caſe be reduced: but it ſhould not be left off wholly. A drink ſhould be made of burnt hartſhorn and comfry root, two ounces of each boiled in two quarts of water to three pints, the liquor poured clear off, and drank warm with a little red wine. This ſhould be the common drink.</p>
               <p>RICE-MILK, with ſome cinnamon boiled in it, is excellent for breakfaſt; and rice-pudding beſt of all things for ſupper; and this two hours before bed time. Sea-buiſcuit ſhould on this occaſion be eat inſtead of bread; and the patient muſt uſe more than ordinary exerciſe, to promote perſpiration.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. OF THE GRAVEL AND STONE.</head>
               <p>OLD perſons are very ſubject to obſtructions in the urinary paſſages; and often the various degrees of the gravel and ſtone follow. Theſe are diſorders difficult of cure: but they are eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in moſt conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>LET thoſe who are ſubject but to ſlight complaints of this kind avoid wine; and ſupply its place by clear malt liquor, of a due ſtrength.</p>
               <p>LET the diet be cooling: and in regard to exerciſe, the great and golden rule is moderation. Violent
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014116_0043_0F93009C6A666A78"/>motion, or reſt for a long time together, are equally wrong. Let the patient walk, or ride out every day at the proper hours; and when the weather does not permit that, let him uſe the ſame exerciſe in his chamber.</p>
               <p>WHEN the fits come on, let him take manna and oil: This is an eaſy and effectual medicine. Two ounces of manna ſhould be diſſolved in half a pint of water, and ſix ſpoonfuls of ſalad oil added to it. A ſpoonful of this taken every half hour will ſtay upon the ſtomach, aſſwage the pain, ſtop the vomitings which uſually attend theſe complaints; and at the ſame time procure ſtools: and while it eaſes the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licky pains, it will give paſſage to the ſtone.</p>
               <p>THIS is the courſe in the violence of a fit. When it is perceived coming on, an infuſion of Burdock root ſlic'd, is the ſafeſt, beſt, and moſt effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Two ounces of the freſh root, with a pint and half of boiling water poured on it, makes this infuſion. The liquor is to be ſtrained off as ſoon as cold; and half a pint, a little warmed again, with a quarter of a pint of milk, and ſweetened with honey, is to be taken every four hours.</p>
               <p>THIS is the medicine lately publiſhed alſo for the gout; and which many are now taking for that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe with very great ſucceſs. The gout and gravel
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014116_0044_0F93009CA45D8A30"/>are nearly ally'd, and it is not ſtrange the ſame reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſo effectual alſo in this caſe. The wonder is, that a plant of ſo great virtue, and ſo common, has been ſo long neglected by the practiſers of phyſic.</p>
               <p>OF the gout it would be in vain to treat here. 'Tis a peculiar ſubject, and requires a larger compaſs than any ſingle article can be allowed in this work; and it has been conſidered ſeparately in that treatiſe.</p>

               <p>GREAT evacuations, intenſe ſtudy, violent paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or a too low diet, will ſometimes bring it on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the natural time; and then a proper care and regimen may in a great meaſure remove it.</p>
               <p>A WEAKNESS of the pulſe, feebleneſs of the limbs, a paleneſs of the face, waſte of fleſh, and low ſpirits, are the ſymptoms by which this is known: the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are cordial medicines, and a ſomewhat richer diet.</p>

                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:014116_0045_0F93009D5E64E628"/>
THE medicine I have found moſt effectual is this: a quarter of an ounce of ſaffron, a dram of cinnamon, and an ounce of confection of alkermes, put into a quart of white wine: when this has ſtood two days it ſhould be poured off, and half a wine-glaſs of it drank once a day.</p>
               <p>REST of mind and body are alſo in this caſe very eſſential articles toward the cure. Let not the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent think he is in danger: let him venture to eat ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what richer meats, but in a moderate quantity: and indulge in one extraordinary glaſs of wine at every meal.</p>
               <p>LET him riſe early; but not go out 'till the air is well warmed by the ſun; and the dews are diſperſed. If he reſides in London at the time, let him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately go into the country: if he be too looſe in his bowels let him check it moderately by the means we have before directed; and let his malt liquor be ſtrong of the hop.</p>
               <p>BETWEEN breakfaſt and dinner let him every day take a yolk of a new laid egg, beat up in a glaſs of ſtrong white wine. The company of agreeable friends will be the beſt medicine in an evening; and good broth his fitteſt ſupper.</p>

               <p>THE ſmoke of London is very bad; and the ill ſmells from many of the trades carried on there are likewiſe hurtful. No perſon ſubject to an aſthma ſhould live near tanners in the country, nor tallow chandlers, or the like offenſive trades, in London.</p>

               <p>FREQUENT waſhing the feet in warm water, and good rubbing with dry cloths afterwards, is alſo highly ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>ALL cold and viſcous foods muſt be avoided. The ſtomach muſt not be ſuffered to be empty, nor muſt it be loaded. The food ſhould be of the richeſt kind that can be proper for perſons advanced in years; and to aſſiſt digeſtion, two or three diſhes of good green tea, made carefully and taken with little ſugar and without milk, ſhould be drank conſtantly, two hours and a half after dinner</p>
               <p>

VEGETABLES muſt be avoided; and one great caution ſhould be, not to drink too much of any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor whatſoever.</p>
               <p>BLEEDING is uſually neceſſary; and the condition of the blood will ſhew whether it ſhould be in larger or ſmaller quantity; and whether or not it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to be ſoon repeated.</p>
               <p>IF the blood be ſizey, ſeveral bleedings will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be wanted; and the ſame condition of it ſhews that the body can ſpare thoſe quantities. It ſhews alſo, that without theſe bleeding medicines can take no effect.</p>
               <p>AFTER all this, the greateſt preſervative againſt ſharp or repeated fits is the famous gum ammoniacum. A quarter of an ounce of this being diſſolved in half a pint of water, two ſpoonfuls ſhould be taken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſymptoms, every night, or every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or third night.</p>
               <p>THIS method will prevent many fits, and abate the ſeverity of thoſe which cannot be avoided.</p>
               <p>THUS the old man, even againſt the fury of this worſt diſturbance of his life, as well as all the reſt, may live happy: and he ought to value that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the more, becauſe he will owe it to his own diſcretion.</p>
