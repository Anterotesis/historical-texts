            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>he Glories of the better Country. There is a good fight of Faith which every Chriſtian muſt fight, or he will never lay hold on that Eternal Life unto which he is called. And as there are many things which if ſeriouſly pondered by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, will ſerve to animate them unto, and make them circumſpect in their Chriſtian Warfare, ſo there are two eſpecially which I may not omit the mention of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have a Compleat armour of Proof provided for them, which duely put on, and skilfully managed; will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitably render them impregnable,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001145_0004_0FB08E376346AF78"/>
and ſecure to them ſignal and aſſured Victories over all their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Enemies they are to engage and combate with are not only ſtrong and powerful; but marvellouſly poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ſubtil &amp; crafty, excellently skil'd, and wonderfully improv'd in the Art of War.</p>
            <p>Both theſe Conſiderations are in the Words of our Text very pertinently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to our notice, by the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and an affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate exhortation to the patting on of the former, is grounded upon the latter, as a reaſon of very great and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Cogency.</p>
            <p>In the Words then we may obſerve two things:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>An Exhortation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Ground or Reaſon of it.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>An Exhortation: Put on the whole armour of God.</hi> And in this there are three things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſubject matter which the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has a reſpect unto, the</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. the Panoply, or whole Armour of God. Two things are implyed here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant is to be furniſhed with, is not of his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001145_0005_0FB08E3A29FCDEF0"/>
own providing</hi>: No, It is the <hi>Armour of God.</hi> Kings have their Royal Arſenals, where all their Stores of War are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved, from hence their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are ſupplyed with Weapons of all ſorts, and put into a Warlike Equipage fit for the field. The King of Kings and Lord of Lords hath his royal Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal alſo, from hence Chriſtians receive all that royal furniture which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to equip them for, and Arm them to the Spiritual Warfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Armour, the Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant is to put on is not carnal, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:</hi> The <hi>Graces</hi> of Gods Spirit, are the <hi>Armour</hi> here intended. The Apoſtle Expreſſes himſelf in <hi>Military terms,</hi> and cloaths his exhortation in a <hi>Souldier-like garbe.</hi> The expreſſion is Metaphorical, Here's an excellent alluſion to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of War-like Weapons, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which Souldiers are furniſht with when they go out to War. This Metaphor the Apoſtle more largely inſiſts upon in the Subſequent context, where he runs the Analogy, and diſcovers the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar uſe and ſerviceableneſs of the Graces of Gods Spirit, from the reſpect they bear unto the ſeveral pieces and parts
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001145_0006_0FB08E3EDD55E728"/>
of proper armour there mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may conſider <hi>the Act which the Spiritual Combatant is adviſed to, or that which the Spiritual Souldier is to do with this armour: He muſt put it on.</hi> The Apoſtle here alludes to the Cuſtome of Souldiers, making ready to engage their enemies. They repair to their Arms, buckle on their armour, not omitting any one piece of it, which may ſerve either to defend themſelves, or annoy their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They think it not enough to put on their head-piece, and neglect their breaſt-plates, Shields and Swords; No, they will be Armed Cap-a-pee from Head to Foot. It is not enough that the Souldier is well provided with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; He muſt have it on, and be in a readineſs for the battel. Thus Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt get themſelves furniſhed with Grace, all the Graces of Gods Spirit, &amp; live in the conſtant exerciſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them. They muſt be compleatly Armed to the Combat, with the whole Spiritual Armour, no piece of it muſt be wanting, leſt being in any part naked, and void of ſuitable defence, they become unable to make good their ground againſt the formidable inſults of their helliſh adverſaries.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001145_0007_0FB08E41EEBA8640"/>3. We may conſider <hi>the Subject Perſons concern'd in the exhortation. All true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, All Orders, Ranks and Degrees of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in all Ages and Generations.</hi> Altho' the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to whom the Epiſtle is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed were firſtly concerned in it, yet all Chriſtians are ſecondarily concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Apoſtolical Epiſtles were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned to be of private, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concernment. To put on the whole armour of God is the duty of all Chriſtians, whatever Station they hold, or Relation they ſuſtain. This parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular is excellently illuſtrated from the ſpecial quality thoſe are treated in who are the Subjects of the duty here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. The Spirit of God treats them in the quality of Souldiers, or of Perſons ingaged in a Warfare. The Word of Command in our Text is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Military, <hi>Put on the whole Armour of God.</hi> It is as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Remember Chriſtians, that in a Spiritual ſence you are Souldiers, and therefore ſee to it, that you be compleat in Arms and Ammunition; ſee to it, that you ſtand furniſhed with the whole of the glorious Armour, God hath provided you with, that you may be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001145_0008_0FB08E4388AC8908"/>
with, hew your way through and put your Enemies to a rout, and confuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Reaſon or Ground of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> the reaſon why Chriſtians ſhould thus Arm themſelves with, or put on the whole armour of God, viz. <hi>That they may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> And here we have three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The grand Enemy of the Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batant detected, the Devil: That ye may be able to ſtand againſt the wiles of the Devil.</hi> The Devil is the true Chriſtians prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Enemy. The Apoſtle expreſſes himſelf here in the ſingular number, &amp; that with a peculiar emphaſis; but yet by an uſual Synecdoche, he intends all thoſe vaſt, and (as to us) numberleſs <hi>Troops</hi> of evil spirits, who are under the conduct of the Prince of the Powers of the Air: And thus he explains himſelf in the 12<hi>th.</hi> verſe. The <hi>General</hi> (as is frequent) is here put for the whole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> under his conduct. There may be a farther notion in the expreſſion. God would hereby let us know, that the Powers of Darkneſs are ſtrongly leagued, and banded together; and do all joyn as one in proſecuting the deſigns of Hell
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001145_0009_0FB08E44E2925780"/>
againſt the Children of God. And whilſt Chriſtians reflect upon the vaſt, and hideous numbers of Devils, who are with a united force continually engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, how neceſſary is the Spiritual Armour to defend them againſt their wiles!

               </p>
               <p>This may ſuffice for the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrine. The Reaſons of it follow. I ſhall take notice but of Two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>God treats Chriſtians in his Word, in the quality of Souldiers, that he may inſtruct them more fully, in thoſe things he would inform them about.</hi> The Information of men is one great end the Scripture ſcopes at. It is in this reſpect, the <hi>Commandment is a lamp, and the Law a light. Prov.</hi> 6.23. Men are very dull, and ſlow of underſtanding in things of a ſpiritual nature; and therefore God is pleaſed to call in the help of apt ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes, and curious metaphorical allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to aſſiſt their underſtandings in the purſuit of Duty. Theſe have a ſingular aptitude to convey the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of truth more fully to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, and to ſet them before us in a clearer light. It is a gracious effect of the Infinite Condeſcendency of God, that he attempers his phraſe to our Capacities and Apprehenſions;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001145_0023_0FB08E6E9ADD1728"/>
and illuſtrates Spiritual Truths to us, by ſimilitudes and alluſions, that are plain, and obvious to us. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf puts us in mind of the favour he does us in this reſpect. Hoſ. 12.10. <hi>I have multiplied Viſions, and uſed Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes by the Miniſtry of the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>God in his Word treats Chriſtians in the Quality of Souldiers, as a means to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Inſtructions more powerfully upon them.</hi> Scripture Alluſions and Similitudes have a double advantage to effect this.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They exceedingly delight men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their affections, and ſo make the deeper impreſſions upon their Memories.</hi> That which the Pſalmiſt affirms concerning the Word and Law of God in general, is true concerning the metaphorical al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions contained in it. <hi>They are ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Honey and the Honey-comb.</hi> Pſal. 19.10. The Souls of men are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizingly tranſported with raviſhing delight, whilſt they are digging and delving after the precious <hi>Oar</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtructions, that lye hid in the rich and inexhauſtible <hi>Mines</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Alluſions; and the deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon their engaged affections,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001145_0024_0FB08E750A213748"/>
give advantage to their being more faithfully ſecured, and treaſured up in their Memories. The more men love and admire any thing, the better they remember it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Objects the Spirit of God makes uſe of as a Stock to graff Spiritual Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on, are for the moſt part in our daily view; and by the ſight of them we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted unto a freſh remembrance of, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reflections upon thoſe inſtructions they readily afford us.</hi> We cannot look either upward or downward, on our right hand, or left, but ſome object or other comes in view which God hath ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to do the office of a Monitor, or faithful remembrancer, to aſſiſt our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on Spiritual things. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the mention of other Inſtances; The very ſight of a <hi>Souldier in Arms</hi> is enough to <hi>Muſter</hi> up an intire <hi>Regiment</hi> of holy thoughts, and profitable medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Soul of a Chriſtian. If he looks upon the dazling brightneſs of his glittering armour, behold! here is a monitor to put him in mind of the out-ſhining Splendour of thoſe glorious Robes of Righteouſneſs, which every Saint is Arrayed with. Each piece of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001145_0025_0FB08E789B94D638"/>
his Armour repreſents to him a ſeveral Grace of Gods Holy Spirit. Whilſt he ſeeth with what a ſtately grandeur he Marcheth after his Leader, diſdaining to caſt an eye upon the little trifling diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that lye in his way; will not this tell him that he muſt be a follower of the Lamb whitherſoever he goes? That he muſt preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling in Chriſt Jeſus? Doth he obſerve the remarkable Silence of the Souldier, whilſt he awaits the Orders of his Commander, and will not this engage him to entertain the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts reſolution, <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> Pſal. 85.8.

                  <hi>Take not up your Reſt in, ſet not your Affections on this World.</hi> This will prove an unhappy Snare to you, and tempt you to forſake the Service of your Glorious Commander.
