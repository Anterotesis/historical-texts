            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And the ſame Word declareth that our Lord Jeſus being in the Form of God, took upon him the Form of a Servant, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, that he might redeem his People from the Curſe of the Law, and give them power to become the Sons of God; and that they, together with the Privilege of <hi>Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> might have the Image of God reſtored to them, <hi>being born of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13. Here we are alſo taught that in order to their being made Partakers of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> "not by Communication of the divine Eſſence to them; but by God's impreſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them Qualities and Diſpoſitions which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Perfections of God": I ſay, that in order to this, the Son of God hath purchaſed and received the <hi>Gift of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who by his Office renews his People after the Image of God, when they are born of him; and ſo enableth them to <hi>put off the old Man which is corrupt; and to put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.22,-24. Now theſe are called <hi>Godly</hi> in Scripture; for they reſemble God in Knowlege,

Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, in Goodneſs and Truth, Grace and Mercy, according to the Meaſure of the Gift of Chriſt; tho' not in ſinleſs Perfection. And even in this Life, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, <hi>they are changed into the ſame I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from Glory to Glory,</hi> by the Spirit of the Lord: And they ſhall be perfectly transform'd into his Likeneſs when they ſhall ſee him as he is in the Light of Heaven.

And then, in their Trade and Commerce, they obſerve the Warning given, I Theſſ. 4.6. <hi>That no Man go beyond and defraud his Brother in any matter: becauſe that the Lord is the Avenger of all ſuch.</hi> And if in any Inſtance they have injured him, when they return to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will be ready to confeſs their Sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to give proper Satisfaction to their Neighbour, for the wrong done him.</p>

                  <p>This may be ſaid of them, when through the Corruption of the Times, they are hindred from ſerving God, and their Generation. Prov 28.12. —<hi>When the Wicked riſe, a Man is hidden.</hi> And this may be one Thing intended in that propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Deſcription, which we have of the <hi>ſlaying of the Witneſſes,</hi> Rev. 11. While ſome are in a literal Senſe ſlain for the Teſtimony of Jeſus; others may be ſlain <q>politically and civilly; depos'd, ſilenc'd, impriſon'd, and laid aſide as uſeleſs and dead.</q> And in this ſenſe ſome of the Godly might ceaſe and fail under <hi>Saul</hi>'s Male-Adminiſtration; as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were put to Death.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 22.18.</note> But that which I would briefly conſider at this Time is, <hi>Their ceaſing and failing by a natural Death.</hi> The Godly and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful muſt dye out of this World, as well as others.

Agreably, when that good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had receiv'd the Sentence of Death, he lamented and ſaid, as Iſai. 38.11. <hi>I ſhall not ſee the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the Living: I ſhall behold Man no more with the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the World.</hi> And we have that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Luk. 16.9. <hi>Make to your ſelves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteouſneſs; that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlaſting Habitations.</hi> At Death, Fleſh and Heart fail, Friends, Eſtates, and all earthly Comforts fail. <hi>As we brought nothing into

this World with us, ſo it is certain we can carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out.</hi> Yea, the faithful Servants of God are bereav'd of their preſent Advantages of glorifying God, and promoting the Good of his People.

Tho' the Manner and Event of their doing this, are vaſtly diſtant: The faithful Servant doth it with Joy unſpeakable and glorious; the Wicked with unutterable Grief and Confuſion. However, they are diſmiſs'd from their Work, one as well as the other. Dan. 12.13. <hi>Go thou thy way, for thou ſhalt Reſt.</hi> The Godly are call'd off from the toilſome Labours and Sufferings of this Life, and taken up to the more excellent Work, and to the glorious Rewards of Heaven. Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, is Dead, and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi> Indeed <hi>by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Godly</hi> are <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd</hi> from Sin, the <hi>Sting of Death;</hi> and they ſhall obtain a <hi>compleat Victory</hi> over this laſt Enemy at the <hi>Reſurrection of the Juſt,</hi> when the Dominion which Death hath had from <hi>Adam,</hi> will give a joyful Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to our Lord, for the Manifeſtation of His divine Knowledge, Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, in gathering their ſcattered Duſt, forming their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies anew out of it, and faſhioning them <hi>like to his own glorious Body.</hi> But the Time would fail me to enter into a particular Conſideration of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Godly die as well as others.</p>

How unwearied in attending the Buſineſs of it, even when his bodily Infirmities urged him to ſpare himſelf! For the Proof of theſe Things, I might appeal to <hi>Witneſſes</hi> here preſent, and to the <hi>Books</hi> and Records of the <hi>College,</hi> where, if I miſtake not, ſtand ſome peculiar Monuments of his laborious Diligence. Indeed, I can't but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the Power of God was magnified in his Weakneſs; in that, under ſuch frequent Returns of Pain, he was ſo far ſtrengthned and ſpirited to his Work; particularly, in the <hi>extreme Cold</hi> of the laſt <hi>Winter.</hi>

                  <p>THIS Epiſtle of the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> (in which he gives ſuch an agreable Account of himſelf) all agree was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> his beloved Son in the Faith. But whether it was the firſt, or the ſecond Time of his going thither, and appearing before <hi>Ceſar,</hi> is not ſo certain. A learned Expoſitor has in his Preface to this Epiſtle <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond.</note>, offered many conſiderable Arguments to prove that this was the firſt time of his being at <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Verſes that I have now read, and ſome other Verſes in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004196_0036_1003FD6C308BE6F8"/>
this Epiſtle together with the Poſtſcript, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>tten the laſt time he came thither, and when he had the near and certain Proſpect of his Death.</p>
                  <p>But when this Epiſtle was written is not ſo much my preſent Purpoſe, as the Things which are contained in the Verſes now before us. And I think they may all be reduced to theſe three general Heads, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. The Apoſtles <hi>Apprehenſion of himſelf</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his <hi>preſent</hi> State, namely <hi>that he was now upon the very brink of Death,</hi> expreſſed in thoſe Words, <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>II. <hi>His peaceful, and comfortable Reflection upon the paſt Conduct of himſelf in the Courſe of his Life,</hi> in thoſe Words, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>III. <hi>His pleaſing Proſpect, and joyful Expectation of what he and other Saints ſhould meet with hereafter. —Thenceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And theſe are accordingly the three general Heads, which I propoſe for the Subject of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Meditation at this time.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider the Apoſtle's <hi>Apprehenſion of himſelf with reſpect to his preſent State,</hi> namely <hi>that he was now upon the very brink of Death.—I am now ready to he offered, and the time of my Departure is at Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Apoſtle is here plainly ſpeaking of his Death; ſo what I would obſerve under this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004196_0037_1003FDCB0D576BA8"/>1. <hi>The Account he gives of Death, or the Manner in which he deſcribes it, viz</hi> as an OFFERING, and a DEPARTURE.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The full Apprehenſion he had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be at Hand, ready even then to come upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Calmneſs, the Eaſineſs, and Freedom, with which he ſeems to ſpeak or write of if.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Let us conſider the Account the Apoſtle gives of Death, or the Manner in which he deſcribes it,</hi> viz. <hi>as an</hi> Offering, <hi>and a</hi> departure.</p>
                  <p>I am ready to be <hi>Offered,</hi> and my <hi>Departure;</hi>— which refer to his Death. So then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He calls it an <hi>Offering,</hi> or <hi>pouring out;</hi> for ſo it is in the Original, <hi>I am now already poured out</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">gap DESC="foreign"</note>. It is obſerved to be the ſame Word that is uſed, for the <hi>Drink-Offerings</hi> under the Law, which were won't to be <hi>poured out.</hi> Hence the Word, in the Septuagint or Greek Tranſlation for <hi>Drink-Offering;</hi> is derived from the ſame Word that the Apoſtle here uſeth <note n="‡" place="bottom">Numb 28.7.</note>. And the Apoſtle, if he apprehended with what Death he ſhould glorify God, might conſider it as a ſort of Sacrifice, not by way of Expiation or Atonement; (for there was a ſufficiency of that for the greateſt Sins, in the Sacrifice that Chriſt once made of himſelf) but in confirmation of the Truth of the Goſpel which he bore Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to, and was now about to Seal with his Blood. Hence the Word is obſerved to refer to ſuch Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as were for the Confirmation of ſome Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Leigh, Cri. Sac.</note>. And the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the ſame Dialect concerning his Death, to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Ch. 2.17. If I <hi>be offered</hi> (the ſame Word) upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith. Thus the Apoſtle, we may ſuppoſe, looks upon his Death in this View,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004196_0038_1003FD6EC83C69E8"/>
even as an offering up of his Life to God; and that he does this very freely and readily, conſidering what a Teſtimony he ſhould hereby give, and what a Confirmation it would be of the Truth of the Goſpel, that new Covenant of Grace, which he had been preaching to the World, ever ſince his Converſion to the chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>But then, if we conſider the <hi>Word,</hi> according to the literal Meaning of it, viz. <hi>a pouring forth;</hi> it may ſerve to give us ſome Idea of Death, which is the <hi>pouring forth</hi> of Life. For the Life goes forth at Death; and in a ſudden and violent Death, it may be ſaid to be poured out, in a full continued Stream; and not by Drops, as in a lingring Death. Thus the Blood, which is called the Life of the Beaſt, was to be poured out<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xii 16.</note>; when the Beaſt was killed for Sacrifice, or for Food. And it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed concerning Chriſt, that he ſhould pour out his Soul unto Death<note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſaiah liii 12.</note>. But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle according to the common Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, here ſpeaks of Death as a DIPARTURE. <hi>My Departure is at Hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Death may very properly be called a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</hi> For at Death the Soul departs; it departs from the Body, and takes its leave of it for the preſent. Moreover, Life, Senſe, and Motion, all depart from the Body; and leave it a lifeleſs ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Carcaſs, at Death. Nay the Body it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts at Death. The preſent Form and Viſage of the Face depart, then <hi>his Beauty conſumes away like a Moth</hi>

                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job 14. 20.</note>. And the Body becomes ſuch a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Spectacle, that the deareſt Friends are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004196_0039_1003FDD5140BB6C0"/>
to have it removed and burled out of their Sight, not to appear any more till the Reſurrection. It is a Departure, as the Man at Death departs from his preſent Houſe and Home to the Grave, <hi>that Houſe appointed for all the Living. For the Wind paſſeth over him and he is gone, and the Places</hi> that knew him <hi>ſhall know him no more</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm ciii. 16.</note>. At Death the Man departs from his preſent Friends and Company, and inſtead of being among the Living to Praiſe God, he is gone to the Congregation of the Dead. He departs alſo from the preſent Buſineſs and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of Life, to the Place of Silence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity; from the Hurries and Cares and Labours of this Life, to the Grave, where there is no Work, no. Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, he <hi>departs</hi> from his preſent Poſſeſſions and Enjoyments; for at Death we leave all behind us, to thoſe that come after us. <hi>Naked came we out of our Mother's Womb, and naked ſhall we return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Job i. 21.</note>. Moreover, he <hi>departs</hi> from his preſent Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and Sufferings; and if he be a good Man, to that Place where the Wicked ceaſe from troubling, and where the Weary be at reſt; where he reſts from his Labours, and his Works follow him. In a Word, He departs out of this World; for as our Birth is our Entry into it, ſo our Death is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, ſo as to have no more to do with it. We go off the Stage, we make our Exit, and appear no more to act any other Part upon it. Thus Death is a <hi>Departure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then the Word<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> tranſlated a <hi>Departure</hi> is obſerved to ſignify more properly a <hi>Diſſolution.</hi> And this will ſerve to give us a further Notion of Death; for it may truly be ſaid of Death that
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004196_0040_1003FD73235092B8"/>
it is a Diſſolution. It diſſolves the vital Union of Soul and Body. That cloſe and intimate Union that there has been of the eſſential Parts of our Conſtitution is broken by Death, ſo that their Relation to, and Dependance upon each other, for their Senſations or Perceptions, are entirely over for the preſent. One Part is returned or returning to the Duſt as it was, while the other is gone to God that gave it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, If we conſider the Body by it ſelf, Death is the Diſſolution of it. For in Life there is a cloſe &amp; regular Connection of the ſeveral Parts of the Body, whereby they have a near Relation to, and a Dependance and Influence upon each other, which Conjunction, and Connection of the Parts is in the Time of Life preſerved by the Laws of Adheſion and Attraction, or ſome other Way of the Creator that we know nothing about; which at Death begins to diſſolve. Then the wonderful Structure of the humane Body begins to fall to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and this Maſter-piece of the lower Creation, even all the Members and Organs of the Body that were ſo <hi>curiouſly wrought in the loweſt Parts if the Earth,</hi> looſe their Form, Situation and Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and diſſolve at length into the ſame kind of Duſt out of which Man was formed at firſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more Form, Connection or Dependance one upon another, than the common Sand or Duſt with which it is intermingled. <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt ſhalt thou return,</hi> Gen. iii. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come now to conſider, <hi>The full Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle had of the near Approach of his Death, or Departure; that he looked upon it to be juſt at Hand, and ready even then to come upon him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am <hi>now</hi> ready to be offered, and my Departure <hi>is at Hand.</hi> What particular Reaſon the Apoſtle
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004196_0041_1003FDDCDE27AE48"/>
had to think ſo, we are not told. An eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Echard</hi>
                     </note> tells us from the Fathers, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him, that his Death was approaching, ſome Time before this; and that he ſhould ſuffer Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom at <hi>Rome,</hi> which cauſed him to haſten with Joy to the Place. And conſidering that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt witneſſed in every City, of the Bonds and Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that he ſhould meet with<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts xx. 23.</note>; it is no Wonder if he ſhould give him ſome Notice of his Death, that finiſhing Stroke of his Sufferings, ſome Time before-hand. But whether this be ſo or no, yet if this was the laſt Time of his being at <hi>Rome,</hi> he was in cloſe Impriſonment, and he might at the Time of his Writing this Epiſtle be under a Sentence of Death, at leaſt within himſelf, which he might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue from the Cruelty and Rage of that bloody Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> the roman Emperor, and the fierce Perſecution he was now engaged in againſt the Chriſtians; and ſo it proved, for in that Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and towards the latter End of that Reign, he was beheaded, and <hi>Peter</hi> crucified in <hi>Rome;</hi> and as is generally agreed, on the ſame Day.</p>
                  <p>And as the bleſſed Apoſtle had Notice and Warning of his Death, ſome how or other, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, ſo it has been with others, they have had ſome Revelation or Intimations of their Death, ſome Time before it has come upon them. Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> had expreſs Notice of his Death, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was ordered to take him, and <hi>Eliezer</hi> his Son to Mount <hi>Hor;</hi> and told him that <hi>Aaron ſhould he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered unto his People, and die there</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Numb. xx. 25, 26.</note>. And <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had it revealed unto him, that he ſhould go up and die at Mount <hi>Nebo</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii. 49.</note>. And <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was revealed before-hand, not only to him,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004196_0042_1003F9EA75BEE170"/>
but to <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and to the <hi>Sons of the Prophets,</hi> who ask'd <hi>Eliſha</hi> whether he knew <hi>that the Lord would take away his Maſter from his Head that Day?</hi> To which he replies, <hi>that he knew it</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Kings ii. 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And altho' theſe are extraordinary Inſtances, and the moſt common Caſe is that of good old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who <hi>knew not the Day of his Death.</hi> That is, not the very Day, nor particular Time that Life will come to an End; yet God in his Providence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes gives fair Intimations to Men that their Departure is at Hand. This is the Caſe of thoſe that are of an advanced Age, and have the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays of Nature growing apace upon them. This is alſo the Caſe of ſuch as are ſeized with mortal Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and under uncontroulable Languiſhments; for when ſuch Diſtempers prevail, notwithſtanding all the Means uſed for the Removal of them; they give fair Intimations that our Diſſolution ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and that the Time of our Departure is at hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What I propoſed further to obſerve under this firſt general Head was, <hi>The Calmneſs, Eaſineſs and Freedom with which he ſpeaks of his Death or Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> which he apprehended to be at hand.</p>
                  <p>And by what follows in my Text it appears that he was not under any Ruffle or Perplexity of Mind, at his Thinking or Writing of his Death. The realizing Thought of Death, or of its being juſt at hand, was no Surprize to him. He had been in <hi>Deaths oft,</hi> yea he as it were <hi>died daily;</hi> he had been expecting and waiting for it, and the News of its Approach inſtead of ſtirring up any Fear or Terror, it afforded Matter of Rejoycing to him, and he was ready to bid it welcome. He tells us
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004196_0043_1003FDE57779D3F8"/>
in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Chap. i. 23. That he had a <hi>Deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt; which was far better</hi> than to be here. And he heid ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſame Mind, now he ſaw Death approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and coming in good earneſt. The <hi>Jeopardy he was in every Hour,</hi> had made Death very familiar to him; and it ſeemed to be no more to him than to fall aſleep; for ſo he calls it, <hi>a Sleep in Jeſus.</hi> And as to what followed after Death, that was a Joy rather than any Fear to him, conſidering the Promiſes and the Proſpects which the Goſpel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him.</p>
                  <p>And now this is the happy Privilege of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the eminent Saints and faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt; that Death ceaſes to be <hi>the King of Terrors</hi> unto them, and the near, yea the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Proſpects of it, are no Surprize to them. Nay, ſome who <hi>through fear of Death have all their Life time been ſubject to Bondage,</hi> yet when Death has actually drawn near, and they have ſeen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a going, all their Fears have been ſcattered, and they have been able to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſalm xxiii. 4. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy Staff they comfort me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now, what was it that afforded ſuch Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Comfort to the Apoſtle under the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Death? Why, it was the Reflection he had upon his paſt Conduct; and ſo the lively Views and certain Proſpect of the Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that follow after Death and the Judgment. Which leads me to the other general Heads I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to conſider, and which lye ſo obvious in my Text. So then,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Let us conſider, <hi>The peaceful and comfortable Reflection of the Apoſtle upon his Conduct, in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004196_0044_1003FD7B2EC24A88"/>
Time paſt of his Life;</hi> eſpecially ſince he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Faith of Chriſt; Namely, <hi>That he had fought the good Fight, that he had finiſhed his Courſe, and kept the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The holy Apoſtle being come to the Cloſe of Life; he looks back upon what was paſt, to ſee how he had managed, and behaved himſelf in the World.</p>
                  <p>And what can be more proper, than for a Man when he is juſt finiſhing the Scene of Life, to take a Review of the ſeveral Parts of it, and ſee how he has managed himſelf: Whether he has anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the great End of Living, or fruſtrated the grand Deſign of his Being? Whether his Life has been to any good Purpoſe, to the Honour of God and for the Good of others, as well as for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Salvation? Whether he has lived as the Grace of God has taught him? This is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a Man in order to the removing his Fears of Death, and ſettling his Hopes and Expectations of a future Glory upon a good Foundation. For as we have behaved our ſelves in this World, ſo may we expect it will fare with us in the World that is to come. For here we ſtand Probationers for the eternal State, and we ſhall receive of our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge <hi>according to the things done in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether they have been good, or whether they have been evil,</hi> 2 Cor. viii. 10.</p>
                  <p>And now the Apoſtle upon a ſerious, thorough and impartial Review of his paſt Life, was able to give a good Account of it, which gave him ſuch a Calm in the near Proſpect, and ſuch Courage in the very Hour of Death, He had this for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, even the Teſtimony of his Conſcience that he had fought the good Fight, that he had finiſhed his Courſe, and that he had kept the Faith.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here is an Alluſion (as is ſuppoſed) to the grecian or roman Games, in which there were <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> as well as <hi>Wreſtlings</hi> and <hi>Racings;</hi> and ſo he had engaged in the chriſtian Combat: He had liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under Chriſt's Banner, and waged War with the Enemies and Oppoſers of Chriſtianity; and had <hi>fought manfully under the Captain of his Salvation; had endured Hardneſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> He conflicted with great Difficulties, &amp; patiently ſuffered the ſharpeſt Perſecutions, &amp; all Manner of Hardſhips, ſhort of Death, &amp; now was going to ſuffer <hi>that,</hi> for the Cauſe of Chriſt &amp; of his Goſpel. And what a long Catalogue of his Sufferings does he give us in 2 Cor. xi. 23, — 27. <hi>In Labours mere abundant, in Stripes above meaſure, in Priſons more frequent, in Deaths oft, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by my own Countrymen, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wilderneſs, in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils in the Sea, in Perils among falſe Brethren; in Wearineſs and Painfulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold and Nakedneſs.</hi> But he ſurmounted theſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, overcame all theſe Oppoſitions; and <hi>came off a Conquerer, yea, more than a Conquerer, through Chriſt that loved him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, altho' we have not is all Reſpects the ſame Enemies to fight againſt, not ſuch Difficulties and Dangers to encounter, no ſuch fierce Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Perſections from the civil Power, who were at that Time the profeſſed Enemies of Chriſt; yet there is, as we are told, Job vii. 1. according to the marginal Reading, <hi>a Warfare to Man upon Earth;</hi> and a good Fight which we muſt be able to ſay we have fought, if we would have Peace and Comfort in a dying Hour. There are ſpiritual, and fleſhly, and worldly Luſts, (all which war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004196_0046_1003F9EEAD0BD088"/>
the Soul) for us to fight with. There are alſo the Examples of the Wicked, the Enticements of Sinners, and the corrupt Cuſtoms of the World, and our own evil Habits, to oppoſe and conquer; and laſt of all, there is our <hi>Adverſary the Devil, who as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we muſt be able to ſay that we have waged and carried on a War with theſe our Enemies, that we have been fighting with them, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and overcome them. We muſt be able to ſay, that by the Grace of Chriſt, <hi>we have crucified the Fleſh, with all it's Affections and Luſts;</hi> that we have watched &amp; guarded againſt the Snares of the World, and have by Faith gain'd the Victory over it, ſo as in a good Meaſure to get above the Hopes or Fears, the Frowns or Flatteries of it. And that we reſiſt the Devil, ſo as to cauſe him to flee from us. In a Word, We are ſo to fight and ſtruggle with our Luſts, and all our ſpiritual Enemies, as to come to ſuch a Paſs, that no Iniquity has the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us.</p>
                  <p>But then,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle <hi>finiſhed his Courſe,</hi> or run his Race. Alluding ſtill to the Iſthmian &amp; Olympick Games. And what he here informs us concerning himſelf was, that notwithſtanding all the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Dangers, and Oppoſitions in his Way; yet he kept on his Courſe, diligently, ſteddily, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and perſeveringly, even unto the End.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghoſt had witneſſed <hi>in every City, that Bonds and Afflictions waited for him;</hi> but ſays he, with a noble Courage and Reſolution, becoming an Apoſtle, <hi>None of theſe Things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and the Miniſtry I have received of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Acts xx. 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004196_0047_1003FDEF331DC508"/>The Apoſtle had a Race to run, as a Chriſtian, and as a Miniſter; and in both theſe Reſpects he finiſhed his Courſe; that is, he faithfully diſcharged the Duties which the Goſpel required of him, as a Chriſtian, and as an Apoſtle. He had the <hi>Teſtimony of his Conſcience, that in Simplicity and godly Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, he had his Converſation in the World;</hi> and that he had exerciſed himſelf to have a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence, towards God and towards Men;</hi> carefully attending all the Duties of the chriſtian Life.</p>
                  <p>And then as an Apoſtle he went abroad faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhing the Goſpel of Chriſt, from City to City, and from one Country to another People, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every Plate that the Holy Ghoſt ſignified to him that he ſhould go unto. And a great Race indeed in this Reſpect did he run; and it would take a longer Time, than I have at preſent, only to reckon up the Voyages and Travels of this great Apoſtle. And altho' he ſpeaks humbly of himſelf, as <hi>the leaſt of the Apoſtles, and not meet to he called an Apoſtle, becauſe be perſecuted the Church of God;</hi> yet he declares at the ſame time, <hi>that he laboured more abundantly than they all, by the Grace of God that was with him</hi>

And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> which is ſuppoſed by many, to be ſome <hi>bodily Weakneſs;</hi> yet he went on ſteddily, through the whole Courſe of his Miniſtry and Service, <hi>preaching Chriſt warning &amp; teaching every Man, — ſtriving according to his Working, which wrought in him mightily</hi>

he appeals to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> when he took his Leave of them, for his Fidelity, Conſtancy and Diligence in the Service of Chriſt, and of their Souls. Acts xx. 18,-27. <hi>Ye know after what Manner I have been with you at all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſerving the Lord with all Humility of Mind, and with many Tears and temptations, — and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and have taught you publickly, and from Houſe to Houſe, teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, &amp; Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore I take you to record this Day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men; for I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Counſel of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the bleſſed Apoſtle, ſo every Chriſtian has a Race to run, a Courſe to finiſh, if he would finiſh his Life with Peace, and receive a Crown hereafter. There are all the Duties of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life, even thoſe of Piety, Juſtice and Charity, which may be conſidered as the chriſtian Race; ſo that for us to run the chriſtian Race, is to live as the Goſpel, and the Grace of God teaches us, which is <hi>to deny Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts; and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the preſent World <note n="‡" place="bottom">Heh. xii <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note>.</hi> And to finiſh this Courſe, is to perſevere in Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing to the End, <hi>to continue Faithful unto the Death.</hi> It is as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>to run with Patience,</hi> or Perſeverance, <hi>the Race that is ſot before us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, for I can only hint at Things, to run our Race, and <hi>finiſh our Courſe,</hi> is to ſet out in the Ways of Chriſtianity; to conſider the Duties of every Station and Relation, of every Circumſtance and Condition of Life; and to go on in the ſincere,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004196_0049_1003FDFD2FD21C78"/>
diligent and ſteddy Practice of them. It is to run the Way of God's Commandments, and not ſuffer our ſelves to be diverted out of it, or hindred from going on in it. It is to <hi>run</hi> without being <hi>Weary,</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> without <hi>Fainting.</hi> It is to <hi>hold on our Way,</hi> yea, and <hi>to wax ſtronger and ſtronger.</hi> In a Word, It is to be <hi>always abounding in the Work of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle had this Teſtimony, that <hi>he had kept the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which intends either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he kept the <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of his Faith.</p>
                  <p>He was not ſo terrified by the Enemies of Chriſt, nor at the Rage and Fury of his cruel Perſecutors; but that in the midſt of Danger, &amp; Death, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and courageouſly profeſſed Chriſt, and his holy Religion. And notwithſtanding the Contempt and Reproaches that were caſt upon Chriſt, and even the Scandal of the Croſs; yet he was not aſhamed to own him before Men. And altho' the Croſs, that is the Sufferings &amp; ignominious Death of Chriſt were to <hi>the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks Fooliſhneſs;</hi> yet he glories in nothing more than in the Croſs of Chriſt, he being to them who are called <hi>the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> i. 23, 24.</note>. And amidſt all the Trials and Temptations to the contrary, he held faſt <hi>the Profeſſion of his Faith, without Waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may intend his keeping the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Faith, or of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>And this he kept, as he conſtantly maintained the Truth of it againſt all Gainſayers. And as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated the Goſpel, by his Preaching, &amp; by his Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; ſo he confirmed the ſame, not only with the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004196_0050_1003FA52EB6B8638"/>
ſtrongeſt Reaſonings; but by divers Signs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt. He made full Proof of his Miniſtry, preaching the Word <hi>in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and with Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some underſtand the <hi>Grace</hi> of Faith here.</p>
                  <p>And ſo he kept the Faith, as he continued his Faith and Truſt in God, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He believed on him with all his Heart. He accepted of Chriſt as his only Saviour, and looked for Deliverance from all Condemnation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in and through him; believing as he ſaid, <hi>That there is no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He looked for Juſtification, not from his own Righteouſneſs; but from the free Grace of God, <hi>through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He depended alſo upon him, for all Grace and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Strength, that he ſtood in need of; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it was <hi>through Chriſt ſtrengthening him, he could do all Things;</hi> and that of himſelf he <hi>was not ſufficient ſo much as for a good Thought.</hi> In a Word, he gives this Account of himſelf, Gal. ii. 20. <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me; and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he kept this Faith, continued in it firm and ſteddy to the End; and he grew ſtrong in it, whereby he gave Glory to God, and gained a Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over the World; and when Death it ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, it did by no Means fail; but he triumphed over all the Pears and Terrors of it, <hi>knowing in whom he had believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now we muſt thus <hi>keep the Faith.</hi> We muſt continue in our Profeſſion of Chriſt, and of his Goſpel. We muſt continue in a firm and unſhaken Belief of the Goſpel, <hi>the Faith that was once deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004196_0051_1003FE0D9494B510"/>
to the Saints.</hi> And we muſt, as we <hi>believe in God, believe alſo in Chriſt.</hi> And we muſt watch and pray, that our Faith fail not; and muſt reſolve that nothing ſhall diſcourage, or break us off from our Faith in him; that altho' <hi>he ſlay us, yet we will truſt in him.</hi> We <hi>muſt truſt in him at all Times,</hi> and <hi>in the Shadow of his Wings, we muſt make our Refuge.</hi> We muſt truſt to the Merits of his Obedience &amp; Death, to the Prevalency of his Interceſſion, to the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Freeneſs of divine Grace; and we muſt be influenced by ſuch a Faith, to all Love, Holineſs and Obedience; and muſt continue in ſuch a Faith, even unto the Death, if we would receive <hi>the End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have gone through the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head, even the Apoſtle's Reflection upon the paſt Conduct of himſelf, in the Courſe of his Life; and happy he, and happy every Man, that upon an impartial Review of his Life, is able to give ſuch a Teſtimony of it; <hi>That he has fought the good Fight, finiſhed his Courſe, and kept the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. I proceed to conſider the laſt general Head, viz. <hi>The joyful Expectation which the Apoſtle had of what he ſhould meet with hereafter,</hi> viz <hi>A Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge would give him at that Day; and not to him only, but to them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle was upon the Brink of both Worlds. He had paſſed thro' this World, &amp; was leaving it; and was juſt entring upon the Borders of the other. And as with one Eye, he looks back to ſee what he had done, how he had behaved in his paſt Life; ſo with the other, he looks forward to ſee what he was to receive in the future. And as he had the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Conſcience, as to his paſt Life; ſo he
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004196_0052_1003FE11B959F220"/>
had moſt joyful Expectations in the Life that was to come. <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. He argues with himſelf, that ſince he had fought the good Fight, and finiſhed his Courſe ſo well; all which remained now, was to <hi>receive the Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Here he ſeems to carry on the Alluſion to the ancient Games, and proceeds in the <hi>agoniſtick Stile.</hi> For as the Victors, in thoſe Combats or Racings, received a Laurel, a Crown upon their Winning it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rules of thoſe Games; which was given to them by one appointed to judge and determine whether they had won it, or no: So the Apoſtle having fought the Good Fight, and run his Race, he is aſſured, that there is a glorious <hi>Crown laid up for him, which the righteous Judge would give him at that Day, and not to him only, but to them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi> He had the Teſtimony of his Conſcience, that he had acted his Part well; and ſo doubted not, but that he had the Approbation of his Judge; and all he expected now was to receive the Token of it, in the glorious Crown before him. Here are ſeveral Things proper to be taken notice of, with ſome Enlargement, was there Time for it.</p>
                  <p>As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Name</hi> he gives to that Reward, he ſays was laid up for him, viz. <hi>A Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Crowns are ſet upon the Heads of Emperors and Kings in Token of their regal Dignity, and Power, and Glory; accordingly a Crown is an Emblem or Token of very high Honour and Dignity; ſo that when the Apoſtle ſays, there was laid up for him a <hi>Crown,</hi> it was as much as to ſay, that he had by a patient Continuance in Well-doing, been ſeeking for <hi>Glory, Honour</hi> and <hi>Immortality.</hi> He believed it was laid up for him, and that he ſhould receive it. He expected all thoſe Marks of Honour and Glory
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004196_0053_1003FE1C0E928B88"/>
which would be conferred upon ſuch whom the <hi>King</hi> of Heaven <hi>delighted to honour.</hi> And hence, ſometimes it is called <hi>a Crown of Glory,</hi> and a <hi>Crown of Life</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r v. 4. James i 12.</note>. But here he calls it, <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs.</hi> By which we are to underſtand, either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That Righteouſneſs would be his Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs was the Glory with which our Nature was crowned, and adorned at firſt; (this being a great Part of the Image of God upon the Soul of Man) ſo it will moſt certainly be the ſpecial and peculiar Glory of the Saints in Heaven; that they are made perfect in Holineſs. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>a Crown of Righteouſneſs</hi> may be intended, a Crown purchaſed and procured <hi>by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> even by his Obedience and Death, which has unbarred the Gates of Heaven, and opened all the Glory and Happineſs thereof unto us, and made Way for our obtaining it, by Virtue thereof. Or,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Rewards of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Reward to be beſtowed upon righteous Men. For as the Pſalmiſt ſays, Pſal. lviii. 11. <hi>Verily, there is a Reward for the Righteous.</hi> And that in keeping the Commandments, <hi>there is a great Reward,</hi> Pſalm xix. 11. Which Reward is not to be reckoned of Debt, but of Grace. Or,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the Crown's being called <hi>a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> we may underſtand, <hi>that Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which of Right belongs to all the Saints, according to the Tenor of the Goſpel-Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For altho' it be a Reward not of Debt, but of free Grace; yet by Virtue of the Covenant, and Promiſes of the Goſpel, to which the Saints are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled; it may be called a Reward, or a Crown of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004196_0054_1003FAA44514EF10"/>
                     <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> For God of his free Grace, has by his Word &amp; Promiſe, transferred a <hi>Right</hi> to them. Hence it is ſaid to the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> Rev. xxii. 14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But which Way ſoever we underſtand the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it comes to the ſame Thing; for that which is intended by it, is the Glory and the Happineſs of the other World, that will be conferred upon all the ſincere Saints, and faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is worthy of our Remark, <hi>from whom</hi> the Apoſtle expected to <hi>receive this Reward, this Crown of Righteouſneſs;</hi> namely, <hi>from the Lord, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is conſtituted the Judge of the World; the Son of God, to whom the Father <hi>hath given Authority to execute Judgment, becauſe he is the Son of Man</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">John v. 27.</note>. And he is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge: For unto the Son, he ſaith, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a Scepter of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is the Scepter of thy Kingdom</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Heb. i. 8.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And this was he whom the Apoſtle believed in with all his Heart, had preached to the World, had faithfully ſerved; and laid himſelf out with moſt indefatigable Diligence, to promote his Intereſt, and advance his Honour. From him, I ſay, it was that the Apoſtle expected to receive a glorious Reward.</p>
                  <p>And how great and glorious a Crown may we ſuppoſe him to expect from ſuch <hi>a plentiful Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> conſidering how ardently he loved him, how faithfully he ſerved him, how much he denied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his Sake, what Sufferings he had already
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004196_0055_1003FE2967EE4658"/>
endured, and conſidering that he was now about to lay down his Life in his Cauſe?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may conſider the <hi>Manner</hi> in which he expected to receive this Crown, viz. <hi>By Way of Gift. Which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Altho' he had been ſo faithfully ſerving Chriſt, and was now ready to die for him, rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny him. And altho' he expected a very glorious Reward, yet he has no Apprehenſion of Merit in all this. He don't look upon himſelf as having merited the leaſt of what he expected. For if he was a diſtinguiſh'd Saint, yet he knew who it was that made him to differ; and <hi>that it was by the Grace of God that he was what he was:</hi> and that if he <hi>laboured more abundantly than the other</hi> Apoſtles, <hi>it was not HE, but the Grace of God that was with him</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 10.</note>. And as he looked upon all he had already, as what he had received freely from God; ſo what he expected further, he looked upon as a free Gift; not what he had merited by all his Services and Sufferings, but what would be freely given him. Indeed he looks for it, as what was promiſed and ſecured to him by the Goſpel-Covenant; but not as what his Services had merited. And ſo the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth between the Rewards of Sin, and the Rewards of Righteouſneſs: One he calls Wages, the other a Gift. <hi>The</hi> Wages <hi>of Sin is Death: but the Gift of God is eternal Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi>

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004196_0056_1003FE30AC1B7548"/>For altho' the Apoſtle in other Places ſpeaks of his <hi>being preſent with the Lord, when abſent from the Body</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 8.</note> and of his <hi>deſiring to depart, and to be with Chriſt; which is far better</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil i. 23.</note> than to be here: Yet the Crown of Righteouſneſs, the Completion of his Happineſs, which he expects from the righteous Judge, is <hi>at that Day;</hi> viz. that Day when the righteous Judge ſhall appear to judge the World. We are told, Acts xvii. 31. That God <hi>hath appointed A DAY in which he will judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath ordained.</hi> And it is called <hi>that Day</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Jade 6</note>. Accordingly that is the Time repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in Scripture, when the Rewards of Glory ſhall be given to the Saints. This the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to encourage the Elders to be faithful in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flock of God, aſſures them; <hi>that when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear,</hi> that is at the Judgment, <hi>they ſhould receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. v 4</note>. So that it is when the chief Shepherd and Judge ſhall appear to judge the World, that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the Apoſtles expected to receive a Crown of Righteouſneſs, and a Crown of Glory. He was full in the Belief of the Reſurrection of the Body, of the Judgment to come, and of the future State; and died in the confident Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof; believing there was a Crown laid up for him, which at the Reſurrection of the Juſt and the Judgment that follows upon it, he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And this Faith, in ſome good Degree, have all the Saints. And this leads me,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To obſerve, <hi>The full Perſwaſion and confident Expectation</hi> the Apoſtle had of <hi>receiving this glorious Crown.</hi>

                     <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004196_0057_1003FE3658AE9E68"/>He ſpeaks of it with an Aſſurance; <hi>Henceforth, there IS laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge WILL give me.</hi> He was fully perſwaded of this, there was no Doubt or Uncertainty remaining in his Mind about the Matter; but he ſeems to be well aſſured of it, as the Racers were of the Laurel, or the Crown they ſaw hung up at the End of the Race. And with ſuch ſure and certain Hopes, with ſuch ſtrong and lively Proſpects of a glorious Crown; he is enabled to receive the Maſſages of Death with all Calmneſs and Courage, has all his natural Fears of Death ſcattered, and with Pleaſure thinks of his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was ſo near at Hand.</p>
                  <p>And this is the happy Privilege of ſome of God's eminent Saints and Servants: They have ſuch clear Evidences of their being in a State of Grace, and ſuch Aſſurances of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for them; that they can, not only die in Peace, but are able even to rejoyce at ſuch a Time, in Hope of that Glory there is now reſerved in Heaven for them, and ſhall in due Time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Let me further obſerve, <hi>The pleaſing Thought</hi> the Apoſtle had at this Time, with Reſpect to the <hi>Salvation and Happineſs of others,</hi> as well as his own.</p>
                  <p>Was he ſo Selfiſh as to think and pleaſe himſelf with the Thoughts of a Crown of Righteouſneſs and Glory far none but himſelf? Was he for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolizing the Glory and Happineſs of Heaven, as ſome Men would the Riches and Honours of the preſent World? No, but pleaſed himſelf with the Thought that this World would be the happy Lot and Portion of all true Believers, as well as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>And not to me only, but to them alſo that love
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004196_0058_1003FE41694B26D8"/>
his Appearing.</hi> He did not look upon the Crown as belonging only to him, or as if he was the only one that ſhould receive a Reward; but that others, even all that loved the Appearance of Chriſt, ſhould be Partakers with him in the future Glory and Felicity.</p>
                  <p>And here is the Difference between thoſe that run the chriſtian Race, and the Racers among the Grecians or Romans: For in their Racings, there was but one that gained the Prize; altho' many ran, and ſtrove for it. <hi>Know ye not that they which run in a Race, run all, but one receiveth the Prize</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor ix. 24.</note>? Whereas in the chriſtian Race, all that run with Patience and Perſeverance, ſhall obtain the Prize, the Crown of eternal Life. And this Thought, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being any Abatement of his Pleaſure, was a great Addition to it: It pleaſed him that others ſhould be as ſurely, and as gloriouſly rewarded as he; according to their Services and Faith.</p>
                  <p>He had his Soul enlarged in Love to his Fellow-Creatures; he wiſhed, and prayed, and longed, and laid himſelf out to the utmoſt, for their Converſion and Salvation. He tells us, Rom. x. 1. <hi>That it was his Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God for Iſrael, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And ſo earneſt &amp; ardent were his Deſires for the Salvation of his People, as to carry him beyond Bounds, and to expreſs himſelf in ſuch an hyperbolical Manner, (as is thought) in Rom. ix. 3. <hi>I could wiſh that my ſelf were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> or ſeparated, <hi>from Chriſt, for my Brethren my Kinſmen according to the Fleſh.</hi> And how ſollicitous was he, that they and others, might believe and be ſaved? In ſo much, that he even <hi>travailed in Birth that Chriſt might be formed in them</hi>
                     <note n="‡" place="bottom">Gal. 4.19.</note>. He preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004196_0059_1003FE44E46F9360"/>
he taught, he warned, he exhorted every Man, in all Wiſdom, labouring and ſtriving according to the Power and Grace of God given to him; and what was it for? but <hi>that he might preſent every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Col. i. 28.</note>. And well might he think of it with Pleaſure; that not only he, but that all true Believers ſhould receive ſuch unfading Crowns of Glory from the Lord their righteous Judge.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Temper of every true Saint: Their Souls are not only elevated into a ſupreme Love of God, but enlarged in a ſincere and fervent Charity to all the Saints; and it will pleaſe every Saint to think that others will, as well as they receive thoſe Marks of divine Honour, and Favour; and that they ſhall join together, even innumerable Companies of Saints and Angels, in ſhouting forth the Praiſes of God, and the Lamb for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I have but one Word more to add here; and that is, the Apoſtle's <hi>Deſcription</hi> of thoſe for whom this Crown of Righteouſneſs was laid up, as well as for himſelf, viz. <hi>Such as love his Appearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is the Appearing of the Lord, the righte-Judge, before mentioned. So that one Part of the Character of a true Chriſtian, of one that is intitled to a Crown, is that he loves the Appearance of Jeſus Chriſt to Judgment. As for the Hypocrite, and the Sinner, he dreads the Appearance of him. What a Terror is it to ſuch to think of Appearing before him, <hi>whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, who ſearches the Hearts, and tries the Reins of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, that he may render to every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Works; before whom all Things are open

                  <p>But now the real Chriſtian whoſe Conſcience can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Glad that there will be an Opportunity to vindicate himſelf of the ill Thoughts, the hard Speeches and Reproaches that have been caſt upon him; to have his Sincerity and Uprightneſs, his Fidelity and Diligence in the Service of Chriſt, acknowleged and approved by his Judge; and to receive the bleſſed <hi>Euge</hi> to his immortal Honour before the World.</p>
                  <p>Thus every true Chriſtian has Reaſon to love the Appearing of Jeſus Chriſt; for when <hi>he who is their Life ſhall appear, they alſo ſhall appear with him in Glory</hi>

                     <p>And here I ſhall only mention two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, that are the moſt obvious, and will be moſt agreeable to the preſent Occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Infer. I. <hi>What an unſpeakable Mercy is it, ſince there is a Neceſſity of Dying; that there is any thing to ſupport and comfort us under the certain Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and near Approaches of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Death in it ſelf conſidered is an awful Change, and carries a great deal of Terror along with it. Nature abhors and relucts at a Diſſolution. It is a very affecting Thing to go off the Stage of Life, and paſs into a State of Silence, and Inactivity. It is a very melancholly Thing to take the final Leave of our Families and Friends, our Poſſeſſions, and Enjoyments; &amp; to leave the Places that now know us, to know us no more forever.</p>
                     <p>And if we are utterly in the Dark as to our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, it muſt needs be very perplexing to the Mind. But, O what Diſtreſs muſt the Man be in, who has no better a Proſpect before him, but that of a miſerable Eternity! That when Death ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and when all worldly Proſpects fail; that there <hi>ſhould nothing remain to him, but a fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation to devour him!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But now what an unſpeakable Mercy do the Saints enjoy; that they have ſuch Cordials, ſuch Supports &amp; Comforts, at the Approaches of Death, as the Teſtimony of their Conſciences, the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Spirit, the Light of his Countenance, and the Joy of his Salvation? Such ſure and certain Proſpects of a bleſſed Eternity, that inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurprized or terrified at Death, it is Matter of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004196_0062_1003FA97B2B22A28"/>
Joy to them, and inſtead of ſhrinking back at the Approach of it, they are able to welcome the King of Terrors, and in holy Triumph, to ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. xv. 55, 56. <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? The Sting of Death is Sin; and the Strength of Sin is the Law. But Thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Infer. II. We learn, <hi>That it is the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, with Reſpect to our paſt Carriage and Conduct in the World, that will afford ſolid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in a dying Hour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was <hi>this</hi> that enabled the Apoſtle, to think, and ſpeak, and write ſo calmly of Death; and to pleaſe himſelf with the confident Expectation of a future Reward. And it is only ſuch a Teſtimony of Conſcience for us, that will take away the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the Sting of Death: And truly without this, it is impoſſible for us to have any Peace at the Approach of Death. What Peace or Comfort can that Man have who is conſcious to himſelf, that he has lived in the Neglect of God, and of his Duty to him, of his being unjuſt in his Dealings, unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Truſt, unkind, unchaſte or intemperate in his Life? How will ſuch a guilty Soul be filled with Diſtreſs &amp; Terror at the Approach of Death, knowing that this will open the Scene of eternal Wo and Miſery unto him?</p>
                     <p>Whereas ſuch as upon the cloſeſt, and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reflection upon themſelves, can ſay they <hi>have fought the good Fight;</hi> that they have waged War with all their ſpiritual Enemies; and have through the Grace and Strength of Chriſt gotten the Maſtery of them; that they have run their chriſtian Race with Patience; that they hold faſt the Profeſſion, and the Exerciſe of their Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004196_0063_1003FE60ABDE06B8"/>
Wavering, they will have a ſure foundation for Peace and Comfort in the Hour of Death. For what can do a Man any Hurt that is in ſuch a Caſe? God and Chriſt are for him; the Goſpel, and all the exceeding great and precious Promiſes thereof, are on his Side; and then, who or what can be againſt him.</p>
                     <p>So that it is according as our Conſciences teſtify for, or againſt us; that we ſhall have Hope or Fear, Joy or Sorrow, in a dying Hour. <hi>For if our Hearts condemn us, God is greater than our Heart, and knoweth all Things. But if our Heart condemn us not, then may we have Confidence towards God<note n="†" place="bottom">1 John iii. 20, 21.</note>.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Infer. III. <hi>How ſafe and happy muſt the true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian needs be in Death; ſince there is a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs laid up for him, which the Lord the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge will give him at the Day of his Appearing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>that to die was Gain</hi>
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">Phil i. 21</note>, ſince that was the Way to a glorious Crown; and it is through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death, that all the Saints do aſcend to Glory. That Man who while he lives, lives to the Lord, and when he dies, dies in the Lord; who can take away his Crown? It is ſecured to him by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by the Promiſes of God, <hi>all which are in Chriſt yea, and in him Amen.</hi> Wherefore we may all write, as in Rev. xiv. 13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead which die in the Lord from henceforth, yea, ſaith the Spirit, that they may reſt from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, this we have Reaſon to think was the happy Caſe of an aged Saint among us, who was

                     <p>But what abundant Reaſon have we to think ſo, with Reſpect to the worthy and honourable, good and faithful PRESIDENT of the College; who has lately taken his Departure from us by Death?</p>
                     <p>His Life and Converſation from his Youth up, have been a conſtant Teſtimony for him, to all that knew him, of the excellent good Diſpoſitions of his Mind, and of the gracious Impreſſions upon his Heart from his tender Years. He like King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> while he was yet young, began to ſeek and ſerve the God of his Fathers.</p>
                     <p>He was favoured with a liberal Education at the College, (over which he was afterwards called to preſide): And when a Student there, he behaved himſelf with ſo much Inoffenſiveneſs, Dutifulneſs, and Diligence, as not only to gain the Love and Good-Will of all, but their Reſpect and Eſteem as a good Proficient in the Learning of <hi>that Day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since which he has been imploying his natural and acquired Accompliſhments, with a Diligence, Conſtancy and Fidelity, that was uncommon.</p>
                     <p>But few Men had more uſeful Talents, or Accompliſhments better fitted for doing Service in the World, than he.</p>
                     <p>He had a calm and moderate Temper, and had a great Government of his Paſſions; but with all, had ſtrong and ſteddy Spirits, which would prompt him to undertake, and would carry him through many difficult Labours, without Fainting or giving

over. He was very meek and peaceable, humble, condeſcending and familiar to all. He was not of a haſty Spirit, that would precipitate him to any raſh or unadviſed Actions; but in all Affairs, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that were difficult and doubtful, he acted with great Caution.</p>
                     <p>And altho' where his Conſcience was concerned, (which he always appeared to be under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of,) he would ſteddily and courageouſly abide by the Dictates thereof, whether he pleaſed or diſpleaſed Men; for this was his governing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to manage in all his Affairs, not as pleaſing Men but God, that trieth the Hearts.</p>
                     <p>And yet in other Caſes, no Man more careful not to diſpleaſe or offend. Accordingly in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, whether private or publick, he for the moſt part avoided controverſial Points, and Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of doubtful Diſputation; chooſing rather to preſs thoſe practical Duties that were not diſputed, than ſpend his Time in ſpeculative Controverſies. He was a Lover, and a Counſeller of Peace; and ſtudied the Things that made for Peace, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one might edify another.</p>
                     <p>He ſpent about <hi>thirty Years</hi> of his Life in the publick Miniſtry at <hi>Boſton,</hi> where he was happy in the hearty Love and Reſpects of his People; and where he diligently, and I believe ſucceſsfully laid himſelf out for the good of Souls, in his paſtoral Viſits, as well as in his publick Preaching; and ſhewed himſelf a Pattern of good Works, readily diſtributing the Tenth of all his Income to pious and charitable Uſes, whereby he could with greater Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Confidence call upon others for their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities; and did by his own Example provoke them to Love and to good Works.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, He endeavoured that his publick Miniſtry ſhould be of more extenſive Service; by
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004196_0066_1003FE737812C450"/>
the many Sermons, and other Diſcourſes which he publiſhed; in all of which he uſed great Plainneſs of Speech, level'd to the loweſt Capacities, more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to inſtruct and quicken others, than to gain Applauſe to himſelf; in which Writings, altho' he be dead, yet he ſpeaks to us; and as they have been, ſo I doubt not, but that they will be a Guide and Comfort to many Souls.</p>
                     <p>It is now almoſt <hi>twelve Years</hi> ſince he was choſen into the Preſidentſhip, and accepted the Care and Burden of that important Office; not for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or the Profit of the Place; but as he has often declared, from a ſelf-denying Spirit, and in Obedience to what he apprehended to be the Call of God unto him.</p>

                     <p>And altho' he has for the greateſt Part of his Preſidentſhip been afflicted and ſore broken; yet it has been wonderful to us all, to obſerve, not only with what Patience he endured his Pains; (which for Years together, except when in Bed, were almoſt conſtant upon him.) But with what Diligence and Care he applied himſelf to the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the College, under ſo much bodily Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For altho' this Weakneſs grew upon him, yet he held out, in the conſtant Service of his Place, even almoſt unto the very laſt. So that I have often thought, that many other Men, for the ſame Degree of Pain and Weakneſs, would keep their Chamber, if not their Bed; when he would
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004196_0067_1003FE789FB4FD38"/>
go forth to College, and carry on the Worſhip of the Hall.</p>
                     <p>In a Word, and to ſum up all; He was one of the brighteſt Examples of Diligence, Conſtancy and Fidelity.</p>
                     <p>And when he apprehended his Departure to be at Hand, he was in the ſame happy Frame with the bleſſed Apoſtle. He had his Conſcience wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing for him, that he <hi>had fought the good Fight, finiſhed his Courſe, and kept the Faith;</hi> which gave him a Calm and Quietneſs of Mind; yea, and filled him with joyful Expectations of <hi>a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> and with admiring and adoring Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, for his abundant Mercy through Chriſt, in begetting ſuch lively Hopes within him; telling me at one Time, how deeply and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was affected with thoſe Words of the Apoſtle, 1 Peter i. 3,— 9. ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant Mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively Hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and that fadeth not away reſerved, in Heaven for you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And now, who is there that has ſeen &amp; known <hi>his Manner of Life</hi> among us, his <hi>Doctrine, Purpoſe, Long-ſuffering, Charity, Patience,</hi> and are Witneſſes how <hi>

                           </gap>lily, juſtly &amp; unblameably</hi> he behaved himſelf; that can poſſibly doubt of there being a Crown of Glory laid up for him? If we may judge of the Tree by its Fruit, we muſt thus judge of him: He was a good and holy Man; for he had his <hi>Fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holineſs,</hi> &amp; <hi>the End is eternal Life.</hi> He is gone, with the Apoſtle, to be with Chriſt for the preſent, and his Reſt is glorious in him; and there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004196_0068_1003FE80144C3290"/>
a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give him, at <hi>the Day</hi> of his Appearing.</p>
                     <p>And now what remains, but that we duly reſent this bereaving Stroke of divine Providence, and make a wiſe Improvement of it?</p>
                     <p>And in a particular Manner, let the <hi>College</hi> be deeply affected with the Breach that God in his holy and ſovereign Providence has made upon it.</p>
                     <p>May <hi>Thoſe</hi> who have the <hi>immediate Inſtruction and Government of that Society,</hi> be excited and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to be more and more imitating their Maſter that is taken from their Head, in Diligence, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Fidelity; aſpiring after a double Portion of that good Spirit that was in him.</p>
                     <p>And may the <hi>Students,</hi> the Sons of the Prophets, call to mind the ſolemn, earneſt and affectionate Counſels, Exhortations and Warnings, that you have heard from his Mouth; and may his Prayers and Tears upon your Account, which you have ſeen and heard, come into your more ſerious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.

                     <p>May <hi>mourning Friends and Relatives</hi> be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think of the happy Exchange it has proved to him.</p>
                     <p>May the <hi>Poor</hi> of this Place, and elſewhere, who have been relieved and refreſhed by his Charities; be duly affected with the Loſs of ſuch a kind Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor; and be pleaſed with the Thought, that by his Acts of Piety and Charity, he has made to himſelf Friends of the Mammon of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that now receive him into everlaſting Habitations.</p>
                     <p>And may <hi>all of us in the Neighbourhood,</hi> be ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affected with the Loſs of ſo good a Neighbour, ſuch a faithful Friend, and Father.</p>
                     <p>And may the <hi>whole Town</hi> mourn the Loſs of this and other Saints, and Servants of Jeſus Chriſt; and when our Glory is thinning after ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may we cry unto God, as in Pſalm xii. 1. <hi>Help, Lord, for the godly Man ceaſeth; and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fail from among the Children of Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, Let us earneſtly pray for the plentiful Out-pourings of the divine Spirit upon thoſe of us that ſurvive; that the Breaches may be repaired, and their Ground made good who have gone off the Stage. Let us be Imitators of them who are gone before in all that was Good and Excellent; and eſpecially, let us aſpire after the ſame Mind,

                     <q>HIS Lord ſaid unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou haſt been faithful over a few Things; I will make thee Ruler over many Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</q>

                  <p>THESE Words are Part of a Parable ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by our bleſſed Saviour to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when the Time of his Departure from this World, and of his Aſcenſion to his Father began to draw near.</p>
                  <p>The Deſign of the Parable ſeems to be to ſet forth the different Demeanour of thoſe, who bear the Name of the Servants of Chriſt, and receive valuable Betruſtments from him, in this World; and the ſuitable Difference he will make in his Treatment of them; when <hi>he ſhall come in his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> at the Day of Judgment, <hi>and all the holy Angels with him.</hi> It will then be found, that ſome of the Servants of Chriſt have well improved the <hi>Talents</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004196_0073_1003FE99DD068AC0"/>
he delivered to them; and theſe he will both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and reward: While others who have been his Servants by Vocation, external Profeſſion, and ſpecial Deſignation as well as they; will neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs appear to have made an ill Uſe of their Lord's <hi>Goods;</hi> or at leaſt not to have improved them to any valuable Purpoſe: And theſe he will cenſure as <hi>Wicked and Slothful,</hi> and doom them to <hi>outer Darkneſs, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Text contains the Words of our Lord to a Servant of the firſt Sort, who was able to give a good and a joyful Account of himſelf, and of what his Lord had delivered to him. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Thou deliveredſt unto me five Talents; behold, I have gained beſides them five Talents more.</hi> He humbly acknowleges that he had improved nothing, but what he had received from Chriſt his Lord. Tho' his Stock had been large, compar'd with that of his Fellow-Servants; yet it was not his own, but Chriſt's. Thine the Talents were, and thou ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouredſt me by committing them to my Truſt. And then he appeals to Chriſt as a Witneſs of his Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Faithfulneſs and Succeſs in improving them. That as he had received much, ſo he had been careful to return the more; and to make his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements proportionable to his Receivings: <hi>Behold, I have gained beſides them five Talents more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is it a fooliſh Confidence of Boaſting, but the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, that he had obtained Mercy to be faithful, which gives him this Boldneſs in the Day of Judgment; for Chriſt himſelf admits the Truth of his Account, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds and rewards his Faithfulneſs and Diligence; ſaying unto him as in my Text, <hi>well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou haſt been faithful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many

Things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi> Upon which we may obſerve this Doctrine,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That theſe Servants of Chriſt, who have faithfully improved the Talents he delivered to them, ſhall be highly applauded, and gloriouſly rewarded by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the Illuſtration of this Truth, I ſhall do four Things: viz.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>I ſhall conſider what may be meant by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents delivered to the Servants of Chriſt.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>I ſhall ſhow, that it is Chriſt who delivers theſe Talents to his Servants.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That thoſe Servants who improve them faithfully, ſhall be highly applauded.</hi> And,</item>
                     <item>4. <hi>That they ſhall be gloriouſly rewarded by him.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>I am to conſider, what may be meant by the Talents delivered to the Servants of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I may ſay in general, <hi>That every Thing improveable by them to the Honour of God, or to the Good of others, or of their own Souls is a Talent.</hi> It is a valuable Treaſure, which if the Fault be not their own, may become of ineſtimable Advantage to them; for as much as by a right Uſe of it, they may be <hi>laying up in Store for themſelves a good Foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal Life</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Tim vi. 19</note>. In this View we may conſider, the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Minds; the Health &amp; Strength &amp; Vigour of their Bodies; their worldly Enjoyments, Eſtate, Education, Credit, Intereſt, Power, Preferments; the Word and Ordinances of God, and Motions of the good Spirit of Grace; and all the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or even Occaſions of doing or receiving

ſpiritual Good; as ſo many Talents committed to their Truſt. By a right Uſe of any of theſe, they may be doing acceptable Service to God; and by a Miſimprovement, at a bare Neglect of them, they may incur the Guilt of Sloth and Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How much then does it concern us all, to walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, not as Fools, but as Wiſe; ſince there is hardly any Thing can occur to us ſo indifferent in its own Nature, but that it may miniſter an Occaſion of doing, what may recommend us to the Favour, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap> us to the Diſpleaſure of God, and ſo may affect our eternal Intereſts?</hi>— It is juſt Matter of Rejoycing to conſider, that the moſt Common of our outward Enjoyments may be ſo ordered, as to be of everlaſting Advantage to us: That our very Food and Drink may be received in ſuch a Manner, as that God will account himſelf glorified thereby. But then we have Reaſon to rejoyce with Trembling, when we take a Proſpect of the Danger on the other Side: How that by any Miſimprovement of theſe Things, or only by neglecting to glorify God with them, we ſhall incur his Diſpleaſure, and treaſure up Wrath to our ſelves. Since then we have ſuch an Advantage, and ſuch a Danger continually before us; how tho'tful and vigilant ought we always to be? And what Manner of Perſons in all holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and Godlineſs? Eſpecially if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, what I am to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>That it is Chriſt who delivers to his Servants all the Talents they are betruſted with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Truth of this is fairly hinted in the Parable now before us; the <note n="*" place="bottom">ver 14</note> firſt Verſe of which, I think,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004196_0076_1004194F07C31750"/>
ought to be read, not as in our Engliſh Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is;</hi> but, <hi>The Son of Man is</hi> as a Man travelling into a far Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods. And unto one he gave five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to another two, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>When our bleſſed Lord aſcended up on high, he received Gifts for Men; had all Things put under his Feet; and was made to be the Head over all Things to the Church <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm lxviii. 18. Eph. i. 22.</note>. The Adminiſtration therefore of the Kingdom of Providence and of Grace, is now in his Hand. So that we are to look upon all the Abilities, Advantages, Occaſions and Opportunities we have of doing or receiving Good, as ſo many Talents committed to our Truſt <hi>by him,</hi> who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People, zealous of good Works <note n="‡" place="bottom">Tirus ii. 14.</note>: <hi>By him,</hi> who will call us to an Account in the great Day of Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, and be our Judge to determine our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting State, according as we have made a good or bad Uſe of theſe Talents of Truſt and Confidence repoſed in us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Let us then conſider ſeriouſly with what Strictneſs and Exactneſs, and tender Reſentments, we may well expect he will take an Account of the Number and the Nature and the Degree of the good Things which be himſelf hath committed to us.</hi>—As he was the Beſtower of them, he cannot but know exactly what they were. And as they were Part of the Purchaſe of his Blood, and of the Reward of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto Death, and were committed by him to us as Marks of Honour and Confidence, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004196_0077_1003FAD6AA09EEB0"/>
for our eternal Benefit, he cannot but be moſt tenderly affected with the Uſe we make of them. With what Pleaſure &amp; Satisfaction muſt he look upon us, if we faithfully improve them to the bleſſed Purpoſes for which he purchas'd &amp; beſtowed them. And with what Indignation, if we neglect them as Things not worthy of our Notice or Improvement?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Conſideration of theſe Things ſhould be a moſt powerful and prevailing Argument with every one of us to inquire frequently with great Care and Sollicitude, into his own State and Circumſtances; that he may know what is his Duty, and what are the Expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Lord from him.</hi> — Without ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, we ſhall either not know, or at leaſt not conſider what Talents Chriſt hath delivered to us. And ſo far as we are ignorant or tho'tleſs of this, it is certain we ſhall be ſcareleſs and ſlothful and wicked Servants; and have but a wretched Account to give up to our Maſter at the Day of Reckoning. And as our Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are often varying, ſo our Opportunities and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for doing Honour to God, and Service to our Generation, are often changing with them, which makes it needful that our Inquiries ſhould be frequent: And very ſollicitous we have all the Reaſon in the World to be, to obtain a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in theſe Things; becauſe our Uſefulneſs in this World, and our Happineſs in the next, ſo much depend upon our Knowledge of them; and becauſe our Lord himſelf will take ſuch an exact Account of his own Gifts, as well as of our Improvements.</p>
                  <p>Let us then be perſwaded to inquire frequently and with great Attention; what Services for God and our Generation the natural Abilities which our Lord hath given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, tender us moſt fit for? An Inquiry this, of great Importance to ſuch as (like

many of you) have their Courſe of Life yet to chooſe; that they may determine upon ſuch a one, as they will be moſt likely to act in with Pleaſure and Satisfaction to themſelves, and Uſefulneſs to others.</p>
                  <p>Again, Let us inquire, what Duties God calls us to from time to time in his Providence; by preſenting Opportunities &amp; Advantages, &amp; laying Inducements before us? What Opportunities and Occaſions ariſe out of our preſent State of Life, to teſtify our Fear of God, and Regard to his Servants? What to be getting Good to our ſelves now, and what to be laying a Foundation for Uſefulneſs to others here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after? What Benefits or Advantages are derived to us from the reſpective Relations or Capacities in which we are placed? What Incitements to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Application ariſe from our outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and future Hopes and Proſpects? In fine, and above all, how many ſpiritual Advantages we enjoy in common with our Fellow-Servants by the external Means of Grace? And how many pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to our ſelves by the inward Convictions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, Aſſiſtances of that good Spirit which our departed Lord ſendeth to us? By frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of this ſort, we ſhall become more and more ſenſible what Talents our Lord is committing to our Truſt; and of conſequence what we have to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove here, and what to Account for hereafter. And a ſerious Conſideration of theſe Things will have a happy Tendency to work us up to a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Spirit in the Service of our Lord, and ſo prepare us for thoſe Applauſes and Rewards which the Good and Faithful may expect from him.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it may do alſo, to <hi>remember them who have had the Rule over us, who have ſpoken unto us the Word of God, and whoſe Faith it concerns us to fellow, conſidering the End of their Converſation.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004196_0079_1003FB1C32D62130"/>
For every Benefit we have had Opportunity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by their Means, ought to be conſidered by us as a Talent, which we muſt give an Account of to Chriſt at his ſecond Coming. And all their Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Opportunities to do Service to us or others: And their Fidelity in improving them, ought thankfully to be acknowledged to the Honour of Him, who is Head over all Things to the Church; and who <hi>giveth</hi> ſuch <hi>Gifts to Men, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>And this brings me to pay Part of that Tribute which is due to the Memory of our late Reverend and worthy Preſident, who may juſtly be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we compare his Opportunities and Abilities together, as one of thoſe Servants whom our Lord honours with the Care of <hi>five Talents,</hi> a large Stock in compariſon of what is truſted with many others.</p>
                  <p>He had his Education in this Houſe, where I hope without Flattery it may be ſaid, that thoſe who are diſpoſed wiſely to improve them, enjoy at leaſt as many Advantages to accompliſh themſelves for the Service of their Generation, as are to be met with in our own Country. When he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to ſettle in the Goſpel Miniſtry, the Holy Ghoſt made him Overſeer of a numerous Flock in the Metropolis of the Province, in the generality of whoſe Affections he was bleſſed with a very great Intereſt. And as this gave him a ſingular Advantage to promote the Good of their Souls; ſo it evidences the Truth of their Chriſtian Self-denial and publick Spirit (which ought always to be remembred, and ſpoken of with Honour) in Conſenting to the Removal of One ſo dear to them, to what they apprehended a Station of more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Uſefulneſs and Service. And ſo at length by the ſovereign Diſpoſal of our aſcended Lord, he
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004196_0080_10041966B024A948"/>
was ſet at the Head of this Society, in whoſe Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and Proſperity, both the civil and religious Intereſts of the People of God in this Land are ſo much concerned that hardly any Place can be tho't of, in which a Servant of Chriſt hath Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be a more extenſive Bleſſing.</p>
                  <p>And to render him ſuch a one in every Station, the glorious Head of the Church had given him a very capacious and faithful Memory, a ſound Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, a clear Apprehenſion, and an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Faculty of making religious Truths plain to the meaneſt Capacities. But to crown all, our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt had taken an early Poſſeſſion of the Heart of this his Servant for himſelf; had impreſſed it with a moſt affectionate Concern for the Souls of Men, and had given him an indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit to purſue their Intereſts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the Talents with which our bleſſed Lord betruſted his deceaſed Servant. But how diligently and faithfully he occupied them I ſhall have a more proper Occaſion to ſay under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Head. I muſt now proceed therefore to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>That thoſe Servants of Chriſt who have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully improved the Talents he delivered to them, ſhall be highly applauded by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall endeavour two Things; viz.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To deſcribe the faithful Servants of Chriſt; or ſhew, what Manner of Perſons they are who faithfully improve the Talents he hath delivered to them.</hi> And</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>To prove the Truth of the Propoſition; or ſhew, that ſuch Servants ſhall be highly applauded by him.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Here then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Who is the faithful Servant of Chriſt? What is his Character? Or what Manner of Perſon is the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004196_0081_1004196FAA9D06F0"/>
Man who faithfully improves the Talents which Chriſt hath delivered to him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I may ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That he is one whoſe Heart is full of Affection and Devotion to his Maſter.</hi> He conſiders that he is not his own, but is bought with a Price: and that not of corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he loves the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Sincerity, who hath firſt loved him, and given himſelf an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and a Sacrifice to God for him. If other Lords have had Dominion over him, the faithful Servant of Chriſt heartily repents his paſt Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them. He renounces the Service of the Fleſh, the World and the Devil; breaks their Bands aſunder, and caſts their Cords away from him. He unfeignedly acknowleges the Right of Chriſt to rule over him, and devotes himſelf entirely and forever to his Service; ſaying as in Pſalm cxvi. 16. <hi>Oh Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the Son of thine Handmaid. Thy Servant who is devoted to thy Fear,</hi> Pſalm cxix. 38.</p>
                  <p>From this Spirit of Affection and Devotion to him, the faithful Servant of Chriſt becomes highly concerned for his Maſter's Intereſt and Honour, ſollicitous above all Things, that whether preſent or abſent, he may be accepted of him; and he can take no reſt under the leaſt Senſe or Doubt of his Diſpleaſure. It is his earneſt Deſire and Study to know the Will of Chriſt in the utmoſt Latitude of it, and eſpecially with Reſpect to the Duties of his own Station in particular. His great Inquiry is, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> And his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer, <hi>Teach me thy Statutes. I am thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant give me Underſtanding that I may know thy Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> And it is his fixed Reſolution (through Chriſt ſtrengthening him) carefully to perform what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004196_0082_100419788C04EF50"/>
he does know, or ſhall know to be his Duty Without ſuch a Temper of Mind as this, no Man will faithfully improve the Talents which Chriſt hath delivered to him, but will be habitually <hi>diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and unto every good Work reprohate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A faithful Servant of Chriſt is one who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to extend his Obedience to the whole Compaſs of his Duty.</hi> It is not Faithfulneſs, but ſome other and ſome unworthy Principle which actuates the Man, who pretends a Zeal for Chriſt in ſome Points of Duty, and yet is knowingly Remiſs and Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in others: Such a Man <hi>ſeeks his own, not the Things which are Jeſus Chriſt's.</hi> For a ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Intereſt and Honour and Will of Chriſt, muſt be operative and influencial in one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as well as in another. And therefore, tho' the faithful Servant of Chriſt, thro' humane Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, offends and falls ſhort of his Duty in many Things, yet it is his Grief and Lamentation that he does ſo, and <hi>he always labours fervently that be may ſtand perfect and compleat in all the Will of God.</hi> And <hi>then</hi> only <hi>will he not be aſhamed, when he hath a Reſpect unto all his Commandments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The faithful Servant of Chriſt is peculiarly mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the Duties of the Station and Relations in which his Lord hath ſet him.</hi> Theſe are emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally his <hi>own Buſineſs</hi> and <hi>he ſtudies to do it,</hi> being always tho'tful of that Precept, I Cor. vii. 17. <hi>As God hath diſtributed to every Man, as the Lord hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one, ſo let him walk.</hi> And for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he will alſo carefully lay hold of every Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, Advantage or Occaſion ariſing from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in which his Lord ſhall at any Time place him, to promote his Maſter's Intereſt and Honour, get good to his own Soul, or do good to others. For he looks upon every Opportunity and Advantage for theſe Things, as a Call from Chriſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004196_0083_1004197C90B40040"/>
to ariſe and do them. And he thinks it impoſſible for any Man to be a faithful Servant of Chriſt, and yet regardleſs of his Maſter's Calls to Duty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The faithful Servant of Chriſt is a diligent and laborious Servant.</hi> He abhors the Character, and dreads the Curſe of him, who doeth the Work of the Lord negligently. And therefore whatſoever his Hand findeth to do, he doth it with his Might. He is not ſlothful in Buſineſs; but ſervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>He is full of Patience and Reſignation to his Maſter's Will under all the Afflictions with which he thinks fit in his holy Providence to exerciſe him.</hi> The faithful Servant of Chriſt don't conſider Affliction as coming forth out of the Duſt, or Trouble as ſpringing out of the Ground; but as ſent by him, who is given of God to be Head over all Things to the Church; by him who loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it: who therefore cannot be ſuppoſed to afflict willingly, or grieve any of his faithful Servants, whom he hath redeemed with his Blood; but rather to chaſten them for their Profit, that they may be Partakers of his Holineſs. That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, tho' no Chaſtening for the preſent ſeemeth to be joyous but grievous; nevertheleſs, afterward it yieldeth the peaceable Fruit of Righteouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that are exerciſed thereby. Upon which Account he conſiders every Fight of Affliction as a Talent, the right Improvement of which, will work for him a far more exceeding, and eternal Weight of Glory. And this may well make him patient in Tribulation. For he reckons that the Sufferings of the preſent Time are not worthy to be compared with the Glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, The faithful Servant of Chriſt looks unto Jeſus the Author and finiſher of his Faith; who for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004196_0084_1004198509CD5E70"/>
the Croſs, deſpiſing the Shame, and is ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him that endured ſuch Contradiction of Sinners againſt himſelf; and alſo, that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, leaving us an Example that we ſhould follow his Steps; he is not wearied, neither doth he faint in his Mind; but is ready to deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow his Maſter, not thinking any Thing too much to ſuffer from a Senſe of Gratitude, and a Principle of Love and Subjection to him, who his own ſelf bear our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, and hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</p>
                  <p>In fine, The faithful Servant of Chriſt is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that it is only if need be, that he is now in Heavineſs for a Seaſon thro' manifold Temptations. He can truly ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Pſalm cxix. 75. <hi>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in Faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſtead of murmuring at his Maſter, or envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fellow-Servants, who ſeem thro' leſs Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than he, to be entring into the Kingdom of God; he kiſſes the Rod, and bleſſes him that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it; knowing that Tribulation worketh Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; and Patience, Experience; and Experience, Hope; and Hope maketh not aſhamed, becauſe the Love of God is ſhed abroad in his Heart, by the Holy Ghoſt which is given unto him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>The faithful Servant of Chriſt perſeveres in his Duty with an unbroken Reſolution as long as he lives.</hi> He remembers the Faithfulneſs of his bleſſed Lord to the Intereſt of miſerable Sinners, when for their Sakes, he humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that one great End of this was, that we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004196_0085_1003FAFB73260A38"/>
being delivered out of the Hands of our Enemies, might ſerve him without Fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before him, all the Days of our Life. He conſiders that his Lord hath promiſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ender eternal Life, only to them, who ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immortality, by <hi>patient Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Well-doing;</hi> But that, if any Man draw back, his Soul will have no Pleaſure in him. And upon ſuch Conſiderations as theſe, the faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt can ſay, <hi>I have inclined mine Heart to perform thy Statutes alway even unto the End. I have ſworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous Judgments. All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my Noſtrils, I will not forget thee, neither will I deal falſly in thy Covenant. My Heart ſhall not turn back, nor my Steps decline from thy Ways.</hi> And having once framed ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vigorous Reſolutions, he earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to hold them faſt; and <hi>through the Supply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> he becomes <hi>Stedfaſt, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord.</hi> But theſe Things may ſuffice for the main Strokes in the Character of the faithful Servants of Chriſt. It only remains under this Head, that I proceed to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch Servants as theſe, ſhall he highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded by their Maſter.</hi> He knoweth all Things, he knoweth that they love him. He knows their Works, their Labour, and their Patience. He looks down from Heaven with Approbation and Pleaſure upon them now. And he is not unrighteou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ll the holy Angels with him, and ſhall ſit upon the Throne of his Glory, he will call them good and faithful Servants, the bleſſed of his Father: he will approve &amp; applaud
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004196_0086_10041990EA0147D8"/>
their Faithfulneſs and Obedience, and publiſh to their everlaſting Honour, their pious and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Works in the Preſence of the whole Aſſembly of Men and Angels, who ſhall be gathered before him at that Day; ſaying, <hi>I was an hungred and ye gave me Meat, I was thirſty and ye gave me Drink,</hi> &amp;c. Thus their Faithfulneſs ſhall be found <hi>unto Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory at the Appearing of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And not only ſo, but as I am to ſay,</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>It ſhall be gloriouſly rewarded by him alſo.</hi> Their Reward hereafter ſhall be vaſtly greater than their Improvements have been here; &amp; they ſhall have Comfort and Peace, and unſpeakable Rejoycing evermore in the Poſſeſſion of it. For <hi>they ſhall be made Rulers over many Things,</hi> and ſhall <hi>enter into the Joy of their Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They ſhall be made Rulers over many Things.</hi> This is ſpoken after the Manner of earthly Princes. For as they, if they be good and wiſe, will advance thoſe Servants to higher Offices, whom they have found faithful in lower, ſo will Chriſt do alſo. He will make all his faithful Servants Kings &amp; Prieſts unto God, &amp; his Father. He will give them a Crown of Righteouſneſs. He will grant to them to ſit with him in his Throne; and to inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for them from the Foundation of the World <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. i. 6.2. Tim. iv. 8. Rev. iii. 21. Marth. xxv. 34.</note>. What a Diſproportion is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Work and the Reward of a faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? He is faithful over a few Things, and he is rewarded for it with a Crown, a Throne, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom! Verily, Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done; but according to his Mercy he ſaves and rewards us!</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004196_0087_10041999E3B76308"/>2. <hi>They ſhall enter into the Joy of their Lord.</hi> Sorrow &amp; Sighing ſhall now flee away for ever, and all Tears ſhall be wiped from their Eyes. All the Springs of Joy and Gladneſs ſhall be opened unto them; for they ſhall ſee God Face to Face, &amp; ſhall be made like unto him by ſeeing him as he is. In his Preſence they ſhall find their Joys to be full, and their Pleaſures everlaſting. Then ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that Word of their Lord, the Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou haſt given me. And <hi>that beholding</hi> cannot mean a meerly <hi>contemplative,</hi> but a <hi>fruitive</hi> Intuition. <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, that we may be alſo glorified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I might now proceed to infer from what you have heard, How bleſſed a Thing it is to be a faithful Servant of Chriſt? How eaſily we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, why our Lord ſuffers his moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants to undergo ſo much Tribulation in this World? How unreaſonable it would be, either to forſake the Service of ſuch a Maſter, or to go on dejectedly in it, becauſe of the Difficulties which may ſometimes attend it? How fooliſh and wicked a Thing it is to refuſe this Service, or deſpiſe thoſe who are faithful in it; or to do any thing which may tend to render the Labours of any faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt leſs ſucceſsful, than otherwiſe they might have been? In fine, How much the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Generality of Mankind is to be lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who inſtead of devoting themſelves to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, make themſelves Slaves to the worſt of Maſters? But theſe, and many other uſeful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which might be made upon what hath been diſcourſed at this Time, I muſt leave to be enlarged upon in your private Meditations and may only add,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="unknown:004196_0088_100419A0CE560B40"/>
                     <hi>That from the Deſcription which hath been given of a good and faithful Servant, I think we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Servant of Chriſt lately taken from our Head was ſuch a one.</hi> Indeed his Character hath been already drawn ſo well, by much better Hands than mine, that there is no Occaſion for my attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that.</hi> I ſhall therefore only go on to obſerve ſuch Things concerning him, as my Subject natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally leads me to conſider.</p>
                  <p>Under a former Head we have taken a View of ſome of thoſe Talents which his Lord delivered to him; and here we may turn our Thoughts with Pleaſure and Advantage upon his Faithfulneſs in improving them to his Maſter's Honour, and the Service of his Generation.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider, how ſhort a Time he ſpent in this Society when a young Man, in Compariſon of what many have done of later Years; how long he was removed from it; what weighty Cares were upon him, during the Time of his Removal; and yet when he returned to it, what a conſiderable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance he retained with the learned Languages, and other Parts of Learning alſo, according to the State of them with us in his younger Time; and how laudably, and to what general Acceptance he preſided at the firſt anniverſary Solemnity after his Return, before he began to be broken with bodily Pains and Weakneſs; we may very reaſonably conclude, that he faithfully improved the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an academical Education by hard Study in his Youth.</p>
                  <p>Again, How diligent, how conſtant, how labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he was in the Diſcharge of all the Duties of the paſtoral Office while he ſtood in that Relation, you have already been informed by thoſe who had ſufficient Opportunity to obſerve that Part of his Life and Character.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004196_0089_100419A986CB5970"/>And how great his Faithfulneſs was in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the honourable Relation which he bore to this Society in his laſt Years, you need not that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould inform you. Ye are all Witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblameably he behaved himſelf among you. Ye are all Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his ſervent Affection and Devotion to his Maſter; of his exemplary Patience and Reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Will under ſore Pains, and of long Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; of his tender Concern for the Intereſt of this Society, and the beſt Good of all it's Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and of his unwearied Application to all the Duties of his Office, in which he always ſeemed to go to the utmoſt of his Ability, and many Times almoſt beyond it. Sure I am, that ſome of us have ſpent whole Days in the Buſineſs of this Society with him, when it hath been a continual Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us to ſee that he could take no Reſt in any Poſture, by Reaſon of his diſtreſſing Pains; and yet have not heard one Complaint come out of his Mouth, no obſerved any Token of his being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have the Buſineſs of the Day hurried o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but as long as there was any Buſineſs to be done, or any Day left to do it in, he hath always appeared as willing and patient, as thoſe who were moſt at Eaſe and in Health, to attend upon it, And ſo he continued without fainting in his Mind, faithful to the Death.</p>
                  <p>And now, we may very well refreſh our ſelves with the Thought, that the Applauſes &amp; Rewards of a good and faithful Servant are become his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Inheritance forever. And God grant that none of us may be ſlothful; but followers of him who through Faith and Patience inherits the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
