            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IN fulfilling the engagement which I had come under to the Public, with reſpect to the HIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORY of AMERICA, it was my intention not to have publiſhed any part of the work, until the whole was completed. The preſent ſtate of the Britiſh Colonies has induced me to alter that reſolution. While they are engaged in civil war with Great Britain, inquiries and ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning their ancient forms of policy and laws, which exiſt no longer, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. The attention and expectation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are now turned towards their future condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In whatever manner this unhappy conteſt may terminate, a new order of things muſt ariſe in North America, and its affairs will aſſume another aſpect. I wait with the ſolicitude of a good citizen, until the ferment ſubſide, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar government be re-eſtabliſhed, and then I ſhall return to this part of my work, in which I had made ſome progreſs. That, together with the hiſtory of Portugueſe America, and of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements made by the ſeveral nations of Europe in the Weſt India iſlands, will complete my plan.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034476_0003_0FFDD42E77EF4278"/>THE three volumes which I now publiſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an account of the diſcovery of the New World, and of the progreſs of the Spaniſh arms and colonies there. This is not only the moſt ſplendid portion of the American ſtory, but ſo much detached, as, by itſelf, to form a perfect whole, remarkable for the unity of the ſubject. As the principles and maxims of the Spaniards in planting colonies, which have been adopted in ſome meaſure by every nation, are unfolded in this part of my work; it will ſerve as a proper introduction to the hiſtory of all the European eſtabliſhments in America, and convey ſuch information concerning this important article of policy, as may be deemed no leſs intereſting than curious.</p>
                  <p>IN deſcribing the atchievements and inſtitutions of the Spaniards in the New World, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in many inſtances from the accounts of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding hiſtorians, and have often related facts which ſeem to have been unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the Public, to mention the ſources from which I have derived ſuch intelligence, as juſtifies me either in placing tranſactions in a new light, or in forming any new opinion with reſpect to their cauſes and effects. This duty I perform with greater ſatisfaction, as it will afford an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of expreſſing my gratitude to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, who have honoured me with their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and aid in my reſearches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="v" facs="unknown:034476_0004_0FFDD4314906BEC8"/>AS it was from Spain that I had to expect the moſt important information, with regard to this part of my-work, I conſidered it as a very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate circumſtance for me, when Lord Grantham, to whom I had the honour of being perſonally known, and with whoſe liberality of ſentiment, and diſpoſition to oblige, I was well acquainted, was appointed ambaſſador to the court of Madrid. Upon applying to him, I met with ſuch a recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſatisfied me that his endeavours would be employed in the moſt proper manner, in order to obtain the gratification of my wiſhes; and I am perfectly ſenſible, that what progreſs I have made in my inquiries among the Spaniards, ought to be aſcribed chiefly to their knowing how much his Lordſhip intereſted himſelf in my ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord Grantham, than the advantages which I have derived from his attention in engaging Mr. Waddilove, the chaplain of his embaſſy, to take the conduct of my literary inquiries in Spain, the obligations I lie under to him would be very great. During five years, that gentleman has carried on reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for my behoof, with ſuch activity, preſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and knowledge of the ſubject, to which his attention was turned, as have filled me with no leſs aſtoniſhment than ſatisfaction. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for me the greater part of the Spaniſh books, which I have conſulted; and as many of
<pb facs="unknown:034476_0005_0FFDD433DBF086E0"/>
them were printed early in the ſixteenth century, and are become extremely rare, the collecting of theſe was ſuch an occupation, as, alone, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much time and aſſiduity. To his friendly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention I am indebted for copies of ſeveral valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manuſcripts, containing facts and details which I might have ſearched for in vain, in works that have been made public. Encouraged by the inviting good-will with which Mr. Waddilove conferred his favours, I tranſmitted to him a ſet of queries, with reſpect both to the cuſtoms and policy of the native Americans, and the nature of ſeveral inſtitutions in the Spaniſh ſettlements, framed in ſuch a manner, that a Spaniard might anſwer them, without diſcloſing any thing that was improper to be communicated to a foreigner. He tranſlated theſe into Spaniſh, and obtained from various perſons who have reſided in moſt of the Spaniſh colonies, ſuch replies as have afforded me much inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING thoſe peculiar advantages with which my inquiries were carried on in Spain, it is with regret I am obliged to add, that their ſucceſs muſt be aſcribed to the beneficence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, not to any communication by public authority. By a ſingle arrangement of Philip II. the records of the Spaniſh monarchy are depoſited in the <hi>Archivo</hi> of Simancas, near Valladolid, at the diſtance of a hundred and twenty miles from the ſeat of government, and the ſupreme courts of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:034476_0006_0FFDD4366E6BE558"/>
juſtice. The papers relative to America, and chiefly to that early period of its hiſtory, towards which my attention was directed, are ſo numerous, that they alone, according to one account, fill the largeſt apartment in the Archivo; and according to another, they compoſe eight hundred and ſeventy-three large bundles. Conſcious of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing, in ſome degree, the induſtry which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to an hiſtorian, the proſpect of ſuch a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure excited my moſt ardent curioſity. But the proſpect of it, is all that I have enjoyed. Spain, with an exceſs of caution, has uniformly thrown a veil over her tranſactions in America. From ſtrangers they are concealed with peculiar ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Even to her own ſubjects the Archivo of Simancas is not opened without a particular order from the crown; and after obtaining that, papers cannot be copied, without paying fees of office ſo exorbitant, that the expence exceeds what it would be proper to beſtow, when the gratification of literary curioſity is the only object. It is to be hoped, that the Spaniards will at laſt diſcover this ſyſtem of concealment to be no leſs impolitic than illiberal. From what I have experienced in the courſe of my inquiries, I am ſatisfied, that upon a more minute ſcrutiny into their early operations in the New World, however reprehenſible the actions of individuals may appear, the conduct of the nation will be placed in a more favourable light.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:034476_0007_0FFDD4390B4FF730"/>IN other parts of Europe very different ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevail. Having ſearched, without ſucceſs, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes to Charles V. written ſoon after he landed in the Mexican em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which has not hitherto been publiſhed: it occurred to me, that as the Emperor was ſetting out for Germany at the time when the meſſengers from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter with which they were intruſted might poſſibly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Imperial library of Vienna. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated this idea to Sir Robert Murray Keith, with whom I have long had the honour to live in friendſhip, and I had ſoon the pleaſure to learn, that upon his application, her Imperial Majeſty had been graciouſly pleaſed to iſſue an order, that not only a copy of that letter (if it were found), but of any other papers in the library, which could throw light upon the Hiſtory of America, ſhould be tranſmited to me. The letter from Cortes is not in the Imperial library, but an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic copy, atteſted by a notary, of the letter written by the magiſtrates of the colony planted by him at Vera Cruz, which I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 269, having been found, it was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and ſent to me. As this letter is no leſs curious, and as little known as that which was the object of my inquiries, I have given ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in its proper place, of what is moſt worthy of notice in it. Together with it, I received a copy of a letter from Cortes, containing a long account of
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:034476_0008_0FFDD43BA1010538"/>
his expeditions to Honduras, with reſpect to which, I did not think it neceſſary to enter into any particular detail; and likewiſe thoſe curious Mexican paintings, which I have deſcribed, Vol. ii.</p>
                  <p>MY inquiries at St. Peterſburgh were carried on with equal facility and ſucceſs. In examining into the neareſt communication between our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and that of America, it became of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to obtain authentic information concerning the diſcoveries of the Ruſſians in their navigation from Kamchatka towards the coaſt of America. Accurate relations of their firſt voyage, in 1741, have been publiſhed by Muller and Gmelin. Several foreign authors have entertained an opinion, that the court of Ruſſia ſtudiouſly conceals the progreſs which has been made by more recent navigators, and ſuffers the Public to be amuſed with falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of their route. Such conduct appeared to me unſuitable to thoſe liberal ſentiments, and that patronage of ſcience, for which the preſent ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of Ruſſia is eminent; nor could I diſcern any political reaſon, that might render it improper to apply for information concerning the late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Ruſſians to open a communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Aſia and America. My ingenious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, Dr. Rogerſon, firſt phyſician to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, preſented my requeſt to her Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who not only diſclaimed any idea of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment, but inſtantly ordered the Journal of Captain Krenitzin, who conducted the only voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:034476_0009_0FFDD43D3340CDC8"/>
of diſcovery made by public authority ſince the year 1741, to be tranſlated, and his original chart to be copied for my uſe. By conſulting them, I have been enabled to give a more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate view of the progreſs and extent of the Ruſſian diſcoveries, than has hitherto been communicated to the Public.</p>
                  <p>FROM other quarters I have received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great utility and importance. M. le Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de Pinto, the miniſter from Portugal to the court of Great Britain, who commanded for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years at Matagroſſo, a ſettlement of the Portugueſe in the interior part of Brazil, where the Indians are numerous, and their original man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners little altered by intercourſe with Europeans, was pleaſed to ſend me very full anſwers to ſome queries concerning the character and inſtitutions of the natives of America, which his polite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of an application made to him in my name, encouraged me to propoſe. Theſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied me, that he had contemplated with a diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attention the curious objects which his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſented to his view, and I have often fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him as one of my beſt-inſtructed guides.</p>
                  <p>M. SUARD, to whoſe elegant tranſlation of the Hiſtory of the Reign of Charles V. I owe the favourable reception of that work on the continent, procured me anſwers to the ſame queries from M. de Bougainville, who had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of obſerving the Indians both of North
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:034476_0010_0FFDD440CED58410"/>
and South America, and from M. Godin le Jeune, who reſided fifteen years among Indians in Quito, and twenty years in Cayenne. The latter are more valuable from having been examined by M. de la Condamine, who, a few weeks before his death, made ſome ſhort additions to them, which may be conſidered as the laſt effort of that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſcience which occupied a long life.</p>
                  <p>MY inquiries were not confined to one region in America. Governor Hutchinſon took the trouble of recommending the conſideration of my queries to Mr. Hawley and Mr. Brainerd, two proteſtant miſſionaries, employed among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Five Nations, who favoured me with anſwers, which diſcover a conſiderable knowledge of the people whoſe cuſtoms they diſcribe. From William Smith, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the ingenious hiſtorian of New York, I received ſome uſeful information. When I enter upon the Hiſtory of our Colonies in North America, I ſhall have occaſion to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge how much I have been indebted to many other gentlemen of that country.</p>
                  <p>FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages made by Alexander Dalrymple, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> with whoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Hiſtory of Navigation and Diſcovery the Public is well acquainted, I have received ſome very rare books, particularly two large volumes of Memorials, partly manuſcript, and partly in print, which were preſented to the court of Spain during the reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV.

From theſe I have learned many curious particulars with reſpect to the interior ſtate of the Spaniſh colonies, and the various ſchemes formed for their improvement. As this Collection of Memorials formerly belonged to the Colbert Library, I have quoted them by that title.</p>
                  <p>ALL thoſe books and manuſcripts I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with that attention which the reſpect due from an Author to the Public required; and by minute references to them, I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever I relate. The longer I reflect on the nature of hiſtorical compoſition, the more I am convinced that this ſcrupulous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy is neceſſary. The hiſtorian who records the events of his own time, is credited in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the opinion which the Public entertains with reſpect to his means of information and his veracity. He who delineates the tranſactions of a remote period, has no title to claim aſſent, unleſs he produces evidence in proof of his aſſertions. Without this, he may write an amuſing tale, but cannot be ſaid to have compoſed an authentic hiſtory. In thoſe ſentiments I have been confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the opinion of an Author<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Gibbon.</note>, whom his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, erudition, and diſcernment, have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly placed in a high rank among the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent hiſtorians of the age. Emboldened by a hint from him, I have publiſhed a catalogue of the Spaniſh books which I have conſulted. This prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:034476_0012_0FFDD4454B4400B0"/>
was frequent in the laſt century, and was conſidered as an evidence of laudable induſtry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y in an author; in the preſent, it may, perhaps, be deemed the effect of oſtentation; but as many of theſe books are unknown in Great Britain, I could not otherwiſe have referred to them as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, without incumbering the page with an inſertion of their full titles. To any perſon who may chuſe to follow me in this path of inquiry, the catalogue muſt be very uſeful.</p>
                  <p>MY readers will obſerve, that in mentioning ſums of money, I have uniformly followed the Spaniſh method of computing by <hi>peſos.</hi> In Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the peſo <hi>fuerte,</hi> or <hi>duro,</hi> is the only one known, and that is always meant when any ſum imported from America is mentioned. The peſo fuerte, as well as other coins, has varied in its numerary value; but I have been adviſed, without attending to ſuch minute variations, to conſider it as equal to four ſhillings and ſixpence of our money. It is to be remembered, however, that in the ſixteenth century, the effective value of a peſo, i. e. the quantity of labour which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, or of goods which it would purchaſe, was five or ſix times as much as at preſent.</p>
                  <p>N. B. Since this edition was put into the preſs, a Hiſtory of Mexico, in two volumes in quarto, tranſlated from the Italian of the Abbé D. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Saverio Clavigero, has been publiſhed. From a perſon, who is a native of New Spain,
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:034476_0013_0FFDD449E30702B0"/>
who has reſided forty years in that country, and who is acquainted with the Mexican language, it was natural to expect much new information. Upon peruſing his work, however, I find that it contains hardly any addition to the ancient Hiſtory of the Mexican empire, as related by Acoſta and Herrea, but what is derived from the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable narratives and fanciful conjectures of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quemada and Boturini. Having copied their ſplendid deſcriptions of the high ſtate of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Mexican empire, M. Clavigero, in the abundance of his zeal for the honour of his native country, charges me with having miſtaken ſome points, and with having miſrepreſented others, in the Hiſtory of it. When an author is conſcious of having exerted induſtry in reſearch and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in deciſion; he may without preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, claim what praiſe is due to theſe qualities, and he cannot be inſenſible to any accuſation that tends to weaken the force of his claim. A feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this kind has induced me to examine ſuch ſtrictures of M. Clavigero on my Hiſtory of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica as merited any attention, eſpecially as theſe are made by one, who ſeemed to poſſeſs the means of obtaining accurate information; and to ſhew that the greater part of them is deſtitute of any juſt found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. This I have done in notes upon the paſſages in my Hiſtory, which gave riſe to his criticiſms.</p>

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF <hi>AMERICA.</hi> BOOK I.</head>
                  <p>THE progreſs of men in diſcovering and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling the various parts of the earth,<note place="margin">BOOK I. The earth ſlowly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.</note> has been extremely ſlow. Several ages elapſed before they removed far from thoſe mild and fertile regions in which they were originally placed by their Creator. The occaſion of their firſt general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion is known; but we are unacquainted with the courſe of their migrations, or the time when they took poſſeſſion of the different countries which they now inhabit. Neither hiſtory nor tradition furniſh ſuch information concerning thoſe remote events, as enables us to trace, with any certainty, the operations of the human race in the infancy of ſociety.</p>
                  <p>WE may conclude, however,<note place="margin">Firſt migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by land.</note> that all the early migrations of mankind were made by land. The ocean, which ſurrounds the habitable earth, as well as the various arms of the ſea which ſeparate one region from another, though deſtined to facilitate the communication between diſtant countries, ſeem, at firſt; view, to be formed to check the progreſs of man and to mark the bounds of that portion of the globe to which nature had confined him It was long, we may believe, before men attempted
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034476_0036_0FFDD486460780B8"/>
to paſs theſe formidable barriers, and became ſo ſkilful and adventrous as to commit themſelves to the mercy of the winds and waves, or to quit their native ſhores in queſt of remote and unknown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note>NAVIGATION and ſhip-building are arts ſo nice and complicated, that they require the ingenuity, as well as experience, of many ſucceſſive ages to bring them to any degree of perfection. From the raft or canoe, which firſt ſerved to carry a ſavage over the river that obſtructed him in the chace, to the conſtruction of a veſſel capable of conveying a numerous crew with ſafety to a diſtant coaſt, the progreſs in improvement is immenſe. Many efforts would be made, many experiments would be tried, and much labour as well as invention would be employed, before men could accompliſh this ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and important undertaking. The rude and imperfect ſtate in which navigation is ſtill found among all nations which are not conſiderably civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized, correſponds with this account of its progreſs, and demonſtrates that, in early times, the art was not ſo far improved as to enable men to undertake diſtant voyages, or to attempt remote diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of commerce.</note>AS ſoon however, as the art of navigation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came known, a new ſpecies of correſpondence among men took place. It is from this aera, that we muſt date the commencement of ſuch an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between nations as deſerves the appellation of commerce. Men are, indeed, far advanced in improvement before commerce becomes an object of great importance to them. They muſt even have made ſome conſiderable progreſs towards ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilization, before they acquire the idea of property, and aſcertain it ſo perfectly as to be acquainted with the moſt ſimple of all contracts, that of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing by barter one rude commodity for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But as ſoon as this important right is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and every individual feels that he has an
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034476_0037_0FFDD489DA2728F0"/>
excluſive title to poſſeſs or to alienate whatever he has acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature ſuggeſt to him a new method of increaſing his acquiſitions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, by diſpoſing of what is ſuperfluous in his own ſtores, in order to procure what is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or deſirable in thoſe of other men. Thus a commercial intercourſe begins, and is carried on among the members of the ſame community. By degrees, they diſcover that neighbouring tribes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs what they themſelves want, and enjoy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of which they wiſh to partake In the ſame mode, and upon the ſame principles, that domeſtic traffic is carried on within the ſociety, an external commerce is eſtabliſhed with other tribes or nations. Their mutual intereſt and mutual wants render this intercourſe deſirable, and imperceptibly introduce the maxims and laws which facilitate its progreſs and render it ſecure. But no very extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce can take place between contiguous provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe ſoil and climate being nearly the ſame, yield ſimilar productions. Remote countries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convey their commodities by land, to thoſe places, where on account of their rarity they are deſired, and become valuable. It is to navigation that men are indebted for the power of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperfluous ſtock of one part of the earth, to ſupply the wants of another. The luxuries and bleſſings of a particular climate are no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to itſelf alone, but the enjoyment of them is communicated to the moſt diſtant regions.</p>
                  <p>IN proportion as the knowledge of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages derived from navigation and commerce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſpread, the intercourſe among nations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The ambition of conqueſt, or the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of procuring new ſettlements, were no longer the ſole motives of viſiting diſtant lands.

But even after a regular commerce was eſtabliſhed in the world, after nations were conſiderably civilized, and the ſciences and arts were cultivated with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and ſucceſs, navigation continued to be ſo imperfect, that it can hardly be ſaid to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement in the ancient world.</p>

Their navigation was of conſequence uncertain and timid. They durſt ſeldom quit ſight of land, but crept along the coaſt, expoſed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the obſtructions, unavoidable in holding ſuch an aukward courſe. An incredible length of time was requiſite for performing voyages, which are now finiſhed in a ſhort ſpace. Even in the mildeſt

                  <p>WHILE both the ſcience and practice of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued to be ſo defective, it was an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of no ſmall difficulty and danger to viſit any remote region of the earth. Under every diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, however, the active ſpirit of commerce exerted itſelf. The Egyptians,<note place="margin">Navigation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> ſoon after the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of their monarchy, are ſaid to have opened a trade between the Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the weſtern coaſt of the great Indian continent. The commodities which they imported from the eaſt, were carried by land from the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Gulph to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down that river to the Mediterranean. But if the Egyptians in early times applied themſelves to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, their attention to it was of ſhort duration. The fertile ſoil and mild climate of Egypt produced the neceſſaries and comforts of life with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as rendered its inhabitants ſo independent of other countries, that it became an eſtabliſhed maxim among that people, whoſe ideas and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions differed in almoſt every point from thoſe of other nations, to renounce all intercourſe with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. In conſequence of this, they never went out of their own country; they held all ſea-faring perſons in deteſtation, as impious and profane; and fortifying their own harbours, they denied ſtrangers admittance into them. <note n="†" place="bottom">Diod.

                     <note place="margin">Of the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians.</note>THE character and ſituation of the Phenicians were as favourable to the ſpirit of commerce and diſcovery as thoſe of the Egyptians were adverſe to it. They had no diſtinguiſhing peculiarity in their manners and inſtitutions; they were not addicted to any ſingular and unſocial form of ſuperſtition; they could mingle with other nations without ſcruple or reluctance. The territory which they poſſeſſed was neither large nor fertile. Commerce was the only ſource from which they could derive opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was more extenſive and enterpriſing than that of any ſtate in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians, as well as the object of their policy and the ſpirit of their laws, were entirely commercial. They were a people of merchants who aimed at the empire of the ſea, and actually poſſeſſed it. Their ſhips not only frequented all the ports in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean, but they were the firſt who ventured beyond the ancient boundaries of navigation, and paſſing the Streights of Gades, viſited the weſtern coaſts of Spain and Africa. In many of the places to which they reſorted, they planted colonies, and communicated to the rude inhabitants ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their arts and improvements. While they extended their diſcoveries towards the north and the weſt, they did not neglect to penetrate into the more opulent and fertile regions of the ſouth and eaſt. Having rendered themſelves maſters of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral commodious harbours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulph, they, after the example of the Egyptians, eſtabliſhed a regular intercourſe with Arabia and the continent of India on the one hand, and with the eaſtern coaſt of Africa on the other.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:034476_0041_0FFDD4945BC00CB8"/>
From theſe countries they imported many valuable commodities, unknown to the reſt of the world, and during a long period, engroſſed that lucrative branch of commerce without a rival.<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE I. in Vol. I.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE vaſt wealth which the Phenicians acquired by monopolizing the trade carried on in the Red Sea, incited their neighbours the Jews,<note place="margin">Of the Jews</note> under the proſperous reigns of David and Solomon, to aim at being admitted to ſome ſhare of it. This they obtained partly by their conqueſt of Idumea, which ſtretches along the Red Sea, and partly by their alliance with Hiram King of Tyre. Solomon fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out fleets, which, under the direction of Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician pilots, ſailed from the Red Sea to Tarſhiſh and Ophir. Theſe it is probable were ports in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia and Africa which their conductors were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to frequent, and from them the Jewiſh ſhips returned with ſuch valuable cargoes as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly diffuſed wealth and ſplendour through the kingdom of Iſrael.<note n="†" place="bottom">Memoire ſur le Pays d'Ophir par M.

Accordingly, this unſocial genius of the people, together with the diſaſters which befel the kingdom of Iſrael, prevented the commercial ſpirit which their monarchs laboured to introduce, and to cheriſh, from ſpreading among them. The Jews cannot be numbered among the nations which contributed to improve navigation, or to extend diſcovery.</p>

temper of the Jews, in oppoſition to the tendency of their laws, they tranſmitted the commercial ſpirit with facility, and in full vigour, to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants the Carthaginians. The commonwealth of Carthage applied to trade and to naval affairs, with no leſs ardour, ingenuity, and ſucceſs, than its parent ſtate. Carthage early rivalled, and ſoon ſurpaſſed Tyre, in opulence and power, but ſeems not to have aimed at obtaining any ſhare in the commerce with India. The Phenicians had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed this, and had ſuch a command of the Red Sea, as ſecured to them the excluſive poſſeſſion of that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial activity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another direction. Without contending for the trade of the eaſt with their mother-country, they extended their navigation chiefly towards the weſt and north. Following the courſe which the Phenicians had opened, they paſſed the Streights of Gades, and puſhing their diſcoveries far beyond thoſe of the parent ſtate, viſited not only all the coaſts of Spain, but thoſe of Gaul, and penetrated at laſt into Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. At the ſame time that they acquired know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of new countries in this part of the globe, they gradually carried their reſearches towards the South. They made conſiderable progreſs, by land, into the interior provinces of Africa, traded with ſome of them, and ſubjected others to their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. They ſailed along the weſtern coaſt of that great continent, almoſt to the tropic of Cancer, and planted ſeveral colonies, in order to civilize the natives, and accuſtom them to commerce. They diſcovered the Fortunate Iſlands, now known by the name of the Canaries, the utmoſt boundary of ancient navigation in the weſtern ocean.<note n="*" place="bottom">Plinii Nat.

Commerce was followed by its uſual effects among both theſe people. It awakened curioſity, enlarged the ideas and deſires of men, and incited them to bold enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes. Voyages were undertaken, the ſole object of which was to diſcover new countries, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore unknown ſeas. Such during the proſperous age of the Carthaginian republic, were the famous navigations of Hanno and Himilco. Both their fleets were equipped by authority of the ſenate, and at public expence. Hanno was directed to ſteer towards the ſouth, along the coaſt of Africa, and he ſeems to have advanced much nearer the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line than any former navigator<note n="*" place="bottom">Plinii Nat.

which I have related, may juſtly be reckoned the greateſt effort of navigation in the ancient world; and if we attend to the imperfect ſtate of the art at that time, it is difficult to determine, whether we ſhould moſt admire the courage and ſagacity with which the deſign was formed, or the conduct and good fortune with which it was executed.

It is evident that the Phenicians, who inſtructed the Greeks in many other uſeful ſciences and arts, did not communicate to them that exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive knowledge of navigation which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves poſſeſſed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial ſpirit and ardour for diſcovery which diſtinguiſhed their rivals the Carthaginians.— Though Greece be almoſt encompaſſed by the ſea, which formed many ſpacious bays and commodious harbours, though it be ſurrounded by a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of fertile iſlands, yet notwithſtanding ſuch a favourable ſituation, which ſeemed to invite that ingenious people to apply themſelves to navigation, it was long before this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t attained any degree of perfection among them. Their early voyages, the object of which was piracy rather than commerce, were ſo inconſiderable, that the expedition of the Argonauts from the coaſt of Theſſaly to the Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſea, appeared ſuch an amazing effort of ſkill and courage, as entitled the conductors of it to be ranked among the demigods, and exalted the veſſel in which they ſailed to a place among the heavenly conſtellations. Even at a later period, when the Greeks engaged in their famous enterprize againſt Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs ſeems not to have been much improved. According to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Homer, the only poet to whom hiſtory
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:034476_0046_0FFDD4A05712B530"/>
ventures to appeal, and who, by his ſcrupulous accuracy in deſcribing the manners and arts of early ages, merits this diſtinction, the ſcience of navigation, at that time, had hardly advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its rudeſt ſtate. The Greeks in the heroic age ſeem to have been unacquainted with the uſe of iron, the moſt ſerviceable of all the metals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no conſiderable progreſs was ever made in the mechanical arts. Their veſſels were of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable burthen, and moſtly without decks. They had only one maſt, which was erected or taken down at pleaſure. They were ſtrangers to the uſe of anchors. All their operations in ſailing were clumſy and unſkilful. They turned their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations towards ſtars, which were improper for regulating their courſe, and their mode of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them was inaccurate and fallacious. When they had finiſhed a voyage they drew their paltry barks aſhore, as ſavages do their canoes, and theſe remained on dry land until the ſeaſon of returning to ſea approached. It is not then in the early or heroic ages of Greece that we can expect to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſcience of navigation, and the ſpirit of diſcovery, making any conſiderable progreſs. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that period of diſorder and ignorance, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cauſes concurred in reſtraining curioſity and enterprize within very narrow bounds.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a ſtate of greater civilization and refinement. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in its moſt liberal and perfect form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be eſtabliſhed in their different communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; equal laws and regular police were gradually introduced; the ſciences and arts which are uſeful or ornamental in life were carried to a high pitch of improvement, and ſeveral of the Grecian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths applied to commerce with ſuch ardour and ſucceſs, that they were conſidered, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient world, as maritime powers of the firſt rank.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:034476_0047_0FFDD4A328A41D20"/>
Even then, however, the naval victories of the Greeks muſt be aſcribed rather to the native ſpirit of the people, and to that courage which the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of liberty inſpires, than to any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary progreſs in the ſcience of navigation. In the Perſian war, thoſe exploits which the genius of the Greek hiſtorians has rendered ſo famous, were performed by fleets, compoſed chiefly of ſmall veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels without decks;<note n="*" place="bottom">Thucyd. lib. i. c. 14.</note> the crews of which ruſhed forward with impetuous valour, but little art, to board thoſe of the enemy. In the war of Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus, their ſhips ſeem ſtill to have been of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable burthen and force. The extent of their trade, how highly ſoever it may have been eſtimated in ancient times, was in proportion to this low condition of their marine. The maritime ſtates of Greece hardly carried on any commerce beyond the limits of the Mediterranean ſea. Their chief intercourſe was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted in the leſſer Aſia, in Italy and Sicily. They ſometimes viſited the ports of Egypt, of the ſouthern provinces of Gaul, and of Thrace; or paſſing through the Helleſpont, they traded with the countries ſituated around the Euxine ſea. Amazing inſtances occur of their ignorance even of thoſe countries which lay within the narrow precincts to which their navigation was confined. When the Greeks had aſſembled their combined fleet againſt Xerxes at Egina, they thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſable to ſail to Samos, becauſe they believed the diſtance between that iſland and Egina to be as great as the diſtance between Egina and the Pillars of Hercules<note n="†" place="bottom">Heredot. lib. viii. c. 132.</note>. They were either utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the parts of the globe beyond the Mediterranean ſea, or what knowledge they had of them was founded on conjecture, or derived from the information of a few perſons, whom curioſity
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:034476_0048_0FFDD4A6E6348868"/>
and the love of ſcience had prompted to travel by land into the Upper Aſia, or by ſea into Egypt, the ancient ſeats of wiſdom and arts. After all that the Greeks learned from them, they appear to have been ignorant of the moſt important facts on which an accurate and ſcientific knowledge of the globe is founded.</p>
                  <p>THE expedition of Alexander the Great into the eaſt, conſiderably enlarged the ſphere of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of geographical knowledge among the Greeks. That extraordinary man, notwithſtanding the violent paſſions which incited him, at ſome times, to the wildeſt actions, and the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant enterpriſes, poſſeſſed talents which fitted him not only to conquer, but to govern the world. He was capable of framing thoſe bold and original ſchemes of policy, which gave a new form to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs. The revolution in commerce, brought about by the force of his genius, is hardly inferior to that revolution in empire occaſioned by the ſucceſs of his arms. It is probable that the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and efforts of the republic of Tyre, which checked him ſo long in the career of his victories, gave Alexander an opportunity of obſerving the vaſt reſources of a maratime power, and conveyed to him ſome idea of the immenſe wealth which the Tyrians derived from their commerce, eſpecially that with the Eaſt-Indies. As ſoon as he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the deſtruction of Tyre, and reduced Egypt to ſubjection, he formed the plan of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the empire which he propoſed to eſtabliſh, the center of commerce as well as the ſeat of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. With this view he founded a great city, which he honoured with his own name, near one of the mouths of the river Nile, that, by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean ſea, and the neighbourhood of the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian Gulf, it might command the trade both of the eaſt and weſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Strab. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1143. 1249.</note>. This ſituation was choſen with
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:034476_0049_0FFDD4A97805D7B8"/>
ſuch diſcernment, that Alexandria ſoon became the chief commercial city in the world. Not only during the ſubſiſtence of the Grecian empire in Egypt and in the eaſt, but amidſt all the ſucceſſive revolutions in thoſe countries, from the time of the Ptolemies to the diſcovery of the navigation by the Cape of Good Hope, commerce, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the Eaſt-Indies, continued to flow in the channel which the ſagacity and foreſight of Alexander had marked out for it.</p>
                  <p>HIS ambition was not ſatisfied with having open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Greeks a communication with India by ſea; he aſpired to the ſovereignty of thoſe regions which furniſhed the reſt of mankind with ſo many precious commodities, and conducted his army thither by land. Enterpriſing, however, as he was, he may be ſaid rather to have viewed, than to have conquered that country. He did not, in his progreſs towards the eaſt, advance beyond the banks of the rivers that fall into the Indus, which is now the weſtern boundary of the vaſt continent of India. Amidſt the wild exploits which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh this part of his hiſtory, he purſued mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that mark the ſuperiority of his genius, as well as the extent of his views.

In order to effect this, he propoſed to remove the cataracts, with which the jealouſy of the Perſians, and their averſion to correſpondence with foreigners, had obſtructed the entrance into the Euphrates;<note n="*" place="bottom">Strab.

Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſailed beyond the bounds of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, where the ebb and flow of the ſea are hardly perceptible, when they firſt obſerved this phaenomenon at the mouth of the Indus, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them a prodigy, by which the gods teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the diſpleaſure of Heaven againſt their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE V.</note> During their whole courſe, they ſeem never to have loſt ſight of land, but followed the bearings of the coaſt ſo ſervilely, that they could not much avail themſelves of thoſe periodical winds which facilitate navigation in the Indian ocean.

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:034476_0051_0FFDD4ADA0CD4EF0"/>
of the Indus to that of the Perſian Gulf, does not exceed twenty degrees. It is probable, that amidſt the violent convulſions and frequent revolutions in the Eaſt, occaſioned by the conteſts among the ſucceſſors of Alexander, the navigation to India, by the courſe which Nearchus had opened, was diſcontinued. The Indian trade carried on at Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria not only ſubſiſted, but was ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended under the Grecian monarchs of Egypt, that it proved a great ſource of the wealth which diſtinguiſhed their kingdom.</p>

The genius of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people, their military education, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of their laws concurred in eſtranging them from commerce and naval affairs. It was the neceſſity of oppoſing a formidable rival, not the deſire of extending trade, which firſt prompted them to aim at maritime power. Though they ſoon perceived that, in order to acquire the univerſal dominion after which they aſpired, it was neceſſary to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves maſters of the ſea, they ſtill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the naval ſervice as a ſubordinate ſtation, and reſerved for it ſuch citizens as were not of a rank to be admitted into the legions<note n="*" place="bottom">Polyb. lib. v.</note>. In the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Roman republic, hardly one event oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, that marks attention to navigation any farther than as it was inſtrumental towards conqueſt. When the Roman valour and diſcipline had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all the maritime ſtates known in the ancient world; when Carthage, Greece, and Egypt had ſubmitted to their power, the Romans did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe the commercial ſpirit of the conquered na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Among that people of ſoldiers, to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to trade would have been deemed a degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Roman citizen. They abandoned the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034476_0052_0FFDD4B139E50B80"/>
arts, commerce, and navigation, to ſlaves, to freedmen, to provincials, and to citizens of the loweſt claſs. Even after the ſubverſion of liberty, when the ſeverity and haughtineſs of ancient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners began to abate, commerce did not riſe into high eſtimation among the Romans. The trade of Greece, Egypt, and the other conquered coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, continued to be carried on in its uſual chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, after they were reduced into the form of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man provinces. As Rome was the capital of the world, and the ſeat of government, all the wealth and valuable productions of the provinces flowed naturally thither. The Romans, ſatisfied with this, ſeem to have ſuffered commerce to remain almoſt entirely in the hands of the natives of the reſpective countries. The extent, however, of the Roman power, which reached over the greateſt part of the known world, the vigilant inſpection of the Roman magiſtrates, and the ſpirit of the Roman govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no leſs intelligent than active, gave ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſecurity to commerce, as animated it with new vigour. The union among nations was never ſo entire, nor the intercourſe ſo perfect, as within the bounds of this vaſt empire. Commerce un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Roman dominion, was not obſtructed by the jealouſy of rival ſtates, interrupted by frequent hoſtilities, or limited by partial reſtrictions. One ſuperintending power moved and regulated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits of their joint efforts.</p>
                  <p>NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved under it. As ſoon as the Romans acquired a taſte for the luxuries of the Eaſt, the trade with India through Egypt was puſhed with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the Indian continent, navigators became acquainted with the periodical courſe of the winds, which, in
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:034476_0053_0FFDD4B3D298DD40"/>
the ocean that ſeparates Africa from India, blow with little variation during one half of the year from the eaſt, and during the other half blow with equal ſteadineſs from the weſt. Encouraged by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, the pilots who ſailed from Egypt to India abandoned their ancient ſlow and dangerous courſe along the coaſt, and as ſoon as the weſtern monſoon ſet in, took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and ſtretched boldly acroſs the ocean <note n="*" place="bottom">Plin. Nat. Hiſt. lib. vi. c. 23.</note>. The uniform direction of the wind ſupplying the place of the compaſs, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the guidance of the ſtars leſs neceſſary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them to the port of Muſiris, on the weſtern ſhore of the Indian continent. There they took on board their cargo, and returning with the eaſtern monſoon, finiſhed their voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year. This part of India, now known by the name of the Malabar coaſt, ſeems to have been the utmoſt limit of ancient navigation in that quarter of the globe. What imperfect knowledge the ancients had of the immenſe countries which ſtretch beyond this towards the eaſt, they received from a few adventurers, who had viſited them by land. Such excurſions were neither frequent nor extenſive, and it is probable, that while the Roman intercourſe with India ſubſiſted, no traveller ever penetrated farther than to the banks of the Ganges.<note n="†" place="bottom">Strab. Georgr. lib. xv. p. 1006. 1010.

But though the diſcoveries of the Romans in India were ſo limited, their commerce there was ſuch as will appear conſiderable, even to the preſent age, in which the Indian trade has been extended far beyond the practice or conception of any preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period.

The progreſs, however, of their victorious armies through a conſiderable portion of Europe, Aſia, and Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, contributed greatly to extend diſcovery by land, and gradually opened the navigation of new and unknown ſeas. Previous to the Roman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the civilized nations of antiquity had little communication with thoſe countries in Europe, which now form its moſt opulent and powerful kingdoms.

by its neighbours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian merchants. The name of Germany had ſcarcely been heard of. Into all theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the arms of the Romans penetrated. They entirely ſubdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered the greateſt and moſt fertile part of Britain; they advanced into Germany, as far as the banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they acquired a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble knowledge of the provinces which ſtretch along the Mediterranean ſea, from Egypt weſtward to the ſtraits of Gades. In Aſia, they not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to their power moſt of the provinces which compoſed the Pruſſian and Macedonian empires, but, after their victories over Mithridates and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes, they ſeem to have made a more accurate ſurvey of the countries contiguous to the Euxine and Caſpian ſeas, and to have carried on a more extenſive trade than that of the Greeks with the opulent and commercial nations, then ſeated round the Euxine ſea.</p>
                  <p>FROM this ſuccinct ſurvey of diſcovery and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,<note place="margin">Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographical knowledge among the ancients.</note> which I have traced from the earlieſt dawn of hiſtorical knowledge to the full eſtabliſhment of the Roman dominion, the progreſs of both ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been wonderfully ſlow.

In Europe, the extenſive provinces in the eaſtern part of Germany were little known to them.
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:034476_0056_0FFDD4BACE4D9F00"/>
They were almoſt totally unacquainted with the vaſt countries which are now ſubject to the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, Pruſſia, Poland, and the Ruſſian empire. The more barren regions, that ſtretch within the arctic circle, were quite unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored. In Africa, their reſearches did not extend far beyond the provinces which border on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean, and thoſe ſituated on the weſtern ſhore of the Arabian Gulf. In Aſia, they were unacquainted, as I formerly obſerved, with all the fertile and opulent countries beyond the Ganges, which furniſh the moſt valuable commodities that, in modern times, have been the great object of the European commerce with India; nor do they ſeem to have ever penetrated into thoſe immenſe regions occupied by the wandering tribes which they called by the general name of Sarmatians or Scythians, and which are now poſſeſſed by Tartars of various denominations, and by the Aſiatic ſubjects of Ruſſia.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable proof of this.</note>BUT there is one opinion, that univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among the ancients, which conveys a more ſtriking idea of the ſmall progreſs they had made in the knowledge of the habitable globe, than can be derived from any detail of their diſcoveries. They ſuppoſed the earth to be divided into five regions, which they diſtinguiſhed by the name of zones. Two of theſe, which were neareſt the poles, they termed frigid zones, and believed that the extreme cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered them uninhabitable. Another, ſeated under the line, and extending on either ſide towards the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and imagined it to be ſo burnt up with unremitting heat, as to be equally deſtitute of inhabitants. On the two other zones, which occupied the remainder of the earth, they beſtowed the appellation of temperate, and taught that theſe, being the only regions in which life
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:034476_0057_0FFDD4BF70B58738"/>
could ſubſiſt, were allotted to man for his habitation. This wild opinion was not a conceit of the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vulgar, or a fanciful fiction of the poets, but a ſyſtem adopted by the moſt enlightened phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, the moſt accurate hiſtorians and geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, in Greece and Rome According to this theory, a vaſt portion of the habitable earth was pronounced to be unſit for ſuſtaining the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies. Thoſe fertile and populous regions within the torrid zone, which are now known not only to yield their own inhabitants the neceſſaries and comforts of life, with moſt luxuriant profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to communicate their ſuperfluous ſtores to the reſt of the world, were ſuppoſed to be the manſion of perpetual ſterility and deſolation. As all the parts of the globe with which the ancients were acquainted, lay within the northern temperate zone, their opinion that the other temperate zone was filled with inhabitants, was founded on reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conjecture, not on diſcovery. They even believed that, by the intolerable heat of the torrid zone, ſuch an inſuperable barrier was placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two temperate regions of the earth, as would prevent for ever any intercourſe between their reſpective inhabitants. Thus this extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant theory not only proves that the ancients were unacquainted with the true ſtate of the globe, but it tended to render their ignorance perpetual, by repreſenting all attempts towards opening a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the remote regions of the earth, as utterly impracticable<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE VIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT, however imperfect or inaccurate the geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical knowledge which the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had acquired may appear, in reſpect of the preſent improved ſtate of that ſcience, their progreſs in diſcovery will ſeem conſiderable, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

As long as the Roman empire retained ſuch vigour as to preſerve its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the conquered nations, and to keep them united, it was an object of public police, as well as of private curioſity, to examine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the countries which compoſed this great body. Even when the other ſciences began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, geography, enriched with new obſervations, and receiving ſome acceſſion from the experience of every age, and the reports of every traveller continued to improve. It attained to the higheſt point of perfection and accuracy to which it ever arrived in the ancient world, by the induſtry and genius of Ptolemy the philoſopher.<note place="margin">Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in geography by Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> He flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the ſecond century of the Chriſtian aera, and publiſhed a deſcription of the terreftri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al globe, more ample and exact than that of any of his predeceſſors.</p>

During this decline and old age of the Roman ſtate, it was impoſſible that the ſciences ſhould go on improving. The efforts of genius were, at that period, as languid and feeble as thoſe of government.

When Egypt was torn from the Roman empire by the Arabians, the induſtry of the Greeks diſcovered a new channel, by which the productions of India might be conveyed to Conſtantinople.

They were ſupplied both with the precious commodities of the eaſt, and with many curious manufactures, the product of ancient arts and ingenuity which ſtill ſubſiſted among the Greeks. As the labour and expence of conveying the productions of India to Conſtantinople by that long and indirect courſe which I have deſcribed, rendered them extremely rare, and of an exorbitant price, the induſtry of the Italians diſcovered other methods of procuring them in greater abundance, and at an eaſier rate. They ſometimes purchaſed them in Aleppo, Tripoli, and other ports on the coaſt of Syria, to which they were brought by a route not unknown to the ancients.

Their naval power increaſed; their veſſels frequented not only all the ports in the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, but venturing ſometimes beyond the Streights, viſited the maritime towns of Spain, France, the Low Countries, and England; and, by diſtributing their commodities over Europe, began to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to its various nations ſome taſte for the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able productions of the eaſt, as well as ſome ideas of manufactures and arts, which were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known beyond the precincts of Italy.</p>

which the Cruſaders made in Paleſtine, and in other provinces of Aſia. From thoſe ſources, prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I have mentioned. This was accompanied with a proportional increaſe of power, and, by the end of the Holy War, Venice, in particular, became a great maritime ſtate, poſſeſſing an extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and ample territories<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſai de l'Hiſtoire du Commerce de Veniſe, p. 52, &amp;c.</note>.

                  <p>AS his father had already carried ſome European commodities to the court of the great Chan of the Tartars, and had diſpoſed of them to advantage, he reſorted thither. Under the protection of Kub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay Chan, the moſt powerful of all the ſucceſſors of Zengis, he continued his mercantile peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in Aſia, upwards of twenty-ſix years; and, during that time, advanced towards the eaſt, far beyond the utmoſt boundaries to which any Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean traveller had ever proceeded. Inſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the courſe of Carpini and Rubruquis, along the vaſt unpeopled plains of Tartary, he paſſed

through the chief trading cities in the more culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated parts of Aſia, and penetrated to Cambalu, or Peking, the capital of the great kingdom of Cathay, or China, ſubject at that time to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of Zengis. He made more than one voyage, on the Indian ocean, he traded in many of the iſlands, from which Europe had long received ſpiceries and other commodities, which it held in high eſtimation, though unacquainted with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular countries to which it was indebted for thoſe precious productions; and he obtained information concerning ſeveral countries, which he did not viſit in perſon, particularly the iſland Zipangri, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the ſame now known by the name of Japan<note n="*" place="bottom">Vigaggi di Marco Polo.

On his return, he aſtoniſhed his contemporaries with his deſcriptions of vaſt regions, whoſe names had never been heard of in Europe, and with ſuch pompous accounts of their fertility, their popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs, their opulence, the variety of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, and the extent of their trade, as roſe far above the conception of an uninformed age.</p>

may be conſidered as the popular traditions and fables of the countries through which they had paſſed, were gradually diſregarded as Europe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in knowledge.

of the earth, by enabling him to viſit every part of it. Flavio Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, a town of conſiderable trade in the kingdom of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, was the author of this great diſcovery, about the year one thouſand three hundred and two.

                  <p>THE firſt appearance of a bolder ſpirit may be dated from the voyages of the Spaniards to the Canary or Fortunate Iſlands.<note place="margin">Some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a bolder ſpirit in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation.</note> By what accident they were led to the diſcovery of thoſe ſmall iſles, which lie near five hundred miles from the Spaniſh coaſt, and above a hundred and fifty miles from the coaſt of Africa, contemporary writers have not explained.

Clement VI. in virtue of the right claimed by the holy ſee, to diſpoſe of all countries poſſeſſed by infidels, erected thoſe iſles into a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the year one thouſand three hundred and forty-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la Cerda, deſcended from the royal family of Caſtile. But that unfortunate prince, deſtitute of power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his nominal title, having never viſited the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, John de Bethencourt, a Norman baron, obtained a grant of them from Henry III. of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile<note n="*" place="bottom">Viera y Clavijo Notic. de la Hiſtor. de Canaria.

parts of the globe with which mankind were then unacquainted, not only improved and extended the art of navigation, but rouſed ſuch a ſpirit of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity and enterpriſe, as led to the diſcovery of the New World, of which I propoſe to write the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, it is neceſſary to take a full view of the riſe, the progreſs, and ſucceſs of their various naval ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.

They had the command of the national force, could rouſe it to act with united vigour, and, after the expulſion of the Moors, could employ it without dread of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from any domeſtic enemy. By the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hoſtilities carried on for ſeveral centuries againſt the Mahometans, the martial and adventurous ſpirit which diſtinguiſhed all the European nations during the middle ages, was improved and height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened among the Portugueſe.

fit for bold undertakings. The ſituation of the kingdom, bounded on every ſide by the dominions of a more powerful neighbour, did not afford free ſcope to the activity of the Portuguſe by land, as the ſtrength of their monarchy was no match for that of Caſtile. But Portugal was a maritime ſtate, in which there were many commodious har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; the people had begun to make ſome progreſs in the knowledge and practice of navigation; and the ſea was open to them, preſenting the only field of enterpriſe in which they could diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

But the nations of Europe had now acquired as much knowledge, as emboldened them to diſregard the prejudices and to correct the errors of their anceſtors. The long reign of ignorance, the conſtant enemy of every curious inquiry, and of every new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, was approaching to its period. The light of ſcience began to dawn. The works of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greeks and Romans began to be read with admiration and profit. The ſciencies cultivated by the Arabians were introduced into Europe by the Moors ſettled in Spain and Portugal, and by the Jews, who were very numerous in both theſe kingdoms. Geometry, aſtronomy, and geography, the ſciences on which the art of navigation is founded, became objects of ſtudious attention. The memory of the diſcoveries made by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients was revived, and the progreſs of their navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and commerce began to be traced. Some of the cauſes which have obſtructed the cultivation of ſcience in Portugal, during this century and the laſt, did not exiſt, or did not operate in the ſame manner, in the fifteenth century<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE IX.</note>; and the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, at that period, ſeem to have kept pace with other nations on this ſide of the Alps in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary purſuits.</p>
                  <p>AS the genius of the age favoured the execution of that new undertaking,<note place="margin">Its ſucceſs.</note> to which the peculiar ſtate of the country invited the Portugueſe, it
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034476_0076_0FFDD4EF7505B718"/>
proved ſucceſsful. The veſſels ſent on the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very doubled that formidable Cape, which had terminated the progreſs of former navigators, and proceeded a hundred and ſixty miles beyond it, to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which ſtretched a conſiderable way into the Atlantic, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more dreadful than the promontory which they had paſſed, the Portugueſe commanders durſt not attempt to ſail round it, but returned to Liſbon, more ſatisfied with having advanced ſo far, than aſhamed of having ventured no farther.</p>

The fortunate iſſue of the king's expedition againſt the Moors of Barbary, added ſtrength to that ſpirit in the nation, and puſhed it on to new undertakings.<note place="margin">1417.</note> In order to render theſe ſucceſsful, it was neceſſary that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by a perſon who poſſeſſed abilities capable of diſcerning what was attainable, who enjoyed leiſure to form a regular ſyſtem for proſecuting diſcovery, and who was animated with ardour that would perſevere in ſpite of obſtacles and repulſes. Happily for Portugal, ſhe found all thoſe qualities in Henry Duke of Viſeo, the fourth ſon of king John by Philippa of Lancaſter, ſiſter of Henry IV. king of England. That prince, in his early youth, having accompanied his father in his expedition to Barbary, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by many deeds of valour. To the martial ſpirit, which was the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of every man of noble birth at that time, he added all the accompliſhments of a more enlightened and poliſhed age. He cultivated the arts and ſciences, which were then unknown and deſpiſed by perſons of his rank. He applied with peculiar fondneſs to the ſtudy of geography; and by the inſtruction of able maſters, as well as by the accounts of travellers, he early acquired ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of the habitable globe, as diſcovered the great probability of finding new and opulent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by ſailing along the coaſt of Africa. Such an object was formed to awaken the enthuſiaſm and ardour of a youthful mind, and he eſpouſed with the utmoſt zeal the patronage of a deſign which might prove as beneficial, as it appeared to be ſplendid and honourable. In order that he might purſue this great ſcheme without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he retired from court immediately after his return from Africa, and fixed his reſidence at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the proſpect of the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts continually towards his favourite project, and encouraged him to execute it. In this retreat he was attended by ſome of the moſt learned men in his country, who aided him in his reſearches. He applied for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to the Moors of Barbary, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to travel by land into the interior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Africa, in queſt of ivory, gold-duſt, and other rich commodities. He conſulted the Jews ſettled in Portugal. By promiſes, rewards, and marks of reſpect, he allured into his ſervice ſeveral perſons, foreigners as well as Portugueſe, who were eminent for their ſkill in navigation. In taking thoſe preparatory ſteps, the great abilities of the prince were ſeconded by his private virtues. His integrity, his affability, his reſpect for religion, his zeal for the honour of his country, engaged per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all ranks to applaud his deſign, and to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the execution of it. His ſchemes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the greater part of his countrymen to proceed neither from ambition nor the deſire of wealth, but to flow from the warm benevolence of a heart eager to promote the happineſs of mankind, and which juſtly entitled him to aſſume a motto for his device, that deſcribed the quality, by which he wiſhed to be diſtinguiſhed, the talent of doing good.</p>

They, according to the mode of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which ſtill prevailed, held their courſe along the ſhore; and by following that direction, they muſt have encountered almoſt inſuperable difficulties in attempting to paſs Cape Bojador. But fortune came in aid to their want of ſkill, and prevented the voyage from being altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. A ſudden ſquall of wind aroſe, drove them out to ſea, and when they expected every moment to periſh, landed them on an unknown iſland, which from their happy eſcape they named <hi>Porto Santo.</hi> In the infancy of navigation, the diſcovery of this ſmall iſland appeared a matter of ſuch moment, that they inſtantly returned to Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal with the good tidings, and were received by Henry with the applauſe and honour due to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate adventurers.

As it was Henry's chief object to render his diſcoveries uſeful to his country, he immediately equipped a fleet to carry a colony of Portugueſe to theſe iſlands. By his provident care,<note place="margin">1420.</note> they were furniſhed not only with the ſeeds, plants, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals common in Europe; but as he foreſaw that the warmth of the climate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the ſoil would prove favourable to the rearing of other productions, he procured ſlips of the vine from the iſland of Cyprus, the rich wines of which were then in great requeſt, and plants of the ſugar-cane from Sicily, into which it had been lately introduced Theſe throve ſo proſperouſly in this new country, that the benefit of cultivating them was immediately perceived, and the ſugar and wine of Madeira quickly became articles of ſome conſequence in the commerce of Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal<note n="†" place="bottom">Lud.

                  <p>AS ſoon as the advantages derived from this firſt ſettlement to the weſt of the European continent began to be felt, the ſpirit of diſcovery appeared leſs chimerical, and became more adventurous.

                     <note place="margin">Aſtoniſhed at what they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered there.</note>HITHERTO the Portugueſe had been guided in their diſcoveries, or encouraged to attempt them, by the light and information which they received from the works of the ancient mathematicians and geographers. But, when they began to enter the torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among the ancients, that the heat which reigned perpetually there, was ſo exceſſive as to render it uninhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, deterred them, for ſome time, from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their own obſervations, when they firſt ventured into this unknown and formidable region, tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the violent operation of the direct rays of the ſun. As far as the river Senegal, the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe had found the coaſt of Africa inhabited by people nearly reſembling the Moors of Barbary. When they advanced to the ſouth of that river, the human form ſeemed to put on a new appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. They beheld men with ſkins black as ebony, with ſhort curled hair, flat noſes, thick lips, and all the peculiar features which are now known to diſtinguiſh the race of negroes. This ſurpriſing alteration they naturally attributed to the influence of heat, and if they ſhould advance nearer to the line, they began to dread that its effects would be ſtill more violent. Thoſe dangers were exaggerated, and many other objections againſt attempting farther diſcoveries were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome of the grandees, who, from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, from envy, or from that cold timid pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which rejects whatever has the air of novelty or enterpriſe, had hitherto condemned all prince Henry's ſchemes. They repreſented, that it was
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034476_0081_0FFDD4FC78F47990"/>
altogether chimerical to expect any advantage from countries ſituated in that region which the wiſdom and experience of antiquity had pronounced to be unfit for the habitation of men; that their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, ſatisfied with cultivating the territory which Providence had allotted them, did not waſte the ſtrength of the kingdom by fruitleſs projects, in queſt of new ſettlements; that Portugal was already exhauſted by the expence of attempts to diſcover lands which either did not exiſt, or which nature deſtined to remain unknown; and was drained of men, who might have been employed in undertakings attended with more certain ſucceſs, and productive of greater benefit. But neither their appeal to the authority of the ancients, nor their reaſonings concerning the intereſts of Portugal, made any impreſſion upon the determined phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophic mind of Prince Henry. The diſcoveries which he had already made convinced him that the ancients had little more than a conjectural knowledge of the torrid zone. He was no leſs ſatisfied that the political arguments of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents with reſpect to the intereſt of Portugal were malevolent and ill founded. In thoſe ſentiments he was ſtrenuouſly ſupported by his brother Pedro, who governed the kingdom as guardian of their nephew Alphonſo V.<note place="margin">1438.</note> who had ſucceeded to the throne during his minority; and inſtead of ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening his efforts, Henry continued to purſue his diſcoveries with freſh ardour.</p>
                  <p>BUT,<note place="margin">Papal grant to Portugal of what countries it ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</note> in order to ſilence all the murmurs of oppoſition, he endeavoured to obtain the ſanction of the higheſt authority in favour of his operations. With this view, he applied to the Pope, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in pompous terms, the pious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied zeal, with which he had exerted himſelf during twenty years, in diſcovering unknown countries, the wretched inhabitants of which were

utter ſtrangers to true religion, wandering in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then darkneſs, or led aſtray by the deluſions of Mahomet. He beſought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar of Chriſt, all the kingdoms of the earth were ſubject, to confer on the crown of Portugal a right to all the countries poſſeſſed by Infidels, which ſhould be diſcovered by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of its ſubjects, and ſubdued by the force of its arms. He intreated him to enjoin all Chriſtian powers, under the higheſt penalties, not to moleſt Portugal while engaged in this laudable enterpriſe, and to prohibit them from ſettling in any of the countries which the Portugueſe ſhould diſcover. He promiſed that, in all their expeditions, it ſhould be the chief object of his countrymen to ſpread the knowledge of the Chriſtian religion, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh the authority of the holy ſee, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the flock of the univerſal paſtor. As it was by improving with dexterity every favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture for acquiring new powers, that the court of Rome had gradually extended its uſurpations, Eugine IV. the Pontiff to whom this application was made, eagerly ſeized the opportunity which now preſented itſelf. He inſtantly perceived, that by complying with Prince Henry's requeſt, he might exerciſe a prerogative no leſs flattering in its own nature, than likely to prove beneficial in its conſequences. A bull was accordingly iſſued, in which, after applauding in the ſtrongeſt terms the paſt efforts of the Portugueſe, and exhorting them to proceed in that laudable career on which they had entered, he granted them an excluſive right to all the countries which they ſhould diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from Cape Non to the continent of India.</p>
                  <p>EXTRAVAGANT as this donation, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a large portion of the habitable globe, would now appear even in Catholic countries, no perſon in the fifteenth century doubted that the

Many Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians and Genoeſe, in particular, who were, at that time, ſuperior to all other nations in the ſcience of naval affairs entered aboard the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe ſhips, and acquired a more perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive knowledge of their profeſſion in that new ſchool of navigation.

of ſchemes more important, than thoſe which had hitherto allured and occupied them. They had detected the error of the ancients concerning the nature of the torrid zone. They found, as they proceeded ſouthwards, that the continent of Africa, inſtead of extending in breadth, according to the doctrine of Ptolemy<note n="*" place="bottom">Vida. Nob. Orbis Tubul.

As navigation, in every direction, was now became enterpriſing, he proceeded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that iſland, the Thule of the ancients, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſeveral degrees within the polar circle. Having ſatisfied his curioſity, by a voyage which tended more to enlarge his knowledge of naval affairs, than to improve his fortune, he entered into the ſervice of a famous ſea-captain, of his own name and family. This man commanded a ſmall ſquadron, fitted out at his own expence, and by cruiſing ſometimes againſt the Mahometans, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt the Venetians, the rivals of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in trade, had acquired both wealth and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

In this dreadful extremity his intrepidity and preſence of mind did not forſake him. He threw himſelf into the ſea, laid hold of a floating oar, and by the ſupport of it, and his dexterity in ſwimming, he reached the ſhore, though above two leagues diſtant, and ſaved a life reſerved for great undertakings<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. v.</note>.</p>

To every adventurer, animated either with curioſity to viſit new countries, or with ambition to diſtinguiſh himſelf, the Portugueſe ſervice was at that time extremely inviting. Columbus liſtened with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ear to the advice of his friends, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gained the eſteem of a Portugueſe lady, whom he married, fixed his reſidence in Liſbon. This alliance, inſtead of detaching him from a ſea-faring life, contributed to enlarge the ſphere of his naval knowledge, and to excite a deſire of extending it ſtill farther. His wife was a daughter of Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew Pereſtrello, one of the captains employed by prince Henry in his early navigations, and who, under his protection, had diſcovered and planted the iſlands of Porto Santo and Maderia. Columbus got poſſeſſion of the journals and charts of this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced navigator, and from them he learned the courſe which the Portugueſe had held in making their diſcoveries, as well as the various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which guided or encouraged them in their attempts. The ſtudy of theſe ſoothed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed his favourite paſſion; and while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the maps, and read the deſcriptions of the new countries which Pereſtrello had ſeen, his impatience to viſit them became irreſiſtible. In order to indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira, and continued during ſeveral years to trade with that iſland, with the Canaries, the Azores, the ſettlements in Guinea, and all the other places which the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe had diſcovered on the continent of Africa.<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. iv. v.</note>

But, not ſatisfied with that praiſe, his ambition aimed at ſomething more. The ſucceſsful progreſs of the Portugueſe navigators had awakened a ſpirit of curioſity and emulation, which ſet every man of ſcience upon examining all the circumſtances that led to the diſcoveries which they had made, or that afforded a proſpect of ſucceeding in any new and bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus, naturally inquiſitive, capable of deep reflection, and turned to ſpeculations of this kind, was ſo often employed in revolving the principles upon which the Portugueſe had founded their ſchemes of diſcovery, and the mode on which they had carried them on, that he gradually began to form an idea of improving upon their plan, and of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing diſcoveries which hitherto they had attempted in vain.</p>
                  <p>TO find out a paſſage by ſea to the Eaſt Indies,<note place="margin">He forms the idea of a new courſe to India.</note> was the great object in view at that period. From the time that the Portugueſe doubled Cape de Verd, this was the point at which they aimed in all their navigations, and, in compariſon with it, all their diſcoveries in Africa appeared inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. The fertility and riches of India had been known for many ages; its ſpices and other valuable commodities were in high requeſt throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and the vaſt wealth of the Venetians ariſing from their having engroſſed this trade, had raiſed the envy of all nations. But how intent ſoever the Portugueſe were upon diſcovering a new route to thoſe deſirable regions, they ſearched for it only by ſteering towards the ſouth, in hopes of arriving at India, by turning to the eaſt, after they had ſailed
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:034476_0096_0FFDD524E5A86180"/>
round the farther extremity of Africa. This courſe was ſtill unknown, and, even if diſcovered, was of ſuch immenſe length, that a voyage from Europe to India muſt have appeared, at that period, an undertaking, extremely arduous, and of very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain iſſue. More than half a century had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in advancing from Cape Non to the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; a much longer ſpace of time might elapſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more extenſive navigation from that to India could be accompliſhed. Theſe reflections upon the uncertainty, the danger and tediouſneſs of the courſe which the Portugueſe were purſuing, naturally led Columbus to conſider whether a ſhorter and more direct paſſage to the Eaſt Indies might not be found out. After revolving long and ſeriouſly every circumſtance ſuggeſted by his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior knowledge in the theory as well as practice of navigation, after comparing attentively the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of modern pilots with the hints and conjectures of ancient authors, he at laſt concluded, that by ſailing directly towards the weſt, acroſs the Atlantic ocean, new countries which probably formed a part of the great continent of India, muſt infallibly be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which his theory was founded.</note>PRINCIPLES and arguments of various kinds, and derived from different ſources, induced him to adopt this opinion, ſeemingly as chimerical as it was new and extraordinary. The ſpherical figure of the earth was known, and its magnitude aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſome degree of accuracy. From this it was evident, that the comments of Europe, Aſia, and Africa, as far as they were known at that time, formed but a ſmall portion of the terraqueous globe. It was ſuitable to our ideas concerning the wiſdom and beneficence of the Author of Nature, to believe that the vaſt ſpace ſtill unexplored, was not covered entirely by a waſte unprofitable ocean, but occupied by countries fit for the habitation of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034476_0097_0FFDD52677935B20"/>
man. It appeared likewiſe extremely probable, that the continent, on this ſide of the globe, was balanced by a proportional quantity of land in the other hemiſphere. Theſe concluſions concerning the exiſtence of another continent, drawn from the figure and ſtructure of the globe, were confirmed by the obſervations and conjectures of modern na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators. A Portugueſe pilot, having ſtretched farther to the weſt than was uſual at that time, took up a piece of timber artificially carved, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſea; and as it was driven towards him by a weſterly wind, he concluded that it came from ſome unknown land, ſituated in that quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law had found, to the weſt of the Madeira iſles, a piece of timber faſhioned in the ſame manner, and brought by the ſame wind; and had ſeen likewiſe canes of an enormous ſize floating upon the waves, which reſembled thoſe deſcribed by Ptolemy as productions peculiar to the Eaſt-Indies<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. i. c. 17.</note>. After a courſe of weſterly winds, trees, torn up by the roots, were often driven upon the coaſts of the Azores, and at one time the dead bodies of two men with ſingular features, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of Africa, were caſt aſhore there.</p>
                  <p>AS the force of this united evidence, ariſing from theoretical principles and practical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, led Columbus to expect the diſcovery of new countries in the weſtern ocean, other reaſons induced him to believe that theſe muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the continent of India. Though the ancients had hardly ever penetrated into India farther than the banks of the Ganges, yet ſome Greek authors had ventured to deſcribe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces beyond that river. As men are prone, and at liberty, to magnify what is remote or unknown,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034476_0098_0FFDD5A962E4EC20"/>
they repreſented them as regions of an immenſe extent. Cteſias affirmed that India was as large as all the reſt of Aſia. Oneſicritus, whom Pliny the naturaliſt follows<note n="*" place="bottom">Nat. Hiſt. Lib. vi. c. 17.</note>, contended that it was equal to a third part of the habitable earth. Nearchus aſſerted, that it would take four months to march in a ſtraight line from one extremity of India to the other<note n="†" place="bottom">Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1011.</note>. The journal of Marco Polo, who had proceeded towards the eaſt far beyond the limits to which any European had ever advanced, ſeemed to confirm theſe exaggerated accounts of the ancients. By his magnificent deſcriptions of the kingdoms of <hi>Cathay</hi> and <hi>Cipango,</hi> and of many other countries, the names of which were unknown in Europe, India appeared to be a region of vaſt extent. From theſe accounts, which, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, were the moſt accurate that the people of Europe had received at that period, with reſpect to the remote parts of the Eaſt, Columbus drew a juſt concluſion. He contended, that, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the continent of India ſtretched out towards the Eaſt, it muſt, in conſequence of the ſpherical figure of the earth, approach nearer to the iſlands which had lately been diſcovered to the weſt of Africa; that the diſtance from the one to the other was probably not very conſiderable; and that the moſt direct, as well as ſhorteſt courſe to the remote regions of the eaſt, was to be found by ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due weſt<note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE XII.</note>. This notion concerning the vicinity of India to the weſtern parts of our continent, was countenanced by ſome eminent writers among the ancients, the ſanction of whoſe authority was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, in that age, to procure a favourable recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any tenet. Ariſtotle thought it probable that the Columns of Hercules, or Straits of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:034476_0099_0FFDD5ABFA6F1B40"/>
were not far removed from the Eaſt Indies, and that there might be a communication by ſea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them<note n="*" place="bottom">Ariſtot. de Coelo, lib. ii. c. 14. edit. Du Val, Par. 1629. vol. i. p. 472.</note>. Seneca, in terms ſtill more explicit, affirms, that, with a fair wind, one might ſail from Spain to India, in a few days<note n="†" place="bottom">Senec.

The famous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic iſland deſcribed by Plato, and ſuppoſed by many to be a real country, beyond which an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known continent was ſituated, is repreſented by him as lying at no great diſtance from Spain. After weighing all theſe particulars, Columbus, in whoſe character the modeſty and diffidence of true genius was united with the ardent enthuſiaſm of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, did not reſt with ſuch abſolute aſſurance either upon his own arguments, or upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ancients, as not to conſult ſuch of his contemporaries as were capable of comprehending the nature of the evidence which he produced in ſupport of his opinion. As early as the year one thouſand four hundred and ſeventy-four, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated his ideas concerning the probability of diſcovering new countries, by ſailing weſtwards, to Paul, a phyſician of Florence, eminent for his knowledge of coſmography, and who, from the learning as well as candour which he diſcovers in his reply, appears to have been well entitled to the confidence which Columbus placed in him. He warmly approved of the plan, ſuggeſted ſeveral facts in confirmation of it, and encouraged Columbus to perſevere in an undertaking ſo laudable, and which muſt redound ſo much to the honour of his country, and the benefit of Europe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. viii.</note>.</p>

had been long eſtabliſhed, and whom he conſidered, on that account, as having the ſecond claim to his ſervice. Here every circumſtance ſeemed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him a more favourable reception. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a monarch of an enterpriſing genius, no incompetent judge in naval affairs, and proud of patroniſing every attempt to diſcover new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. His ſubjects were the moſt experienced navigators in Europe, and the leaſt apt to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated either by the novelty or boldneſs of any maritime expedition. In Portugal, the profeſſional ſkill of Columbus, as well as his perſonal good qualities, were thoroughly known; and as the former rendered it probable that his ſcheme was not altogether viſionary, the latter exempted him from the ſuſpicion of any ſiniſter intention in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it. Accordingly, the king liſtened to him in the moſt gracious manner, and referred the conſideration of his plan to Diego Ortiz, biſhop of Ceuta, and two Jewiſh phyſicians, eminent coſmographers, whom he was accuſtomed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult in matters of this kind.

                  <p>IT was not without reaſon that Columbus enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained doubts and fears with reſpect to the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his propoſals in the Spaniſh court.<note place="margin">Obſtacles to his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Spain.</note> Spain was, at that juncture, engaged in a dangerous war with Grenada, the laſt of the Mooriſh kingdoms in that country. The wary and ſuſpicious temper of Ferdinand was not formed to reliſh bold or uncommon deſigns. Iſabella, though more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and enterpriſing, was under the influence of her huſband in all her actions. The Spaniards had hitherto made no efforts to extend navigation beyond its ancient limits, and had beheld the amazing progreſs of diſcovery among their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the Portugueſe, without one attempt to imitate or to rival them. The war with the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels afforded an ample field to the national activity and love of glory.

His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, however, was admirably adapted to that of the people, whoſe confidence and protection he ſolicited. He was grave, though courteous in his deportment; circumſpect in his words and actions; irreproachable in his morals; and exemplary in his attention to all the duties and functions of religion. By qualities ſo reſpectable, he not only gained many private friends, but acquired ſuch general eſteem, that, notwithſtanding the plainneſs of his appearance, ſuitable to the mediocrity of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he was not conſidered as a mere adventurer, to whom indigence had ſuggeſted a viſionary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but was received as a perſon to whoſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions ſerious attention was due.</p>

much regard to Columbus, as to remit the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his plan to the queen's confeſſor, Ferdinand de Talavera. He conſulted ſuch of his countrymen as were ſuppoſed beſt qualified to decide with reſpect to a ſubject of this kind. But true ſcience had, hitherto, made ſo little progreſs in Spain, that the pretended philoſophers, ſelected to judge in a matter of ſuch moment, did not comprehend the firſt principles upon which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus founded his conjectures and hopes. Some of them, from miſtaken notions concerning the dimenſions of the globe, contended that a voyage to thoſe remote parts of the eaſt, which Columbus expected to diſcover, could not be performed in leſs than three years. Others concluded, that either he would find the ocean to be of infinite extent, according to the opinion of ſome ancient philoſophers; or, if he ſhould perſiſt in ſteering towards the weſt beyond a certain point, that the convex figure of the globe would prevent his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and that he muſt inevitably periſh, in the vain attempt to open a communication between the two oppoſite hemiſpheres, which nature had for ever disjoined. Even without deigning to enter into any particular diſcuſſion, many rejected the ſcheme in general, upon the credit of a maxim, under which the ignorant and unenterpriſing ſhelter themſelves in every age, "That it is preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any perſon, to ſuppoſe that he alone poſſeſſes knowledge ſuperior to all the reſt of mankind united." They maintained, that if there were really any ſuch countries as Columbus pretended, they could not have remained ſo long concealed, nor would the wiſdom and ſagacity of former ages have left the glory of this invention to an obſcure Genoeſe pilot.</p>

ſtrange propoſitions. He had to contend not only with the obſtinacy of ignorance, but with what is ſtill more attractable, the pride of falſe knowledge. After innumerable conferences, and waſting five years in fruitleſs endeavours to inform and to ſatisfy judges ſo little capable of deciding with propriety, Talavera, at laſt, made ſuch an unfavourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to Ferdinand and Iſabella, as induced them to acquaint Columbus, that until the war with the Moors ſhould be brought to a period, it would be imprudent to engage in any new and extenſive enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER care was taken to ſoften the harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſh of this declaration, Columbus conſidered it as a final rejection of his propoſals. But happily for mankind, that ſuperiority of genius, which is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of forming great and uncommon deſigns, is uſually accompanied with an ardent enthuſiaſm, which can neither be cooled by delays, nor damped by diſappointment. Columbus was of this ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine temper. Though he felt deeply the cruel blow given to his hopes, and retired immediately from a court, where he had been amuſed ſo long with vain expectations, his confidence in the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his own ſyſtem did not diminiſh, and his impatience to demonſtrate the truth of it by an actual experiment, became greater than ever. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing courted the protection of ſovereign ſtates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceſs, he applied, next, to perſons of inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or rank, and addreſſed ſucceſſively the dukes of Medina, Sidonia, and Medina Celi, who, though ſubjects, were poſſeſſed of power and opulence more than equal to to the enterpriſe which he projected. His negociations with them proved as fruitleſs, as thoſe in which he had been hitherto engaged; for theſe noblemen were either as little convinced by Columbus's arguments as their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, or they were afraid of alarming the jealouſy,

To their aſtoniſhment, Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus appeared before them with the ſame confident hopes of ſucceſs as formerly, and inſiſted upon the ſame high recompence. He propoſed that a ſmall fleet ſhould be fitted out, under his command, to attempt the diſcovery, and demanded to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hereditary admiral and viceroy of all the ſeas and lands which he ſhould diſcover, and to have the tenths of the profits ariſing from them, ſettled irrevocably upon himſelf and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants.

The negociation now went forward with facility and diſpatch, and a treaty or capitulation with Columbus was ſigned on the ſeventeenth of April, one thouſand four hundred and ninety-two. The chief articles of it were, 1. Ferdinand and Iſabella as ſovereigns of the ocean, conſtituted Columbus their high admiral in all the ſeas, iſlands, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents which ſhould be diſcovered by his induſtry; and ſtipulation that he and his heirs for ever ſhould enjoy this office, with the ſame powers and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives which belonged to the high admiral of Caſtile, within the limits of his juriſdiction. 2. They
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:034476_0112_0FFDD5CE2590A748"/>
appointed Columbus their viceroy in all the iſlands and continents which he ſhould diſcover; but if, for the better adminiſtration of affairs, it ſhould hereafter be neceſſary to eſtabliſh a ſeparate go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor in any of thoſe countries, they authoriſed Columbus to name three perſons, of whom they would chooſe one for that office; and the dignity of viceroy, with all its immunities, was likewiſe to be hereditary in the family of Columbus. 3. They granted to Columbus and his heirs for ever, the tenth of the free profits accruing from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions and commerce of the countries which he ſhould diſcover. 4. They declared, that if any controverſy or law-ſuit ſhall ariſe with reſpect to any mercantile tranſaction in the countries which ſhould be diſcovered, it ſhould be determined by the ſole authority of Columbus, or of judges to be appointed by him. 5. They permitted Columbus to advance one eighth part of what ſhould be expended in preparing for the expedition, and in carrying on commerce with the countries which he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and intitled him, in return, to an eighth part of the profit <note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 15.

                  <p>THOUGH the name of Ferdinand appears con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined with that of Iſabella in this tranſaction, his diſtruſt of Columbus was ſtill ſo violent that he refuſed to take any part in the enterpriſe as king of Aragon.

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:034476_0113_0FFDD5D2C73E0CB8"/>
reparation to Columbus for the time which he had loſt in fruitleſs ſolicitation. By the twelfth of May, all that depended upon her was adjuſted; and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus waited on the king and queen, in order to receive their final inſtructions. Every thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the deſtination and conduct of the voyage, they committed implicitly to the diſpoſal of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But that they might avoid giving any juſt cauſe of offence to the king of Portugal, they ſtrictly enjoined him not to approach near to the Portugueſe ſettlements on the coaſt of Guinea, or in any of the other countries to which the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe claimed right as diſcoverers. Iſabella had ordered the ſhips, of which Columbus was to take the command, to be fitted out in the port of Palos, a ſmall maritime town in the Province of Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſia. As the guardian Juan Perez, to whom Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus had already been ſo much indebted, reſided in the neighbourhood of this place, he, is by the influence of that good eccleſiaſtic, as well by his own connection with the inhabitants, not only raiſed among them what he wanted of the ſum that he was bound by treaty to advance, but engaged ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of them to accompany him in the voyage. The chief of theſe aſſociates were three brothers of the name of Pinzon, of conſiderable wealth, and of great experience in naval affairs, who were willing to hazard their lives and fortunes in the expedition.</p>
                  <p>BUT, after all the efforts of Iſabella and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, the armament was not ſuitable, either to the dignity of the nation by which it was equipped, or to the importance of the ſervice for which it was deſtined. It conſiſted of three veſſels. The largeſt, a ſhip of no conſiderable burden, was commanded by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> out of reſpect for the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whom he honoured with ſingular devotion.
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:034476_0114_0FFDD5D4586AEA60"/>
Of the ſecond, called the <hi>Pinta,</hi> Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis, pilot. The third, named the <hi>Nigna,</hi> was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. Theſe two were light veſſels, hardly ſuperior in burden or force to large boats. This ſquadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for twelve months, and had on board ninety men, moſtly ſailors, together with a few adventurers who followed the fortune of Columbus, and ſome gentlemen of Iſabella's court, whom ſhe appointed to accompany him. Though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the undertaking was one of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded ſo long the negociation with Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, the ſum employed in ſitting out this ſquad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron did not exceed four thouſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>AS the art of ſhip-building in the fifteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury was extremely rude, and the bulk of veſſels was accommodated to the ſhort and eaſy voyages along the coaſt which they were accuſtomed to perform, it is a proof of the courage as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing genius of Columbus, that he ventured, with a fleet ſo unfit for a diſtant navigation, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore unknown ſeas, where he had no chart to guide him, no knowledge of the tides and currents, and no experience of the dangers to which he might be expoſed. His eagerneſs to accompliſh the great deſign which had ſo long engroſſed his thoughts, made him overlook or diſregard every circumſtance that would have intimidated a mind leſs adventurous. He puſhed forward the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations with ſuch ardour, and was ſeconded ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually by the perſons to whom Iſabella committed the ſuperintendance of this buſineſs, that every thing was ſoon in readineſs for the voyage. But as Columbus was deeply impreſſed with ſentiments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſeas. The firſt day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the ſecond, he loſt ſight of the Canaries; and many of the ſailors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected already and diſmayed, when they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated the boldneſs of the undertaking, began to beat their breaſts, and to ſhed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with aſſurances of ſucceſs, and the proſpect of vaſt wealth, in thoſe opulent regions whither he was conducting them. This early diſcovery of the ſpirit of his follower, taught Columbus, that he muſt prepare to ſhuggle, not only with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable difficulties which might be expected from the nature of his undertaking, but with ſuch as were likely to ariſe from the ignorance and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of the people under his command; and he perceived that the art of governing the minds of men, would be no leſs reqiuſite for accompliſhing the diſcoveries which he had in view, than naval ſkill and undaunted courage. Happily for himſelf, and for the country by which he was employed, he joined to the ardent temper and inventive genius of a projector, virtues of another ſpecies, which are rarely united with them. He poſſeſſed a thorough knowledge of mankind, an inſinuating addreſs, a patient perſeverance in executing any plan, the perfect government of his own paſſions, and the talent of acquiring an aſcendant over thoſe of other men. All theſe qualities, which formed him for command, were accompanied with that ſuperior knowledge of his profeſſion, which begets confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in times of difficulty and danger.<note place="margin">Vigilance and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

As ſoon as they put to ſea, he regulated every thing by his
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034476_0117_0FFDD5DB2AD4C478"/>
ſole authority; he ſuperintended the execution of every order; and allowing himſelf only a few hours for ſleep, he was at all other times upon deck. As his courſe lay through ſeas which had not formerly been viſited, the founding-line, or inſtruments for obſervation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portugueſe diſcoverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watching the flight of birds, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of fiſhes, of ſea-weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered every occurrence, with a minute exactneſs, in the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not fail of alarming ſailors habituated only to ſhort excurſions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progreſs which they made. With this view, though they run eighteen leagues on the ſecond day after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only fifteen, and he uniformly employed the ſame artifice of reckoning ſhort during the whole voyage. By the fourteenth of September, the fleet was above two hundred leagues to the weſt of the Canary Iſles, at a greater diſtance from land than any Spaniard had been before that time.<note place="margin">

They obſerved that the magnetic needle, in their compaſſes, did not point exactly to the polar ſtar, but varied towards the weſt; and as they proceeded, this variation increaſed. This appearance, which is now familiar, though it ſtill remains one of the myſteries of nature, into the cauſe of which the ſagacity of man hath not been able to penetrate, filled the companions of Columbus with terror. They were now in a boundleſs and unknown ocean, far from the uſual courſe of navigation; nature itſelf ſeemed to be altered, and the only guide which they had le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with no leſs quickneſs than ingenuity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a reaſon for this appearance, which, though it did not ſatisfy himſelf, ſeemed ſo plauſible to them, that it diſpelled their fears, or ſilenced their murmurs.</p>
                  <p>HE ſtill continued to ſteer due weſt, nearly in the ſame latitude with the Canary iſlands. In this courſe he came within the ſphere of the trade wind, which blows ivariably from eaſt to weſt, between the tropics and a few degrees beyond them. He advanced before this ſteady gale with ſuch uniform rapidity, that it was ſeldom neceſſary to ſhift a ſail. When about four hundred leagues to the weſt of the Canaries, he found the ſea ſo covered with weeds, that it reſembled a meadow of vaſt extent, and in ſome places they were ſo thick, as to retard the motion of the veſſels. This ſtrange appearance occaſioned new alarm and diſquiet. The ſailors imagined that they were now arrived at the utmoſt boundary of the navigable ocean; that theſe float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weeds would obſtruct their farther progreſs, and conceal dangerous rocks, or ſome large tract of land, which had ſunk, they knew not how, in that place. Columbus endeavoured to perſuade them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be conſidered as a ſign of approaching land.

They had now been above three weeks at ſea; they had proceeded far beyond what former navigators had attempted or deemed poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; all their prognoſtics of diſcovery, drawn from the flight of birds and other circumſtances, had proved fallacious; the appearances of land, with which their own credulity or the artifice of their commander had from time to time flattered and amuſed them, had been altogether illuſive, and their proſpect of ſucceſs ſeemed now to be as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as ever. Theſe reflections occurred often to men, who had no other object or occupation than to reaſon and diſcourſe concerning the intention and circumſtances of their expedition. They made impreſſion, at firſt, upon the ignorant and timid, and extending, by degrees, to ſuch as were better informed or more reſolute, the contagion ſpread at length from ſhip to ſhip. From ſecret whiſpers or murmurings, they proceeded to open cabals and public complaints. They taxed their ſovereign with inconſiderate credulity, in paying ſuch regard to the vain promiſes and raſh conjectures of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent foreigner, as to hazard the lives of ſo many of her own ſubjects, in proſecuting a chimerical ſcheme. They affirmed that they had fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their duty, by venturing ſo far in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and hopeleſs courſe, and could incur no blame, for refuſing to follow, any longer, a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate adventurer to certain deſtruction. They contended, that it was neceſſary to think of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Spain, while their crazy veſſels were ſtill in a condition to keep the ſea, but expreſſed their fears that the attempt would prove vain, as the

All agreed that Columbus ſhould be compelled by force to adopt a meaſure on which their common ſafety depended. Some of the more audacious propoſed, as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditious and certain method for getting rid at once of his remonſtrances, to throw him into the ſea, being perſuaded that, upon their return to Spain, the death of an unſucceſsful projector would excite little concern, and be enquired into with no curioſity.</p>

For ſome days the ſounding line reached the bottom, and the ſoil which it brought up indicated land to be at no great diſtance. The flocks of birds increaſed, and were compoſed not only of ſea fowl, but of ſuch land birds as could not be ſuppoſed to fly far from the ſhore. The crew of the Pinta obſerved a cane floating, which ſeemed to have been newly cut, and likewiſe a piece of timber artificially carved. The ſailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree with red berries, perfectly freſh. The clouds around the ſetting ſun aſſumed a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; the air was more mild and warm, and, during night, the wind became unequal and varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

ſcene now before them. Every herb, and ſhrub, and tree, was different from thoſe which flouriſhed in Europe. The ſoil ſeemed to be rich, but bore few marks of cultivation. The climate, even to the Spaniards, felt warm, though extremely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. The inhabitants appeared in the ſimple innocence of nature, entirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or was bound in treſſes around their heads. They had no beards, and every part of their bodies was perfectly ſmooth. Their complexion was of a duſky copper colour, their features ſingular, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than diſagreeable, their aſpect gentle and timid. Though not tall, they were well ſhaped, and active. Their faces, and ſeveral parts of their body, were fantaſtically painted with glaring co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. They were ſhy at firſt through fear, but ſoon became familiar with the Spaniards, and with tranſports of joy received from them hawks-bells, glaſs beads, or other baubles, in return for which they gave ſuch proviſions as they had, and ſome cotton yarn, the only commodity of value that they could produce. Towards evening, Columbus returned to his ſhip, accompanied by many of the iſlanders in their boats, which they called <hi>canoes,</hi> and though rudely formed out of the trunk of a ſingle tree, they rowed them with ſurpriſing dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.

He inquired every where for gold, and the ſigns that were uniformly made by way of anſwer, confirmed him in the opinion that it was brought from the ſouth. He followed that courſe, and ſoon diſcovered a country which appeared very extenſive, not perfectly level, like thoſe which he had already viſited, but ſo diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with riſing grounds, hills, rivers, woods, and plains, that he was uncertain whether it might prove an iſland, or part of the continent.

                  <p>COLUMBUS, retarded by contrary winds,<note place="margin">Diſcovers the iſland Hiſpaniola.</note> did not reach Hayti till the ſixth of December.

As he could neither meet with the Pinta, nor have any intercourſe with the inhabitants, who fled in great conſternation towards the woods, he ſoon quitted St. Nicholas, and ſailing along the northern coaſt of the iſland, he entered another harbour, which he called Conception.

The deſcription which ſhe gave to her countrymen of the humanity and wonderful qualities of the ſtrangers; their admiration of the trinkets, which ſhe ſhewed with exultation; and their eagerneſs to participate of the ſame favours; removed all their fears, and induced many of them to repair to the harbour.

They poſſeſſed gold in greater abundance than their neighbours, which they readily exchanged for bells, beads or pins; and in this unequal traffic both parties were highly pleaſed, each conſidering themſelves as gainers by the tranſaction. Here Columbus was viſited by a prince or <hi>cazique</hi> of the country.

but, inſtead of obeying, they made off towards the Nigna, which was about half a league diſtant. He then commanded the maſts to be cut down, in order to lighten the ſhip; but all his endeavours were too late; the veſſel opened near the keel, and filled ſo faſt with water that its loſs was inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. The ſmoothneſs of the ſea, and the timely aſſiſtance of boats from the Nigna, enabled the crew to ſave their lives. As ſoon as the iſlanders heard of this diſaſter, they crowded to the ſhore, with their prince Guacanahari at their head.

Each of thoſe circumſtances was alarming, and filled the mind of Columbus with the utmoſt ſolicitude.

ſome curioſity to know the cauſe which had moved the iſlanders to fly with ſuch precipitation upon the approach of his ſhips; the cazique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that the country was much infeſted by the incurſions of certain people, whom he called Carribeans, who inhabited ſeveral iſlands to the ſouth eaſt. Theſe he deſcribed as a fierce and warlike race of men, who delighted in blood, and devoured the fleſh of the priſoners who were ſo unhappy as to fall into their hands; and as the Spaniards, at their firſt appearance, were ſuppoſed to be Carribeans, whom the natives, however nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, durſt not face in battle, they had recourſe to their uſual method of ſecuring their ſafety, by flying into the thickeſt and moſt impenetrable woods.

The ground was marked out for a ſmall ſort, which Columbus called Navidad, becauſe he had landed there on Chriſtmas day. A deep ditch was drawn around it. The ramparts were fortified with palliſades,

and the great guns, ſaved out of the admiral's ſhip, were planted upon them. In ten days the work was finiſhed, that ſimple race of men labouring with inconſiderate aſſiduity in erecting this firſt monument of their own ſervitude. During this time, Columbus, by his careſſes and liberality, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to increaſe the high opinion which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives entertained of the Spaniards. But while he endeavoured to inſpire them with confidence in their diſpoſition to do good, he wiſhed likewiſe to give them ſome ſtriking idea of their power to puniſh and deſtroy ſuch as were the objects of their indignation. With this view, in preſence of a vaſt aſſembly, he drew up his men in order of battle, and made an oſtentatious but innocent diſplay of the ſharpneſs of the Spaniſh ſwords, of the force of their ſpears, and the operation of their croſs-bows. Theſe rude people, ſtrangers to the uſe of iron, and unacquainted with any hoſtile weapons, but arrows of reeds pointed with the bones of fiſhes, wooden ſwords and javelins hardened in the fire, wondered and trembled. Before this ſurpriſe or fear had time to abate, he ordered the great guns to be fired. The ſudden exploſion ſtruck them with ſuch terror that they fell flat to the ground, covering their faces with their hands; and when they beheld the aſtoniſhing effect of the bullets among the trees, towards which the cannon had been pointed, they concluded that it was impoſſible to reſiſt men, who had the command of ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive inſtruments, and who came armed with thunder and lightning againſt their enemies.</p>

He promiſed to reviſit them ſoon, with ſuch a reinforcement of ſtrength as might enable them to take full poſſeſſion of the country, and to reap all the fruits of their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. In the mean time, he engaged to mention their names to the king and queen, and to place their merit and ſervices in the moſt advantageous light<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo ap Ramuſio, iii. p. 82, E.

                  <p>HAVING thus taken every precaution for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the Colony, he left Navidad on the fourth of January,<note place="margin">1493.</note> one thouſand four hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three, and ſteering towards the eaſt, diſcovered, and gave names to moſt of the harbours on the northern coaſt of the iſland. On the ſixth, he deſcried the Pinta, and ſoon came up with her, after a ſeparation of more than ſix weeks. Pinzon endeavoured to juſtify his conduct, by pretending that he had been driven from his courſe by ſtreſs of weather, and prevented from returning by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds. The admiral, though he ſtill ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected his perfidious intentions, and knew well what he urged in his own defence to be frivolous as well as falſe, was ſo ſenſible that this was not a proper time for venturing upon any high ſtrain of
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:034476_0137_0FFDD6121B530690"/>
authority, and felt ſuch ſatisfaction in this junction with his conſort, which delivered him from many diſquieting apprehenſions, that lame as Pinzon's apology was, he admitted of it without difficulty and reſtored him to favour. During his abſence from the admiral, Pinzon had viſited ſeveral har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in the iſland, had acquired ſome gold by trafficking with the natives, but had made no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of any importance.</p>
                  <p>FROM the condition of his ſhips,<note place="margin">Reſolves to return to Europe.</note> as well as the temper of his men, Columbus now found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to haſten his return to Europe. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, having ſuffered much during a voyage of ſuch an unuſual length, were extremely leaky. The latter expreſſed the utmoſt impatience to reviſit their native country, from which they had been ſo long abſent, and where they had things ſo wonderful and unheard of to relate. Accordingly, on the ſixteenth of January, he directed his courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the north-eaſt, and ſoon loſt ſight of land. He had on board ſome of the natives, whom he had taken from the different iſlands which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; and beſides the gold, which was the chief object of reſearch, he had collected ſpecimens of all the productions which were likely to become ſubjects of commerce in the ſeveral countries, as well as many unknown birds, and other natural curioſities, which might attract the attention of the learned, or excite the wonder of the people. The voyage was proſperous to the fourteenth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and he had advanced near five hundred leagues acroſs the Atlantic Ocean,<note place="margin">A violent ſtorm ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> when the wind began to riſe, and continued to blow with increaſing rage, which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every thing that the naval ſkill and experience of Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus could deviſe was employed, in order to ſave the ſhips. But it was impoſſible to withſtand the violence of the ſtorm, and, as they were ſtill far

from any land, deſtruction ſeemed inevitable. The ſailors had recourſe to prayers to Almighty God, to the invocation of ſaints, to vows and charms, to every thing that religion dictates, or ſuperſtition ſuggeſts, to the affrighted mind of man. No proſpect of deliverance appearing, they abandoned themſelves to deſpair, and expected every moment to be ſwallowed up in the waves. Beſides the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which naturally agitate and alarm the human mind in ſuch awful ſituations, when certain death, in one of his moſt terrible forms, is before it, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus had to endure feelings of diſtreſs peculiar to himſelf.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Columbus.</note> He dreaded that all knowledge of the amazing diſcoveries which he had made was now to periſh; mankind were to be deprived of every benefit that might have been derived from the happy ſucceſs of his ſchemes, and his own name would deſcend to poſterity as that of a raſh deluded adventurer, inſtead of being tranſmitted with the honor due to the author and conductor of the moſt noble enterprize that had ever been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Theſe reflections extinguiſhed all ſenſe of his own perſonal danger. Leſs affected with the loſs of life, than ſolicitous to preſerve the memory of what he had attempted and atchieved, he retired to his cabin, and wrote upon parchment, a ſhort account of the voyage which he had made, of the courſe which he had taken, of the ſituation and riches of the countries which he had diſcovered, and of the colony that he had left there. Having wrapped up this in an oiled cloth, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a cake of wax, he put it into a caſk care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtopped up, and threw it into the ſea, in hopes that ſome fortunate accident might preſerve a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit of ſo much importance to the world<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 37.

                  <p>IN order to prevent this,<note place="margin">Feb. 24. Arrives at Liſbon.</note> he left the Azores as ſoon as the weather would permit.

As ſoon as the ſhip was diſcovered approaching the port, all the inhabitants of Palos ran eagerly to the ſhore, in order to welcome their relations and fellow-citizens, and to hear tidings of their voyage. When the proſperous iſſue of it was known, when they beheld the ſtrange people, the unknown animals, and ſingular productions brought from the countries which had been diſcovered, the effuſions of joy was general and unbounded.

Columbus adhered tenaciouſly to his original opinion, that they ſhould be reckoned a part of thoſe vaſt regions in Aſia, comprehended under the general name of India. This ſentiment was confirmed by the obſervations which he made concerning the productions of the countries he had diſcovered. Gold was known to abound in India, and he had met with ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing ſamples of it in the iſlands which he viſited, as led him to believe that rich mines of it might be found.

The Pope, as the vicar and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Jeſus Chriſt, was ſuppoſed to have a right of dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth. Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every crime which diſgraces humanity, filled the papal throne at that time. As he was born Ferdinand's ſubject, and very ſolicitous to ſecure the protection of Spain, in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious ſchemes in favour of his own family, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely willing to gratify the Spaniſh monarchs. By an act of liberality which coſt him nothing, and that ſerved to eſtabliſh the juriſdiction and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the papal ſee, he granted in full right to Ferdinand and Iſabella all the countries inhabited by Infidels, which they had diſcovered, or ſhould diſcover; and, in virtue of that power which he derived from Jeſus Chriſt, he conferred on the crown of Caſtile vaſt regions, to the poſſeſſion of which he himſelf was ſo far from having any title, that he was unacquainted with their ſituation,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:034476_0146_0FFDD628BA9EA338"/>
and ignorant even of their exiſtence. As it was neceſſary to prevent this grant from interfering with that formerly made to the crown of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, he appointed that a line, ſuppoſed to be drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues to the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Azores, ſhould ſerve as a limit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and in the plenitude of his power, beſtowed all to the eaſt of this imaginary line upon the Portugueſe, and all to the weſt of it, upon the Spaniards<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 4.

In order to manifeſt ſome concern for this laudable object, ſeveral friars, under the direction of Father Boyl, a Catalonian monk of great reputation, as apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical vicar, were appointed to accompany Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, and to devote themſelves to the inſtruction of the natives. The Indians, whom Columbus had brought along with him, having received ſome tincture of Chriſtian knowledge, were baptized with much ſolemnity, the king himſelf, the prince his ſon, and the chief perſons of his court, ſtanding as their godfathers.

By the enervating influence of a hot climate, the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity of the Spaniards ſeemed to increaſe. Many of them were gentlemen, unaccuſtomed to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of bodily labour, and all had engaged in the enterpriſe with the ſanguine hopes excited by the ſplendid and exaggerated deſcription of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen who returned from the firſt voyage, or by the miſtaken opinion of Columbus, that the country which he had diſcovered was either the Cipango of Marco Polo, or the Ophir<note n="†" place="bottom">P.

he diſplayed all the pomp of military magnificence that he could exhibit, in order to ſtrike the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the natives. He marched with colours flying, with martial muſic, and with a ſmall body of cavalry that paraded ſometimes in the front, and ſometimes in the rear. As thoſe were the firſt horſes which appeared in the New World, they were objects of terror no leſs than of admiration to the Indians, who having no tame animals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were unacquainted with that vaſt acceſſion of power, which man hath acquired by ſubjecting them to his dominion.

and the rider formed one animal, with whoſe ſpeed they were aſtoniſhed, and whoſe impetuoſity and ſtrength they conſidered as irreſiſtible. But while Columbus endeavoured to inſpire the natives with a dread of his power, he did not neglect the arts of gaining their love and confidence. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered ſcrupulouſly to the principles of integrity and juſtice in all his tranſactions with them, and treated them on every occaſion, not only with humanity, but with indulgence. The diſtrict of Cibao an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the deſcription given of it by the natives. It was mountainous and uncultivated, but in every river and brook gold was gathered either in duſt or in grains, ſome of which were of conſiderable ſize. The Indians had never opened any mines in ſearch of gold. To penetrate into the bowels of the earth, and to refine the rude ore, were opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too complicated and laborious for their talents and induſtry, and they had no ſuch high value for gold as to put their ingenuity and invention upon the ſtretch in order to obtain it<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. ii. p. 90.

The ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of that precious metal which they poſſeſſed, was either picked up in the beds of the rivers, or waſhed from the mountains by the heavy rains that fall within the tropics.

In order to ſecure the command of this valuable province, Columbus erected a ſmall fort to which he gave the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridicule upon ſome of his incredulous followers, who would not believe that the country produced gold, until they ſaw it with their own eyes, and touched it with their hands<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 12.

On all theſe accounts, they became afraid of periſhing with hunger, and were reduced already to a ſcanty allowance. At the ſame time, the diſeaſes predominant in the torrid zone, and which rage chiefly in thoſe uncultivated countries, where the hand of induſtry has not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the woods, drained the marſhes, and confined the rivers within a certain channel, began to ſpread among them.

Though the number of thoſe ſtrangers was inconſiderable, the ſtate of cultivation among this rude people was ſo imperfect, and in ſuch exact proportion to their own conſumption, that it was with difficulty they could afford ſubſiſtence to their new gueſts. Their own mode of life was ſo indolent and inactive, the warmth of the climate ſo enervating, the conſtitution of their bodies naturally ſo feeble, and ſo unaccuſtomed to the laborious exertions of induſtry, that they were ſatisfied with a proportion of food amazingly ſmall. A handful of maize, or a little of the inſipid bread made of the caſſada-root, was ſufficient to ſupport men, whoſe ſtrength and ſpirits were not exhauſted by any vigorous efforts either of body or mind. The Spaniards, though the moſt abſtemious of all the European nations, appeared to them exceſſively voracious. One Spaniard conſumed as much as ſeveral Indians. This keenneſs of appetite ſurpriſed them ſo much, and ſeemed to be ſo infatiable, that they ſuppoſed the Spaniards had left their own country, becauſe it did not produce as much as was requiſite to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their immoderate deſire of food, and had come among them in queſt of nouriſhment<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 17.</note>.

Inflamed by the unprovoked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree of rage of which their gentle natures, formed to ſuffer and ſubmit, ſeemed hardly ſuſceptible, they waited only for a ſignal from their leaders to fall upon the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. Some of the caziques had already ſurpriſed and cut off ſeveral ſtragglers. The dread of this impending danger united the Spaniards, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed the authority of Columbus, as they ſaw no proſpect of ſafety but in committing themſelves to his prudent guidance. It was now neceſſary to have recourſe to arms, the employing of which againſt the Indians, Columbus had hitherto avoided with the greateſt ſolicitude. Unequal as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict may ſeem, between the naked inhabitants of the New World, armed with clubs, ſticks hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in the fire, wooden ſwords, and arrows pointed with bones or flints; and troops accuſtomed to the diſcipline, and provided with the inſtruments of deſtruction known in the European art of war, the ſituation of the Spaniards was far from being exempt from danger. The vaſt ſuperiority of the natives in number, compenſated many defects. An hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men was about to encounter a whole nation. One adverſe event, or even any unforeſeen delay in determining the fate of the war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards. Conſcious that ſucceſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the vigour and rapidity of his operations, Columbus inſtantly aſſembled his forces. They were reduced to a very ſmall number.

The conſternation with which the Indians were filled by the noiſe and havock made by the fire-arms, by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous force of the cavalry, and the fierce onſet of the dogs, was ſo great, that they threw down their weapons, and fled without attempting reſiſtance.

Such an impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was extremely contrary to thoſe maxims which Columbus had hitherto inculcated, with reſpect to the mode of treating them.

Several unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable accounts of his conduct, as well as of the countries diſcovered by him, had been tranſmitted to Spain.

They formed a ſcheme of ſtarving thoſe oppreſſors whom they durſt not attempt to expel; and from the opinion which they entertained with reſpect to the vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious appetite of the Spaniards, they concluded the execution of it to be very practicable. With this view they ſuſpended all the operations of agriculture; they ſowed no maize, they pulled up the roots of the manioc or caſſada which were planted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to the moſt inacceſſible parts of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, left the uncultivated plains to their enemies.

By liſtening with eagerneſs to every accuſation againſt Columbus, and encouraging not only the malcontent Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, but even the Indians, to produce their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, real or imaginary, he fomented the ſpirit of diſſenſion in the iſland, without eſtabliſhing any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of public utility, or that tended to redreſs the many wrongs, with the odium of which he wiſhed to load the admiral's adminiſtration. As Columbus felt ſenſibly how humiliating his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be, if he ſhould remain in the country while ſuch a partial inſpector obſerved his motions, and controlled his juriſdiction, he took the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of returning to Spain,<note place="margin">1496.</note> in order to lay a full account of all his tranſactions, particularly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the points in diſpute between him and his adverſaries, before Ferdinand and Iſabella, from whoſe juſtice and diſcernment he expected an equal and a favourable deciſion. He committed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of affairs, during his abſence, to Don Bartholomew his brother, with the title of Adelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado, or Lieutenant Governor.

the more certain and expeditious method of ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the north, in order to fall in with the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt winds. By this ill-adviſed choice, which, in the infancy of navigation between the New and Old Worlds, can hardly be imputed to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as a defect in naval ſkill, he was expoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite fatigue and danger, in a perpetual ſtruggle with the trade-winds, which blow without varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the eaſt between the tropics. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the almoſt inſuperable difficulties of ſuch a navigation, he perſiſted in his courſe with his uſual patience and firmneſs, but made ſo little way, that he was three months without ſeeing land. At length his proviſions began to fail, the crew was reduced to the ſcanty allowance of ſix ounces of bread a-day for each peſon. The admiral fared no better than the meaneſt ſailor.

Now a plan was to be formed of a regular colony, that might ſerve as a model in all future eſtabliſhments. Every particular was conſidered with attention, and the whole arranged with a ſcrupulous accuracy. The preciſe number of adventurers who ſhould be permitted to embark was fixed. They were to be of different ranks and profeſſions; and the proportion of each was eſtabliſhed, according to their uſefulneſs and the wants of the colony.

As it was the firſt object to raiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in a country where ſcarcity of food had been the occaſion of ſo much diſtreſs, a conſiderable body of huſbandmen was to be carried over. As the Spaniards had then no conception of deriving any benefit from thoſe productions of the New World which have ſince yielded ſuch large returns of wealth to Europe, but had formed magnificent ideas, and entertained ſanguine hopes with reſpect to the riches contained in the mines which had been diſcovered, a band of workmen, ſkilled in the various arts employed in digging and refining the precious metals, was provided.

This advice, given without due reflection, was as inconſiderately adopted. The priſons of Spain were drained, in order to collect members for the intended colony; and the judges empowered to try criminals, were inſtructed to recruit it by their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſentences. It is not, however, with ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials that the foundations of a ſociety, deſtined to be permanent, ſhould be laid.

They were relieved, in ſome meaſure, from their fears by a ſeaſonable fall of rain. This, however, though ſo heavy and unintermitting that the men could hardly keep the deck, did not greatly mitigate the intenſeneſs of the heat.

Columbus, before he could perceive the danger, was entangled among thoſe adverſe currents and tempeſtuous waves, and it was with the utmoſt difficulty that he eſcaped through a narrow ſtrait, which appeared ſo tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous, that he called it La Boca del Drago. As ſoon as the conſternation which this occaſioned, permitted him to reflect upon the nature of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſo extraordinary, he diſcerned in it a ſource of comfort and hope.

                     <note place="margin">Mutiny of Roldan.</note>BUT while the adelantado was employed againſt them in the field, a mutiny, of an aſpect far more alarming, broke out among the Spaniards. The ringleader of it was Francis Roldan, whom Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus had placed in a ſtation which required him to be the guardian of order and tranquility in the colony. A turbulent and inconſiderate ambition precipitated him into this deſperate meaſure, ſo unbecoming his rank. The arguments which he employed to ſeduce his countrymen were frivolous and ill-founded. He accuſed Columbus and his two brothers of arrogance and ſeverity; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that they aimed at the eſtabliſhing an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent dominion in the country; he taxed them
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:034476_0173_0FFDD567093E8038"/>
with an intention of cutting off part of the Spaniards by hunger and fatigue, that they might more eaſily reduce the remainder to ſubjection; he repreſented it as unworthy of Caſtilians, to remain the tame and paſſive ſlaves of three Genoeſe adventurers. As men have always a propenſity to impute the hardſhips of which they feel the preſſure, to the miſconduct of their rulers; as every nation views with a jealous eye the power and exaltation of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, Roldan's inſinuations made a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on his countrymen. His character and rank added weight to them. A conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Spaniards made choice of him as their leader, and taking arms againſt the adelantado and his brother, ſeized the king's magazine of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and endeavoured to ſurpriſe the fort at St. Domingo. This was preſerved by the vigilance and courage of Don Diego Columbus. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers were obliged to retire to the province of Xaragua, where they continued not only to diſclaim the adelantado's authority themſelves, but excited the Indians to throw off the yoke<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 5—8.

                  <p>SUCH was the diſtracted ſtate of the colony when Columbus landed at St Domingo. He was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to find that the three ſhips which he had diſpatched from the Canaries were not yet arrived. By the unſkilfulneſs of the pilots, and the violence of currents, they had been carried a hundred and ſixty miles to the weſt of St. Domingo, and forced to take ſhelter in a harbour of the province of Xaragua, where Roldan and his ſeditious followers were cantoned. Roldan carefully concealed from the commanders of the ſhips his inſurrection againſt the adelantado, and employing his utmoſt addreſs to gain their confidence, perſuaded them to ſet on

It required but few argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prevail with thoſe men to eſpouſe his cauſe. They were the refuſe of the jails of Spain, to whom idleneſs, licentiouſneſs, and deeds of violence were familiar; and they returned eagerly to a courſe of life nearly reſembling that to which they had been accuſtomed. The commanders of the ſhips perceiving, when it was too late, their imprudence in diſembarking ſo many of their men, ſtood away for St. Domingo, and got ſafe into the port a few days after the admiral; but their ſtock of proviſions was ſo waſted during a voyage of ſuch long continuance, that they brought little relief to the colony<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 12.

Columbus, though filled with reſentment at his ingratitude, and highly exaſperated by the inſolence of his followers, made no haſte to take the field. He trembled at the thoughts of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the flames of a civil war, in which, whatever party prevailed, the power and ſtrength of both muſt be ſo much waſted, as might encourage the common enemy to unite and complete their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. At the ſame time, he obſerved, that the prejudices and paſſions which incited the rebels to take arms, had ſo far infected thoſe who ſtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to him, that many of them were adverſe, and all cold to the ſervice. From ſuch ſentiments, with reſpect to the public intereſt, as well as from this view of his own ſituation, he choſe to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate rather than to fight. By a ſeaſonable procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, offering free pardon to ſuch as ſhould

By en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging to grant ſuch as ſhould deſire it the liberty of returning to Spain, he allured all thoſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate adventurers, who, from ſickneſs and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, were diſguſted with the country. By promiſing to re-eſtabliſh Roldan in his former office, he ſoothed his pride; and, by complying with moſt of his demands in behalf of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, he ſatisfied their avarice. Thus, gradually and without bloodſhed, but after many tedious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociations, he diſolved this dangerous combination which threatened the colony with ruin; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the appearance of order, regular govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and tranquillity<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 13, 14.

Self-condemnation and regret were not the only ſentiments to which the ſucceſs of Columbus, and reflection upon their own imprudence in rejecting his propoſals, gave riſe among the Portugueſe. They excited a general emulation to ſurpaſs his performances, and an ardent deſire to make ſome reparation to their country for their own error. With this view, Emanuel, who inherited the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing genius of his predeceſſors, perſiſted in their grand ſcheme of opening a paſſage to the Eaſt Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, and ſoon after his acceſſion to the throne, equipped a ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron for that important voyage. He gave the command of it to Vaſco de Gama, a man of noble birth, poſſeſſed of virtue, prudence, and courage, equal to the ſtation. The ſquadron, like all thoſe fitted out for diſcovery in the infancy of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was extremely feeble, conſiſting only of three veſſels, of neither burden nor force adequate to the ſervice. As the Europeans were at that time little acquainted with the courſe of the trade-winds and periodical monſoons, which render navigation in the Atlantic ocean, as well as in the ſea that ſeparates Africa from India, at ſome ſeaſons eaſy, and at others not only dangerous, but almoſt impracticable, the time choſen for Gama's departure was the moſt improper during the whole year.

his conduct and intrepidity, he came to anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the city of Melinda. Throughout all the vaſt countries which extend along the coaſt of Africa, from the river Senegal to the confines of Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guebar, the Portugueſe had found a race of men rude and uncultivated, ſtrangers to letters, to arts, and commerce, and differing from the inhabitants of Europe, no leſs in their features and complexion, than in their manners and inſtitutions. As they advanced from this, they obſerved, to their inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible joy, that the human form gradually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and improved; the Aſiatic features began to predominate, marks of civilization appeared, letters were known, the Mahometan religion was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and a commerce, far from being inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, was carried on. At that time ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels from India were in the port of Melinda. Gama now purſued his voyage with almoſt abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of ſucceſs, and under the conduct of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon the coaſt of Malabar, on the twenty-ſecond of May one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred and ninety-eight. What he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held of the wealth, the populouſneſs, the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the induſtry and arts of this highly civilized country, far ſurpaſſed any idea that he had formed, from the imperfect accounts which the Europeans had hitherto received of it. But as he poſſeſſed neither ſufficient force to attempt a ſettlement, nor proper commodities with which he could carry on commerce of any conſequence, he haſtened back to Portugal, with account of his ſucceſs in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a voyage, the longeſt, as well as moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, that had ever been made, ſince the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of navigation.

The Spaniſh court, whoſe ſcanty revenues were exhauſted by the charge of its expeditions to the New World, which, though they opened alluring proſpects of future benefit, yielded a very ſparing return of preſent profit, was extremely willing to devolve the burden of diſcovery upon its ſubjects.

In what ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſerved, is uncertain; but as he was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſailor, and eminently ſkilful in all the ſciences ſubſervient to navigation, he ſeems to have acquired ſuch authority among his companions, that they willingly allowed him to have a chief ſhare in directing their operations during the voyage. Soon after his return, he tranſmitted an account of his adventures and diſcoveries to one of his countrymen; and labouring with the vanity of a traveller to magnify his own exploits, he had the addreſs and confidence to frame his narrative, ſo as to make it appear that he had the glory of having firſt diſcovered the continent in the New World. Amerigo's account was drawn up not only with art, but with ſome elegance.

                        </gap>s againſt Columbus.</note>WHILE the Spaniards and Portugueſe, by thoſe ſucceſſive voyages, were daily acquiring more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged ideas of the extent and opulence of that quarter of the globe which Columbus had made known to them, he himſelf, far from enjoying the tranquillity and honours with which his ſervices ſhould have been recompenſed, was ſtruggling with every diſtreſs in which the envy and malevolence of the people under his command, or the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the court which he ſerved, could involve him. Though the pacification with Roldan broke the union and weakened the force of the mutineers, it did not extirpate the ſeeds of diſcord out of the iſland. Several of the malcontents continued in arms, refuſing to ſubmit to the admiral. He and his brothers were obliged to take the field alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, in order to check their incurſions, or to puniſh their crimes. The perpetual occupation and diſquiet which this created, prevented him from giving due attention to the dangerous machinations of his enemies in the court of Spain. A good number of ſuch as were moſt diſſatisfied with his adminiſtration, had embraced the opportunity of returning to Europe with the ſhips which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:034476_0185_0FFDD5874B141710"/>
from St. Domingo. The final diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their hopes enflamed the rage of theſe unfortunate adventurers againſt Columbus to the utmoſt pitch. Their poverty and diſtreſs, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing compaſſion, rendered their accuſations cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and their complaints intereſting. They teazed Ferdinand and Iſabella inceſſantly with memorials, containing the detail of their own grievances, and the articles of their charge againſt Columbus. Whenever either the king or queen appeared in public, they ſurrounded them in a tumultuary manner, inſiſting with importunate clamours for the payment of the arrears due to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding vengeance upon the author of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. They inſulted the admiral's ſons where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met them, approaching them as the offspring of the projector, whoſe fatal curioſity had diſcovered thoſe pernicious regions which drained Spain of its wealth, and would prove the grave of its people. Theſe avowed endeavours of the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents from America to ruin Columbus, were ſeconded by the ſecret, but more dangerous inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of that party among the courtiers, which had always thwarted his ſchemes, and envied his ſucceſs and credit<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 85.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FERDINAND was diſpoſed to liſten,<note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on Ferdinand and Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la.</note> not only with a willing, but with a partial ear, to theſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Notwithſtanding the flattering accounts which Columbus had given of the riches of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the remittances from it had hitherto been ſo ſcanty, that they fell far ſhort of defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the armaments fitted out. The glory of the diſcovery, together with the proſpect of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mote commercial advantages, was all that Spain had yet received in return for the efforts which ſhe had made. But time had already diminiſhed the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:034476_0186_0FFDD589E0481190"/>
firſt ſenſations of joy which the diſcovery of a New World occaſioned, and fame alone was not an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſatisfy the cold intereſted mind of Ferdinand. The nature of commerce was then ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that where immediate gain was not acquired, the hope of diſtant benefit, or of ſlow and moderate returns, was totally diſregarded. Ferdinand conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Spain, on this account, as having loſt by the enterpriſe of Columbus, and imputed it to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct and incapacity for government, that a country abounding in gold had yielded nothing of value to its conquerors. Even Iſabella, who from the favourable opinion which ſhe entertained of Columbus, had uniformly protected him, was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at length by the number and boldneſs of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, and began to ſuſpect that a diſaffection ſo general muſt have been occaſioned by real grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, which called for redreſs. The biſhop of Badajos, with his uſual animoſity againſt Columbus, encouraged theſe ſuſpicions, and confirmed them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this.</note>AS ſoon as the queen began to give way to the torrent of calumny, a reſolution fatal to Columbus was taken. Francis de Bouvadilla, a knight of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrava, was appointed to repair to Hiſpaniola, with full powers to enquire into the conduct of Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, and, if he ſhould find the charge of mal-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration proved, to ſuperſede him, and aſſume the government of the iſland. It was impoſſible to eſcape condemnation, when this prepoſterous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion made it the intereſt of the judge to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the perſon whom he was ſent to try, guilty. Though Columbus had now compoſed all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſions in the iſland; though he had brought both Spaniards and Indians to ſubmit peaceably to his government; though he had made ſuch effectual proviſion for working the mines, and cultivating the country, as would have ſecured a conſiderable revenue to the king, as well as large profits to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:034476_0187_0FFDD58CA1070C30"/>
Bovadilla, without deigning to attend to the nature or merit of thoſe ſervices, diſcovered, from the moment that he landed in Hiſpaniola, a determined purpoſe of treating him as a criminal. He took poſſeſſion of the admiral's houſe in St. Domingo, from which its maſter happened at that time to be abſent, and ſeized his effects, as if his guilt had been already fully proved; he rendered himſelf maſter of the ſort and of the king's ſtores by violence; he required all perſons to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as ſupreme governor; he ſet at liberty the priſoners confined by the admiral, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him to appear before his tribunal, in order to anſwer for his conduct; tranſmitting to him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſummons, a copy of the royal man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, by which Columbus was enjoined to yield im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience to his commands.</p>
                  <p>COLUMBUS,<note place="margin">Columbus ſent in chains to Spain. October.</note> though deeply affected with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and juſtice of Ferdinand and Iſabella, did not heſitate a moment about his own conduct. He ſubmitted to the will of his ſovereigns with a reſpectful ſilence, and repaired directly to the court of that violent and partial judge whom they had authorized to try him. Bovadilla, without admitting him into his preſence, ordered him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to be arreſted, to be loaded with chains, and hurried on board a ſhip. Even under this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating reverſe of fortune, the firmneſs of mind which diſtinguiſhes the character of Columbus, did not forſake him. Conſcious of his own integrity, and ſolacing himſelf with reflecting upon the great things which he had atchieved, he endured this inſult offered to his character, not only with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, but with dignity. Nor had he the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſympathy to mitigate his ſufferings. Bova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla had already rendered himſelf ſo extremely popular, by granting various immunities to the colony, by liberal donations of Indians to all who
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:034476_0188_0FFDD58E580B4600"/>
applied for them, and by relaxing the reins of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and government, that the Spaniards, who were moſtly adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes had impelled to abandon their native country, expreſſed the moſt indecent ſatisfaction with the diſgrace and impriſonment of Columbus. They flattered themſelves, that now they ſhould enjoy an uncontrouled liberty, more ſuitable to their diſpoſition and former habits of life. Among perſons thus prepared to cenſure the proceedings, and to aſperſe the character of Columbus, Bova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilla collected materials for a charge againſt him. All accuſations, the moſt improbable, as well as inconſiſtent, were received. No informer, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever infamous, was rejected. The reſult of this inqueſt, no leſs indecent than partial, he tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Spain. At the ſame time, he ordered Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, with his two brothers to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fetters; and, adding cruelty to inſult, he confined them in different ſhips, and excluded them from the comfort of that friendly intercourſe which might have ſoothed their common diſtreſs. But while the Spaniards in Hiſpaniola viewed the arbitrary and inſolent proceedings of Bovadilla with a general approbation, which reflects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon their name and country, one man ſtill retained a proper ſenſe of the great actions which Columbus had performed, and was touched with the ſentiments of veneration and pity due to his rank, his age, and his merit. Alonſo de Vallejo, the captain of the veſſel on board which the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral was confined, as ſoon as he was clear of the iſland, approached his priſoner with great reſpect, and offered to releaſe him from the fetters with which he was unjuſtly loaded. "No," replied Columbus with a generous indignation, "I wear theſe irons in conſequence of an order from my ſovereigns. They ſhall find me as obedient to this

Set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but deprived of all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> the voyage to Spain was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſhort. As ſoon as Ferdinand and Iſabella were informed that Columbus was brought home a priſoner, and in chains, they perceived at once what univerſal aſtoniſhment this event muſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and what an impreſſion to their diſadvantage it muſt make. All Europe, they foreſaw, would be filled with indignation at this ungenerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital of a man who had performed actions worthy of the higheſt recompence, and would exclaim againſt the injuſtice of the nation, to which he had been ſuch an eminent benefactor, as well as againſt the ingratitude of the princes whoſe reign he had rendered illuſtrious. Aſhamed of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and eager not only to make ſome reparation for this injury, but to efface the ſtain which it might fix upon their character, they inſtantly iſſued orders to ſet Columbus at liberty,<note place="margin">Dec. 17.</note> invited him to court, and remitted money to enable him to appear there in a manner ſuitable to his rank. When he entered the royal preſence, Columbus threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the feet of his ſovereigns. He remained for ſome time ſilent; the various paſſions which agitated his mind ſuppreſſing his power of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. At length he recovered himſelf, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated his conduct in a long diſcourſe, producing the moſt ſatisfying proofs of his own integrity, as well as good intention, and evidence, no leſs clear, of the malevolence of his enemies, who, not ſatisfied with having ruined his fortune, labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deprive him of what alone was now left, his honour and his fame. Ferdinand received him
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:034476_0190_0FFDD59488AE1390"/>
with decent civility, and Iſabella with tenderneſs and reſpect. They both expreſſed their ſorrow for what had happened, diſavowed their knowledge of it, and joined in promiſing him protection and future favour. But though they inſtantly degraded Bovadilla, in order to remove from themſelves any ſuſpicion of having authoriſed his violent proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they did not reſtore to Columbus his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and privileges as viceroy of thoſe countries which he had diſcovered. Though willing to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the avengers of Columbus's wrongs, that illiberal jealouſy which prompted them to inveſt Bovadilla with ſuch authority as put it in his power to treat the admiral with indignity ſtill ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. They were afraid to truſt a man to whom they had been ſo highly indebted, and retaining him at court under various pretexts, they appointed Nicholas de Ovando, a knight of the military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Alcantara, governor of Hiſpaniola<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iv. c. 10—12.

                  <p>COLUMBUS was deeply affected with this new injury, which came from hands that ſeemed to be employed in making reparations for his paſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The ſenſibility with which great minds feel every thing that implies any ſuſpicion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, or that wears the aſpect of an affront, is exquiſite. Columbus had experienced both from the Spaniards; and their ungenerous conduct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated him to ſuch a degree, that he could no longer conceal the ſentiments which it excited. Wherever he went, he carried about with him, as a memorial of their ingratitude, thoſe fetters with which he had been loaded. They were conſtantly hung up in his chamber,<note place="margin">1501.

Roldan, and the other ringleaders of the mutineers, who had been moſt active in oppoſing Columbus, were required to leave the iſland at the ſame time.

After attending the court of Spain for near two years, as an humble ſuitor, he found it impoſſible to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and perceived, at length, that he laboured in vain, when he urged a claim of juſtice or merit with an intereſted and unfeeling prince.</p>

                     <note place="margin">He forms new ſchemes of diſcovery.</note>BUT even this ungenerous return did not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him from purſuing the great object which firſt called forth his inventive genius, and excited him to attempt diſcovery. To open a new paſſage to the Eaſt Indies was his original and favourite ſcheme. This ſtill engroſſed his thoughts; and either from his own obſervations in his voyage to Paria, or from ſome obſcure hint of the natives, or from the accounts given by Baſtidas and de la Coſa, of their expedition, he conceived an opinion that, beyond the continent of America, there was a ſea which extended to the Eaſt-Indies, and hoped to find ſome ſtrait or narrow neck of land, by which a communication might be opened with it and the part of the ocean already known. By a very fortunate conjecture, he ſuppoſed this ſtrait or iſthmus to be ſituated near the gulph of Darien. Full of this idea, though he was now of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age, worn out with fatigue, and broken with infirmities, he offered, with the alacrity of a youthful adventurer, to undertake a voyage which would aſcertain this important point, and perfect the grand ſcheme which from the beginning he
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:034476_0195_0FFDD5A090A4B630"/>
propoſed to accompliſh. Several circumſtances concurred in diſpoſing Ferdinand and Iſabella to lend a favourable ear to this propoſal. They were glad to have the pretext of any honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for removing from court a man with whoſe demands they deemed it impolitic to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and whoſe ſervices it was indecent to neglect. Though unwilling to reward Columbus, they were not inſenſible of his merit, and from their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of his ſkill and conduct, had reaſon to give credit to his conjectures, and to confide in his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. To theſe conſiderations, a third muſt be added of ſtill more powerful influence. About this time the Portugueſe fleet, under Cabral, arrived from the Indies; and, by the richneſs of its cargo, gave the people of Europe a more perfect idea than they had hitherto been able to form, of the opulence and fertility of the eaſt. The Portugueſe had been more fortunate in their diſcoveries than the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. They had opened a communication with countries where induſtry, arts, and elegance flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed; and where commerce had been longer eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and carried to greater extent, than in any region of the earth. Their firſt voyages thither yielded immediate as well as vaſt returns of profit, in commodities extremely precious and in great requeſt. Liſbon became immediately the ſeat of commerce and wealth; while Spain had only the expectation of remote benefit, and of future gain, from the weſtern world. Nothing, then, could be more acceptable to the Spaniards than Columbus's offer to conduct them to the eaſt, by a route which he expected to be ſhorter, as well as leſs danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than that which the Portugueſe had taken. Even Ferdinand was rouſed by ſuch a proſpect, and warmly approved of the undertaking.</p>
                  <p>BUT intereſting as the object of this voyage was to the nation,<note place="margin">His fourth voyage.</note> Columbus could procure only four

ſmall barks, the largeſt of which did not exceed ſeventy tons in burden, for performing it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to brave danger, and to engage in arduous undertakings with inadequate force, he did not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to accept the command of this pitiful ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. His brother Bartholomew, and his ſecond ſon Ferdinand, the hiſtorian of his actions, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him. He ſailed from Cadiz on the ninth of May, and touched, as uſual, at the Canary iſlands; from thence he propoſed to have ſtood directly for the continent; but his largeſt veſſel was ſo clumſy and unfit for ſervice, as conſtrained him to bear away for Hiſpaniola, in hopes of exchanging her for ſome ſhip of the fleet that had carried out Ovando.<note place="margin">June 29.</note> When he arrived at St. Domingo, he found eighteen of theſe ſhips ready loaded, and on the point of departing for Spain. Columbus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately acquainted the governor with the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his voyage, and the accident which had obliged him to alter his route. He requeſted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to enter the harbour, not only that he might negociate the exchange of his ſhip, but that he might take ſhelter during a violent hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane, of which he diſcerned the approach from various prognoſtics, which his experience and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity had taught him to obſerve. On that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eviſed him likewiſe to put off for ſome days the departure of the fleet bound for Spain. But Ovando refuſed his requeſt, and deſpiſed his counſel. Under circumſtances in which humanity would have afforded refuge to a ſtranger, Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus was denied admittance into a country of which he had diſcovered the exiſtence and acquired the poſſeſſion. His ſalutary warning, which merited the greateſt attention, was regarded as the dream of a viſionary prophet, who arrogantly pretended to predict an event beyond the reach of human foreſight. The fleet ſet ſail for Spain. Next

night the hurricane came on with dreadful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity. Columbus, aware of the danger, took precautions againſt it, and ſaved his little ſquadron. The fleet deſtined for Spain met with the fate which the raſhneſs and obſtinacy of its commanders deſerved. Of eighteen ſhips, two or three only eſcaped. In this general wreck pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed Bovadilla, Roldan, and the greater part of thoſe who had been the moſt active in perſecuting Columbus and oppreſſing the Indians. Together with themſelves, all the wealth which they had acquired by their injuſtice and cruelty was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up. It exceeded in value two hundred thouſand <hi>peſos;</hi> an immenſe ſum at that period, and ſufficient not only to have ſcreened them from any ſevere ſcrutiny into their conduct, but to have ſecured them a gracious reception in the Spaniſh court. Among the ſhips that eſcaped, one had on board all the effects of Columbus, which had been recovered from the ruins of his fortune. Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, ſtruck with the exact diſcrimination of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as well as the juſt diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments, conſpicuous in thoſe events, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally attribute them to an immediate interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of divine Providence, in order to avenge the wrongs of an injured man, and to puniſh the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors of an innocent people. Upon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſuperſtitious race of men, who were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this occurrence, it made a different im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. From an opinion which vulgar admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is apt to entertain with reſpect to perſons who have diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their ſagacity and inventions, they believed Columbus to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of ſupernatural powers, and imagined that he had conjured up this dreadful ſtorm by magical art and incantations, in order to be avenged of his enemies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 7.9.

There he had an interview with ſome inhabitants of the continent, who arrived in a large canoe. They appeared to be a people more civilized, and who had made greater progreſs in the knowledge of uſeful arts, than any whom he had hitherto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. In return to the inquiries which the Spaniards made, with their uſual eagerneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the places where the Indians got the gold which they wore by way of ornament, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to countries ſituated to the weſt, in which gold was found in ſuch profuſion, that it was applied to the moſt common uſes. Inſtead of ſteering in queſt of a country ſo inviting, which would have conducted him along the coaſt of Yu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catan to the rich empire of Mexico, Columbus was ſo bent upon his favourite ſcheme of finding out the ſtrait which he ſuppoſed to communicate with the Indian ocean, that he bore away to the eaſt towards the gulph of Darien.

meaſure of his calamities ſeemed now to be full. He was caſt aſhore upon an iſland at a conſiderable diſtance from the only ſettlement of the Spaniards in America. His ſhips were ruined beyond the poſſibility of being repaired. To convey an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his ſituation to Hiſpaniola, appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; and without this it was vain to expect relief. His genius, fertile in reſources, and moſt vigorous in thoſe perilous extremities when feeble minds abandon themſelves to deſpair, diſcovered the only expedient which afforded any proſpect of deliverance. He had recourſe to the hoſpitable kindneſs of the natives, who conſidering the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards as beings of a ſuperior nature, were eager, on every occaſion, to miniſter to their wants. From them he obtained two of their canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a ſingle tree hollowed with fire, and ſo miſ-ſhapen and aukward as hardly to merit the name of boats. In theſe, which were fit only for creeping along the coaſt, or croſſing from one ſide of a bay to another, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fieſchi, a Genoeſe, two gentlemen particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Columbus, gallantly offered to ſet out for Hiſpaniola, upon a voyage of above thirty leagues<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 9.</note>. This they accompliſhed in ten days, after ſurmounting incredible dangers, and enduring ſuch fatigues, that ſeveral of the Indians who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied them ſunk under it, and died. The attention paid to them by the governor of Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola was neither ſuch as their courage merited, nor the diſtreſs of the perſons from whom they came required. Ovando, from a mean jealouſy of Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to ſet foot in the iſland under his government.

Deſpair, heightened by diſappointment, ſettled in every breaſt. Their laſt reſource had failed, and nothing remained but the proſpect of ending their miſerable days among naked ſavages, far from their country and their friends. The ſeamen, in a tranſport of rage, roſe in open mutiny, threatened the life of Columbus, whom they reproached as the author of all their calamities, ſeized ten canoes, which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed from the Indians, and deſpiſing his remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances and entreaties, made off with them to a diſtant part of the iſland. At the ſame time the natives murmured at the long reſidence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards in their country. As their induſtry was not greater than that of their neighbours in Hiſpaniola, like them they found the burden of ſupporting ſo many ſtrangers to be altogether intolerable. They began to bring in proviſions with reluctance, they furniſhed them with a ſparing hand, and threatened to withdraw thoſe ſupplies altogether. Such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution muſt have been quickly fatal to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. Their ſafety depended upon the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will

of the Indians; and unleſs they could revive the admiration and reverence with which that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people had at firſt beheld them, deſtruction was unavoidable. Though the licentious proceedings of the mutineers had, in a great meaſure, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced thoſe impreſſions which had been ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the Spaniards, the ingenuity of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus ſuggeſted a happy artifice, that not only reſtored but heightened the high opinion which the Indians had originally entertained of them. By his ſkill in aſtronomy he knew that there was ſhortly to be a total eclipſe of the moon. He aſſembled all the principal perſons of the diſtrict around him on the day before it happened, and, after reproaching them for their ſickleneſs in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their affection and aſſiſtance from men whom they had lately revered, he told them, that the Spaniards were ſervants of the Great Spirit who dwells in heaven, who made and governs the world; that he, offended at their refuſing to ſupport men who were the objects of his peculiar favour, was preparing to puniſh this crime with exemplary ſeverity, and that very night the moon ſhould withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue, as a ſign of the divine wrath, and an emblem of the vengeance ready to fall upon them. To this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous prediction ſome of them liſtened with the careleſs indifference peculiar to the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; others, with the credulous aſtoniſhment na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to barbarians. But when the moon began gradually to be darkened, and at length appeared of a red colour, all were ſtruck with terror. They ran with conſternation to their houſes, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtantly to Columbus loaded with proviſions, threw them at his feet, conjuring him to intercede with the Great Spirit to avert the deſtruction with which they were threatened.

While they were advancing, an event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, more cruel and afflicting than any calamity which he dreaded from them. The governor of Hiſpaniola, whoſe mind was ſtill filled with ſome dark ſuſpicions of Columbus, ſent a ſmall bark to Jamaica, not to deliver his diſtreſſed countrymen, but to ſpy out their condition. Leſt the ſympathy of thoſe whom he employed ſhould afford them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, contrary to his intention, he gave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of this veſſel to Eſcobar, an inveterate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Columbus, who adhering to his inſtructions with malignant accuracy, caſt anchor at ſome diſtance from the iſland, approached the ſhore in a ſmall boat, obſerved the wretched plight of the Spaniards, delivered a letter of empty compliments to the admiral, received his anſwer, and departed. When the Spaniards firſt deſcried the veſſel ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the iſland, every heart exulted, as if the long-expected hour of their deliverance had at length arrived; but when it diſappeared ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, they ſunk into the deepeſt dejection, and
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:034476_0204_0FFDD637EF56D1F8"/>
all their hopes died away. Columbus alone, though he felt moſt ſenſibly this wanton inſult which Ovando added to his paſt neglect, retained ſuch compoſure of mind, as to be able to cheer his followers. He aſſured them, that Mendez and Fieſchi had reached Hiſpaniola in ſafety; that they would ſpeedily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſhips to carry them off; but as Eſcobar's veſſel could not take them all on board, that he had refuſed to go with her, becauſe he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to abandon the faithful companions of his diſtreſs. Soothed with the expectation of ſpeedy deliverance, and delighted with his apparent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity in attending more to their preſervation than to his own ſafety, their ſpirits revived, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained their confidence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 104.

                  </p>
                  <p>WITHOUT this confidence, he could not have reſiſted the mutineers, who were now at hand. All his endeavours to reclaim theſe deſperate men had no effect but to increaſe their frenzy. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands became every day more extravagant, and their intentions more violent and bloody. The common ſafety rendered it neceſſary to oppoſe them with open force. Columbus, who had been long afflicted with the gout, could not take the field.<note place="margin">May 20.</note> His brother, the adelantado, marched againſt them. They quickly met. The mutineers rejected with ſcorn terms of accommodation, which were once more offered them, and ruſhed on boldly to the attack.

The ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantado, whoſe ſtrength was equal to his courage, cloſed with their captain, wounded, diſarmed, and took him priſoner<note n="†" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 107.

Soon after, they ſubmitted in a body to Columbus, and bound themſelves by the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn oaths to obey all his commands. Hardly was tranquillity re-eſtabliſhed, when the ſhips appeared, whoſe arrival Columbus had promiſed with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, though he could foreſee it with little certainty. With tranſports of joy, the Spaniards quitted an iſland in which the unfeeling jealouſy of Ovando had ſuffered them to languiſh above a year, expoſed to miſery in all its various forms.</p>

But amidſt thoſe over-acted demonſtrations of regard, he could not conceal the hatred and malignity la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in his heart. He ſet at liberty the captain of the mutineers, whom Columbus had brought over in chains, to be tried for his crimes, and threatened ſuch as had adhered to the admiral, with proceeding to a judicial enquiry into their conduct. Columbus ſubmitted in ſilence to what he could not redreſs; but diſcovered an extreme impatience to quit a country, which was under the juriſdiction of a man who had treated him, on every occaſion,<note place="margin">Sept. 12.</note> with inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and injuſtice.

To ſolicit a prince thus prejudiced againſt him, was an occupation no leſs irkſome than hopeleſs. In this, however, Columbus was doomed to employ the cloſe of his days. As ſoon as his health was in ſome degree re-eſtabliſhed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to court; and though he was received there with civility barely decent, he plied Ferdinand with petition after petition, demanding the puniſhment of his oppreſſors, and the reſtitution of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges beſtowed upon him by the capitulation of one thouſand four hundred and ninety-two.

                     <note place="margin">BOOK III. 1504. State of the colony in Hiſpaniola.</note>WHILE Columbus was employed in his laſt voyage, ſeveral events worthy of notice happened in Hiſpaniola. The colony there, the parent and nurſe of all the ſubſequent eſtabliſhments of Spain in the New World, gradually acquired the form of a regular and proſperous ſociety. The humane ſolicitude of Iſabella to protect the Indians from oppreſſion, and particularly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel them to work, retarded, it is true, for ſome time, the progreſs of improvement. The natives, who conſidered exemption from toil as ſupreme felicity, ſcorned every allurement and reward by which they were invited to labour. The Spaniards had not a ſufficient number of hands either to work the mines or to cultivate the ſoil. Several of the firſt coloniſts, who had been accuſtomed to the ſervice of the Indians, quitted the iſland, when deprived of thoſe inſtruments, without which they knew not how to carry on any operation. Many of the new ſettlers who came over with Ovando, were ſeized with the diſtempers peculiar to the climate, and in a ſhort ſpace above a thouſand of them died. At
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:034476_0209_0FFDD6471EDC5460"/>
the ſame time, the exacting one half of the product of the mines as the royal ſhare, was found to be a demand ſo exorbitant, that no adventurers would engage to work them upon ſuch terms. In order to ſave the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the rigour of the royal edicts.<note place="margin">1505.</note> He made a new diſtribution of the Indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them to labour, for a ſtated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the ground; but, in order to ſcreen himſelf from the imputation of having ſubjected them again to ſervitude, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined their maſters to pay them a certain ſum, as the price of their work. He reduced the royal ſhare of the gold found in the mines from the half to the third part, and ſoon after lowered it to a fifth, at which it long remained. Notwithſtanding Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella's tender concern for the good treatment of the Indians, and Ferdinand's eagerneſs to improve the royal revenue, Ovando perſuaded the court to approve of both theſe regulations<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. v. c. 3.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Indians,<note place="margin">War with the Indians.</note> after enjoying reſpite from oppreſſion, though during a ſhort interval, now felt the yoke of bondage to be ſo galling, that they made ſeveral attempts to vindicate their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. This the Spaniards conſidered as rebellion, and took arms in order to reduce them to ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When war is carried on between nations whoſe ſtate of improvement is in any degree ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, the means of defence bear ſome proportion to thoſe employed in the attack; and in this equal conteſt ſuch efforts muſt be made, ſuch talents are diſplayed, and ſuch paſſions rouſed, as exhibit mankind to view in a ſituation no leſs ſtriking than intereſting. It is one of the nobleſt functions of hiſtory, to obſerve and to delineate men at a junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when their minds are moſt violently agitated,
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:034476_0210_0FFDD648AE8CD6F0"/>
and all their powers and paſſions are called forth. Hence the operations of war, and the ſtruggles between contending ſtates, have been deemed by hiſtorians, ancient as well as modern, a capital and important article in the annals of human actions. But in a conteſt between naked ſavages, and one of the moſt warlike of the European nations, where ſcience, courage, and diſcipline on one ſide, were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ignorance, timidity, and diſorder on the other, a particular detail of events would be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant as uninſtructive. If the ſimplicity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Indians had inſpired the Spaniards with humanity, had ſoftened the pride of ſuperiority into compaſſion, and had induced them to improve the inhabitants of the New World, inſtead of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, ſome ſudden acts of violence, like the too rigorous chaſtiſements of impatient inſtructors, might have been related without horror. But, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, this conſciouſneſs of ſuperiority ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a different manner. The Spaniards were advanced ſo far beyond the natives of America in improvement of every kind, that they viewed them with contempt. They conceived the Americans to be animals of an inferior nature, who were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the rights and privileges of men. In peace, they ſubjected them to ſervitude. In war, they paid no regard to thoſe laws, which, by a tacit convention between contending nations, regulate hoſtility, and ſet ſome bounds to its rage. They conſidered them not as men fighting in defence of their liberty, but as ſlaves, who had revolted againſt their maſters. Their caziques, when taken, were condemned, like the leaders of banditti, to the moſt cruel and ignominious puniſhments; and all their ſubjects, without regarding the diſtinction of ranks eſtabliſhed among them, were reduced to the ſame ſtate of abject ſlavery. With ſuch a ſpirit and ſentiments were hoſtilities carried on againſt
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:034476_0211_0FFDD64A45E82560"/>
the cazique of Higuey, a province at the eaſtern extremity of the iſland. This war was occaſioned by the perfidy of the Spaniards, in violating a treaty which they had made with the natives, and it was terminated by hanging up the cazique, who defended his people with bravery ſo far ſuperior to that of his countrymen, as intitled him to a better fate<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 9, 10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE conduct of Ovando,<note place="margin">The cruel and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous conduct of Ovando.</note> in another part of the iſland, was ſtill more treacherous and cruel. The province anciently named Xaragua, which extends from the fertile plain where Leogane is now ſituated, to the weſtern extremity of the iſland, was ſubject to a female cazique, named Anacoana, highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected by the natives. She, from that partial fondneſs with which the women of America were attached to the Europeans, (the cauſe of which ſhall be afterwards explained,) had always courted the friendſhip of the Spaniards, and loaded them with benefits. But ſome of the adherents of Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan having ſettled in her country, were ſo much exaſperated at her endeavouring to reſtrain their exceſſes, that they accuſed her of having formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate the Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well what little credit was due to ſuch profligate men, marched, without further inquiry, towards Xara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua, with three hundred foot and ſeventy horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. To prevent the Indians from taking alarm at this hoſtile appearance, he gave out that his ſole intention was to viſit Anacoana, to whom his countrymen had been ſo much indebted, in the moſt reſpectful manner, and to regulate with her the mode of levying the tribute payable to the king of Spain. Anacoana, in order to receive this
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:034476_0212_0FFDD64E021F2AC8"/>
illuſtrious gueſt with due honour, aſſembled the principal men in her dominions, to the number of three hundred, and advancing at the head of theſe, accompanied by a great croud of perſons of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank, ſhe welcomed Ovando with ſongs and dances, according to the mode of the country, and conducted him to the place of her reſidence. There he was feaſted for ſome days, with all the kindneſs of ſimple hoſpitality, and amuſed with the games and ſpectacles uſual among the Americans upon occaſions of mirth and feſtivity. But, amidſt the ſecurity which this inſpired, Ovando was me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating the deſtruction of his unſuſpicious enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer and her ſubjects; and the mean perfidy with which he executed this ſcheme, equalled his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity in forming it. Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the parade of an European tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he advanced with his troops, in battle array, towards the houſe in which Anacoana and the chiefs who attended her were aſſembled. The infantry took poſſeſſion of all the avenues which led to the village. The horſemen encompaſſed the houſe. Theſe movements were the object of admiration without any mixture of fear, until, upon a ſignal which had been concerted, the Spaniards ſuddenly drew their ſwords, and ruſhed upon the Indians, defenceleſs, and aſtoniſhed at an act of treachery which exceeded the conception of undeſigning men. In a moment Anacoana was ſecured. All her attendants were ſeized and bound. Fire was ſet to the houſe; and, without examination or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, all theſe unhappy perſons, the moſt illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious in their own country, were conſumed in the flames. Anacoana was reſerved for a more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious fate. She was carried in chains to St. Domingo, and, after the formality of a trial before Spaniſh judges, ſhe was condemned, upon the

Upon the death of Iſabella, all the regulations tending to mitigate the rigour of their ſervitude were forgotten. The ſmall gratuity paid to them as the price of their labour was withdrawn; and at the ſame time the taſks impoſed upon them were increaſed. Ovando,<note place="margin">1506.</note> without any reſtraint, diſtributed Indians among his friends in the iſland. Ferdinand, to whom the queen had left by will one half of the revenue ariſing from the ſettlements in the New World, conferred grants of a ſimilar nature upon his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers as the leaſt expenſive mode of rewarding their ſervices. They farmed out the Indians, of whom they were rendered proprietors, to their countrymen ſettled in Hiſpaniola; and that wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, being compelled to labour in order to ſatisfy the rapacity of both, the exactions of their oppreſſors no longer knew any bounds. But, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous as their policy was, and fatal to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Hiſpaniola, it produced for ſome time, very conſiderable effects. By calling forth the force of a whole nation, and exerting it in one direction, the working of the mines was carried on with amazing rapidity and ſucceſs. During ſeveral years, the gold brought into the royal ſmelting-houſes in Hiſpaniola amounted annually to four hundred and ſixty thouſand peſos, above a hundred thouſand pounds ſterling; which, if we

Others diſſipated in oſtentatious profuſion, what they acquired with facility. Dazzled by both, new adventurers crowded to America, with the moſt eager impatience, to ſhare in thoſe treaſures which had enriched their countrymen; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mortality occaſioned by the unhealthineſs of the climate, the colony continued to increaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 18, &amp;c.</note>

                     <note place="margin">Progreſs of the colony.</note>OVANDO governed the Spaniards with wiſdom and juſtice, not inferior to the rigour with which he treated the Indians. He eſtabliſhed equal laws, and, by executing them with impartiality, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed the people of the colony to reverence them. He founded ſeveral new towns in different parts of the iſland, and allured inhabitants to them, by the conceſſion of various immunities. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to turn the attention of the Spaniards to ſome branch of induſtry more uſeful than that of ſearching for gold in the mines. Some ſlips of the ſugar-cane having been brought from the Canary iſlands by way of experiment, they were found to thrive with ſuch increaſe in the rich ſoil and warm climate to which they were tranſplanted, that the cultivation of them ſoon became an object of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Extenſive plantations were begun; ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, which the Spaniards called <hi>ingenio's,</hi> from the various machinery employed in them, were erected, and in a few years the manufacture of this commodity was the great occupation of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Hiſpaniola and the moſt conſiderable ſource of their wealth.<note n="†" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. iv. c. 8.</note>

the welfare of the colony, were powerfully ſeconded by Ferdinand. The large remittances which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the New World opened his eyes, at length,<note place="margin">Political regulations of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</note> with reſpect to the importance of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, which he had hitherto affected to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value. Fortune, and his own addreſs, having now extricated him out of thoſe difficulties in which he had been involved by the death of his queen,<note place="margin">1507.</note> and by his diſputes with his ſon-in-law about the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her dominions<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the Reign of Charles V. vol. ii. p. 6, &amp;c.</note>, he had full leiſure to turn his attention to the affairs of America. To his provident ſagacity, Spain is indebted for many of thoſe regulations which gradually formed that ſyſtem of profound, but jealous policy by which ſhe governs her dominions in the New World. He erected a court, diſtinguiſhed by the title of the <hi>Caſa de Contratacion,</hi> or Board of Trade, compoſed of perſons eminent for rank and abilities, to whom he committed the adminiſtration of American affairs. This board aſſembled regularly in Seville, and was inveſted with a diſtinct and extenſive juriſdiction. He gave a regular form to eccleſiaſtical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in America, by nominating archbiſhops, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, deans, together with clergymen of ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate ranks, to take charge of the Spaniards eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed there, as well as of the natives who ſhould embrace the Chriſtian faith. But, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the obſequious devotion of the Spaniſh court to the Papal See, ſuch was Ferdinand's ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude to prevent any foreign power from claiming juriſdiction, or acquiring influence, in his new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, that he reſerved to the crown of Spain the ſole right of patronage to the benefices in America, and ſtipulated that no papal bull or mandate ſhould be promulgated there, until it was previouſly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and approved of by his council. With
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:034476_0216_0FFDD6575DC0E5C8"/>
the ſame ſpirit of jealouſy, he prohibited any goods to be exported to America, or any perſon to ſettle there, without a ſpecial licence from that council<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 19, 20.</note>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Indians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes faſt.</note>BUT, notwithſtanding this attention to the police and welfare of the colony, a calamity impended which threatened its diſſolution. The original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, on whoſe labour the Spaniards in Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola depended for their proſperity, and even their exiſtence, waſted ſo faſt, that the extinction of the whole race ſeemed to be inevitable. When Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus diſcovered Hiſpaniola, the number of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants was computed to be at leaſt a million<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. dec. lib. x. c. 12.</note>. They were now reduced to ſixty thouſand in the ſpace of fifteen years. This conſumption of the human ſpecies, no leſs amazing than rapid, was the effect of ſeveral concurring cauſes. The natives of the American iſlands were of a more feeble conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution than the inhabitants of the other hemiſphere. They could neither perform the ſame work, nor endure the ſame fatigue, with men whoſe organs were of a more vigorous conformation. The liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs indolence in which they delighted to paſs their days, as it was the effect of their debility, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted likewiſe to increaſe it, and render them, from habit as well as conſtitution, incapable of hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The food on which they ſubſiſted afforded little nouriſhment, and they were accuſtomed to take it in ſmall quantities, not ſufficient to invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a languid frame, and render it equal to the efforts of active induſtry. The Spaniards, without attending to thoſe peculiarities in the conſtitution of the Americans, impoſed taſks upon them, which, though not greater than Europeans might have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with caſe, were ſo diſproportioned to their
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:034476_0217_0FFDD65B0084D000"/>
ſtrength, that many ſunk under the fatigue, and ended their wretched days. Others, prompted by impatience and deſpair, cut ſhort their own lives with a violent hand. Famine, brought on by compelling ſuch numbers to abandon the culture of their lands, in order to labour in the mines, proved fatal to many. Diſeaſes of various kinds, ſome occaſioned by the hardſhips to which they were expoſed, and others by their intercourſe with the Europeans, who communicated to them ſome of their peculiar maladies, completed the deſolation of the iſland. The Spaniards being thus deprived of the inſtruments which they were accuſtomed to employ, found it impoſſible to extend their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, or even to carry on the works which they had already begun.<note place="margin">1508.</note> In order to provide an immediate remedy for an evil ſo alarming, Ovando propoſed to tranſport the inhabitants of the Lucayo iſlands to Hiſpaniola, under the pretence that they might be civilized with more facility, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to greater advantage in the Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ferdinand, deceived by this artifice, or willing to connive at an act of violence which policy repreſented as neceſſary, gave his aſſent to the propoſal. Several veſſels were fitted out for the Lucayos, the commanders of which informed the natives, with whoſe language they were now well acquainted, that they came from a delicious country, in which the departed anceſtors of the Indians reſided, by whom they were ſent to invite their deſcendants to reſort thither, to partake of the bliſs enjoyed there by happy ſpirits.

                     <note place="margin">New diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and ſettlements</note>THE Spaniards had, for ſome time, carried on their operations in the mines of Hiſpaniola with ſuch ardour as well as ſucceſs, that theſe ſeemed to have engroſſed their whole attention. The ſpirit of diſcovery lanquiſhed; and, ſince the laſt voyage of Columbus, no enterpriſe of any moment had been undertaken. But as the decreaſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians rendered it impoſſible to acquire wealth in that iſland with the ſame rapidity as formerly, this urged ſome of the more adventurous Spaniards to ſearch for new countries, where their avarice might be gratified with more facility. Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded under Ovando in the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern diſtrict of Hiſpaniola, paſſed over to the iſland of St. Juan de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had diſcovered in his ſecond voyage, and penetrated into the interior part of the country. As he found the ſoil to be fertile, and expected, from ſome ſymptoms, as well as from the information of the inhabitants, to diſcover mines of gold in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Ovando permitted him to attempt making a ſettlement in the iſland. This was eaſily effected by an officer eminent for conduct no leſs than for courage. In a few years Puerto Rico was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Spaniſh government, the natives were reduced to ſervitude; and, being treated with the ſame inconſiderate rigour as their neighbours in Hiſpaniola, the race of original inhabitants, worn out with fatigue and ſufferings, was ſoon extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 1—4.

They held the ſame courſe which Columbus had taken, as far as to the iſland of Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naios; but, ſtanding from thence to the weſt, they diſcovered a new and extenſive province, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known by the name of Yucatan, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a conſiderable way along the coaſt of that country<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 17.</note>. Though nothing memorable occurred in this voyage, it deſerves notice, becauſe it led to diſcoveries of greater importance. For the ſame reaſon, the voyage of Sebaſtian de Ocampo, muſt be mentioned. By the command of Ovando, he ſailed round Cuba, and firſt diſcovered with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that this country, which Columbus once ſuppoſed to be a part of the continent, was a large iſland<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS voyage round Cuba was one of the laſt occurrences under the adminiſtration of Ovando.<note place="margin">Diego Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Hiſpaniola.</note> Ever ſince the death of Columbus, his ſon Don Diego had been employed in ſoliciting Ferdinand to grant him the offices of viceroy and admiral in the New World, together with all the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities and profits which deſcended to him by inheritance, in conſequence of the original capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation with his father. But if theſe dignities and revenues appeared ſo conſiderable to Ferdinand, that, at the expence of being deemed unjuſt as well as ungrateful, he had wreſted them from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, it is not ſurpriſing that he ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to confer them on his ſon. Accordingly, Don Diego waſted two years in inceſſant but fruitleſs importunity. Weary of this, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at length to obtain, by a legal ſentence,
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:034476_0220_0FFDD661EBB047C8"/>
what he could not procure from the favour of an intereſted monarch. He commenced a ſuit againſt Ferdinand before the council which managed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs,<note place="margin">1509.</note> and that court, with integrity which reflects honour upon its proceedings, decided againſt the king, and ſuſtained Don Diego's claim of the viceroyalty, together with all the other privileges ſtipulated in the capitulation. Even after this decree, Ferdinand's repugnance to put a ſubject in poſſeſſion of ſuch extenſive rights, might have thrown in new obſtacles, if Don Diego had not taken a ſtep which intereſted very powerful perſons in the ſucceſs of his claims. The ſentence of the council of the Indies gave him a title to a rank ſo elevated, and a fortune ſo opulent, that he found no difficulty in concluding a marriage with Donna Maria, Daughter of Don Ferdinand de Toledo, great commendator of Leon, and brother of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of the firſt rank, and nearly related to the king. The duke and his family eſpouſed ſo warmly the cauſe of their new ally, that Ferdinand could not reſiſt their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations. He recalled Ovando, and appointed Don Diego his ſucceſſor, though, even in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this favour, he could not conceal his jealouſy; for he allowed him to aſſume only the title of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, not that of viceroy, which had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to belong to him <note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 4, &amp;c.</note>.</p>

                  <p>NO benefit accrued to the unhappy natives from this change of governors. Don Diego was not only authorized by a royal edict to continue the <hi>repartimientos,</hi> or diſtribution of Indians, but the particular number which he might grant to every perſon, according to his rank in the colony, was ſpecified.

                  <p>THE next care of the new governor was to comply with an inſtruction which he received from the king, about ſettling a colony in Cubagua,<note place="margin">Pearl fiſhery of Cubagua.</note> a ſmall iſland which Columbus had diſcovered in his third voyage. Though this barren ſpot hardly yielded ſubſiſtence to its wretched inhabitants, ſuch quantities of thoſe oyſters which produce pearls were found on its coaſt, that it did not long eſcape the inquiſitive avarice of the Spaniards, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a place of conſiderable reſort. Large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes were acquired by the fiſhery of pearls, which was carried on with extraordinary ardour.

                  <p>ABOUT this period, Juan Diaz de Solis and Pinzon ſet out,<note place="margin">New voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</note> in conjunction, upon a ſecond voyage. They ſtood directly ſouth, towards the equinoctial line, which Pinzon had formerly croſſed, and advanced as far as the fortieth degree of ſouthern latitude.

They landed in different places, to take poſſeſſion in the name of their ſovereign; but though the country appeared to be extremely fertile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting, their force was ſo ſmall, having been ſitted out rather for diſcovery than making ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they left no colony behind them.

What had been ſo long neglected was now ſeriouſly attempted, and with conſiderable vigour, though the plan for this purpoſe was neither formed by the crown, nor executed at the expence of the nation, but carried on by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſing ſpirit of private adventurers. This ſcheme took its riſe from Alonſo de Ojeda, who had already made two voyages as the diſcoverer, by which he acquired conſiderable reputation, but no wealth. But his character for intrepidity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct eaſily procured him aſſociates, who advanced the money requiſite to defray the charges of the
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:034476_0223_0FFDD66AC7BB1488"/>
expedition. About the ſame time, Diego de Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cueſſa, who had acquired a large fortune in Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola, formed a ſimilar deſign. Ferdinand encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged both; and though he refuſed to advance the ſmalleſt ſum, was extremely liberal of titles and patents. He erected two governments on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, one extending from Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien, and the other from that to Cape Gracias a Dios. The former was given to Ojeda, the latter to Nicueſſa. Ojeda fitted out a ſhip and two brigantines, with three hundred men; Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cueſſa, ſix veſſels, with ſeven hundred and eighty men. They ſailed about the ſame time from St. Domingo for their reſpective governments. In order to give their title to thoſe countries ſome appearance of validity, ſeveral of the moſt eminent divines and lawyers in Spain were employed to preſcribe the mode in which they ſhould take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them <note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 15.</note>. There is not in the hiſtory of mankind any thing more ſingular or extravagant than the form which they deviſed for this purpoſe. They inſtructed thoſe invaders, as ſoon as they landed on the continent, to declare to the natives the principal articles of the Chriſtian faith; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them in particular, with the ſupreme juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Pope over all the kingdoms of the earth; to inform them of the grant which this holy pontiff had made of their country to the king of Spain; to require them to embrace the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of that religion which the Spaniards made known to them; and to ſubmit to the ſovereign whoſe authority they proclaimed. If the natives refuſed to comply with this requiſition, the terms of which muſt have been utterly incomprehenſible to uninſtructed Indians, then Ojeda and Nicueſſa were authoriſed to attack them with fire and ſword;
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:034476_0224_0FFDD66C6BF63DF0"/>
to reduce them, their wives and children, to a ſtate of ſervitude; and to compel them by force to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize the juriſdiction of the church, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the monarch, to which they would not voluntarily ſubject themſelves<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXIII.</note>.</p>

                     <note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tending it.</note>AS the inhabitants of the continent could not at once yield aſſent to doctrines too refined for their uncultivated underſtandings, and explained to them by interpreters imperfectly acquainted with their language; as they did not conceive how a foreign prieſt, of whom they had never heard, could have any right to diſpoſe of their country, or how an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known prince ſhould claim juriſdiction over them as his ſubjects; they fiercely oppoſed the new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of their territories. Ojeda and Nicueſſa endeavoured to effect by force what they could not accompliſh by perſuaſion. The contemporary writers enter into a very minute detail in relating their tranſactions; but as they made no diſcovery of importance, nor eſtabliſhed any permanent ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, their adventures are not entitled to any conſiderable place in the general hiſtory of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, where romantic valour, ſtruggling with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible hardſhips, diſtinguiſh even effort of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh-arms.

Though the Spaniards employed every art to foothe them, and to gain their confidence, they refuſed to hold any intercourſe,<note place="margin">1510.</note> or to exchange any friendly office, with men whoſe reſidence among them they conſidered as fatal to their liberty and independence. This implacable enmity of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, though it rendered an attempt to eſtabliſh a ſettlement in their country extremely difficult as well as dangerous, might have been ſurmounted at length by the perſeverance of the Spaniards, by the ſuperiority of their arms, and their ſkill in the art of war. But every diſaſter which can be accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated upon the unfortunate, combined to complete their ruin. The loſs of their ſhips by various acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents upon an unknown coaſt, the diſeaſes peculiar to a climate the moſt noxious in all America, the want of proviſions, unavoidable in a country im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly cultivated, diſſenſion among themſelves, and the inceſſant hoſtilities of the natives, involved them in a ſucceſſion of calamities, the bare recital of which ſtrikes one with horror. Though they received two conſiderable reinforcements from Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, the greater part of thoſe who had engaged in this unhappy expedition, periſhed, in leſs than a year, in the moſt extreme miſery. A few who ſurvived, ſettled as a feeble colony at Santa Maria el Antigua, on the gulf of Darien, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Vaſco Nugnez de Balboa, who, in the moſt deſperate exigencies, diſplayed ſuch courage and conduct, as firſt gained the confidence of his countrymen, and marked him out as their leader in more ſplendid and ſucceſsful undertakings. Nor was he the only adventurer in this expedition who will appear with luſtre in more important ſcenes, Franciſco Pizarro was one of Ojeda's companions, and in this ſchool of adverſity acquired or improved the talents which ſitted him for the extraordinary actions which he afterwards performed.

                     <note place="margin">Conqueſt of Cuba.</note>NOTWITHSTANDING the unfortunate iſſue of this expedition, the Spaniards were not deterred from engaging in new ſchemes of a ſimilar nature. When wealth is acquired gradually by the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering hand of induſtry, or accumulated by the ſlow operations of regular commerce, the means em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed are ſo proportioned to the end attained, that there is nothing to ſtrike the imagination, and little to urge on the active powers of the mind to uncommon efforts. But when large fortunes were created almoſt inſtantaneouſly; when gold and pearls were procured in exchange for baubles; when the countries which produced theſe rich commodities, defended only by naked ſavages, might be ſeized by the firſt bold invader, objects ſo ſingular and alluring, rouſed a wonderful ſpirit of enterpriſe among the Spaniards, who ruſhed with ardour into this new path that was opened to wealth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. While this ſpirit continued warm and vigorous, every attempt either towards diſcovery or conqueſt was applauded, and adventurers engaged in it with emulation. The paſſion for new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which characteriſes the age of diſcovery in the latter part of the fifteenth and beginning of the ſixteenth century, would alone have been ſufficient
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:034476_0227_0FFDD675556A8B40"/>
to prevent the Spaniards from ſtopping ſhort in their career. But circumſtances peculiar to Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola at this juncture, concurred with it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their navigation and conqueſts. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous treatment of the inhabitants of that iſland, having almoſt extirpated the race, many of the Spaniſh planters, as I have already obſerved, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible to carry on their works with the ſame vigour and profit, were obliged to look out for ſettlements in ſome country where people were not yet waſted by oppreſſion. Others, with the inconſiderate levity natural to men upon whom wealth pours in with a ſudden flow, had ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in thoughtleſs prodigality, what they acquired with eaſe, and were driven by neceſſity to embark in the moſt deſperate ſchemes, in order to retrieve their affairs. From all theſe cauſes, when Don Diego Columbus propoſed to conquer the iſland of Cuba, and to eſtabliſh a colony there,<note place="margin">1511.</note> many perſons of chief diſtinction in Hiſpaniola engaged with ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity in the meaſure. He gave the command of the troops deſtined for that ſervice to Diego Velaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez, one of his father's companions in his ſecond voyage, and who, having been long ſettled in Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, had acquired an ample fortune, with ſuch reputation for probity and prudence, that he ſeemed to be well qualified for conducting an expedition of importance. Three hundred men were deemed ſufficient for the conqueſt of an iſland of above ſeven hundred miles in length, and filled with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. But they were of the ſame unwarlike character with the people of Hiſpaniola. They were not only intimidated by the appearance of their new enemies, but unprepared to reſiſt them. For though, from the time that the Spaniards took poſſeſſion of the adjacent iſland, there was reaſon to expect a deſcent on their territories; none of the ſmall communities into which Cuba was divided,
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:034476_0228_0FFDD67817F869E0"/>
had either made any proviſion for its own defence, or had formed any concert for their common ſafety. The only obſtruction the Spaniards met with was from Hatuey, a cazique, who had fled from Hiſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola, and had taken poſſeſſion of the eaſtern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Cuba. He ſtood upon the defenſive at their firſt landing, and endeavoured to drive them back to their ſhips. His feeble troops, however, were ſoon broken and diſperſed; and he himſelf being taken priſoner, Velaſquez, according to the barbarous maxim of the Spaniards, conſidered him as a ſlave who had taken arms againſt his maſter, and condemned him to the flames. When Hatuey was faſtened to the ſtake, a Franciſcan friar la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to convert him, promiſed him immediate admittance into the joys of heaven, if he would embrace the Chrſtian faith. <q>Are there any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</q> ſays he, after ſome pauſe, <q>in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of bliſs which you deſcribe?</q> "Yes," replied the monk, <q>but only ſuch as are worthy and good.</q> "The beſt of them," returned the indignant cazique, <q>have neither worth nor good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I will not go to a place where I may meet with one of that accurſed race<note n="*" place="bottom">B. de las Caſas, p. 40.</note>.</q> This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful example of vengeance ſtruck the people of Cuba with ſuch terror, that they ſcarcely gave any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the progreſs of their invaders, and Velaſquez, without the loſs of a man, annexed this extenſive and fertile iſland to the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 2, 3, &amp;c.

He directed his courſe towards the Lucayo iſlands; and after touching at ſeveral of them, as well as the Bahama iſles, he ſtood to the ſouthweſt, and diſcovered a country hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Spaniards, which he called Florida, either becauſe he fell in with it on Palm Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful appearance. He attempted to land in different places, but met with ſuch vigorous oppoſition from the natives, who were fierce and warlike, as convinced him that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of force was requiſite to effect a ſettlement. Satisfied with having opened a communication with a new country, of whoſe value and importance he conceived very ſanguine hopes, he returned to Puerto Rico, through the channel now known by the name of the Gulf of Florida.</p>
                  <p>IT was not merely the paſſion of ſearching for new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to undertake this voyage; he was influenced by one of thoſe viſionary ideas, which at that time often mingled with the ſpirit of diſcovery, and rendered it more active. A tradition prevailed among the natives of Puerto Rico, that in the iſle of Bimini, one of the Lucayos, there was a fountain of ſuch wonderful virtue as to renew the youth, and recal the vigour of every perſon who bathed in its ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary waters. In hopes of finding this grand reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged through the iſlands, ſearching, with fruitleſs ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and labour for the fountain, which was the chief object of their expedition.

appears in the preſent age, altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. The fact, however, is certain; and the moſt authentic Spaniſh hiſtorians mention this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant ſally of their credulous countrymen. The Spaniards, at that period, were engaged in a career of activity which gave a romantic turn to their imagination, and daily preſented to them ſtrange and marvellous objects. A New World was opened to their view. They viſited iſlands and continents, of whoſe exiſtence mankind in former ages had no conception. In thoſe delightful countries nature ſeemed to aſſume another form: every tree and plant and animal was different from thoſe of the ancient hemiſphere. They ſeemed to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into enchanted ground; and, after the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they had ſeen, nothing, in the warmth and novelty of their admiration, appeared to them ſo extraordinary as to be beyond belief. If the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid ſucceſſion of new and ſtriking ſcenes made ſuch impreſſion even upon the ſound underſtanding of Columbus, that he boaſted of having found the ſeat of Paradiſe, it will not appear ſtrange that Ponce de Leon ſhould dream of diſcovering the fountain of youth <note n="*" place="bottom">P.

Balboa having been raiſed to the government of the ſmall colony at Santa Maria in Darien, by the voluntary ſuffrage of his aſſociates, was ſo extremely deſirous to obtain from the crown a confirmation of their election, that he diſpatched one of his officers to Spain, in order to ſolicit a royal commiſſion, which might inveſt him with a legal title to the ſupreme command.

however, that he could not expect ſucceſs from the patronage of Ferdinand's miniſters, with whom he was unconnected, or from negociating in a court to the arts of which he was a ſtranger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he aſpired, and aimed at performing ſome ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that would ſecure him the preference to every competitor. Full of this idea, he made frequent inroads into the adjacent country, ſubdued ſeveral of the caziques, and collected a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the continent than in the iſlands. In one of thoſe excurſions, the Spaniards contended with ſuch eagerneſs about the diviſion of ſome gold, that they were at the point of proceeding to acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt one another. A young cazique, who was preſent, aſtoniſhed at the high value which they ſet upon a thing of which he did not diſcern the uſe, tumbled the gold out of the balance with indignation; and, turning to the Spaniards, "Why do you quarrel (ſays he) about ſuch a trifle? If you are ſo paſſionately fond of gold, as to abandon your own country, and to diſturb the tranquillity of diſtant nations for its ſake, I will conduct you to a region where the metal which ſeems to be the chief object of your admiration and deſire, is ſo common that the meaneſt utenſils are formed of it." Tranſported with what they heard, Balboa and his companions inquired eagerly where this happy country lay, and how they might arrive at it. He informed them that at the diſtance of ſix ſuns, that is of ſix days journey towards the ſouth, they ſhould diſcover another ocean, near to which this wealthy kingdom was ſituated; but if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to attack that powerful ſtate, they muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble forces far ſuperior in number and ſtrength to thoſe with which they now appeared <note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 2.

He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concluded the ocean which the cazique mentioned, to be that for which Columbus had ſearched without ſucceſs in this part of America, in hopes of opening a more direct communication with the Eaſt Indies; and he conjectured that the rich territory which had been deſcribed to him, muſt be part of that vaſt and opulent region of the earth. Elated with the idea of performing what ſo great a man had attempted in vain; and eager to accompliſh a diſcovery which he knew would be no leſs acceptable to the king than beneficial to his country, he was impatient until he could ſet out upon this enterpriſe, in compariſon of which all his former exploits appeared inconſiderable. But previous arrangement and preparation were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to enſure ſucceſs. He began with courting and ſecuring the friendſhip of the neighbouring ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziques.

By a proper diſtribution of this, they ſecured the favour of the governor, and allured volunteers into the ſervice. A conſiderable reinforcement from that iſland joined him, and he thought himſelf in a condition to attempt the diſcovery.</p>

ſea, and without any difficulty, to the territories of a cazique whoſe friendſhip he had gained; but no ſooner did he begin to advance into the interior part of the country, than he was retarded by every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle, which he had reaſon to apprehend, from the nature of the territory, or the diſpoſition of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Some of the caziques, at his approach, fled to the mountains with all their people, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off or deſtroyed whatever could afford ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his troops. Others collected their ſubjects, in order to oppoſe his progreſs, and he quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived what an arduous undertaking it was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſuch a body of men through hoſtile nations, acroſs ſwamps and rivers, and woods, which had never been paſſed but by ſtraggling Indians.

Though their guides had repreſented the breadth of the iſthmus to be only a journey of ſix days, they had already ſpent twenty-five in forcing their way through the woods and mountains. Many of them were ready to ſink under ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted fatigue in that ſultry climate, ſeveral were taken ill of the dyſentery and other diſeaſes frequent in that country, and all became impatient
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:034476_0235_0FFDD68A01BA6DB8"/>
to reach the period of their labours and ſufferings. At length the Indians aſſured them, that from the top of the next mountain they ſhould diſcover the ocean which was the object of their wiſhes. When, with infinite toil, they had climbed up the greater part of that ſteep aſcent, Balboa commanded his men to halt, and advanced alone to the ſummit, that he might be the firſt who ſhould enjoy a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle which he had ſo long deſired. As ſoon as he beheld the South Sea ſtretching in endleſs proſpect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God, who had conducted him to a diſcovery ſo beneficial to his country, and ſo honourable to himſelf. His followers, obſerving his tranſports of joy, ruſhed forward to join in his wonder, exultation and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. They held on their courſe to the ſhore with great alacrity, when Balboa advancing up to the middle in the waves with his buckler and ſword, took poſſeſſion of that ocean in the name of the king his maſter, and vowed to defend it, with theſe arms, againſt all his enemies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 1, &amp;c.

In order to give the Spaniards an idea of theſe, they drew upon the ſand the figure of the Llamas or ſheep, afterwards found in Peru, which the Peruvians had taught to perform ſuch ſervices as they deſcribed.

                  <p>BALBOA'S firſt care was to ſend information to Spain of the important diſcovery which he had made,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The firſt account of the diſcovery of the New World hardly occaſioned greater joy, than the unexpected tidings that a paſſage was at laſt found to the great ſouthern ocean. The communication with the Eaſt Indies, by a courſe to the weſtward of the line of demarkation, drawn by the Pope, ſeemed now to be almoſt certain. The vaſt wealth which flowed into Portugal from its extenſive ſettlements and conqueſts in that country, excited the envy, and called forth the emulation of other ſtates. Ferdinand hoped now to come in for a ſhare in this lucrative commerce, and in his eagerneſs to obtain, it was willing to make an effort beyond what Balboa required. But even in this exertion, his jealous policy, as well as the fatal antipathy of Fonſeca, now Biſhop of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos, to every man of merit who diſtinguiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the New World, were conſpicuous.

was ſo ungenerous as to overlook theſe, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Pedrarias Davila governor of Darien. He gave him the command of fifteen ſtout veſſels, and twelve hundred ſoldiers. Theſe were fitted out at the public expence, with a liberality which Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand had never diſplayed in any former armament deſtined for the New World; and ſuch was the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Spaniſh gentlemen to follow a leader who was about to conduct them to a country, where, as fame reported, they had only to throw their nets into the ſea and draw out gold<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 14.</note>, that fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred embarked on board the fleet, and if they had not been reſtrained, a much greater number would have engaged in the ſervice<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. x. c. 6, 7.

                  <p>PEDRARIAS reached the gulf of Darien with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any remarkable accident, and immediately ſent ſome of his principal officers aſhore to inform Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa of his arrival, with the king's commiſſion, to be governor of the colony. To their aſtoniſhment, they found Balboa, of whoſe great exploits they had heard ſo much, and of whoſe opulence they had formed ſuch high ideas, clad in a canvas jacket, and wearing coarſe hempen ſandals uſed only by the meaneſt peaſants, employed, together with ſome Indians, in thatching his own hut with reeds. Even in this ſimple garb, which correſponded ſo ill with the expectations and wiſhes of his new gueſts, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boa received them with dignity. The fame of his diſcoveries had drawn ſo many adventurers from the iſlands, that he could now muſter four hundred and fifty men. At the head of thoſe daring vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, he was more than a match for the force which Pedrarias brought with him. But though his troops murmured loudly at the injuſtice of the king in ſuperſeding their commander, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:034476_0239_0FFDD69595BB1C40"/>
that ſtrangers would now reap the fruits of their toil and ſucceſs, Balboa ſubmitted with impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit obedience to the will of his ſovereign, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Pedrarias with all the deference due to his character<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 13, 14.</note>.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this moderation,<note place="margin">Diſſenſion between him and Balboa.</note> to which Pedrarias owed the peaceable poſſeſſion of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he appointed a judicial inquiry to be made into Balboa's conduct, while under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Nicueſſa, and impoſed a conſiderable fine upon him, on account of the irregularities of which he had then been guilty. Balboa felt ſenſibly the mortification of being ſubjected to trial and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in a place where he had ſo lately occupied the firſt ſtation. Pedrarias could not conceal his jealouſy of his ſuperior merit; ſo that the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the one, and the envy of the other, gave riſe to diſſentions extremely detrimental to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. It was threatened with a calamity ſtill more fatal.<note place="margin">July.</note> Pedrarias had landed in Darien at a moſt unlucky time of the year, about the middle of the rainy ſeaſon, in that part of the torrid zone where the clouds pour down ſuch torrents as are unknown in more temperate climates<note n="†" place="bottom">Richard Hiſt.

Many principal perſons ſolicited their diſmiſſion, and were glad to relinquiſh all their hopes of wealth, in order to eſcape from that pernicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Pedrarias endeavoured to divert thoſe who remained from brooding over their misfortunes, by finding them employment. With this view, he ſent ſeveral detachments into the interior parts of the country, to levy gold among the natives, and to ſearch for the mines in which it was produced. Thoſe rapacious adventurers, more attentive to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gain than to the means of facilitating their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture progreſs, plundered without diſtinction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they marched. Regardleſs of the alliances which Balboa had made with ſeveral of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziques, they ſtripped them of every thing valuable, and treated them, as well as their ſubjects, with the utmoſt inſolence and cruelty. By their tyranny and exactions, which Pedrarias, either from want of authority or of inclination, did not reſtrain, all the country from the Gulf of Darien to the Lake of Nicaragua was deſolated, and the Spaniards were inconſiderately deprived of the advantages which they might have derived from the friendſhip of the natives, in extending their conqueſts to the South Sea. Balboa, who ſaw with concern that ſuch ill-judged proceedings retarded the execution of his favourite ſcheme, ſent violent remonſtrances to Spain againſt the imprudent government of Pedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, which had ruined a happy and flouriſhing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. Pedrarias, on the other hand, accuſed him of having deceived the king, by magnifying his own exploits, as well as by a falſe repreſentation of the opulence and value of the country <note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 15. dec. 2. c. 1, &amp;c.

an unexpected meſſage from Pedrarias<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. i. c. 3. lib. ii. c. 11.13.21.</note>. As his reconciliation with Balboa had never been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial, the progreſs which his ſon-in-law was making revived his ancient enmity, and added to its ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. He dreaded the proſperity and elevation of a man whom he had injured ſo deeply. He ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſucceſs would encourage him to aim at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence upon his juriſdiction; and ſo violently did the paſſions of hatred, fear, and jealouſy, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate upon his mind, that, in order to gratify his vengeance, he ſcrupled not to defeat an enterpriſe of the greateſt moment to his country. Under pretexts which were falſe, but plauſible, he deſired Balboa to poſtpone his voyage for a ſhort time, and to repair to Acla, in order that he might have an interview with him. Balboa, with the unſuſpicious confidence of a man conſcious of no crime, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly obeyed the ſummons; but as ſoon as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the place, he was arreſted by order of Pedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, whoſe impatience to ſatiate his revenge did not ſuffer him to languiſh long in confinement. Judges were immediately appointed to proceed to his trial. An accuſation of diſloyalty to the king, and of an intention to revolt againſt the governor, was preferred againſt him. Sentence of death was pronounced; and though the judges who paſſed it, ſeconded by the whole colony, interceded warmly for his pardon, Pedrarias continued inexorable; and the Spaniards beheld, with aſtoniſhment and ſorrow, the public execution of a man whom they univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deemed more capable than any who had borne command in America, of forming and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great deſigns<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 21, 22.</note>. Upon his death, the expedition which he had planned was relinquiſhed. Pedrarias, notwithſtanding the violence and injuſtice of his

Soon after, he obtained permiſſion to remove the colony from its unwholeſome ſtation of Santa Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria to Panama, on the oppoſite ſide of the iſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; and though it did not gain much in point of healthfulneſs by the change, the commodious ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this new ſettlement contributed greatly to facilitate the ſubſequent conqueſts of the Spaniards in the extenſive countries ſituated upon the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Ocean<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 1.</note>.</p>

Ferdinand was ſo intent upon opening a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Molucca or Spice Iſlands by the weſt, that, in the year one thouſand five hundred and fifteen, he fitted out two ſhips at his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in order to attempt ſuch a voyage, and gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed one of the moſt ſkilful navigators in Spain. He ſtood along the coaſt of South Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and on the firſt of January one thouſand five hundred and ſixteen, entered a river which he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Janeiro, where an extenſive commerce is now carried on.

In endeavouring to make a deſcent in this country, De Solis and ſeveral of his crew were ſlain by the natives, who, in ſight of the ſhips, cut their bodies

Don Diego Columbus wanted neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination nor abilities to have rendered the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this colony, who were moſt immediately under his juriſdiction, proſperous and happy. But he was circumſcribed in all his operations by the ſuſpicious policy of Ferdinand, who on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and under pretexts the moſt frivolous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched his privileges, and encouraged the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, the judges, and other ſubordinate officers, to counteract his meaſures, and to diſpute his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

remonſtrated againſt the maxims of the planters with reſpect to the Americans, and condemned the repartimientos, or diſtributions, by which they were given up as ſlaves to their conquerors, as no leſs contrary to natural juſtice and the precepts of Chriſtianity, than to ſound policy. The Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, to whom the inſtruction of the Americans was originally committed, were moſt vehement in teſtifying againſt the repartimientos.

Both parties applied to the king for his deciſion in a matter of ſuch import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

After a long diſcuſſion, the ſpeculative point in controverſy was determined in favour of the Dominicians, the Indians were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be a free people, intitled to all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural rights of men; but, notwithſtanding this deciſion, the repartimientos were continued upon their ancient footing<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. viii. c. 12. lib. ix. c 5.</note>. As this determination admitted the principle upon which the Dominicans founded their opinion, they renewed their efforts to obtain relief for the Indians with additional bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and zeal. At length, in order to quiet the colony, which was alarmed by their remonſtrances and cenſures, Ferdinand iſſued a decree of his privy council, declaring, that after mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Apoſtolic Bull, and other titles by which the crown of Caſtile claimed a right to its poſſeſſions in the New World,<note place="margin">1513.</note> the ſervitude of the Indians was warranted by both the laws of God and of man; that unleſs they were ſubjected to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Spaniards, and compelled to reſide under their inſpection, it would be impoſſible to reclaim them from idolatry, or to inſtruct them in the principles of the Chriſtian faith; that no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcruple ought to be entertained concerning the lawfulneſs of the repartimientos, as the king and council were willing to take the charge of that upon their own conſciences; and that therefore the Dominicians, and Monks of other religious

It was a matter of deliberation and delicacy to chuſe men qualified for ſuch an important ſtation. As all the laymen ſettled in America, or who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted in the adminiſtration of that department, had given their opinion that the Spaniards could not keep poſſeſſion of their new ſettlements, unleſs they were allowed to retain their dominion over the Indians, he ſaw that he could not rely on their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, and determined to commit the truſt to eccleſiaſtics.

The ſuperintendants, with their aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate Zuazo, and Las Caſas, ſailed for St. Domingo. Upon their arrival, the firſt act of their authority was to ſet at liberty all the Indians who had been granted to the Spaniſh courtiers, or to any perſon not reſiding in America. This, together with the information which had been received from Spain concerning the object of the commiſſion, ſpread a general alarm. The coloniſts concluded that they were to be deprived at once of the hands with which they carried on their labour, and that, of conſequence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of St. Jerome proceeded with ſuch caution and prudence, as ſoon diſſipated all their fears. They diſcovered, in every ſtep of their conduct, a knowledge of the world, and of affairs, which is ſeldom acquired in a cloiſter; and diſplayed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as well as gentleneſs ſtill more rare among perſons trained up in the ſolitude and auſterity of a monaſtic life. Their ears were open to information from every quarter, they compared the different accounts which they received, and, after a mature conſideration of the whole, they were fully ſatisfied that the ſtate of the colony rendered it impoſſible to adopt the plan propoſed by Las Caſas, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Cardinal. They plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the Spaniards ſettled in America were ſo few in number, that they could neither work the mines which had been opened, nor cultivate the
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:034476_0253_0FFDD6BC729BB040"/>
country; that they depended for effecting both, upon the labour of the natives, and if deprived of it, they muſt inſtantly relinquiſh their conqueſts, or give up all the advantages which they derived from them; that no allurement was ſo powerful as to ſurmount the natural averſion of the Indians to any laborious effort, and that nothing but the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a maſter could compel them to work; and if they were not kept conſtantly under the eye and diſcipline of a ſuperior, ſo great was their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liſtleſſneſs and indifference, that they would neither attend to religious inſtruction, nor obſerve thoſe rites of Chriſtianity which they had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taught. Upon all thoſe accounts, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendants found it neceſſary to tolerate the repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timientos, and to ſuffer the Indians to remain under ſubjection to their Spaniſh maſters. They uſed their utmoſt endeavours, however, to prevent the fatal effects of this eſtabliſhment, and to ſecure to the Indians the conſolation of the beſt treatment compatible with a ſtate of ſervitude.

The memory of Ferdinand was odious to the Flemings. The ſuperior virtue and abilities of Ximenes had long been the object of their envy. They fondly wiſhed to have a plauſible pretext for condemning the meaſures, both of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and of the miniſter, and of reflecting ſome diſcredit on their political wiſdom.

This union of many intereſts and paſſions was irreſiſtible; and, in conſequence of it, the fathers of St, Jerome, together with their aſſociate Zuazo, were recalled.

The impoſſibility of carrying on any improvement in America, unleſs the Spaniſh planters could command the labour of the natives, was an inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable objection to his plan of treating them as free ſubjects. In order to provide ſome remedy for this, without which he found it was in vain to mention his ſcheme, Las Caſas propoſed to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a ſufficient number of negroes from the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe ſettlements on the coaſt of Africa, and to tranſport them to America, in order that they might be employed as ſlaves in working the mines and cultivating the ground. One of the firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which the Portugueſe had derived from their deſcoveries in Africa, aroſe from the trade in ſlaves. Various circumſtances concurred in reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this odious commerce, which had been long aboliſhed in Europe, and which is no leſs repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the feelings of humanity, than to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion. As early as the year one thouſand five hundred and three, a few negro ſlaves had been ſent into the New World<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. v. c. 12.</note>. In
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:034476_0257_0FFDD6C61B3C36B8"/>
the year one thouſand five hundred and eleven, Ferdinand permitted the importation of them in greater numbers<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. lib. viii. c. 9.</note>. They were found to be a more robuſt and hardy race than the natives of America. They were more capable of enduring fatigue, more patient under ſervitude, and the labour of one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro was computed to be equal to that of four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. lib. 9. c. 5.</note>. Cardinal Ximenes, however, when ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to encourage this commerce, peremptorily rejected the propoſition, becauſe he perceived the iniquity of reducing one race of men to ſlavery, while he was conſulting about the means of reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberty to another<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 8</note>. But Las Caſas, from the inconſiſtency natural to men who hurry with head-long impetuoſity towards a favourite point, was incapable of making this diſtinction. While he contended earneſtly for the liberty of the people born in one quarter of the globe, he laboured to enſlave the inhabitants of another region; and in the warmth of his zeal to ſave the Americans from the yoke, pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to impoſe one ſtill heavier upon the Africans. Unfortunately for the latter, Las Caſas's plan was adopted. Charles granted a patent to one of his Flemiſh favourites, containing an excluſive right of importing four thouſand negroes into America. The favourite ſold his patent to ſome Genoeſe merchants for twenty-five thouſand ducats, and they were the firſt who brought into a regular form that commerce for ſlaves between Africa and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which has ſince been carried on to ſuch an amazing extent<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 20.</note>.</p>

that the number imported into Hiſpaniola made no great change upon the ſtate of the colony. Las Caſas, whoſe zeal was no leſs inventive than indefatigable, had recourſe to another expedient for the relief of the Indians. He obſerved, that moſt of the perſons who had ſettled hitherto in America, were ſailors and ſoldiers employed in the diſcovery or conqueſt of the country; the younger ſons of noble families, allured by the proſpect of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſudden wealth; or deſperate adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes forced to abandon their native land. Inſtead of ſuch men, who were diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, rapacious, and incapable of that ſober perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering induſtry which is requiſite in forming new colonies, he propoſed to ſupply the ſettlements in Hiſpaniola and other parts of the New World with a ſufficient number of labourers and huſbandmen, who ſhould be allured by ſuitable premiums to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thither. Theſe, as they were accuſtomed to fatigue, would be able to perform the work, to which the Indians, from the feebleneſs of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, were unequal, and might ſoon become uſeful and opulent citizens.

In all thoſe vaſt regions there was but one feeble colony planted; and except a ſmall ſpot on the iſthmus of Darien, the natives ſtill occupied the whole country. This opened a new and more ample field for the humanity and zeal of Las Caſas, who flattered himſelf that he might prevent a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſyſtem from being introduced there, though he had failed of ſucceſs in his attempts to overturn it, where it was already eſtabliſhed. Full of this idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccupied country, ſtretching along the ſea-coaſt from the gulf of Paria to the weſtern frontier of that province now known by the name of Santa Martha. He propoſed to ſettle there with a colony compoſed of huſbandmen, labourers, and eccleſiaſtics. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, in the ſpace of two years, to civilize ten thouſand of the natives, and to inſtruct them ſo thoroughly in the arts of ſocial life, that, from the fruits of their induſtry, an annual revenue of fifteen thouſand ducats ſhould ariſe to the king. In ten years he expected that his improvements would be ſo far advanced, as to yield annually ſixty thouſand ducats. He ſtipulated, that no ſailor or ſoldier ſhould ever be permitted to ſettle in this diſtrict; and that no Spaniard whatever ſhould enter it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his permiſſion. He even projected to clothe the people whom he took along with him in ſome diſtinguiſhing garb, which did not reſemble the Spaniſh dreſs, that they might appear to the natives to be a different race of men from thoſe who had brought ſo many calamities upon their country<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 2.</note>. From this ſcheme, of which I have traced only the great lines, it is manifeſt that Las Caſas had formed ideas concerning the method of treating the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſimilar to thoſe by which the Jeſuits afterwards carried on their great operations in another part of

the ſame continent. He ſuppoſed that the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, by availing themſelves of that aſcendant which they poſſeſſed in conſequence of their ſuperior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in ſcience and improvements, might gradually form the minds of the Americans to reliſh thoſe comforts of which they were deſtitute, might train them to the arts of civil life, and render them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of its functions.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Favourably received.</note>BUT to the biſhop of Burgos and the council of the Indies this project appeared not only chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, but dangerous in a high degree. They deemed the faculties of the Americans to be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo limited, and their indolence ſo exceſſive, that every attempt to inſtruct or to improve them would be fruitleſs. They contended that it would be extremely imprudent to give the command of a country extending above a thouſand miles along the coaſt, to a fanciful preſumptuous enthuſiaſt, a ſtranger to the affairs of the world, and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the arts of government. Las Caſas, far from being diſcouraged with a repulſe, which he had reaſon to expect, had recourſe once more to the Flemiſh favourites, who zealouſly patronized his ſcheme, merely becauſe it had been rejected by the Spaniſh miniſters. They prevailed with their maſter, who had lately been raiſed to the Imperial dignity, to refer the conſideration of this meaſure to a ſelect number of his privy-counſellors; and Las Caſas having excepted againſt the members of the counſel of the Indies, as partial and intereſted, they were all excluded. The deciſion of men choſen by recommendation of the Flemings, was perfectly conformable to their ſentiments. They warmly approved of Las Caſas's plan; and gave orders for carrying it into execution, but reſtricted the territory allotted him to three hundred miles along the coaſt of Cumana, allowing him, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,

                  <p>THIS determination did not paſs uncenſured.

Quevedo, the biſhop of Darien, who had accompanied Pedrarias to the continent in the year one thouſand five hundred and thirteen, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to land at Barcelona, where the court then reſided. It was quickly known, that his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning the talents and diſpoſition of the Indians differed from thoſe of Las Caſas; and Charles naturally concluded that by confronting two reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable perſons, who, during their reſidence in America, had full leiſure to obſerve the manners of the people whom they pretended to deſcribe, he might be able to diſcover which of them had formed his opinion with the greateſt diſcernment and accuracy.</p>
                  <p>A day for this ſolemn audience was appointed.
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:034476_0262_0FFDD6D32DBC82E8"/>
The emperor appeared with extraordinary pomp, and took his ſeat on a throne in the great hall of the palace. His principal courtiers attended. Don Diego Columbus admiral of the Indies, was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to be preſent. The biſhop of Darien was called upon firſt to deliver his opinion. He, in a ſhort diſcourſe, lamented the fatal deſolautin of America, by the extinction of ſo many of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; he acknowledged that this muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, in ſome degree, to the exceſſive rigour and inconſiderate proceedings of the Spaniards; but declared, that all the people of the New World, whom he had ſeen either in the continent or in the iſlands, appeared to him to be a race of men marked out, by the inferiority of their talents, for ſervitude, and whom it would be impoſſible to inſtruct or improve, unleſs they were kept under the continual inſpection of a maſter. Las Caſas, at greater length, and with more fervour, defended his own ſyſtem. He rejected with indignation the idea that any race of men was born to ſervitude, as irreligious and inhuman. He aſſerted, that the faculties of the Americans were not naturally deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, but unimproved; that they were capable of receiving inſtruction, in the principles of religion, as well as of acquiring the induſtry and arts which would qualify them for the various offices of ſocial life; that the mildneſs and timidity of their nature rendered them ſo ſubmiſſive and docile, that they might be led and formed with a gentle hand. He profeſſed, that his intentions in propoſing the ſcheme now under conſideration were pure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted; and though, from the accompliſhment of his deſigns, ineſtimable benefits would reſult to the crown of Caſtile, he never had claimed, nor ever would receive, any recompence on that account.</p>

                  <p>NOTHING, however, could damp his zeal.<note place="margin">Departs for America, and meets with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable obſtacles.</note> With this ſlender train, hardly ſufficient to take poſſeſſion of ſuch a large territory, and altogether unequal to any effectual attempt towards civilzing its inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, he ſet ſail. The firſt place at which he touched was the iſland of Puerto Rico. There he received an account of a new obſtacle to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſcheme, more inſuperable than any he had hitherto encountered. When he left America in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſixteen, the Spaniards had little intercourſe with any part of the continent, except the countries adjacent to the gulf of Darien. But as every ſpecies of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal induſtry began to ſtagnate in Hiſpaniola, when, by the rapid decreaſe of the natives, the Spaniards were deprived of thoſe hands with which they had
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:034476_0264_0FFDD6D775F625E0"/>
hitherto carried on their operations, this prompted them to try various expedients for ſupplying that loſs. Conſiderable numbers of negroes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported; but, on account of their exorbitant price, many of the planters could not afford to purchaſe them. In order to procure ſlaves at an eaſier rate, ſome of the Spaniards in Hiſpaniola fitted out veſſels to cruize along the coaſt of the continent. In places where they found themſelves inferior in ſtrength, they traded with the natives, and gave European toys in exchange for the plates of gold worn by them as ornaments; but, wherever they could ſurpriſe or overpower the Indians, they carried them off by force, and ſold them as ſlaves<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 3.</note>. In thoſe predatory excurſions, ſuch atrocious acts of violence and cruelty had been commited, that the Spaniſh name was held in deteſtation all over the continent. Whenever any ſhips appeared, the inhabitants either fled to the woods, or ruſhed down to the ſhore in arms, to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They forced ſome parties of the Spaniards to retreat with precipitation; they cut off others; and in the violence of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment againſt the whole nation, they murdered two Dominican miſſionaries, whoſe zeal had prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to ſettle in the province of Cumana<note n="†" place="bottom">Oviedo Hiſt. lib. xix. c. 3.</note>. This outrage againſt perſons revered for their ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, excited ſuch indignation among the people of Hiſpaniola, who, notwithſtanding all their licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and cruel proceedings, were poſſeſſed with a wonderful zeal for religion, and a ſuperſtitious reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for its miniſters, that they determined to inflict exemplary puniſhment, not only upon the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that crime, but upon the whole race. With this view, they gave the command of five ſhips and three hundred men to Diego Ocampo, with orders to lay waſte the country of Cumana with fire and

This armament Las Caſas found at Puerto Rico, in its way to the continent; and as Ocampo refuſed to defer his voyage, he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately perceived that it would be impoſſible to attempt the execution of his pacific plan in a country deſtined to be the ſeat of war and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ix. c. 8, 9.</note>.</p>

From many concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cauſes, the reception which Las Caſas met with in Hiſpaniola was very unfavourable. In his negociations for the relief of the Indians, he had cenſured the conduct of his countrymen ſettled there with ſuch honeſt ſeverity as rendered him uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally odious to them. They conſidered their own ruin as the inevitable conſequence of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. They were now elated with hope of receiving a large recruit of ſlaves from Cumana, which muſt be relinquiſhed if Las Caſas were aſſiſted in ſettling his projected colony there. Figueroa, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the inſtructions which he had received in Spain, had made an experiment concerning the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the Indians, that was repreſented as deciſive againſt the ſyſtem of Las Caſas.

The fame of this allured thither many perſons from the other colonies, in hopes of finding either ſome permanent eſtabliſhment or ſome employment for their activity. As Cuba lay to the weſt of all the iſlands occupied by the Spaniards, and as the ocean, which ſtretches beyond it towards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, theſe circumſtances na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally invited the inhabitants to attempt new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. An expedition for this purpoſe, in which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and reſolution might conduct to ſudden wealth, was more ſuited to the genius of the age, than the patient induſtry requiſite in clearing ground, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing ſugar. Inſtigated by this ſpirit, ſeveral officers, who had ſerved under Pedrarias in Darien, entered into an aſſociation to undertake a voyage of diſcovery. They perſuaded Franciſco Hernandez Cordova, an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of diſtinguiſhed courage, to join with them in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and choſe him to be their commander. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſquez not only approved of the deſign, but aſſiſted in carrying it on. As the veterans from Darien were extremely indigent, he and Cordova advanced mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for purchaſing three ſmall veſſels, and furniſhing them with every thing requiſite either for traffic or

By the advice of their chief pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had ſerved under the firſt admiral Columbus, they ſtood directly weſt, relying on the opinion of that great navigator, who uniformly maintained that a weſterly courſe would lead to the moſt important diſcoveries.</p>
                  <p>ON the twenty-firſt day after their departure from St. Jago, they ſaw land, which proved to be <hi>Cape Catoche,</hi> the eaſtern point of that large pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninſula projecting from the continent of America, which ſtill retains its original name of <hi>Yucatan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Yucatan.</note> As they approached the ſhore, ſive canoes came off full of people decently clad in cotton garments; an aſtoniſhing ſpectacle to the Spaniards, who had found every other part of America poſſeſſed by naked ſavages. Cordova endeavoured by ſmall preſents to gain the good-will of theſe people. They, though amazed at the ſtrange objects now preſented for the firſt time to their view, invited the Spaniards to viſit their habitations, with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of cordiality.

                  <p>CORDOVA landed all his troops in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the ſailors while employed in filling the caſks; but notwithſtanding this precaution, the natives ruſhed down upon them with ſuch fury, and in ſuch numbers, that forty-ſeven of the Spaniards were killed upon the ſpot, and one man only of the whole body eſcaped unhurt. Their commander, though wounded in twelve different places, directed the retreat with preſence of mind equal to the courage with which he had led them on in the engagement, and with much difficulty regained their ſhips. After this fatal repulſe, nothing remained but to haſten back to Cuba with their ſhattered forces.

                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the diſaſtrous concluſion of this expedition,<note place="margin">Voyage of Grijalva.</note> it contributed rather to animate than to damp a ſpirit of enterpriſe among the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. They had diſcovered an extenſive country, ſituated at no great diſtance from Cuba, fertile in appearance, and poſſeſſed by a people far ſuperior in improvement to any hitherto known in America. Though they had carried on little commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the natives, they had brought off ſome ornaments of gold, not conſiderable in value, but of ſingular fabric. Theſe circumſtances, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the exaggeration natural to men deſirous of heightening the merit of their own exploits, were more than ſufficient to excite romantic hopes and expectations. Great numbers offered to engage in a new expedition. Velaſquez, ſolicitous to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh himſelf by ſome ſervice ſo meritorious as might entitle him to claim the government of Cuba independent of the admiral, not only encouraged their ardour, but at his own expence fitted out four ſhips for the voyage. Two hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were ſeveral perſons of rank and fortune, embarked in this enterpriſe. The command of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a young man of known merit and courage, with inſtructions to obſerve attentively the nature of the countries which he ſhould diſcover, to barter for gold, and, if circumſtances were inviting, to ſettle a colony in ſome proper ſtation.

the violence of the currents carrying the ſhips to the ſouth, the firſt land which they made was the iſland of <hi>Cozumel,</hi> to the eaſt of Yucatan, As all the inhabitants fled to the woods and mountains at the approach of the Spaniards, they made no long ſtay there, and without any remarkable occurrence they reached Potonchan on the oppoſite ſide of the peninſula. The deſire of avenging their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who had been ſlain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, that they might chaſtiſe the Indians of that diſtrict with ſuch exemplary rigour, as would ſtrike terror into all the people around them. But though they diſembarked all their troops, and carried aſhore ſome field pieces, the Indians fought with ſuch courage, that the Spaniards gained the victory with difficulty, and were confirmed in their opinion that the inhabitants of this country would prove more formidable enemies than any they had met with in other parts of America. From Poton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan, they continued their voyage towards the weſt, keeping as near as poſſible to the ſhore, and caſting anchor every evening, from dread of the dangerous accidents to which they might be expoſed in an unknown ſea. During the day, their eyes were turned continually towards land, with a mixture of ſurpriſe and wonder at the beauty of the country, as well as the novelty of the objects which they beheld. Many villages were ſcattered along the coaſt, in which they could diſtinguiſh houſes of ſtone that appeared white and lofty at a diſtance. In the warmth of their admiration, they fancied theſe to be cities adorned with towers and pinnacles; and one of the ſoldiers happening to remark that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try reſembled Spain in its appearance, Grijalva, with univerſal applauſe, called it <hi>New Spain,</hi> the name which ſtill diſtinguiſhes this extenſive and opulent province of the Spaniſh empire in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXVII.</note>.

Theſe ideas were raiſed ſtill higher by what occurred at the place where they next touched. This was conſiderably to the weſt of Tobaſco, in the province ſince known by the name of Guaxaca.<note place="margin">Guaxaca.</note> There they were received with the reſpect paid to ſuperior be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The people perfumed them as they landed, with incenſe of gum copal, and preſented to them as offerings the choiceſt delicacies of their country. They were extremely fond of trading with their new viſitants, and in ſix days the Spaniards obtained ornaments of gold, of curious workmanſhip, to the value of fifteen thouſand peſos, in exchange for European toys of ſmall price. The two priſoners whom Cordova had brought from Yucatan, had hitherto ſerved as interpreters; but as they did not underſtand the language of this country, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards learned from the natives by ſigns, that they were ſubjects of a great monarch called Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma, whoſe dominion extended over that and many other provinces.

But the ſquadron had now been above five months at ſea; the greateſt part of their proviſions was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and what remained of their ſtores ſo much corrupted by the heat of the climate, as to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unfit for uſe; they had loſt ſome men by death; others were ſickly; the country was crowded with people who ſeemed to be intelligent as well as brave; and they were under the government of one powerful monarch, who could bring them to act againſt their invaders with united force. To plant a colony under ſo many circumſtances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, appeared a ſcheme too perilous to be attempted.

diſtinguiſhed the features of this country by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much ſuperior in height to thoſe in the other diviſions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito,<note place="margin">Its moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</note> which may be conſidered as the baſe of the Andes, is elevated farther above the ſea than the top of the Pyrenees. This ſtupendous ridge of the Andes, no leſs remarkable for extent than elevation, riſes in different places more than one third above the Pike of Teneriffe, the higheſt land in the ancient hemiſphere. The Andes may literally be ſaid to hide their heads in the clouds; the ſtorms often roll, and the thunder burſts below their ſummits, which, though expoſed to the rays of the ſun in the center of the torrid zone, are covered with everlaſting ſnows<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXVIII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FROM theſe lofty mountains deſcend rivers,<note place="margin">Rivers.</note> proportionably large, with which the ſtreams in the ancient continent are not to be compared, either for length of courſe, or the vaſt body of water which they roll towards the ocean. The Maragnon, the Orinoco, the Plata in South Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; the Miſſiſippi and St. Laurence in North America, flow in ſuch ſpacious channels, that, long before they feel the influence of the tide, they reſemble arms of the ſea, rather than rivers of freſh water<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE XXIX.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE lakes of the New World are no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous for grandeur than its mountains and rivers.<note place="margin">Lakes.</note> There is nothing in other parts of the globe which reſembles the prodigious chain of lakes in North America.

                     <pb n="282" facs="unknown:034476_0280_0FFDD702097D2748"/>THE New World is of a form extremely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to commercial intercourſe. When a continent is formed,<note place="margin">Its form favourable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</note> like Africa, of one vaſt ſolid maſs, unbroken by arms of the ſea penetrating into its interior parts, with few large rivers, and thoſe at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, the greater part of it ſeems deſtined to remain for ever uncivilized, and to be debarred from any active or enlarged communication with the reſt of mankind. When, like Europe, a continent is opened by inlets of the ocean of great extent, ſuch as the Mediterranean and Baltic; or when, like Aſia, its coaſt is broken by deep bays advancing far into the country, ſuch as the Black Sea, the gulfs of Arabia, of Perſia, of Bengal, of Siam, and of Leotang; when the ſurrounding ſeas are filled with large and fertile iſlands, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent itſelf watered with a variety of navigable rivers, thoſe regions may be ſaid to poſſeſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can facilitate the progreſs of their inhabitants in commerce and improvement. In all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects America may bear a compariſon with the other quarters of the globe. The gulf of Mexico, which flows in between North and South America, may be conſidered as a Mediterranean ſea, which opens a maritime commerce with all the fertile countries by which it is encircled. The iſlands ſcattered in it are inferior only to thoſe in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Archipelago, in number, in magnitude, and in value. As we ſtretch along the northern divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the American hemiſphere, the Bay of Cheſapeak preſents a ſpacious inlet, which conducts the navigator far into the interior parts of provinces no leſs fertile than extenſive; and if ever the progreſs of culture and population ſhall mitigate the extreme rigour of the climate in the more northren diſtricts of America, Hudſon's Bay may become a ſubſervient to commercial intercourſe in
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:034476_0281_0FFDD705B2C07650"/>
that quarter of the globe, as the Baltic is in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The other great portion of the New World is encompaſſed on every ſide by the ſea, except one narrow neck, which ſeparates the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean; and though it be not opened by ſpacious bays or arms of the ſea, its interior parts are rendered acceſſible by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of large rivers, fed by ſo many auxiliary ſtreams, flowing in ſuch various directions, that, almoſt without any aid from the hand of induſtry and art, an inland navigation may be carried on through all the provinces from the river De la Plata to the gulf of Paria. Nor is this bounty of Nature confined to the ſouthern diviſion of America; its northern continent abounds no leſs in rivers which are navigable almoſt to their ſources, and by its immenſe chain of lakes proviſion is made for an inland communication, more extenſive and commodious than in any quarter of the globe. The countries ſtretching from the gulf of Darien on one ſide, to that of California on the other, which form the chain that binds the two parts of the American continent together, are not deſtitute of peculiar advantages. Their coaſt on one ſide is waſhed by the Atlantic Ocean, on the other by the Pacific. Some of their rivers flow into the former, ſome into the latter, and ſecure to them all the commercial benefits that may reſult from a communication with both.</p>
                  <p>BUT what moſt diſtinguiſhes America from other parts of the earth,<note place="margin">Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its climate.</note> is the peculiar temperature of its climate, and the different laws to which it is ſubject with reſpect to the diſtribution of heat and cold. We cannot determine with preciſion the portion of heat felt in any part of the globe, merely by meaſuring its diſtance from the equator. The climate of a country is affected, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, by its elevation above the ſea, by the extent
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:034476_0282_0FFDD7084DDCDBD0"/>
of continent, by the nature of the ſoil, the height of adjacent mountains, and many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The influence of theſe, however, is, from various cauſes, leſs conſiderable in the greater part of the ancient continent; and from knowing the poſition of any country there, we can pronounce with greater certainty, what will be the warmth of its climate, and the nature of its productions.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of cold.</note>THE maxims which are founded upon obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our hemiſphere will not apply to the other. In the New World, cold predominates. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the frigid zone extends over half of thoſe regions, which ſhould be temperate by their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Countries where the grape and the fig ſhould ripen, are buried under ſnow one half of the year; and lands ſituated in the ſame parallel with the moſt fertile and beſt cultivated provinces in Europe, are chilled with perpetual froſts, which almoſt deſtroy the power of vegetation<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXX.</note>. As we advance to thoſe parts of America which lie in the ſame parallel with provinces of Aſia and Africa, bleſſed with an uniform enjoyment of ſuch genial warmth as is moſt friendly to life and to vegetation, the dominion of cold continues to be felt, and winter reigns, though, during a ſhort period, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſeverity. If we proceed along the American continent into the torrid zone, we ſhall find the cold prevalent in the New World extending itſelf alſo to this region of the globe, and mitigating the exceſs of its fervour.

                  <p>VARIOUS cauſes combine in rendering the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of America ſo extremely different from that of the ancient continent.<note place="margin">Cauſes of this.</note> Though the utmoſt extent of America towards the north be not yet diſcovered, we know that it advances much nearer to the pole than either Europe or Aſia. Both theſe have large ſeas to the north, which are open dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the year, and even when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is leſs intenſely cold than that which blows over land in the ſame high latitudes. But in America the land ſtretches from the river St. Laurence towards the pole, and ſpreads out immenſely to the Weſt. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with ſnow and ice, runs through all this dreary region. The wind, in paſſing over ſuch an extent of high and frozen land, becomes ſo impregnated with cold, that it acquires a piercing keenneſs, which it retains in its progreſs through warmer climates, and is not entirely miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated until it reach the gulf of Mexico.

is felt in a tranſition from heat to cold, no leſs violent than ſudden. To this powerful cauſe we may aſcribe the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its violent inroads into the ſouthern provinces in that part of the globe<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlevoix Hiſt. de Nov. Fr. iii. 165. Hiſt. generale Voyages, tom. xv. 215. &amp;c.</note>.</p>
                  <p>OTHER cauſes, no leſs remarkable, diminiſh the active power of heat in thoſe parts of the American continent which lie between the tropics. In all that portion of the globe, the wind blows in an invariable direction from eaſt to weſt. As this wind holds its courſe acroſs the ancient continent, it arrives at the countries which ſtretch along the weſtern ſhores of Africa, inflamed with all the fiery particles which it hath collected from the ſultry plains of Aſia, and the burning ſands in the African deſerts. The coaſt of Africa is, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the region of the earth which feels the moſt fervent heat, and is expoſed to the unmitigated ardour of the torrid zone. But this ſame wind which brings ſuch an acceſſion of warmth to the countries lying between the river of Senegal and Cafraria, traverſes the Atlantic Ocean, before it reaches the American ſhore. It is cooled in its paſſage over this vaſt body of water, and is felt as a refreſhing gale along the coaſt of Braſil<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE XXXI.</note>, and Guinea, rendering theſe countries, though among the warmeſt in America, temperate, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with thoſe which lie oppoſite to them in Africa<note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE XXXII.</note>. As this wind advances in its courſe acroſs America, it meets with immenſe plains, covered with impenetrable foreſts, or occupied by large rivers, marſhes, and ſtagnating waters, where it can recover no conſiderable degree of heat. At length it arrives at the Andes, which run from

north to ſouth through the whole continent. In paſſing over their elevated and frozen ſummits, it is ſo thoroughly cooled, that the greater part of the countries beyond them hardly feel the ardour to which they ſeem expoſed by their ſituation<note n="*" place="bottom">Acoſta Hiſt. Novi Orbis, lib. ii. c. 11. Buffon Hiſt. Naturelle, &amp;c. tom. ii. 512, &amp;c. ix. 107, &amp;c. Oſborn's Collect. of Voyages, ii. p. 868,</note>. In the other provinces of America, from Tierra Firmè weſtward to the Mexican empire, the heat of the climate is tempered, in ſome places, by the elevation of the land above the ſea, in others, by their extraordinary humidity, and in all, by the enormous mountains ſcattered over this tract. The iſlands of America in the Torrid Zone are either ſmall or mountainous, and are fanned alternately by refreſhing ſea and land breezes.</p>
                  <p>THE cauſes of the extraordinary cold towards the ſouthern limits of America, and in the ſeas beyond it, cannot be aſcertained in a manner equally ſatisfying. It was long ſuppoſed that a vaſt continent, diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Terra Auſtralis Incognita,</hi> lay between the ſouthern extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of America and the Antarctic pole. The ſame principles which account for the extraordinary degree of cold in the northern regions of America, were employed in order to explain that which is felt at Cape Horn and the adjacent countries. The immenſe extent of the ſouthern continent, and the large rivers which it poured into the ocean, were mentioned and admitted by philoſophers as cauſes ſufficient to occaſion the unuſual ſenſation of cold, and the ſtill more uncommon appearances of frozen ſeas in that region of the globe. But the imaginary continent to which ſuch influence was aſcribed, having been ſearched for in vain, and the ſpace which it was ſuppoſed to occupy having been found to be an open ſea, new conjectures muſt be

Throughout all its vaſt regions, there were only two monarchies remarkable for extent of territory, or diſtinguiſhed by any progreſs in improvement. The reſt of this continent was poſſeſſed by ſmall independent tribes, deſtitute of arts and induſtry, and neither capable to correct the defects, nor deſirous to meliorate the condition of that part of the earth allotted to them for their habitation. Countries, occupied by ſuch people,

were almoſt in the ſame ſtate as if they had been without inhabitants. Immenſe foreſts covered a great part of the uncultivated earth; and as the hand of induſtry had not taught the rivers to run in a proper channel, or drained off the ſtagnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water, many of the moſt fertile plains were overflowed with inundations, or converted into marſhes. In the ſouthern provinces, where the warmth of the ſun, the moiſture of the climate, and the fertility of the ſoil, combine in calling forth the moſt vigorous powers of vegetation, the woods are ſo choked with its rank luxuriance, as to be almoſt impervious, and the ſurface of the ground is hid from the eye under a thick covering of ſhrubs and herbs and weeds. In this ſtate of wild unaſſiſted nature, a great part of the large provinces in South America, which extend from the bottom of the Andes to the ſea, ſtill remain. The European colonies have cleared and cultivated a few ſpots along the coaſt, but the original race of inhabitants, as rude and indolent as ever, have done nothing to open or improve a country, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing almoſt every advantage of ſituation and climate. As we advance towards the northern provinces of America, Nature continues to wear the ſame uncultivated aſpect, and in proportion as the rigour of the climate increaſes, appears more deſolate and horrid. There the foreſts, though not encumbered with the ſame exuberance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation, are of immenſe extent; prodigious marſhes overſpread the plains, and few marks appear of human activity in any attempt to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or embelliſh the earth. No wonder that the colonies ſent from Europe were aſtoniſhed at their firſt entrance into the New World. It appeared to them waſte, ſolitary, and uninviting.

The American birds of the torrid zone, like thoſe of the ſame climate in Aſia and Africa, are decked in plumage, which dazzle the eye with the beauty of its colours; but nature ſatisfied with clothing them in this gay dreſs, has denied moſt of them that melody of ſound, and variety of notes, which catch and delight the ear. The birds of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates there, in the ſame manner as in our continent, are leſs ſplendid in their appearance, but, in compenſation for that defect, they have voices of greater compaſs, and more melodious. In ſome diſtricts of America, the unwholeſome temperature of the air ſeems to be unfavourable even to this part of the creation.

In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, we may obſerve, that the moiſture and cold, which predominates ſo remarkably in all parts of America, muſt have great influence upon the nature of its ſoil; countries lying in the ſame parallel with thoſe regions which never feel the extreme rigour of winter in the ancient continent, are frozen over in America during a great part of the year.

If we wiſh to rear in America the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which abound in any particular diſtrict of the ancient world, we muſt advance ſeveral degrees nearer to the line than in the other hemiſphere, as it requires ſuch an increaſe of heat to counterba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the natural frigidity of the ſoil and climate<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXXVIII.</note>.

There is hardly any nation from the north to the ſouth pole, to which ſome antiquary, in the extravagance of conjecture, has not aſcribed the honour of peopling America.

If we ſuppoſe two tribes, though placed in the moſt remote regions of the globe, to live in a climate nearly of the ſame temperature, to be in the ſame ſtate of ſociety, and to reſemble each other in the degree of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, they muſt feel the ſame wants, and exert the ſame endeavours to ſupply them. The ſame objects will allure, the ſame paſſions will ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate them, and the ſame ideas and ſentiments will ariſe in their minds. The character and occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the hunter in America muſt be little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from thoſe of an Aſiatic, who depends for ſubſiſtence on the chace.

then of preſuming from this ſimilarity, that there is an affinity between them, we ſhould only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the diſpoſition and manners of men are formed by their ſituation, and ariſe from the ſtate of ſociety in which they live. The moment that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to vary, the character of a people muſt change. In proportion as it advances in improvement, their manners refine, their powers and talents are called forth. In every part of the earth the progreſs of man hath been nearly the ſame, and we can trace him in his career from the rude ſimplicity of ſavage life, until he attains the induſtry, the arts, and the elegance of poliſhed ſociety. There is nothing wonderful then in the ſimilitude between the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans and the barbarous nations of our continent. Had Lafitau, Garcia, and many other authors, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to this, they would not have perplexed a ſubject which they pretend to illuſtrate, by their fruitleſs endeavours to eſtabliſh an affinity between various races of people in the old and new conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, upon no other evidence than ſuch a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in their manners as neceſſarily ariſes from the ſimilarity of their condition. There are, it is true, among every people, ſome cuſtoms, which, as they do not flow from any natural want or deſire peculiar to their ſituation, may be denominated uſages of arbitrary inſtitution. If between two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſettled in remote parts of the earth, a perfect agreement with reſpect to any of theſe ſhould be diſcovered, one might be led to ſuſpect that they were connected by ſome affinity. If, for example, a nation were found in America that conſecrated the ſeventh day to religious worſhip and reſt, we might juſtly ſuppoſe that it had derived its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this uſage, which is of arbitrary inſtitution, from the Jews. But, if it were diſcovered that another nation celebrated the firſt appearance of every new moon with extraordinary demonſtrations
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:034476_0299_0FFDD75207D1FFB8"/>

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of cuſtoms, merely arbitrary, common to the inhabitants of both hemiſpheres, are, indeed, ſo few and ſo equivocal, that no theory concerning the population of the New World ought to be founded upon them.</p>

When the religious opinions of any people are neither the reſult of rational inquiry, nor derived from the inſtructions of revelation, they muſt needs be wild and extravagant. Barbarous nations are incapable of the former, and have not been bleſſed with the advantages ariſing from the latter. Still, however, the human mind, even where its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions appear moſt wild and capricious, holds a courſe ſo regular, that in every age and country the dominion of particular paſſions will be attended with ſimilar effects. The ſavage of Europe or America, when filled with ſuperſtitious dread of inviſible beings, or with inquiſitive ſolicitude to penetrate into the events of futurity, trembles alike with fear, or glows with impatience. He has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to rites and practices of the ſame kind, in order to avert the vengeance which he ſuppoſes to be impending over him, or to divine the ſecret which is the object of his curioſity. Accordingly, the ritual of ſuperſtition, in one continent, ſeems, in many particulars, to be a tranſcript of that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the other, and both authoriſe ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, ſometimes ſo frivolous as to excite pity,

ſometimes ſo bloody and barbarous as to create horror. But without ſuppoſing any conſanguinity between ſuch diſtant nations, or imagining that their religious ceremonies were conveyed by tradition from the one to the other, we may aſcribe this uniformity, which in many inſtances ſeems very amazing, to the natural operation of ſuperſtition and enthuſiaſm upon the weakeſt of the human mind.</p>

For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the elegant and refined arts may decline or periſh, amidſt the violent ſhocks of thoſe revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and diſaſters to which nations are expoſed, the neceſſary arts of life, when once they have been introduced among any people, are never loſt. None of the viciſſitudes in human affairs affect theſe, and they continue to be practiſed as long as the race of men exiſts.

We may conclude then, that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans ſprung from ſome people, who were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch an early and unimproved ſtage of ſociety, as to be unacquainted with all thoſe neceſſary arts, which continued to be unknown among their poſterity, when firſt viſited by the Spaniards.</p>

They poſſeſſed neither enterpriſe, nor ingenuity, nor power, that could prompt them to undertake, or enable them to perform, ſuch a diſtant voyage. That the more civilized nations in Aſia or Africa are not the progenitors of the Americans is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, not only from the obſervations which I have already made concerning their ignorance of the moſt ſimple and neceſſary arts, but from an additional circumſtance.

From which it is obvious, that the people who firſt ſettled in the weſtern world did not iſſue from the countries where thoſe animals abound, and where men, from having been long accuſtomed to their aid, would naturally conſider it, not only as beneficial, but as indiſpenſably neceſſary to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and even the preſervation, of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>

which ſtretch eaſtward from the river Oby to the ſea of Kamchatka were unknown, or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly explored, the north-eaſt extremities of our hemiſphere were ſuppoſed to be ſo far diſtant from any part of the New World, that it was not eaſy to conceive how any communication ſhould have been carried on between them. But the Ruſſians, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjected the weſtern part of Siberia to their empire, gradually extended their knowledge of that vaſt country, by advancing towards the eaſt into unknown provinces. Theſe were diſcovered by hunters in their excurſions after game, or by ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers employed in levying the taxes, and the court of Moſcow eſtimated the importance of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries only by the ſmall addition which they made to its revenue. At length Peter the Great aſcended the Ruſſian throne. His enlightened, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive mind, intent upon every circumſtance that could aggrandize his empire, or render his reign illuſtrious, diſcerned conſequences of thoſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which had eſcaped the obſervation of his ignorant predeceſſors. He perceived, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the regions of Aſia extended towards the eaſt, they muſt approach nearer to America; that the communication between the two continents, which had long been ſearched for in vain, would probably be found in this quarter, and that by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, ſome part of the wealth and commerce of the weſtern world might be made to flow into his dominions by a new channel. Such an object ſuited a genius that delighted in grand ſchemes. Peter drew up inſtructions with his own hand for proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting this deſign, and gave orders for carrying it into execution<note n="*" place="bottom">Muller Voyages et Decouvertes par les Ruſſes, tom. i. p. 4, 5. 141.</note>.</p>

plan. The officers whom the Ruſſian court em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this ſervice, had to ſtruggle with ſo many difficulties, that their progreſs was extremely ſlow. Encouraged by ſome faint traditions among the people of Siberia, concerning a ſucceſsful voyage in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and forty-eight, round the north-eaſt promontory of Aſia, they attempted to follow the ſame courſe. Veſſels were fitted out, with this view, at different times, from the rivers Lena and Kolyma; but in a frozen ocean, which nature ſeems not to have deſtined for navigation, they were expoſed to many diſaſters, without being able to accompliſh their purpoſe. No veſſel fitted out by the Ruſſian court ever dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled this formidable Cape<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLI.</note>; we are indebted for what is known of thoſe extreme regions of Aſia, to the diſcoveries made in excurſions by land. In all thoſe provinces an opinion prevails, that there are countries of great extent and fertility, which lie at no conſiderable diſtance from their own coaſts. Theſe the Ruſſians imagined to be part of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; and ſeveral circumſtances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief, but in perſuading them that ſome portion of that continent could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown in thoſe naked regions of Aſia, are driven upon the coaſt by an eaſterly wind. By the ſame wind, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ice is brought thither in a few days; ſlights of birds arrive annually from the ſame quarter; and a tradition obtains among the inhabitants, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe formerly carried on with ſome countries ſituated to the eaſt.</p>
                  <p>AFTER weighing all theſe particulars, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the poſition of the countries in Aſia which had been diſcovered, with ſuch parts in the north-weſt of America as were already known, the Ruſſian

court formed a plan, which would have hardly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to a nation leſs accuſtomed to engage in ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undertakings, and to contend with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Orders were iſſued to build two veſſels at the ſmall village of Ochotz, ſituated on the ſea of Kam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, to ſail on a voyage of diſcovery. Though that dreary uncultivated region furniſhed nothing that could be of uſe in conſtructing them, but ſome larch trees; though not only the iron, the cordage, the ſails, and all the numerous articles requiſite for their equipment, but the proviſions for victualling them were to be carried through the immenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of Siberia, down rivers of difficult navigation, and along roads almoſt impaſſable, the mandate of the ſovereign, and the perſeverance of the people, at laſt ſurmounted every obſtacle.<note place="margin">1741. June 4.</note> Two veſſels were finiſhed, and, under the command of the captains Behring and Tſchirikow, ſailed from Kamchatka, in queſt of the New World, in a quarter where it had never been approached. They ſhaped their courſe towards the eaſt; and though a ſtorm ſoon ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the veſſels, which never rejoined, and many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters befel them, the expectations from the voyage were not altogether fruſtrated. Each of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders diſcovered land, which to them appeared to be part of the American continent; and, according to their obſervations, it ſeems to be ſituated within a few degrees of the north-weſt coaſt of California. Each ſet ſome of his people aſhore; but in one place the inhabitants fled as the Ruſſians approached; in another, they carried off thoſe who landed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their boats. The violence of the weather, and the diſtreſs of their crews, obliged both cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to quit this inhoſpitable coaſt. In their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn they touched at ſeveral iſlands, which ſtretch in a chain from eaſt to weſt between the country which they had diſcovered and the coaſt of Aſia. They had ſome intercourſe with the natives, who
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:034476_0306_0FFDD763D39E79E8"/>
ſeemed to them to reſemble the North Americans. They preſented to the Ruſſians the <hi>calumet,</hi> or pipe of peace, which is a ſymbol of friendſhip univerſal among the people of North America, and an uſage of arbitrary inſtitution, peculiar to them.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH the iſlands of this New Archipelago have been frequented ſince that time by the Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian hunters, the court of St. Peterſburgh, during a period of more than forty years, ſeems to have relinquiſhed every thought of proſecuting diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in that quarter. But in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-eight, it was unexpectedly reſumed. The Sovereign, who had been lately ſeated on the throne of Peter the Great, poſſeſſed the genius and talents of her illuſtrious predeceſſor. During the operations of the moſt arduous and extenſive war in which the Ruſſian empire was ever engaged, ſhe formed ſchemes and executed undertakings, to which more limited abilities would have been incapable of attending but amidſt the lieſure of pacific times. A new voyage of diſcovery from the eaſtern extremity of Aſia was planned, and captain Krenitzin and lieutenant Levaſheff were appointed to command the two veſſels fitted out for that purpoſe. In their voyage outward they held nearly the ſame courſe with the former navigators, they touched at the ſame iſlands, obſerved their ſituation and productions more carefully, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſeveral new iſlands, with which Behring and Tſchirikow had not fallen in. Though they did not proceed ſo far to the eaſt as to reviſit the country which Behring and Tſchirikow ſuppoſed to be part of the American continent, yet, by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a courſe conſiderably to the north of theirs, they corrected ſome capital miſtakes into which their predeceſſors had fallen, and have contributed to facilitate the progreſs of future navigators in thoſe ſeas<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLII.</note>.</p>

Some tribe, or ſome families of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Tartars, from the reſtleſs ſpirit peculiar to their race, might migrate to the neareſt iſlands, and, rude as their knowledge of navigation was, might, by paſſing from one to the other, reach at length the coaſt of America, and give a beginning to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation in that continent. The diſtance between the Marian or Ladrone iſlands and the neareſt land in Aſia, is greater than that between the part of America which the Ruſſians diſcovered, and the coaſt of Kamchatka; and yet the inhabitants of thoſe iſlands are manifeſtly of Aſiatic extract. If, notwithſtanding their remote ſituation, we admit that the Marian iſlands were peopled from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, diſtance alone is no reaſon why we ſhould heſitate about admitting that the Americans may derive their original from the ſame ſource. It is probable that future navigators in thoſe ſeas, by ſteering farther to the north, may find that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America approaches ſtill nearer to Aſia. According to the information of the barbarous people who inhabit the country about the north-eaſt promontory of Aſia, there lies, off the coaſt, a ſmall iſland, to which they fall in leſs than a day. From that, they can deſcry a large continent, which, according to their deſcription, is covered with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and poſſeſſed by people whoſe language they do not underſtand<note n="†" place="bottom">Muller's Voyages et Decouv. i. 166.</note>.

The Eſquimaux are the only people in America, who, in their aſpect or character, bear any reſemblance to the northern Europeans. They are manifeſtly a race of men, diſtinct from all the nations of the American con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, in language, in diſpoſition, and in habits of life. Their original then, may warrantably be traced up to that ſource, which I have pointed out. But, among all the other inhabitants of America, there is ſuch a ſtriking ſimilitude in the form of their bodies, and the qualities of their minds, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diverſities occaſioned by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of climate, or unequal progreſs in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we muſt pronounce them to be deſcended from one ſource. There may be a variety in the ſhades, but we can every where trace the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal colour. Each tribe has ſomething peculiar which diſtinguiſhes it, but in all of them we diſcern certain features common to the whole race. It is remarkable, that in every peculiarity, whether in their perſons or diſpoſitions, which characteriſe the Americans, they have ſome reſemblance to the rude tribes ſcattered over the north-eaſt of Aſia, but almoſt none to the nations ſettled in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremities of Europe. We may, therefore, refer them to the former origin, and conclude that their Aſiatic progenitors, having ſettled in thoſe parts of America, where the Ruſſians have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the proximity of the two continents, ſpread gradually over its various regions. This account of the progreſs of population in America, coincides with the traditions of the Mexicans concerning their own origin, which, imperfect as they are, were preſerved with more accuracy, and merit greater

The Mexicans point out their various ſtations as they advanced from this, into the interior pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and it is preciſely the ſame route which they muſt have held, if they had been emigrants from Aſia.

had made ſuch progreſs in true ſcience, as inſpires enlarged and liberal ſentiments. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors of the New World were moſtly illiterate adventurers, deſtitute of all the ideas which ſhould have directed them in contemplating objects, ſo extremely different from thoſe with which they were acquainted. Surrounded continually with danger, or ſtruggling with hardſhips, they had little leiſure, and leſs capacity, for any ſpeculative inquiry. Eager to take poſſeſſion of a country of ſuch extent and opulence, and happy in finding it occupied by inhabitants ſo incapable to defend it, they haſtily pronounced them to be a wretched order of men, formed merely for ſervitude; and were more employed in computing the profits of their labour, than in inquiring into the operations of their minds, or the reaſons of their cuſtoms and inſtitutions. The perſons who penetrated at ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent periods into the interior provinces, to which the knowledge and devaſtations of the firſt conquerors did not reach, were generally of a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar character; brave and enterpriſing in an high degree, but ſo uninformed as to be little qualified either for obſerving or deſcribing what they beheld.</p>
                  <p>NOT only the incapacity,<note place="margin">and their prejudices;</note> but the prejudices of the Spaniards, render their accounts of the people of America extremely defective. Soon after they planted colonies in their new conqueſts, a difference in opinion aroſe with reſpect to the treatment of the natives. One party, ſolicitous to render their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude perpetual, repreſented them as a brutiſh, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate race, incapable either of acquiring religious knowledge, or of being trained to the functions of ſocial life. The other, full of pious concern for their converſion, contended that, though rude and ignorant, they were gentle, affectionate, docile, and by proper inſtructions and regulations might be formed gradually into good Chriſtians and uſeful

This controverſy, as I have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, was carried on with all the warmth which is natural, when attention to intereſt on the one hand, and religious zeal on the other, animate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants.

Thoſe repugnant accounts increaſe the difficulty of attaining a perfect knowledge of their character, and render it neceſſary to peruſe all the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them by Spaniſh writers with diſtruſt, and to receive their information with ſome grains of allowance.</p>

At length, they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the contemplation of the condition and character of the Americans in their original ſtate, tended to complete our knowledge of the human ſpecies, might enable us to fill up a conſiderable chaſm in the hiſtory of its progreſs, and lead to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations no leſs curious than important. They entered upon this new field of ſtudy with great ardour; but, inſtead of throwing light upon the ſubject, they have contributed, in ſome degree, to involve it in additional obſcurity. Too impatient to inquire, they haſtened to decide; and began to erect ſyſtems, when they ſhould have been ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for facts on which to eſtabliſh their foundations. Struck with the appearance of degeneracy in the human ſpecies throughout the New World, and aſtoniſhed at beholding a vaſt continent occupied by a naked, feeble, and ignorant race of men, ſome authors of great name have maintained, that

this part of the globe had but lately emerged from the ſea, and become fit for the reſidence of man, that every thing in it bore marks of a recent origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and that its inhabitants, lately called into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and ſtill at the beginning of their career, were unworthy to be compared with the people of a more ancient and improved continent<note n="*" place="bottom">M. de Buffon Hiſt.

Others have imagined, that, under the influence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly climate, which checks and enervates the principle of life, man never attained in America the perfection which belongs to his nature, but remained an animal of an inferior order, defective in the vigour of his bodily frame, and deſtitute of ſenſibility, as well as of force, in the operations of his mind<note n="†" place="bottom">M. de P.

In oppoſition to both theſe, other phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have ſuppoſed that man arrives at his higheſt dignity and excellence long before he reaches a ſtate of refinement; and, in the rude ſimplicity of ſavage life, diſplays an elevation of ſentiment, an independence of mind, and a warmth of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, for which it is vain to ſearch among the members of poliſhed ſocieties<note n="‡" place="bottom">M.

                     <note place="margin">Method obſerved in the inquiry.</note>IN order to conduct this enquiry with greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, it ſhould be rendered as ſimple as poſſible. Man exiſted as an individual before he became the member of a community; and the qualities which belong to him under his former capacity ſhould be known, before we proceed to examine thoſe which ariſe from the latter relation. This is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly neceſſary in inveſtigating the manners of rude nations. Their political union is ſo incomplete, their civil inſtitutions and regulations ſo few, ſo ſimple, and of ſuch ſlender authority, that men in this ſtate ought to be viewed rather as independent agents, than as members of a regular ſociety. The character of a ſavage reſults almoſt entirely from his ſentiments or feelings as an individual, and is but little influenced by his imperfect ſubjection to government and order. I ſhall conduct my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches concerning the manners of the Americans in this natural order, proceeding gradually from what is ſimple to what is more complicated.</p>

THE bodily conſtitution of the Americans.<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>— The human body is leſs affected by climate than that of any other animal. Some animals are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a particular region of the globe, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not exiſt beyond it; others, though they may be brought to bear the injuries of a climate foreign to them, ceaſe to multiply when carried out of that diſtrict which Nature deſtined to be their manſion. Even ſuch as ſeem capable of being naturalized in various climates, feel the effect of every remove from their proper ſtation, and gradually dwindle and degenerate from the vigour and perfection pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to their ſpecies. Man is the only living creature whoſe frame is at once ſo hardy and ſo flexible, that he can ſpread over the whole earth, become the inhabitant of every region, and thrive and multiply under every climate. Subject, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to the general law of Nature, the human body is not entirely exempt from the operation of climate; and when expoſed to the extremes either of heat or cold, its ſize or vigour diminiſhes.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt appearance of the inhabitants of the New World,<note place="margin">Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</note> filled the diſcoverers with ſuch aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that they were apt to imagine them a race of men different from thoſe of the other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere. Their complexion is of a reddiſh brown, nearly reſembling the colour of copper<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo Somario, p. 46, D. Life of Columbus, c. 24.</note>. The hair of their heads is always black, long, coarſe, and uncurled. They have no beard, and every part of their body is perfectly ſmooth. Their perſons are
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:034476_0320_0FFDD74B93FD0120"/>
of a full ſize, extremely ſtraight and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLIV.</note>. Their features are regular, though often diſtorted by abſurd endeavours to improve the beauty of their natural form,<note place="margin">More fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> or to render their aſpect more dreadful to their enemies. In the iſlands, where four-footed animals were both few and ſmall, and the earth yielded her productions almoſt ſpontaneouſly, the conſtitution of the natives, neither braced by the active exerciſes of the chace, nor invigorated by the labour of cultivation, was extremely feeble and languid. On the continent, where the foreſts abound with game of various kinds, and the chief occupation of many tribes was to purſue it, the human frame acquired greater firmneſs. Still, however, the Americans were more remarkable for agility than ſtrength. They reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled beaſts of prey, rather than animals formed for labour<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE XLV.</note>. They were not only averſe to toil, but incapable of it; and when rouzed by force from their native indolence, and compelled to work, they ſunk under taſks which the people of the other continent would have performed with eaſe<note n="‡" place="bottom">Oviedo Som. p. 51, C. Voy. de Correal, ii. 138. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer's Deſcription, p. 131.</note>.

                  <p>THE beardleſs countenance and ſmooth ſkin of the American ſeems to indicate a defect of vigour, occaſioned by ſome vice in his frame. He is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of one ſign of manhood and of ſtrength. This peculiarity, by which the inhabitants of the New

Hiſt, de Nouv. Fr. iii. 310.</note>. For though the food of many Americans be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely inſipid, as they are altogether unacquainted with the uſe of ſalt, rude tribes in other parts of the earth have ſubſiſted on aliments equally ſimple, without this mark of degradation, or any apparent ſymptom of a diminution in their vigour.</p>
                  <p>AS the external form of the Americans leads us to ſuſpect that there is ſome natural debility in their frame,<note place="margin">Leſs appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</note> the ſmallneſs of their appetite for food has been mentioned by many authors as a confirmation of this ſuſpicion. The quantity of food which men conſume varies according to the temperature of the climate in which they live, the degree of activity which they exert, and the natural vigour of their conſtitutions. Under the enervating heat of the torrid zone, and when men paſs their days in indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and eaſe, they require leſs nouriſhment than the active inhabitants of temperate or cold countries. But neither the warmth of their climate, nor their extreme lazineſs, will account for the uncommon defect of appetite among the Americans. The Spaniards were aſtoniſhed with obſerving this, not only in the iſlands, but in ſeveral parts of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The conſtitutional temperance of the natives far exceeded, in their opinion, the abſtinence of the moſt mortified hermits<note n="†" place="bottom">Ramuſio, iii. 304, F. 306, A.

to the charms of beauty, and the power of love. That paſſion which was deſtined to perpetuate life, to be the bond of ſocial union, and the ſource of tenderneſs and joy, is the moſt ardent in the human breaſt. Though the perils and hardſhips of the ſavage ſtate, though exceſſive fatigue, on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and the difficulty at all times of procuring ſubſiſtence, may ſeem to be adverſe to this paſſion, and to have a tendency to abate its vigour, yet the rudeſt nations in every other part of the globe ſeem to feel its influence more powerfully than the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the New World. The negro glows with all the warmth of deſire natural to his climate; and the moſt uncultivated Aſiatics diſcover that ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which from their ſituation on the globe, we ſhould expect them to have felt. But the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans are, in an amazing degree, ſtrangers to the force of this firſt inſtinct of nature. In every part of the New World the natives treat their women with coldneſs and indifference. They are neither the objects of that tender attachment which takes place in civilized ſociety, nor of that ardent deſire conſpicuous among rude nations. Even in climates where this paſſion uſually acquires its greateſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, the ſavage of America views his female with diſdain, as an animal of a leſs noble ſpecies.

                        </gap> to there</note> there is not a more common or more ſeducing error, than that of aſcribing to a ſingle cauſe, thoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic peculiarities, which are the effect of the combined operation of many cauſes. The climate and ſoil of America differ, in ſo many reſpects, from thoſe of the other hemiſphere, and this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo obvious and ſtriking, that philoſophers of great eminence have laid hold on this as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to account for what is peculiar in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of its inhabitants. They reſt on phyſical cauſes alone, and conſider the feeble frame and languid deſire of the Americans, as conſequences of the temperament of that portion of the globe which they occupy. But the influences of political and moral cauſes ought not to have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked. Theſe operate with no leſs effect than that on which many philoſophers reſt as a full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the ſingular appearances which have been mentioned. Wherever the ſtate of ſociety is ſuch as to create many wants and deſires, which cannot be ſatisfied without regular exertions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, the body accuſtomed to labour, becomes robuſt and patient of fatigue. In a more ſimple ſtate, where the demands of men are ſo few and ſo moderate, that they may be gratified, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any effort, by the ſpontaneous productions of nature, the powers of the body are not called forth,
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:034476_0324_0FFDD7421F360D20"/>
nor can they attain their proper ſtrength. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Chili and of North-America, the two tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate regions in the New World, who live by hunting, may be deemed an active and vigorous race, when compared with the inhabitants of the iſles, or of thoſe parts of the continent where hardly any labour is requiſite to procure ſubſiſtence. The exertions of a hunter are not, however, ſo regular, or ſo continued, as thoſe of perſons employed in the culture of the earth, or in the various arts of civilized life, and though his agility may be greater than theirs, his ſtrength is on the whole inferior. If another direction were given to the active pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of man in the New World, and his force aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by exerciſe, he might acquire a degree of vigour which he does not in his preſent ſtate poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs. The truth of this is confirmed by experience. Wherever the Americans have been gradually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hard labour, their conſtitutions become robuſt, and they have been found capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſuch taſks, as ſeemed not only to exceed the powers of ſuch a feeble frame as has been deemed peculiar to their country, but to equal any effort of the natives, either of Africa or of Europe<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE ſame reaſoning will apply to what has been obſerved concerning their ſlender demand for food. As a proof that this ſhould be aſcribed as much to their extreme indolence, and often total want of occupation, as to any thing peculiar in the phyſical ſtructure of their bodies, it has been obſerved, that in thoſe diſtricts, where the people of America are obliged to exert any unuſual effort of activity, in order to procure ſubſiſtence, or wherever they are employed in ſevere labour, their appetite is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that of other men, and, in ſome places, it has ſtruck obſervers as remarkably voracious<note n="†" place="bottom">Gumilla, ii. 12.70.247.

                     <pb n="327" facs="unknown:034476_0325_0FFDD73F865DB708"/>THE operation of political and moral cauſes is ſtill more conſpicuous, in modifying the degree of attachment between the ſexes. In a ſtate of high civilization, this paſſion, inflamed by reſtraint, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by delicacy, and cheriſhed by faſhion, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies and engroſſes the heart. It is no longer a ſimple inſtinct of nature; ſentiment heightens the ardour of deſire, and the moſt tender emotions of which our frame is ſuſceptible, ſoothe and agitate the ſoul. This deſcription, however, applies only to thoſe, who, by their ſituation, are exempted from the cares and labours of life. Among perſons of inferior order, who are doomed by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to inceſſant toil, the dominion of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is leſs violent; their ſolicitude to procure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, and to provide for the firſt demand of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, leaves little leiſure for attending to its ſecond call. But if the nature of the intercourſe between the ſexes varies ſo much in perſons of different rank in poliſhed ſocieties, the condition of man, while he remains uncivilized, muſt occaſion a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation ſtill more apparent. We may well ſuppoſe, that amidſt the hardſhips, the dangers, and the ſimplicity of ſavage life, where ſubſiſtence is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways precarious, and often ſcanty, where men are almoſt continually engaged in the purſuit of their enemies, or in guarding againſt their attacks, and where neither dreſs nor reſerve are employed as arts of female allurement, that the attention of the Americans to their women would be extremely feeble, without imputing this ſolely to any phyſical defect or degradation in their frame.</p>
                  <p>IT is accordingly obſerved, that in thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of America, where, from the fertility of the ſoil, the mildneſs of the climate, or ſome farther advances which the natives have made in improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the means of ſubſiſtence are more abundant, and the hardſhips of ſavage life are leſs ſeverely

felt, the animal paſſion of the ſexes becomes more ardent. Striking examples of this occur among ſome tribes ſeated on the banks of great rivers well ſtored with food, among others who are maſters of hunting-grounds abounding ſo much with game, that they have a regular and plentiful ſupply of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment with little labour. The ſuperior degree of ſecurity and affluence which theſe tribes enjoy, is followed by their natural effects. The paſſions im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the human frame by the hand of nature acquire additional force; new taſtes and deſires are formed; the women, as they are more valued and admired, became more attentive to dreſs and ornament; the men, beginning to feel how much of their own happineſs depends upon them, no longer diſdain the arts of winning their favour and affection. The intercourſe of the ſexes becomes very different from that which takes place among their ruder countrymen; and as hardly any reſtraint is impoſed on the gratification of deſire, either by religion, or laws, or decency, the diſſolution of their manners is exceſſive<note n="*" place="bottom">Biet. 389.

Something, without doubt, may be aſcribed to the operation of theſe cauſes; but the true reaſons of this apparent advantage, which is common to all ſavage nations, lie deeper, and are cloſely inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the nature and genius of that ſtate. The infancy of man is ſo long and ſo helpleſs, that it is extremely difficult to rear children among rude nations. Their means of ſubſiſtence are not only ſcanty, but precarious. Such as live by hunting muſt range over extenſive countries, and ſhift often from place to place. The care of children, as well as every other laborious taſk, is devolved upon the women. The diſtreſſes and hardſhips of the ſavage life, which are often ſuch as can hardly be ſupported by perſons in full vigour, muſt be fatal to thoſe of more tender age. Afraid of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking a taſk ſo laborious, and of ſuch long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that of rearing their offspring, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in ſome parts of America, procure frequent abortions by the uſe of certain herbs, and extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the firſt ſparks of that life which they are unable to cheriſh<note n="†" place="bottom">Ellis's Voyage to Hudſon's Bay, 198.

Thus, in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſocieties, where the means of ſubſiſtence are ſecured with certainty, and acquired with eaſe; where the talents of the mind are often of more importance than the powers of the body; children are preſerved notwithſtanding their defects or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and grow up to be uſeful citizens.

In what part or membrane of the body that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour reſides which tinges the complexion of the negro with a deep black, it is the buſineſs of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts to enquire and deſcribe. The powerful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of heat appears manifeſtly to be the cauſe which produces this ſtriking variety in the human ſpecies. All Europe, a great part of Aſia, and the temperate countries of Africa, are inhabited by men of a white complexion. All the torrid zone in Africa, ſome of the warmer regions adjacent to it, and ſeveral countries in Aſia, are filled with people of a deep black colour. If we ſurvey the nations of our continent, making our progreſs from cold and temperate countries towards thoſe parts which are expoſed to the influence of vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and unremitting heat, we ſhall find, that the extreme whiteneſs of their ſkin ſoon begins to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh; that its colour deepens gradually as we advance; and after paſſing through all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive gradations of ſhade, terminates in an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unvarying black. But in America, where the agency of heat is checked and abated by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſes, which I have already explained, the climate ſeems to be deſtitute of that force which produces ſuch wonderful effects on the human frame. The colour of the natives of the torrid zone, in America, is hardly of a deeper hue than that of the people in the more temperate parts of their continent. Accurate obſervers, who had an opportunity of viewing the Americans in very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent climates, and in provinces far removed from each other, have been ſtruck with the amazing ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of their figure and aſpect<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLVII.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT though the hand of Nature has deviated ſo little from one ſtandard in faſhioning the human form in America, the creation of fancy hath been

various and extravagant, The ſame fables that were current in the ancient continent, have been revived with reſpect to the New World, and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica too has been peopled with human beings of monſtrous and fantaſtic appearance. The inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of certain provinces were deſcribed to be pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of three feet high; thoſe of others to be giants of an enormous ſize. Some travellers publiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of people with only one eye, others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have diſcovered men without heads, whoſe eyes and mouths were planted in their breaſts. The variety of Nature in her productions is, indeed, ſo great, that it is preſumptuous to ſet bounds to her fertility, and to reject indiſcriminately every relation that does not perfectly accord with our own limited obſervation and experience. But the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, of yielding a haſty aſſent, on the ſlighteſt evidence, to whatever has the appearance of being ſtrange and marvellous, is ſtill more unbecoming a philoſophical inquirer, as, in every period, men are more apt to be betrayed into error, by their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in believing too much, than by their arrogance in believing too little. In proportion as ſcience ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and nature is examined with a diſcerning eye, the wonders which amuſed ages of ignorance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear. The tales of credulous travellers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning America are forgotten; the monſters which they deſcribe have been ſearched for in vain; and thoſe provinces where they pretended to have found inhabitants of ſingular forms, are now known to be poſſeſſed by people no wiſe different from the other Americans.</p>
                  <p>THOUGH thoſe relations may, without diſcuſſion, be rejected as fabulous, there are other accounts of varieties in the human ſpecies in ſome parts of the New World, which reſt upon better evidence, and merit more attentive examination. This variety has been particularly obſerved in three different
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:034476_0331_0FFDD7350D7148C0"/>
diſtricts. The firſt of theſe is ſituated in the iſthmus of Darien, near the centre of America. Lionel Wafer, a traveller poſſeſſed of more curioſity and intelligence than we ſhould have expected to find in an aſſociate of Buccaneers, diſcovered there a race of men few in number, but of a ſingular make. They are of low ſtature, according to his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a feeble frame, incapable of enduring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. Their colour is a dead milk white; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling that of fair people among Europeans, but without any tincture of a bluſh or ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Their ſkin is covered with a fine hairy down of a chalky white, the hair of their heads, their eye-brows, and eye-laſhes, are of the ſame hue. Their eyes are of a ſingular form, and ſo weak, that they can hardly bear the light of the ſun; but they ſee clearly by moon-light, and are moſt active and gay in the night<note n="*" place="bottom">Wafer Deſcript. of Iſth. ap. Dampier, iii. p. 346.</note>. No race ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to this has been diſcovered in any other part of America. Cortes, indeed, found ſome perſons exactly reſembling the white people of Darien, among the rare and monſtrous animals which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma had collected<note n="†" place="bottom">Cortes ap. Ramuſ. iii. p. 241, E.</note>. But as the power of the Mexican empire extending to the provinces bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the iſthmus of Darien, they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably brought thence. Singular as the appearance of thoſe people may be, they cannot be conſidered as conſtituting a diſtinct ſpecies. Among the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes of Africa, as well as the natives of the Indian iſlands, nature ſometimes produces a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of individuals, with all the characteriſtic fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and qualities of the white people of Darien. The former are called <hi>Albinos</hi> by the Portugueſe, the latter <hi>Kackerlakes</hi> by the Dutch. In Darien the parents of thoſe Whites are of the ſame colour

with the other natives of the country; and this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation applies equally to the anomalous progeny of the negroes and Indians. The ſame mother who produces ſome children of a colour that does not belong to the race, brings forth the reſt with the complexion peculiar to her country<note n="*" place="bottom">Margrav. Hiſt. Rer. Nat. Braſ. lib. viii. c. 4.</note>. One concluſion may then be formed with reſpect to the people deſcribed by Wafer, the <hi>Albinos</hi> and <hi>Kack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlakes;</hi> they are a degenerated breed, not a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate claſs of men; and from ſome diſeaſe or defect of their parents, the peculiar colour and debility which mark their degradation are tranſmitted to them. As a deciſive proof of this, it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that neither the white people of Darien, nor the Albinos of Africa, propagate their race: their children are of the colour and tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment peculiar to the natives of their reſpective countries<note n="†" place="bottom">Wafer, p. 348.

                  <p>THE ſecond diſtrict that is occupied by inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants differing in appearance from the other people of America, is ſituated in a high northern latitude, extending from the coaſt of Labrador towards the pole, as far as the country is habitable.

                  <p>WE cannot decide with equal certainty concerning the inhabitants of the third diſtrict, ſituated at the ſouthern extremity of America.

But animals attain the higheſt perfection of their ſpecies, only in mild climates, or where they find the moſt nutritive food in greateſt abundance. It

The moſt explicit and unexceptionable evidence is requiſite, in order to eſtabliſh a fact repugnant to thoſe general principles and laws, which ſeem to affect the human frame in every other inſtance, and to decide with reſpect to its nature and qualities. Such evidence has not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been produced. Though ſeveral perſons, to whoſe teſtimony great reſpect is due, have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited this part of America ſince the time of Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, and have had interviews with the natives; though ſome have affirmed, that ſuch as they ſaw were of gigantic ſtature, and others have formed the ſame concluſion from meaſuring their footſteps, or from viewing the ſkeletons of their dead; yet their accounts vary from each other in ſo many eſſential points, and are mingled with ſo many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances manifeſtly falſe or fabulous, as detract much from their credit. On the other hand, ſome navigators, and thoſe among the moſt eminent of their order for diſcernment and accuracy, have aſſerted that the natives of Patagonia, with whom they had intercourſe, though ſtout and well-made, are not of ſuch extraordinary ſize as to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt of the human ſpecies <note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLIX.</note>. The exiſtence of this gigantic race of men ſeems, then, to be one of thoſe points in natural hiſtory, with reſpect to which a cautious inquirer will heſitate, and will chuſe to ſuſpend his aſſent until more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete evidence ſhall decide, whether he ought to admit a fact, ſeemingly inconſiſtent with what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

and experience have diſcovered concerning the ſtructure and condition of man, in all the various ſituations in which he has been obſerved.</p>
                  <p>IN order to form a complete idea with reſpect to the conſtitution of the inhabitants of this and the other hemiſphere,<note place="margin">Their ſtate of health.</note> we ſhould attend not only to the make and vigour of their bodies, but conſider what degree of health they enjoy, and to what period of longevity they uſually arrive. In the ſimplicity of the ſavage ſtate, when man is not oppreſſed with labour or enervated by luxury, or diſquieted with care, we are apt to imagine that his life will flow on almoſt untroubled by diſeaſe or ſuffering, until his days be terminated, in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans, as well as among other rude people, perſons, whoſe decrepit and ſhrivelled form ſeems to indicate an extraordinary length of life. But as moſt of them are unacquainted with the art of numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is paſt, they are improvident for what is to come, it is impoſſible to aſcertain their age, with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of preciſion <note n="*" place="bottom">Ulloa Notic. Americ. 323. Bancroft Nat. Hiſt. of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana, 334.</note>. It is evident, that the period of their longevity muſt vary conſiderably, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the diverſity of climate, and their different modes of ſubſiſtence. They ſeem, however, to be every where exempt from many of the diſtempers which afflict poliſhed nations. None of the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are the immediate offspring of luxury, ever viſited them; and they have no names in their languages by which to diſtinguiſh this numerous train of adventitious evils.</p>
                  <p>BUT, whatever be the ſituation in which man is placed, he is born to ſuffer; and his diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Diſeaſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> in the ſavage ſtate, though fewer in number, are, like
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:034476_0336_0FFDD79EED694E20"/>
thoſe of the animals whom he nearly reſembles in his mode of life, more violent, and more fatal. If luxury engenders and nouriſhes diſtempers of one ſpecies, the rigour and diſtreſſes of ſavage life bring on thoſe of another. As men, in this ſtate, are wonderfully improvident, and their means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence precarious, they often paſs from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according to the viſſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of fortune in the chaſe, or in conſequence of the various degree of abundance with which the earth affords to them its productions, in different ſeaſons. Their inconſiderate gluttony in the one ſituation, and their ſevere abſtinence in the other, are equally pernicious. For though the human conſtitution may be accuſtomed by habit, like that of animals of prey, to tolerate long famine, and then to gorge voraciouſly, it is not a little affected by ſuch ſudden and violent tranſitions. The ſtrength and vigour of ſavages are, at ſome ſeaſons, impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what they ſuffer from ſcarcity of food; at others they are afflicted with diſorders ariſing from indigeſtion and a ſuperfluity of groſs aliment. Theſe are ſo common, that they may be conſidered as the unavoidable conſequence of their mode of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, and cut off conſiderable numbers in the prime of life. They are likewiſe extremely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to conſumptions, to pleuritic, aſthmatic, and paralytic diſorders<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 364. Laſitau, ii, 360.

or tends moſt to abridge human life. The influence of the former is certainly moſt extenſive. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequences of luxury reach only a few members in any community, the diſtreſſes of ſavage life are felt by all. As far as I can judge, after very minute enquiry, the general period of human life is ſhorter among ſavages, than in well-regulated and induſtrious ſocieties.</p>
                  <p>ONE dreadful malady, the ſevereſt ſcourge, with which, in this life, offended Heaven chaſtens the indulgence of criminal deſire, ſeems to have been peculiar to the Americans. By communicating it to their conquerors, they have not only amply avenged their own wrongs, but by adding this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity to thoſe which formerly imbittered human life, they have, perhaps, more than counterbalanced all the benefits which Europe has derived from the diſcovery of the New World. This diſtemper, from the country in which it firſt raged, or from the people by whom it was ſuppoſed to have been ſpread over Europe, has been ſometimes called the Neapolitan, and ſometimes the French diſeaſe. At its firſt appearance, the infection was ſo malignant, its ſymptoms ſo violent, its operations ſo rapid and fatal, as to baſſlle all the efforts of medical ſkill. Aſtoniſhment and terror accompanied this unknown affliction in its progreſs, and men began to dread the extinction of the human race by ſuch a cruel viſitation. Experience, and the ingenuity of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, gradually diſcovered remedies of ſuch vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as to cure or to mitigate the evil. During the courſe of two centuries and a half, its virulence ſeems to have abated conſiderably. At length, in the ſame manner with the leproſy, which raged in Europe for ſome centuries, it may waſte its force and diſappear; and in ſome happier age, this weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern infection, like that from the eaſt, may be known only by deſcription<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE L.</note>.</p>

With reſpect to it, too, there is a period of infancy, during which ſeveral powers of the mind are not unfolded, and all are feeble and defective in their operation. In the early ages of ſociety, while the condition of man is ſimple and rude, his reaſon is but little exerciſed, and his deſires move within a very narrow ſphere. Hence ariſe two remarkable characteriſtics of the human mind in this ſtate. Its intellectual powers are extremely limited; its emotions and efforts are few and languid.

His thoughts extend not beyond what relates to animal life, and when they are not directed towards ſome of its concerns, his mind is totally inactive. In ſituations where no extraordinary effort either of ingenuity or labour is requiſite, in order to ſatisfy the ſimple demands of nature, the powers of the mind are ſo ſeldom rouſed to any exertion, that the rational faculties continue almoſt dormant and unexerciſed. The numerous tribes ſcattered over the rich plains of South-America, the inhabitants of ſome of the iſlands, and of ſeveral fertile regions on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, come under this deſcription. Their vacant countenance, their ſtaring unexpreſſive eye, their liſtleſs inattention, and total ignorance of ſubjects, which ſeem to be the firſt which ſhould occupy the thoughts of rational beings, made ſuch impreſſion upon the Spaniards, when they firſt beheld thoſe rude people, that they conſidered them as animals of an inferior order, and could not believe that they belonged to the human ſpecies<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. 2. c. 15.</note>.

But in ſeverer climates, where ſubſiſtence cannot be procured with the ſame eaſe, where men muſt unite more cloſely, and act with greater concert, neceſſity calls forth their talents, and ſharpens their invention, ſo that the intellectual powers are more exerciſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The North-American tribes and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Chili, who inhabit the temperate regions in the two great diſtricts of America, are people of cultivated and enlarged underſtandings, when viewed in compariſon with ſome of thoſe ſeated in the iſlands, or on the banks of the Maragnon and Orinoco. Their occupations are more various, their ſyſtem of policy, as well as of war, more complex, their arts more numerous. But, even among them, the intellectual powers are extremely limited in their operations, and unleſs when turned directly to thoſe objects which intereſt a ſavage, are held in no eſtimation. Both the North-Americans and Chileſe, when not engaged in ſome of the functions belonging to a warrior or hunter, loiter away their time in thoughtleſs indolence, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with any other ſubject worthy of their attention, or capable of occupying their minds<note n="*" place="bottom">Lafitau, ii. 2.</note>.

                  <p>THIS deſcription, however,<note place="margin">Some va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety with reſpect to all theſe.</note> applies only to ſome tribes. Man cannot continue long in this ſtate of feeble and uninformed infancy. He was made for induſtry and action, and the powers of his nature, as well as the neceſſity of his condition, urge him to fulfil his deſtiny. Accordingly, among moſt of the American nations, eſpecially thoſe ſeated in rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous climates, ſome efforts are employed, and ſome previous precautions are taken, for ſecuring ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The career of regular induſtry is begun, and the laborious arm has made the firſt eſſays of its power. Still, however, the improvident and ſlothful genius of the ſavage ſtate predominates. Even among thoſe more improved tribes, labour is deemed ignominious and degrading. It is only to work of a certain kind that a man will deign to put his hand. The greater part is devolved entirely upon the women. One half of the community re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains inactive, while the other is oppreſſed with the multitude and variety of its occupations. Thus their induſtry is partial, and the foreſight which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates it, is no leſs limited. A remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this occurs in the chief arrangement with reſpect to their manner of living. They depend for their ſubſiſtence, during one part of the year, on fiſhing; during another, on hunting; during a third, on the produce of their agriculture. Though

                     <note place="margin">Domeſtic union.</note>THE domeſtic ſtate is the firſt and moſt ſimple form of human aſſociation. The union of the ſexes, among different animals, is of longer or ſhorter duration in proportion to the eaſe or difficulty of rearing their offspring. Among thoſe tribes where the ſeaſon of infancy is ſhort, and the young
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:034476_0347_0FFDD7B2BA713650"/>
ſoon acquire vigour or agility, no permanent union is formed. Nature commits the care of training up the offspring to the mother alone, and her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, without any other aſſiſtance, is equal to the taſk. But where the ſtate of infancy is long and helpleſs, and the joint aſſiduity of both parents is requiſite in tending their feeble progeny, there a more intimate connexion takes place, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues until the purpoſe of nature be accompliſhed, and the new race grow up to full maturity. As the infancy of man is more feeble and helpleſs than that of any other animal, and he is dependent, during a much longer period, on the care and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of his parents, the union between huſband and wife came early to be conſidered, not only as a ſolemn, but as a permanent contract. A general ſtate of promiſcuous intercourſe between the ſexes, never exiſted but in the imagination of poets. In the infancy of ſociety, when men, deſtitute of arts and induſtry, lead a hard precarious life, the rearing of their progeny demands the attention and efforts of both parents; and if their union had not been formed and continued with this view, the race could not have been preſerved. Accordingly, in America, even among the rudeſt tribes, a regular union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween huſband and wife was univerſal, and the rights of marriage were underſtood and recognized. In thoſe diſtricts where ſubſiſtence was ſcanty, and the difficulty of maintaining a family was great, the man confined himſelf to one wife. In warmer and more fertile provinces, the facility of procuring food concurred with the influence of climate, in inducing the inhabitants to increaſe the number of their wives<note n="*" place="bottom">Lettr.

Whether man has been improved by the progreſs of arts and civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lization in ſociety, is a queſtion, which, in the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs of diſputation, has been agitated among philoſophers. That women are indebted to the refinements of poliſhed manners for a happy change in their ſtate, is a point which can admit of no doubt. To deſpiſe and to degrade the female ſex, is the characteriſtic of the ſavage ſtate in every part of the globe. Man, proud of excelling in ſtrength and in courage, the chief marks of pre-eminence among rude people, treats woman, as an inferior, with diſdain. The Americans, perhaps from that coldneſs and inſenſibility which has been conſidered as peculiar to their conſtitution, add neglect and harſhneſs to contempt. The moſt intelligent tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers have been ſtruck with this inattention of the Americans to their women. It is not, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved, by a ſtudied diſplay of tenderneſs and attachment, that the American endeavours to gain the heart of the woman whom he wiſhes to marry. Marriage itſelf, inſtead of being an union of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and intereſts between equals, becomes, among, them, the unnatural conjunction of a maſter with his ſlave.

This occupation was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the men. They were trained to it from their earlieſt youth.

Among ſeveral tribes, their young men were not permitted to marry, until they had given ſuch proofs of their ſkill in hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as put it beyond doubt that they were capable of providing for a family. Their ingenuity, always on the ſtretch, and ſharpened by emulation, as well as neceſſity, has ſtruck out many inventions, which greatly facilitate ſucceſs in the chaſe. The moſt ſingular of theſe is the diſcovery of a poiſon in which they dip the arrows employed in hunting. The ſlighteſt wound with thoſe envenomed ſhafts is mortal. If they only pierce the ſkin, the blood fixes and congeals in a moment, and the ſtrongeſt animal falls motionleſs to the ground. Nor does this poiſon, notwithſtanding its violence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety, inſect the fleſh of the animal which it kills. That may be eaten with perfect ſafety, and retains its native reliſh and qualities.

the chief object of culture among the hunting tribe on the continent of America, and with a moderate exertion of active and provident induſtry, theſe might have yielded a ſupply to the wants of a numerous people. But men, accuſtomed to the free and vagrant life of hunters, are incapable of regular application to labour; and conſider agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture as a ſecondary and inferior occupation. Accordingly, the proviſion for ſubſiſtence, ariſing from cultivation, was ſo limited and ſcanty among the Americans, that, upon any accidental failure of their uſual ſucceſs in hunting, they were often reduced to extreme diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>IN the iſlands, the mode of ſubſiſting was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably different. None of the large animals which abound on the continent were known there. Only four ſpecies of quadrupeds, beſides a kind of ſmall dumb dog, exiſted in the iſlands, the biggeſt of which did not exceed the ſize of a rabbit<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. xii. in proem.</note> To hunt ſuch diminutive prey, was an occupation which required no effort either of activity or courage. The chief employment of a hunter in the iſles was to kill birds, which on the continent are deemed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble game, and left chiefly to the purſuit of boys<note n="†" place="bottom">Ribas Hiſt. de los Triumph. p. 13. De la Potherie, ii. 33. iii 20.</note>. This want of animals, as well as their peculiar ſituation, led the iſlanders to depend principally upon fiſhing for their ſubſiſtence<note n="‡" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. xiii. c. 1. Gomara, Hiſt. Gener. c. 28.</note>. Their rivers, and the ſea with which they are ſurrounded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with this ſpecies of food. At ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſeaſons, turtles, crabs, and other ſhell-fiſh, abounded in ſuch numbers, that the natives could ſupport themſelves with a facility in which their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence delighted<note n="§" place="bottom">Gomara Hiſt.

and various reptiles of odious forms<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo, lib. xiii. c. 3.</note>. To fiſhing, the inhabitants of the iſlands added ſome degree of agriculture. Maize<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE LX.</note>, manico, and other plants, were cultivated in the ſame manner as on the continent. But all the fruits of their induſtry,<note place="margin">Their agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry limited.</note> together with what their ſoil and climate produced ſpontaneouſly, afforded them but a ſcanty mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

If a few Spaniards ſettled in any diſtrict, ſuch a ſmall addition of ſupernume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary mouths ſoon exhauſted their ſcanty ſtores, and brought on a famine.</p>
                  <p>TWO circumſtances,<note place="margin">Two cauſes of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection.</note> common to all the ſavage nations of America, concurred with thoſe which I have already mentioned, not only in rendering their agriculture imperfect, but in circumſcribing their power in all their operations.

The Tartar follows his prey on the horſe which he has reared; or tends his numerous herds, which furniſh him both with food and clothing; the Arab has rendered the camel docile, and avails himſelf of its perſevering ſtrength; the Laplander has formed the rein-deer to be ſubſervient to his will; and even the people of Kamchatka have trained their dogs to labour. This command over the inferior creatures is one of the nobleſt prerogatives of man, and among the greateſt efforts of his wiſdom and power. Without this, his dominion is incomplete. He is a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who has no ſubjects; a maſter, without ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,

and muſt perform every operation by the ſtrength of his own arm. Such was the condition of all the rude nations in America. Their reaſon was ſo little improved, or their union ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, that they ſeem not to have been conſcious of the ſuperiority of their nature, and ſuffered all the animal creation to retain its liberty, without eſtabliſhing their own authority over any one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Moſt of the animals, indeed, which have been rendered domeſtic in our continent, do not exiſt in the New World; but thoſe peculiar to it are neither ſo fierce, nor ſo forminable, as to have exempted them from ſervitude. There are ſome animals of the ſame ſpecies in both continents. But the rein-deer, which has been tamed and broken to the yoke in the one hemiſphere, runs wild in the other. The <hi>biſon</hi> of America is manifeſtly of the ſame ſpecies with the horned cattle of the other he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere<note n="*" place="bottom">Buffon, Artic. <hi>Biſon.</hi>

                     <pb n="365" facs="unknown:034476_0363_0FFDD7DB9AD9C780"/>THIS, perhaps, is the moſt notable diſtinction between the inhabitants of the Ancient and New Worlds, and a high pre-eminence of civilized men above ſuch as continue rude. The greateſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man in changing and improving the face of nature, as well as his moſt conſiderable efforts in cultivating the earth, are accompliſhed by means of the aid which he receives from the animals whom he has tamed and employs in labour. It is by their ſtrength that he ſubdues the ſtubborn ſoil, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the deſert or marſh into a fruitful field. But man, in his civilized ſtate, is ſo accuſtomed to the ſervice of the domeſtic animals, that he ſeldom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon the vaſt benefits which he derives from it. If we were to ſuppoſe to him, even when moſt improved, to be deprived of their uſeful miniſtry, his empire over nature muſt in ſome meaſure ceaſe, and he would remain a feeble animal, at a loſs how to ſubſiſt, and incapable of attempting ſuch arduous undertakings as their aſſiſtance enables him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with eaſe.</p>
                  <p>IT is a doubtful point,<note place="margin">Want of the uſeful metals.</note> whether the dominion of man over the animal creation, or his acquiring the uſe of metals, has contributed moſt to extend his power. The aera of this important diſcovery is unknown, and in our hemiſphere very remote. It is only by tradition, or by digging up ſome rude inſtruments of our forefathers, that we learn that mankind were originally unacquainted with the uſe of metals, and endeavoured to ſupply the want of them by employing flints, ſhells, bones, and other hard ſubſtances, for the ſame purpoſes which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals ſerve among poliſhed nations. Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes the formation of ſome metals. Gold, ſilver, and copper, are found in their perfect ſtate in the clefts of rocks, in the ſides of mountains, or the channels of rivers. Theſe were accordingly the metals firſt known, and firſt applied to uſe. But
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:034476_0364_0FFDD788938139A0"/>
iron, the moſt ſerviceable of all, and to which man is moſt indebted, is never diſcovered in its perfect form; its groſs and ſtubborn ore muſt feel twice the force of fire, and go through two laborious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, before it become fit for uſe. Man was long acquainted with the other metals, before he acquired the art of fabricating iron, or attained ſuch ingenuity as to perfect an invention, to which he is indebted for thoſe inſtruments wherewith he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the earth, and commands all its inhabitants. But in this, as well as in many other reſpects, the inferiority of the Americans was conſpicuous. All the ſavage tribe, ſcattered over the continent and iſlands, were totally unacquainted with the metals which their ſoil produced in great abundance, if we except ſome trifling quantity of gold, which they picked up in the torrents that deſcended from their mountains, and formed into ornaments. Their devices to ſupply this want of the ſerviceable metals, were extremely rude and awkward. The moſt ſimple operation was to them an undertaking of immenſe difficulty and labour. To fell a tree with no other inſtruments than hatchets of ſtone, was employment for a month <note n="*" place="bottom">Gumilla, iii. 196.</note>. To form a canoe into ſhape, and to hollow it, conſumed years, and it frequently began to rot before they were able to finiſh it<note n="†" place="bottom">Borde Relat. des Caraibes, p. 22.</note>. Their operations in agriculture were equally ſlow and defective. In a country covered with woods of the hardeſt timber, the clearing of a ſmall field deſtined for culture required the united efforts of a tribe, and was a work of much time and great toil. This was the buſineſs of the men and their indolence was ſatisfied with performing it in a very ſlovenly manner. The labour of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was left to the women, who, after digging, or
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:034476_0365_0FFDD7DE32E3D118"/>
rather ſtirring the field, with wooden mattocks, and ſtakes hardened in the fire, ſowed or planted it; but they were more indebted for the increaſe to the fertility of the ſoil, than to their own rude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry<note n="*" place="bottom">Gumilla, iii. 166, &amp;c. Lettr. Edif. xii. 10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AGRICULTURE, even when the ſtrength of man is ſeconded by that of the animals which he has ſubjected to the yoke, and his power augmented by the uſe of the various inſtruments with which the diſcovery of metals has furniſhed him, is ſtill a work of great labour; and it is with the ſweat of his brow that he renders the earth fertile. It is not wonderful, then, that people deſtitute of both theſe advantages ſhould have made ſo little progreſs in cultivation, that they muſt be conſidered as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending for ſubſiſtence on fiſhing and hunting, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than on the fruits of their own labour.</p>

Accordingly, if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from north to ſouth along the continent of America, ſhe ſhall find the power of thoſe veſted with authority gradually increaſing, and the ſpirit of the people becoming more tame and paſſive. In Florida, the authority of the ſachems, caziques, or chiefs was not only permanent, but hereditary.

Among the Natchez, a powerful tribe now extinct,<note place="margin">Among the Natchez.</note> formerly ſituated on the banks of the Miſſiſippi, a difference of rank took place, with which the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern tribes were altogether unacquainted.

comes with profound humility and offers him his head. Nor does the dominion of the Chiefs end with their lives; their principal officers, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite wives, together with many domeſtics of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior rank, are ſacrificed at their tombs, that they may be attended in the next world by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who ſerved them in this; and ſuch is the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in which they are held, that thoſe victims wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death with exultation, deeming it a recompence of their fidelity, and a mark of diſtinction, to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to accompany their deceaſed maſter<note n="*" place="bottom">Dumont Memoir.

as in the iſles. In Bogota, which is now a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the new kingdom of Granada, there was ſettled a nation, more conſiderable in number and more improved in the various arts of life, than any in America except the Mexicans and Peruvians. The people of Bogota ſubſiſted chiefly by agriculture. The idea of property was introduced among them, and its rights, ſecured by laws, handed down by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and obſerved with great care<note n="*" place="bottom">Piedrahita Hiſt. de las Conquiſt del N.

They were clothed in a decent manner, and their houſes may be termed commodious, when compared with thoſe of the ſmall tribes around them. The effects of this uncommon civilization were conſpicuous. Government had aſſumed a regular form. A juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was eſtabliſhed, which took cognizance of different crimes, and puniſhed them with rigour. A diſtinction of ranks was known; their chief, to whom the Spaniards gave the title of monarch, and who merited that name on account of his ſplendour as well as power, reign with abſolute authority. He was attended by officers of various conditions, he never appeared in public without a numerous reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue; he was carried in a ſort of palanquin with much pomp, and harbingers went before him to ſweep the road and ſtrew it with flowers. This uncommon pomp was ſupported by preſents or taxes received from his ſubjects, to whom their prince was ſuch an object of veneration, that none of them preſumed to look him directly in the face, or ever approached him but with an averted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. i. c. 2. lib. v. c. 56.

                     <note place="margin">Cauſes of thoſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.</note>IT is not eaſy to point out the circumſtances, or to diſcover the cauſes which contributed to introduce and eſtabliſh among each of thoſe people a form of government ſo different from that of the tribes around them, and ſo repugnant to the genius of rude nations. If the perſons who had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obſerving them in their original ſtate, had been more attentive and more diſcerning, we might have received information from their conquerors ſufficient to guide us in this enquiry. If the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of people, unacquainted with the uſe of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were not involved in impenetrable obſcurity, we might have derived ſome information from this domeſtic ſource. But as nothing ſatisfactory can be gathered, either from the accounts of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, or from their own traditions, we muſt have recourſe to conjectures, in order to explain the irregular appearances in the political ſtate of the people whom I have mentioned. As all thoſe tribes which had loſt then native liberty and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence were ſeated in the Torrid Zone, or in countries approaching to it, the climate may be ſuppoſed to have had ſome influence in forming their minds to that ſervitude, which ſeems to be the deſtiny of man in thoſe regions of the globe. But though the influence of climate, more powerful than that of any other natural cauſe, is not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked; that alone cannot be admitted as a ſolution of the point in queſtion. The operations of men are ſo complex, that we muſt not attribute the form which they aſſume, to the force of a ſingle prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or cauſe. Although deſpotiſm be confined in America to the Torrid Zone, and to the warm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:034476_0377_0FFDD7FF09DDCD78"/>
bordering upon it, I have already obſerved that theſe countries contain various tribes, ſome of which poſſeſs a high degree of freedom, and others are altogether unacquainted with the reſtraints of government. The indolence and timidity peculiar to the inhabitants of the iſlands, render them ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the ſentiments or efforts neceſſary for maintaining independence, that there is no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſearch for any other cauſe of their tame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the will of a ſuperior. The ſubjection of the Natchez, and of the people of Bogota, ſeems to have been the conſequence of a difference in their ſtate from that of the other Americans. They were ſettled nations, reſiding conſtantly in one place. Hunting was not the chief occupation of the former, and the latter ſeem hardly to have truſted to it for any part of their ſubſiſtence. Both had made ſuch progreſs in agriculture and arts, that the idea of property was introduced in ſome degree in the one community, and fully eſtabliſhed in the other. Among people in this ſtate, avarice and ambition have acquired objects, and have begun to exert their power; views of intereſt allure the ſelfiſh; the deſire of pre-eminence excites the enterpriſing; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is courted by both; and paſſions unknown to man in his ſavage ſtate prompt the intereſted and ambitious to encroach on the rights of their fellow-citizens. Motives, with which rude nations are equally unacquainted, induce the people to ſubmit tamely to the uſurped authority of their ſuperiors. But even among nations in this ſtate, the ſpirit of ſubjects could not have been rendered ſo obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or the power of rulers ſo unbounded without the intervention of ſuperſtition. By its fatal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the human mind, in every ſtage of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, is depreſſed, and its native vigour and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence ſubdued. Whoever can acquire the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of this formidable engine, is ſecure of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion

over his ſpecies. Unfortunately for the people whoſe inſtitutions are the ſubject of enquiry, this power was in the hands of their chiefs. The caziques of the iſles could put what reſponſes they pleaſed into the mouths of their <hi>Cemis</hi> or gods; and it was by their interpoſition, and in their name, that they impoſed any tribute or burden on their people<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 3.</note>. The ſame power and prerogative was exerciſed by the great chief of the Natchez as the principal miniſter as well as the repreſentative of the Sun, their deity. The reſpect which the people of Bogota paid to their monarchs was likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by religion, and the heir apparent of the kingdom was educated in the innermoſt receſs of their principal tempel, under ſuch auſtere diſcipline, and with ſuch peculiar rites, as tended to fill his ſubjects with high ſentiments concerning the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of his character, and the dignity of his ſtation<note n="†" place="bottom">Piedrahita, p. 27.</note>. Thus ſuperſtition, which, in the rudeſt period of ſociety, is either altogether unknown, or waſtes its force in childiſh unmeaning practices, had acquired ſuch an aſcendant over thoſe people of America, who had made ſome little progreſs towards refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it became the chief inſtrument of bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their minds to an untimely ſervitude, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them, in the beginning of their political ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer, to a deſpotiſm hardly leſs rigorous than that which awaits nations in the laſt ſtage of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and decline.</p>

AFTER examining the political inſtitutions of the rude nations in America, the next object of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is their art of war, or their proviſion for public ſecurity and defence. The ſmall tribes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over America are not only independent and unconnected, but engaged in perpetual hoſtilities

Though moſtly ſtrangers to the idea of ſeparate property veſted in any indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, the rudeſt of the American nations are well acquainted with the rights of each community to its own domains. This right they hold to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and excluſive, entitling the poſſeſſor to oppoſe the encroachment of neighbouring tribes. As it is of the utmoſt conſequence to prevent them from deſtroying or diſturbing the game in their hunting grounds, they guard this national property with a jealous attention. But as their territories are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and the boundaries of them not exactly aſcertained, innumerable ſubjects of diſpute ariſe, which ſeldom terminate without bloodſhed. Even in this ſimple and primitive ſtate of ſociety, intereſt is a ſource of diſcord, and often prompts ſavage tribes to take arms, in order to repel or puniſh ſuch as encroach on the foreſts or plains, to which they truſt for ſubſiſtence.</p>
                  <p>BUT intereſt is not either the moſt frequent or the moſt powerful motive of the inceſſant hoſtilities among rude nations.<note place="margin">Their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for engaging in war.</note> Theſe muſt be imputed to the paſſion of revenge, which rages with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the breaſt of ſavages, that eagerneſs to gratify it may be conſidered as the diſtinguiſhing characteriſtic of men in their uncivilized ſtate. Circumſtances of powerful influence, both in the interior government of rude tribes, and in their external operations againſt foreign enemies, concur in cheriſhing and adding ſtrength to a paſſion fatal to the general tranquillity. When the right of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing his own wrongs is left in the hands of every individual, injuries are felt with exquiſite ſenſibility, and vengeance exerciſed with unrelenting rancour. No time can obliterate the memory of an offence, and it is ſeldom that it can be expiated but by the
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:034476_0380_0FFDD80751B53BD0"/>
blood of the offender. In carrying on their public wars, ſavage nations are influenced by the ſame ideas,<note place="margin">From the ſpirit of vengeance.</note> and animated with the ſame ſpirit, as in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting private vengeance. In ſmall communities, every man is touched with the injury or affront offered to the body of which he is a member, as if it were a perſonal attack upon his own honour or ſafety. The deſire of revenge is communicated from breaſt to breaſt, and ſoon kindles into rage. As feeble ſocieties can take the field only in ſmall parties, each warrior is conſcious of the importance of his own arm, and feels that to it is committed a conſiderable portion of the public vengeance. War, which between extenſive kingdoms is carried on with little animoſity, is proſecuted by ſmall tribes with all the rancour of a private quarrel. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of nations is as implacable as that of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals.<note place="margin">Hence the ferocity of their wars,</note> It may be diſſembled or ſuppreſſed, but is never extinguiſhed; and often, when leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected or dreaded, it burſts out with redoubled fury<note n="*" place="bottom">Boucher Hiſt.

When poliſhed nations have obtained the glory of victory, or have acquired an addition of territory, they may terminate a war with honour. But ſavages are not ſatisfied until they extirpate the community which is the object of their hatred. They fight not to conquer, but to deſtroy. If they engage in hoſtilities, it is with a reſolution never to ſee the face of the enemy in peace, but to proſecute the quarrel with immortal enmity<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlev. Hiſt. N.

This grows up with him as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in life; and as his attention is directed to few objects, it acquires a degree of force unknown among men, whoſe paſſions are diſſipated and weakened by the variety of their occupations and purſuits. The deſire of vengeance, which takes poſſeſſion of the heart of ſavages, reſembles the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive rage of an animal, rather than the paſſion of a man. It turns with undiſcerning fury, even againſt inanimate objects. If hurt accidentally by a ſtone, they often ſeize it in a tranſport of anger, and endeavour to wreak their vengeance upon it<note n="†" place="bottom">Lery ap. de Bry, iii. 100.</note>. If ſtruck with an arrow in a battle, they will tear it from the wound, break and bite it with their teeth, and daſh it on the ground<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lery ap. de Bry, iii 208. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 8.</note>. With reſpect to their enemies, the rage of vengeance knows no bounds. When under the dominion of this paſſion, man becomes the moſt cruel of all animals. He neither pities, nor forgives, nor ſpares.</p>
                  <p>THE force of this paſſion is ſo well underſtood by the Americans themſelves, that they always apply to it, in order to excite their people to take arms. If the elders of any tribe attempt to rouze their youth from ſloth, if a chief wiſhes to allure a band of warriors to follow him in invading an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's country, the moſt perſuaſive topics of their martial eloquence are drawn from revenge.

Private chiefs often aſſemble ſmall parties, and invade a hoſtile tribe, without conſulting the rulers of the community. A ſingle warrior, prompted by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price or revenge, will take the field alone, and march ſeveral hundred miles to ſurpriſe and cut off a ſtraggling enemy<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE LXVI.</note>.

Lery ap. de Bry, 215. Hennepin Moeurs des Sauv. 41. Lafitau, ii. 169.</note>. But when a war is national, and undertaken by public authority, the deliberations are formal and ſlow.

Each warrior, beſides his arms, carries a mat and a ſmall bag of pounded maize, and with theſe is completely equipped for any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. While at a diſtance from the enemies fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, they diſperſe through the woods, and ſupport themſelves with the game which they kill, or the fiſh which they catch.

of their language. Among the Iroquois, the phraſe by which they expreſs their reſolution of making war againſt an enemy is, "Let us go and eat that nation."

Nor was the practice peculiar to rude unpoliſhed tribes; the principle from which it took riſe is ſo deeply rooted in the minds of the Americans, that it ſubſiſted in Mexico, one of the civilized empires in the New World, and relics of it may be diſcovered among the more mild inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Peru. It was not ſcarcity of food, as ſome authors imagine, and the importunate crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of hunger, which forced the Americans to thoſe horrid repaſts on their fellow-creatures. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh was never uſed as common food in any country, and the various relations concerning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who reckoned it among the ſtated means of ſubſiſtence, flow from the credulity and miſtakes of travellers.

                  <p>THE people of South America gratify their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge in a manner ſomewhat different, but with no leſs unrelenting rancour. There priſoners, after meeting at their firſt entrance with the ſame

rough reception as among the North Americans<note n="*" place="bottom">Stadius ap. de Bry, iii. p. 40.123.</note>, are not only exempt from injury, but treated with the greateſt kindneſs.

It is not eaſy to account for this part of their conduct unleſs we impute it to a refinement in cruelty. For, while they ſeem ſtudious to attach the captives to life, by ſupplying them with every enjoyment that can ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it agreeable, their doom is irrevocably fixed. On a day appointed, the victorious tribe aſſembles, the priſoner is brought forth with great ſolemnity, he views the preparations for the ſacrifice with as much indifference as if he himſelf were not the victim, and meeting his fate with undaunted firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is diſpatched with a ſingle blow. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he falls, the women ſeize the body, and dreſs it for the feaſt.

                  <p>AS the conſtancy of every American warrior may be put to ſuch ſevere proof, the great object of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary education and diſcipline in the New World is to form the mind to ſuſtain it. When nations carry on war with open force, defy their enemies to the combat, and vanquiſh them by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority

of their ſkill or courage, ſoldiers are trained to be active, vigorous, and enterpriſing. But in America, where the genius and maxims of war are extremely different, paſſive fortitude is the quality in higheſt eſtimation. Accordingly, it is early the ſtudy of the Americans to acquire ſentiments and habits, which will enable them to behave like men, when their reſolution ſhall be put to the proof. As the youth of other nations exerciſe themſelves in feats of activity and force, thoſe of America vie with one another in exhibitions of their patience under ſufferings. They harden their nerves by thoſe voluntary trials, and gradually accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to endure the ſharpeſt pain, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining. A boy and girl will bind their naked arms together, and place a burning coal between them, in order to try who firſt diſcovers ſuch impatience as to ſhake it off.<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlev. Hiſt. N.

They are not diſplays of valour, but of patience; they are not exhibitions of their ability to offend, but of their capacity to ſuffer. Among the tribes on the banks of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noco, if a warrior aſpires to the rank of captain, his probation begins with a long faſt, more rigid than any ever obſerved by the moſt abſtemious hermit. At the cloſe of this, the chiefs aſſemble, each gives him three laſhes with a large whip, applied ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, that his body is almoſt flayed, and if he betrays the leaſt ſymptom of impatience or even ſenſibility, he is diſgraced for ever, and rejected as unworthy of the honour to which he aſpires. After ſome interval, the conſtancy of the candidate is proved by a more excruciating trial. He is laid
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:034476_0394_0FFDD82B841AA0F0"/>
in a hammoc with his hands bound faſt, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitude of venomous ants, whoſe bite occaſions exquiſite pain, and produces a violent inflammation, are thrown upon him. The judges of his merit ſtand around the hammoc, and, while theſe cruel inſects faſten upon the moſt ſenſible parts of his body, a ſigh, a groan, an involuntary motion expreſſive of what he ſuffers, would exclude him for ever from the rank of captain. Even after this evidence of his fortitude, it is not deemed to be completely aſcertained, but muſt ſtand another teſt, more dreadful than any he has hitherto undergone. He is again ſuſpended in his hammoc, and covered with leaves of the palmetto. A fire of ſtinking herbs is kindled underneath, ſo as he may feel its heat, and be involved in its ſmoke. Though ſcorched and almoſt ſuffocated, he muſt continue to endure with the ſame patient inſenſibility. Many periſh in this rude eſſay of their firmneſs and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but ſuch as go through it with applauſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the enſigns of their new dignity with much ſolemnity, and are ever after regarded as leaders of approved reſolution, whoſe behaviour, in the moſt trying ſituations will do honour to their country<note n="*" place="bottom">Gumilla, ii 286, &amp;c. Biet. 376, &amp;c.</note>. In North America, the previous trial of a warrior is neither ſo formal nor ſo ſevere.

                  <p>THE amazing ſteadineſs with which the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans endure the moſt exquiſite torments, has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſome authors to ſuppoſe that, from the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar feebleneſs of their frame, their ſenſibility is not ſo acute as that of other people; as women,

and perſons of a relaxed habit, are obſerved to be leſs affected with pain than robuſt men, whoſe nerves are more firmly braced. But the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Americans is not ſo different, in its texture, from that of the reſt of the human ſpecies, as to account for this diverſity in their behaviour. It flows from a principle of honour, inſtilled early and cultivated with ſuch care, as to inſpire man in his rudeſt ſtate with an heroic magnanimity, to which philoſophy hath endeavoured, in vain, to form him, when more highly improved and poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This invincible conſtancy he has been taught to conſider as the chief diſtinction of a man, and the higheſt attainment of a warrior. The ideas which influence his conduct, and the paſſions which take poſſeſſion of his heart, are few. They ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of courſe with more deciſive effect, than when the mind is crowded with a multiplicity of objects, or diſtracted by the variety of its purſuits; and when every motive that acts with any force in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſentiments of a ſavage, prompts him to ſuffer with dignity, he will bear what might ſeem to be impoſſible for human patience to ſuſtain. But wherever the fortitude of the Americans is not rouſed to exertion by their ideas of honour, their feelings of pain are the ſame with thoſe of the reſt of mankind<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXV.</note>. Nor is that patience under ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for which the Americans have been ſo juſtly celebrated, an univerſal attainment. The conſtancy of many of the victims is overcome by the agonies of torture.

Far the greater part of their captives was anciently ſacrificed to their vengeance, and it is only ſince their numbers began to decline faſt, that they have generally adopted milder maxims.

It ſeems, however, to reſult naturally from the principles upon which war is carried on in America. When nations aim at exterminating their enemies, no exchange of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners can ever take place.

The perfect ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of manners among ſavage nations facilitates and completes the union, and induces a captive to transfer not only his allegiance, but his affection, to the community into the boſom of which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

Even in operations which ſeem the moſt intereſting, and where the moſt powerful motives urge them to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exertions, they labour with a languid liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs.

The ſlighteſt manual operation conſumes an amazing length of time, and what in poliſhed nations would hardly be an effort of induſtry, is among ſavages an arduous undertaking. This ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Americans in executing works of every kind may be imputed to various cauſes. Among ſavages, who do not depend for ſubſiſtence upon the efforts of regular induſtry, time is of ſo little importance, that they ſet no value upon it; and provided they can finiſh a deſign, they never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard how long they are employed about it. The tools which they employ are ſo aukward and defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that every work in which they engage muſt neceſſarily be tedious. The hand of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and ſkilful artiſt, were it furniſhed with no better inſtrument than a ſtone hatchet, a ſhell, or the bone of ſome animal, would find it difficult to perfect the moſt ſimple work. It is by length of labour, that he muſt endeavour to ſupply his defect of power.

them from that habitual indolence in which they are ſunk; and unleſs when engaged in war or hunting, they ſeem incapable of exerting any vigorous effort. Their ardour of application is not ſo great as to call forth that inventive ſpirit which ſuggeſts expedients for facilitating and abridging labour. They will return to a taſk day after day, but all their methods of executing it are tedious and operoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXXVI.</note>. Even ſince the Europeans have communicated to them the knowledge of their inſtruments, and taught them to imitate their arts, the peculiar genius of the Americans is conſpicuous in every attempt they make.

                     <pb n="412" facs="unknown:034476_0410_0FFDD8548A36BF00"/>THERE are two fundamental doctrines, upon which the whole ſyſtem of religion, as far as it can be diſcovered by the light of nature,<note place="margin">Confined to two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> is eſtabliſhed. The one reſpects the being of a God, the other the immortality of the ſoul. To diſcover the ideas of the uncultivated nations under our review with regard to thoſe important points, is not only an object of curioſity, but may afford inſtruction.

That numerous part of the human ſpecies, whoſe lot is labour, whoſe principal and almoſt ſole occupation is to ſecure ſubſiſtence, views the arrangement and operations of nature with little reflection, and has neither leiſure nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for entering into that path of refined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate ſpeculation which conducts to the knowledge of the principles of natural religion. In the early and moſt rude periods of ſavage life, ſuch diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are altogether unknown. When the intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual powers are juſt beginning to unfold, and their luſt feeble exertions are directed towards a few ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of primary neceſſity and uſe; when the faculties of the mind are ſo limited, as not to have formed abſtract or general ideas; when language is ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as to be deſtitute of names to diſtinguiſh any thing that is not perceived by ſome of the ſenſes; it is prepoſterous to expect that man ſhould be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of tracing with accuracy the relation between cauſe and effect; or to ſuppoſe that he ſhould riſe from the contemplation of the one to the knowledge of the other, and form juſt conceptions of a Deity,
<pb n="413" facs="unknown:034476_0411_0FFDD8564C1C1130"/>
as the Creator and Governor of the univerſe. The idea of creation is ſo familiar wherever the mind is enlarged by ſcience, and illuminated with revelation, that we ſeld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Accordingly, ſeveral tribes have been diſcovered in America, which have no idea whatever of a Supreme Being, and no rites of religious worſhip. Inattentive to that magnificent ſpectacle of beauty and order preſented to their view, unaccuſtomed to reflect either upon what they themſelves are, or to inquire who is the author of their exiſtence, men, in their ſavage ſtate, paſs their days like the animals round them, without knowledge or veneration of any ſuperior power.

<pb n="414" facs="unknown:034476_0412_0FFDD85AFA411600"/>
when corrected and refined, to be the great ſource of conſolation amidſt the calamities of life. Among ſome of the American tribes, ſtill in the infancy of improvement, we diſcern apprehenſions of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and powerful beings. Theſe apprehenſions are originally indiſtinct and perplexed, and ſeem to be ſuggeſted rather by the dread of impending evils, than to flow from gratitude for bleſſings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. While Nature holds on her courſe with uniform and undiſturbed regularity, men enjoy the benefits reſulting from it, without inquiring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its cauſe. But every deviation from this regular courſe rouſes and aſtoniſhes them. When they behold events to which they are not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, they ſearch for the reaſons of them with eager curioſity. Their underſtanding is unable to penetrate into theſe; but imagination, a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ardent faculty of the mind, decides with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation. It aſcribes the extraordinary occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in nature to the influence of inviſible beings, and ſuppoſes that the thunder, the hurricane, and the earthquake, are effects of their interpoſition. Some ſuch confuſed notion of ſpiritual or inviſible power, ſuperintending over thoſe natural calamities which frequently deſolate the earth, and terrify its inhabitants, may be traced among many rude na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXXIX.</note>. But beſides this, the diſaſters and dangers of ſavage life are ſo many, and men often find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſituations ſo formidable, that the mind, ſenſible of its own weakneſs, has no reſource but in the guidance and protection of wiſdom and power ſuperior to what is human. Dejected with cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which oppreſs him, and expoſed to dangers which he cannot repel, the ſavage no longer relies upon himſelf; he feels his own impotence, and ſees no proſpect of being extricated, but by the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition

of ſome unſeen arm. Hence, in all unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened nations, the firſt rites or practices which bear any reſemblance to acts of religion, have it for their object to avert evils which men ſuffer or dread. The <hi>Manitous</hi> or <hi>Okkis</hi> of the North Americans were amulets or charms, which they imagined to be of ſuch virtue, as to preſerve the perſons who repoſed confidence in them from every diſaſtrous event, or they were conſidered as tutelary ſpirits, whoſe aid they might implore in circumſtances of diſtreſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev.

The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of fear are conſpicuous in all the ſyſtems of ſuperſtition formed in this ſituation.

                  <p>THE tribe of the Natchez,<note place="margin">Syſtem of the Nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chez.</note> and the people of Bogota had advanced beyond the other unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated nations of America in their ideas of religion, as well as in their political inſtitutions; and it is no leſs difficult to explain the cauſe of this diſtinction than of that which we have already conſidered. The Sun was the chief object of religious worſhip among the Natchez. In their temples, which were conſtructed with ſome magnificence, and decorated with various ornaments, according to their mode of architecture, they preſerved a perpetual fire, as the pureſt emblem of their divinity. Miniſters were appointed to watch and feed this ſacred flame. The firſt function of the great chief of the nation, every morning, was an act of obeiſance to the Sun; and feſtivals returned at ſtated ſeaſons, which were celebrated by the whole community with ſolemn but unbloody rites<note n="†" place="bottom">Dumont, i. 158, &amp;c. Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 417, &amp;c. 429, Lafitau, i. 67.</note>. This is the moſt refined ſpecies of ſuperſtition known in America, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, one of the moſt natural as well as moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing. The Sun is the apparent ſource of the joy, fertility, and life, diffuſed through nature; and while the human mind, in its early eſſays to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

inquiry, contemplates and admires his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and animating energy, its admiration is apt to ſtop ſhort at what is viſible, without reaching to the unſeen cauſe; and pays that adoration to the moſt glorious and beneficial work of God, which is due only to him who formed it. As fire is the pureſt and moſt active of the elements, and in ſome of its qualities and effects reſembles the Sun, it was, not improperly, choſen to be the emblem of his powerful operation. The ancient Perſians, a people far ſuperior, in every reſpect, to that rude tribe whoſe rites I am deſcribing, founded their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſyſtem on ſimilar principles, and eſtabliſhed a form of public worſhip, leſs groſs and exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than any people deſtitute of guidance from revelation.

                  <p>AMONG the people of Bogota, the Sun and Moon were, likewiſe, the chief objects of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

This ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, reſulting from a ſecret conſciouſneſs of its own dignity, from an inſtinctive longing after immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, is univerſal, and may be deemed natural. Upon this, are founded the moſt exalted hopes of man in his higheſt ſtate of improvement; nor has nature withheld from him this ſoothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, in the moſt early and rude period of its progreſs. We can trace this opinion from one extremity of America to the other: in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions more faint and obſcure, in others more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly developed, but no where unknown. The moſt uncivilized of its ſavage tribes do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend death as the extinction of being. All enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes of a future and more happy ſtate, where they ſhall be for ever exempt from the calamities which embitter human life in its preſent condition. This future ſtate they conceive to be a delightful country, bleſſed with perpetual ſpring, whoſe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts abound with game, whoſe rivers ſwarm with fiſh, where famine is never felt, and uninterrupted plenty ſhall be enjoyed without labour or toil. But as men, in forming their firſt imperfect ideas concerning the inviſible world, ſuppoſe that there they ſhall continue to feel the ſame deſires, and to be engaged in the ſame occupations, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world; they naturally aſcribe eminence and diſtinction, in that ſtate, to the ſame qualities and talents which are here the object of their eſteem. The Americans, accordingly, allotted the higheſt place, in their country of ſpirits, to the ſkilful hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the adventrous and ſucceſsful warrior, and to ſuch as had tortured the greateſt number of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,

The human mind is moſt apt to feel, and to diſcover this vain curioſity, when its own powers are moſt feeble and uninformed. Aſtoniſhed with occurrences, of which it is unable to comprehend the cauſe, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally fancies that there is ſomething myſterious and wonderful in their origin. Alarmed at events of which it cannot diſcern the iſſue or the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, it has recourſe to other means of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, than the exerciſe of its own ſagacity. Wherever ſuperſtition is ſo eſtabliſhed as to form a regular ſyſtem, this deſire of penetrating into the ſecrets or futurity is connected with it. Divination becomes a religious act. Prieſts, as the miniſters of Heaven, pretend to deliver its oracles to men.

As the diſeaſes of men in the ſavage ſtate, are (as have been already obſerved) like thoſe of the animal creation, few but extremely violent, their impatience under what they ſuffer, and ſolicitude for the recovery of health, ſoon inſpired them with extraordinary reverence for ſuch as pretended to underſtand the nature of their mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to be poſſeſſed of knowledge ſufficient to preſerve or deliver them from their ſudden and fatal effects. Theſe ignorant pretenders, however, were ſuch utter ſtrangers to the ſtructure of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

frame, as to be equally unacquainted with the cauſes of its diſorders, and the manner in which they will terminate. Superſtition, mingled fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with ſome portion of craft, ſupplied what they wanted in ſcience. They imputed the origin of diſeaſes to ſupernatural influence, and preſcribed or performed a variety of myſterious rites, which they gave out to be of ſuch efficacy as to remove the moſt dangerous and inveterate maladies. The credulity and love of the marvellous, natural to uninformed men, favoured the deception, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them to be the dupes of thoſe impoſtors. Among ſavages, their firſt phyſicians are a kind of conjurers or wizards, who boaſt that they know what is paſt, and can foretel what is to come. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations, ſorcery, and mummeries of diverſe kinds, no leſs ſtrange than frivolous, are the means which they employ to expel the imaginary cauſes of malignity<note n="*" place="bottom">P. Melch. Hernandez, Memorial de Chiriqui. Collect. Orig. Pap. i.</note>; and relying upon the efficacy of theſe, they predict with confidence what will be the fate of their deluded patients. Thus ſuperſtition, in its earlieſt form, flowed from the ſolicitude of man to be delivered from preſent diſtreſs, not from his dread of evils awaiting him in a future life, and was originally ingrafted on medicine, not on religion. One of the firſt, and moſt intelligent hiſtorians of America, was ſtruck with this alliance between the art of divination and that of phyſic, among the people of Hiſpaniola<note n="†" place="bottom">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Americans did not long ſuppoſe the efficacy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration to be confined to one ſubject. They had recourſe to it in every ſituation of danger or diſtreſs. When the events of war were peculiarly diſaſtrous, when they met with unforeſeen diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in hunting, when inundations or drought threatened their crops with deſtruction, they called upon their conjurers to begin their incantations, in order to diſcover the cauſes of thoſe calamities, or to foretell what would be their iſſue<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 3. Dumont, i. 173. Fernand. Relac. de los Chiquit. p. 40. Lozano, 84. Margrave, 279.</note>. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this deluſive art gradually increaſed, and manifeſted itſelf in all the occurrences of life. When involved in any difficulty, or about to enter upon any tranſaction of moment, every individual regularly conſulted the ſorcerer, and depended upon his inſtructions to extricate him from the former, as well as to direct his conduct in the latter. Even among the rudeſt tribes in America, ſuperſtition appears in this form, and divination is an art in high eſteem. Long before man had acquired ſuch knowledge of the Deity as inſpires reverence, and leads to adoration, we obſerve him ſtretching out a preſumptuous hand to draw aſide that veil with
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:034476_0422_0FFDD874C4EFEE68"/>
which Providence kindly conceals its purpoſes from human knowledge; and we find him labouring, with fruitleſs anxiety, to penetrate into the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the divine adminiſtration. To diſcern, and to worſhip a ſuperintending power, is an evidence of the enlargement and maturity of the human underſtanding; a vain deſire of prying into futu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, is the error of is infancy, and a proof of its weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>FROM this weakneſs proceeded likewiſe the faith of the Americans in dreams, their obſervation of omens, their attention to the chirping of birds, and the cries of animals, all which they ſuppoſe to be indications of future events, and if any one of theſe prognoſtics is deemed unfavourable, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly abandon the purſuit of thoſe meaſures on which they are moſt eagerly bent<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev.

As, during a great part of their time, they languiſh in a ſtate of inactivity and indolence, without any occupation to rouſe or intereſt them, they delight univerſally in a paſtime which calls forth the active powers of their nature into exerciſe. The Spaniards, when they firſt viſited America, were aſtoniſhed at the fondneſs of the natives for dancing, and beheld with wonder a people, cold and unanimated in moſt

of their other purſuits, kindle into life, and exert themſelves with ardour, as often as this favourite amuſement recurred. Among them, indeed, danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought not to be denominated an amuſement. It is a ſerious and important occupation, which mingles in every occurrence of public or private life. If any intercourſe be neceſſary between two American tribes, the ambaſſadors of the one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach in a ſolemn dance, and preſent the calumet or emblem of peace; the ſachems of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with the ſame ceremony<note n="*" place="bottom">De la Potherie Hiſt. ii. 17, &amp;c.

If a perſon is indiſpoſed, a dance is preſcribed as the moſt effectual means of reſtoring him to health; and if he himſelf cannot endure the fatigue of ſuch an exerciſe, the phyſician or conjurer performs it in his name, as if the virtue of his activity could be transferred to his patient<note n="§" place="bottom">Denys Hiſt.

                  <p>ALL their dances are imitations of ſome action; and though the muſic by which they are regulated is extremely ſimple and tireſome to the ear by its dull monotony, ſome of their dances appear won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully expreſſive and animated. The war dance is, perhaps the moſt ſtriking. It is the repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a complete American campaign. The

departure of the warriors from their village, their march into the enemy's country, the caution with which they encamp, the addreſs with which they ſtation ſome of their party in ambuſh, the manner of ſurpriſing the enemy, the noiſe and ferocity of the combat, the ſcalping of thoſe who are ſlain, the ſeizing of priſoners, the triumphant return of the conquerors, and the torture of the victims, are ſucceſſively exhibited. The performers enter with ſuch enthuſiaſtic ardour into their ſeveral parts, their geſtures, their countenance, their voice, are ſo wild and ſo well adapted to their various ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that Europeans can hardly believe it to be a mimic ſcene, or view it without emotions of fear and horror<note n="*" place="bottom">De la Potherie, ii. 116.

                  <p>BUT however expreſſive ſome of the American dances may be, there is one circumſtance in them remarkable, and connected with the character of the race. The ſongs, the dances, the amuſements of other nations, expreſſive of the ſentiments which animate their hearts, are often adapted to diſplay or excite that ſenſibility which mutually attaches the ſexes. Among ſome people, ſuch is the ardour of this paſſion, that love is almoſt the ſole object of feſtivity and joy; and as rude nations are ſtrangers to delicacy, and unaccuſtomed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe any emotion of their minds, their dances are often extremely wanton and indecent.

cauſes which I have already explained, the paſſion of love mingles but little with their feſtivals and paſtimes.

If, on ſome occaſions, the women are permited to join in the feſtival, the character of the entertainment is ſtill the ſame, and no movement or geſture is expreſſive of attachment, or encourages familiarity<note n="‡" place="bottom">Barrere, Fr. Equin. p. 191.</note>.</p>
                  <p>AN immoderate love of play,<note place="margin">Paſſion for gaming,</note> eſpecially at games of hazard, which ſeems to be natural to all people unaccuſtomed to the occupations of regular induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is likewiſe univerſal among the Americans. The ſame cauſes, which ſo often prompt perſons in civilized life, who are at their eaſe, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this paſtime, render it the delight of the ſavage. The former are independent of labour, the latter do not feel the neceſſity of it; and as both are unemployed, they run with tranſport to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is intereſting enough to ſtir and to agitate their minds. Hence the Americans, who at other times are ſo indifferent, ſo phlegmatic, ſo ſilent, and animated with ſo few deſires, as ſoon as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in play become rapacious, impatient, noiſy, and almoſt frantic with eagerneſs. Their furs, their domeſtic utenſils, their clothes, their arms, are ſtaked at the gaming-table, and when all is loſt, high as their ſenſe of independence is, in a wild emotion of deſpair or hope, they will often riſk

their perſonal liberty upon a ſingle caſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 261. 318. Lafitau. ii. 338, &amp;c. Ribas, Triumf. 13. Brickell, 335.</note>. Among ſeveral tribes, ſuch gaming parties frequently recur, and become their moſt acceptable entertainment at every great feſtival. Superſtition, which is apt to take hold of thoſe paſſions which are moſt vigorous, frequently lends its aid to confirm and ſtrengthen this favourite inclination. Their conjurers are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to preſcribe a ſolemn match at play, as one of the moſt efficacious methods of appeaſing their gods, or of reſtoring the ſick to health<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlev.

                     <note place="margin">and for drinking.</note>FROM cauſes ſimilar to thoſe which render them fond of play, the Americans are extremely addicted to drunkenneſs. It ſeems to have been one of the firſt exertions of human ingenuity to diſcover ſome compoſition of an intoxicating quality; and there is hardly any nation ſo rude, or ſo deſtitute of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as not to have ſucceeded in this fatal reſearch. The moſt barbarous of the American tribes have been ſo unfortunate as to attain this art; and even thoſe which are ſo deficient in knowledge, as to be unacquainted with the method of giving an inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſtrength to liquors by fermentation, can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the ſame end by other means. The people of the iſlands of North America, and of California, uſed, for this purpoſe, the ſmoke of tobacco, drawn up with a certain inſtrument into the noſtrils, the fumes of which aſcending to the brain, they felt all the tranſports and frenzy of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication<note n="‡" place="bottom">Oviedo, Hiſt. ap Ramuſ. iii. 113. Venegas, i. 68. Naufrag. de Cabeca de Vaca, cap. 26. See NOTE XCII.</note>. In almoſt every other part of the New World, the natives poſſeſſed the art of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an intoxicating liquor from maize or the manioc root, the ſame ſubſtances which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert into bread. The operation by which they
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:034476_0427_0FFDD8820A1AEA00"/>
effect this, nearly reſembles the common one of brewing, but with this difference, that in place of yeſt, they uſe a nauſeous infuſion of a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of maize or manioc chewed by their women. The ſaliva excites a vigorous fermentation, and in a few days the liquor becomes fit for drinking. It is not diſagreeable to the taſte, and when ſwallowed in large quantities, is of an intoxicating quality<note n="*" place="bottom">Stadius ap. de Bry, iii. 111. Lery, ibid. 175.</note>. This is the general beverage of the Americans, which they diſtinguiſh by various names, and for which they feel ſuch a violent and inſatiable deſire, as it is not eaſy either to conceive or deſcribe. Among poliſhed nations, where a ſucceſſion of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious functions and amuſements keeps the mind in continual occupation, the deſire for ſtrong drink is regulated, in a great meaſure, by the climate, and increaſes or diminiſhes according to the variations of its temperature. In warm regions, the delicate and ſenſible frame of the inhabitants does not require the ſtimulation of fermented liquors. In colder countries, the conſtitution of the natives, more ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt and more ſluggiſh, ſtands in need of generous liquors to quicken and animate it. But among ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, the deſire of ſomething that is of power to intoxicate, is in every ſituation the ſame. All the people of America, if we except ſome ſmall tribes near the Straits of Magellan, whether natives of the torrid zone, or inhabitants of its more temperate regions, or placed by a harder fate in the ſevere cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates towards its northren or ſouthern extremity, appear to be equally under the dominion of this appetite<note n="†" place="bottom">Gumilla, i. 257.

Such a ſimilarity of taſte, among people in ſuch different ſituations, muſt be aſcribed to the
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:034476_0428_0FFDD884A1555EF8"/>
influence of ſome moral cauſe, and cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the effect of any phyſical or conſtitutional want. While engaged in war or in the chaſe, the ſavage is often in the moſt intereſting ſituations, and all the powers of his nature are rouſed to the moſt vigorous exertions. But thoſe animating ſcenes are ſucceeded by long intervals of repoſe, during which the warrior meets with nothing that he deems of ſufficient dignity or importance to merit his attention. He languiſhes and mopes in this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of indolence. The poſture of his body is an emblem of the ſtate of his mind. In one climate, cowering over the fire in his cabin; in another, ſtretched under the ſhade of ſome tree, he doſes away his time in ſleep, or in an unthinking joyleſs inactivity, not far removed from it. As ſtrong liquors awake him from this torpid ſtate, give a briſker motion to his ſpirits, and enliven him more thoroughly than either dancing or gaming, his love of them is exceſſive.

Many of their feſtivals have no other object, and they welcome the return of them with tranſports of joy. As they are not accuſtomed to retain any appetite, they ſet no bounds to this. The riot often continues without intermiſſion ſeveral days; and whatever may be the fatal effects of their exceſs, they never ceaſe from drinking as long as one drop of liquor remains. The perſons of greateſt eminence, the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed warriors, and the chiefs moſt renowned for their wiſdom, have no greater command of

                  <p>BUT, amidſt this wild debauch, there is one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance remarkable; the women, in moſt of the American tribes, are not permitted to partake of it<note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE XCIII.</note>. Their province is to prepare the liquor, to ſerve it about to the gueſts, and to take care of their huſbands and friends, when their reaſon is overpowered. This excluſion of the women from an enjoyment ſo highly valued by ſavages, may be juſtly conſidered as a mark of their inferiority, and as an additional evidence of that contempt with which they were treated in the New World. The people of North America, when firſt diſcovered, were not acquainted with any intoxicating drink; but as the Europeans early found it their intereſt to ſupply them with ſpiritous liquors, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſoon became as univerſal among them as among their countrymen to the ſouth; and their women having acquited this new taſte, indulge it with as little decency and moderation as the men<note n="§" place="bottom">Hutchinſon, Hiſt. of Maſſachuſ. 469. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="432" facs="unknown:034476_0430_0FFDD889E6C5D7A0"/>
in America; but I cannot omit one ſeemingly as ſingular as any that has been mentioned. When their parents and other relations become old,<note place="margin">Put to death the aged and incurable.</note> or labour under any diſtemper which their ſlender knowledge of the healing art cannot remove, the Americans cut ſhort their days with a violent hand, in order to be relieved from the burden of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tending them. This practice prevailed among the ruder tribes in every part of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, from Hudſon's Bay to the river De la Plata; and however ſhocking it may be to thoſe ſentiments of tenderneſs and attachment, which, in civilized life, we are apt to conſider as congenial with our frame, the condition of man in the ſavage ſtate leads and reconciles him to it. The ſame hardſhips and difficulty of procuring ſubſiſtence, which deter ſavages, in ſome caſes, from rearing their children, prompt them to deſtroy the aged and infirm. The declining ſtate of the one is as helpleſs as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the other. The former are no leſs unable than the latter to perform the functions that belong to a warrior or hunter, or to endure thoſe various diſtreſſes in which ſavages are ſo often involved, by their own want of foreſight and induſtry. Their relations feel this, and, incapable of attending to the wants or weakneſſes of others, their impatience under an additional burden prompts them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh that life which they find it difficult to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. This is not regarded as a deed of cruelty, but as an act of mercy. An American, broken with years and infirmities, conſcious that he can no longer depend on the aid of thoſe around him, places himſelf contentedly in his grave; and it is by the hands of his children or neareſt relations that the thong is pulled, or the blow inflicted, which releaſes him for ever from the ſorrows of life<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſſani Hiſtor. de N.

A human being, as he comes originally from the hand of nature, is every where the ſame. At his firſt appearance in the ſtate of infancy, whether it be among the rudeſt ſavages, or in the moſt civilized nation, we can diſcern no quality which marks any diſtinction or ſuperiority. The capacity of improvement ſeems to be the ſame; and the talents he may afterwards acquire, as well as the virtues he may be rendered capable of exerciſing, depend, in a great meaſure, upon the ſtate of ſociety in which he is placed. To this ſtate his mind naturally accommodates it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and from it receives diſcipline and culture. In proportion to the wants which it accuſtoms a human being to feel, and the functions in which theſe engage him, his intellectual powers are called forth. According to the connections which it eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes between him and the reſt of his ſpecies, the affections of his heart are exerted. It is only by attending to this great principle, that we can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what is the character of man in every different period of his progreſs.</p>
                  <p>IF we apply it to ſavage life,<note place="margin">Intellectual powers.</note> and meaſure the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the human mind in that ſtate by this ſtandard, we ſhall find, according to an obſervation which I have already made, that the intellectual powers of man muſt be extremely limited in their operations. They are confined within the narrow ſphere of what he deems neceſſary for ſupplying his own wants. Whatever has not ſome relation to theſe, neither attracts his attention, nor is the object of his enquiries. But however narrow the bounds may be within which the knowledge of a
<pb n="434" facs="unknown:034476_0432_0FFDD89031001910"/>
ſavage is circumſcribed, he poſſeſſes thoroughly that ſmall portion which he has attained. It was not communicated to him by formal inſtruction; he does not attend to it as a matter of mere ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and curioſity; it is the reſult of his own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, the fruit of his own experience, and accommodated to his own condition and exigencies. While employed in the active occupations of war or of hunting, he often finds himſelf in difficult and perilous ſituations, from which the efforts of his own ſagacity muſt extricate him. He is frequently engaged in meaſures, where every ſtep depends upon his own ability to decide, where he muſt rely ſolely upon his own penetration to diſcern the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to which he is expoſed, and upon his own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in providing againſt them. In conſequence of this, he feels the knowledge which he poſſeſſes, and the efforts which he makes, and either in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration or action reſts on himſelf alone.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Political talents.</note>AS the talents of individuals are exerciſed and improved by ſuch exertions, much political wiſdom is ſaid to be diſplayed in conducting the affairs of their ſmall communities. The council of old men in an American tribe, deliberating upon its intereſts, and determining with reſpect to peace or war, has been compared to the ſenate in more poliſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics. The proceedings of the former, we are told, are often no leſs formal and ſagacious, than thoſe of the latter. Great political wiſdom is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in pondering the various meaſures propoſed, and in balancing their probable advantages, againſt the evils of which they may be productive. Much addreſs and eloquence are employed by the leaders, who aſpire at acquiring ſuch confidence with their countrymen, as to have an aſcendant in thoſe aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev.

<pb n="435" facs="unknown:034476_0433_0FFDD891C5041690"/>
diſplaying political talents cannot be extenſive. Where the idea of private property is incomplete, and no criminal juriſdiction is eſtabliſhed, there is hardly any function of internal government to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Where there is no commerce, and ſcarcely any intercourſe among ſeparate tribes; where enmity is implacable, and hoſtilities are carried on almoſt without intermiſſion, there will be few points of public concern to adjuſt with their neighbours; and that department of their affairs which may be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated foreign, cannot be ſo intricate as to require much refined policy in conducting it. Where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals are ſo thoughtleſs and improvident as ſeldom to take effectual precautions for ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, it is vain to expect that public meaſures and deliberations will be regulated by the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of remote events. It is the genius of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to act from the impulſe of preſent paſſion. They have neither foreſight nor temper to form complicated arrangements with reſpect to their future conduct. The conſultations of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, indeed, are ſo frequent, and their negociations are ſo many<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XCIV.</note>, and ſo long protracted, as to give their proceedings an extraordinary aſpect of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But this is not owing ſo much to the depth of their ſchemes, as to the coldneſs and phlegm of their temper, which render them ſlow in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining<note n="†" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 271.</note>. If we accept the celebrated league, that united the Five Nations in Canada into a federal republic, which ſhall be conſidered in its proper place, we can diſcern few ſuch traces of political wiſdom, among the rude American tribes, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any great degree of foreſight or extent of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual abilities. Even among them, we ſhall find public meaſures more frequently directed by the impetuous ferocity of their youth, than regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated

The ſtrongeſt feeling in the mind of a ſavage is a ſenſe of his own independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He has ſacrificed ſo ſmall a portion of his natural liberty by becoming a member of ſociety, that he remains, in a great degree, the ſole maſter of his own actions<note n="*" place="bottom">Fernandez Miſſion. de los Chiquit. 33.</note>. He often takes his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions alone, without conſulting, or feeling any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the perſons around him. In many of his operations, he ſtands as much detached from the reſt of his ſpecies, as if he had formed no union with them. Conſcious how little he depends upon other men, he is apt to view them with a careleſs indifference. Even the force of his mind contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to increaſe this unconcern, and as he looks not beyond himſelf in deliberating with reſpect to the part which he ſhould act, his ſolicitude about the conſequences of it ſeldom extends farther. He purſues his own career, and indulges his own fancy, without enquiring or regarding whether what he does be agreeable or offenſive to others, whether they may derive benefit or receive hurt from it. Hence the ungovernable caprice of ſavages, their impatience under any ſpecies of reſtraint, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to ſuppreſs or moderate any inclination, the ſcorn or neglect with which they receive advice, their high eſtimation of themſelves, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of other men. Among them, the pride of independence produces almoſt the ſame effects with intereſtedneſs in a more advanced ſtate of ſociety; it refers every thing to a man himſelf, it leads him
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:034476_0435_0FFDD89705974A28"/>
to be indifferent about the manner in which his actions may affect other men, and renders the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of his own wiſhes the meaſure and end of conduct.</p>
                  <p>TO the ſame cauſe may be imputed the hardneſs of heart, and inſenſibility,<note place="margin">Hardneſs of heart.</note> remarkable in all ſavage nations. Their minds, rouſed only by ſtrong emotions, are little ſuſceptible of gentle, delicate, or tender affections<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 309.</note>. Their union is ſo incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, that each individual acts as if he retained all his natural rights entire and undiminiſhed. If a favour is conferred upon him, or any beneficial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is performed on his account, he receives it with much ſatisfaction, becauſe it contributes to his enjoyment; but this ſentiment extends not beyond himſelf, it excites no ſenſe of obligation, he neither feels gratitude, nor thinks of making any return<note n="†" place="bottom">Oviedo, Hiſt. lib. xvi. c. 2. See NOTE XCV.</note>. Even among perſons the moſt cloſely connected, the exchange of thoſe good offices which ſtrengthen attachment, mollify the heart, and ſweeten the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of life, is not frequent. The high ideas of independence among the Americans nouriſh a ſullen reſerve, which keeps them at a diſtance from each other.

The ſame harſhneſs of temper is ſtill more conſpicuous in their treatment of all the animal creation. Prior to their intercourſe with the people of Europe, the North Americans had ſome tame dogs, which accompanied them in their hunting excurſions, and ſerved them with all the ardour and fidelity peculiar to the ſpecies. But, inſtead of that fond attachment which the hunter naturally feels towards thoſe uſeful companions of

his toils, they requite their ſervices with neglect, ſeldom feed, and never careſs them <note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 119, 337.</note>. In other provinces, the Americans have become acquainted with the domeſtic animals of Europe, and avail themſelves of their ſervice; but it is univerſally obſerved that they always treat them harſhly<note n="†" place="bottom">Ulloa Notic. American. 312.</note>, and never employ any method, either for breaking or managing them, but force and cruelty. In every part of the deportment of man in his ſavage ſtate, whether towards his equals of the human ſpecies, or towards the animals below him, we recognize the ſame character, and trace the operations of a mind intent on its own gratifications, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by its own caprice, with little attention or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility to the ſentiments and feelings of the beings around him.</p>
                  <p>AFTER explaining how unfavourable the ſavage ſtate is to the cultivation of the underſtanding,<note place="margin">Taciturnity</note> and to the improvement of the heart, I ſhould not have thought it neceſſary to mention what may be deemed its leſſer defects, if the character of nations, as well as of individuals, were not often more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly marked by circumſtances apparently trivial than by thoſe of greater moment. A ſavage, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently placed in ſituations of danger and diſtreſs, depending on himſelf alone, and wrapt up in his own thoughts and ſchemes, is a ſerious melancholy animal. His attention to others is ſmall. The range of his own ideas is narrow. Hence that taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnity which is ſo diſguſting to men accuſtomed to the open intercourſe of ſocial converſation. When they are not engaged in action, the Americans often ſit whole days in one poſture, without open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lips<note n="‡" place="bottom">Voyage de Bouguer, 102.</note>. When they go forth to war, or to

the chaſe, they uſually march in a line at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from one another, and without exchanging a word. The ſame profound ſilence is obſerved when they row together in a canoe<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev. iii. 340.</note>. It is only when they are animated by intoxicating liquors, or rouzed by the jollity of the feſtival and dance, that they become gay and converſible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Cunning.</note>TO the ſame cauſes may be imputed the refined cunning with which they form and execute their ſchemes. Men, who are not habituated to a liberal communication of their own ſentiments and wiſhes, are apt to be ſo diſtruſtful, as to place little confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in others, and to have recourſe to an inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous craft in accompliſhing their own purpoſes. In civilized life, thoſe perſons, who, by their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have but a few objects of purſuit on which their minds inceſſantly dwell, are moſt remarkable for low artifice in carrying on their little projects. Among ſavages, whoſe views are equally confined, and their attention no leſs perſevering, thoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances muſt operate ſtill more powerfully, and gradually accuſtom them to a diſingenuous ſubtlety in all their tranſactions. The force of this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by habits which they acquire in carrying on the two moſt intereſting operations wherein they are engaged. With them war is a ſyſtem of craft, in which they truſt for ſucceſs to ſtratagem more than to open force, and have their invention conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on the ſtretch to circumvent and ſurpriſe their enemies. As hunters, it is their conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to enſnare, in order that they may deſtroy. Accordingly, art and cunning have been univerſally obſerved as diſtinguiſhing characteriſtics of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages. The people of the rude tribes of America are remarkable for their artifice and duplicity. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrably ſecret in forming their meaſures, they
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:034476_0439_0FFDD8B227F337F8"/>
purſue them with a patient undeviating attention, and there is no refinement of diſſimulation which they cannot employ, in order to inſure ſucceſs. The natives of Peru were engaged above thirty years, in concerting the plan of that inſurrection which took place under the vice-royalty of the marquis de Villa Garcia; and though it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to a great number of perſons in all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ranks, no indication of it ever tranſpired during that long period; no man betrayed his truſt, or by an unguarded look, or raſh word, gave riſe to any ſuſpicion of what was intended <note n="*" place="bottom">Voyage de Ulloa, ii. 309.</note>. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation and craft of individuals is no leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than that of nations. When ſet upon deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they wrap themſelves up ſo artificially, that it is impoſſible to penetrate into their intentions, or to detect their deſigns<note n="†" place="bottom">Gumilla, i. 162. Charlev. iii. 109.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT if there be defects or vices peculiar to the ſavage ſtate,<note place="margin">Virtues.</note> there are likewiſe virtues which it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires, and good qualities, to the exerciſe of which it is friendly.<note place="margin">Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirit.</note> The bonds of ſociety ſit ſo looſe upon the members of the more rude American tribes, that they hardly feel any reſtraint. Hence the ſpirit of independence, which is the pride of a ſavage, and which he conſiders as the unalienable prerogative of man. Incapable of controul, and diſdaining to acknowledge any ſuperior, his mind, though limited in its powers, and erring in many of its purſuits, acquires ſuch elevation by the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its own freedom, that he acts on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with aſtoniſhing force, and perſeverance, and dignity.</p>
                  <p>AS independence nouriſhes this high ſpirit among ſavages,<note place="margin">Fortitude.</note> the perpetual wars in which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged call it forth into action. Such long intervals of tranquillity as are frequent in poliſhed ſocieties

are unknown in the ſavage ſtate. Their enmities, as I have obſerved, are implacable and immortal. The valour of the young men is never allowed to ruſt in inaction. The hatchet is always in their hand, either for attack or defence. Even in their hunting excurſions, they muſt be on their guard againſt ſurpriſe from the hoſtile tribes, by which they are ſurrounded. Accuſtomed to continual alarms, they grow familiar with danger; courage becomes an habitual virtue, reſulting naturally from their ſituation, and ſtrengthened by conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The mode of diſplaying fortitude may not be the ſame in ſmall and rude communities, as in more powerful and civilized ſtates. Their ſyſtem of war, and ſtandard of valour, may be formed upon different principles, but in no ſituation does the human mind riſe more ſuperior to the ſenſe of danger, or the dread of death, than in its moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and uncultivated ſtate.</p>

But there are circumſtances which render the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, even of their looſe mode of aſſociation, very powerful. The American tribes are ſmall; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined againſt their neighbours, in proſecution of ancient enemies, or in avenging recent injuries, their intereſts and operations are neither numerous nor complex. Theſe are objects, which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated underſtanding of a ſavage can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. His heart is capable of forming connections, which are ſo little diffuſed. He aſſents with warmth to public meaſures, dictated by paſſions ſimilar to thoſe which direct his own conduct. Hence the ardour with which individuals undertake the moſt perilous ſervice, when the community deems it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Hence their fierce and deep-rooted anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
<pb n="443" facs="unknown:034476_0441_0FFDD8B66C042C58"/>
to the public enemies. Hence their zeal for the honour of their tribe, and that love of their country, which prompts them to brave danger that it may triumph, and to endure the moſt exquiſite torments, without a groan, that it may not be diſgraced.</p>
                  <p>THUS,<note place="margin">Satisfaction with their own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in every ſituation where a human being can be placed, even the moſt unfavourable, there are virtues which peculiarly belong to it; there are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which it calls forth; there is a ſpecies of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which it yields. Nature, with moſt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent intention, conciliates and forms the mind to its condition; the ideas and wiſhes of man extend not beyond that ſtate of ſociety to which he is habituated. What it preſents as objects of contemplation or enjoyment, fills and ſatisfies his mind, and he can hardly conceive any other mode of life to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or even tolerable. The Tartar, accuſtomed to roam over extenſive plains, and to ſubſiſt on the product of his herds, imprecates upon his enemy, as the greateſt of all curſes, that he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to reſide in one place, and to be nouriſhed with the top of a weed. The rude Americans, fond of their own purſuits, and ſatisfied with their own lot, are equally unable to comprehend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or utility of the various accommodations, which, in more poliſhed ſociety, are deemed eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the comfort of life. Far from complaining of their own ſituation, or viewing that of men in a more improved ſtate with admiration or envy, they regard themſelves as the ſtandard of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as beings the beſt entitled, as well as the moſt perfectly qualified, to enjoy real happineſs. Unaccuſtomed to any reſtraint upon their will or their actions, they behold with amazement the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of rank, and the ſubordination which take place in civilized life, and conſider the voluntary ſubmiſſion of one man to another, as a renunciation,

no leſs baſe than unaccountable, of the firſt diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humanity. Void of foreſight, as well as free from care themſelves, and delighted with that ſtate of indolent ſecurity, they wonder at the anxious precautions, the unceaſing induſtry, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated arrangements of Europeans, in guarding againſt diſtant evils, or providing for future wants; and they often exclaim againſt their prepoſterous folly, in thus multiplying the troubles, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the labour of life<note n="*" place="bottom">Charlev.

                  <p>THUS I have finiſhed a laborious delineation of the character and manners of the uncivilized tribes ſcattered over the vaſt continent of America. In this, I aſpire not at rivalling the great maſters who have painted and adorned ſavage life, either in bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſign, or in the glow and beauty of their colouring. I am ſatisfied with the more humble merit of having perſiſted with patient induſtry, in viewing my ſubjects in many various lights, and collecting from the moſt accurate obſervers ſuch detached, and often minute features, as might enable me to exhibit a portrait that reſembles the original.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE I cloſe this part of my work,<note place="margin">General caution with reſpect to this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</note> one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation more is neceſſary, in order to juſtify the concluſions which I have formed, or to prevent the miſtakes into which ſuch as examine them may fall. In contemplating the inhabitants of a country ſo widely extended as America, great attention ſhould be paid to the diverſity of climates under which they are placed. The influence of this I
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:034476_0444_0FFDD8AF9150A9B8"/>
have pointed out with reſpect to ſeveral important particulars, which have been the object of reſearch; but even where it has not been mentioned, it ought not to be overlooked. The provinces of America are of ſuch different temperament, that this alone is ſufficient to conſtitute a diſtinction between their inhabitants. In every part of the earth where man exiſts, the power of climate operates, with deciſive influence, upon his condition and character. In thoſe countries which approach near to the extremes of heat or cold, this influence is ſo conſpicuous as to ſtrike every eye. Whether we conſider man merely as an animal, or as being endowed with rational powers which fit him for activity and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, we ſhall find that he has uniformly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the greateſt perfection of which his nature is capable, in the temperate regions of the globe. There his conſtitution is moſt vigorous, his organs moſt acute, and his form moſt beautiful. There, too, he poſſeſſes a ſuperior extent of capacity, greater fertility of imagination, more enterpriſing courage, and a ſenſibility of heart which gives birth to deſires, not only ardent, but perſevering. In this favourite ſituation he has diſplayed the utmoſt efforts of his genius, in literature, in policy, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, in war, and in all the arts which improve or embelliſh life <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Ferguſon's Eſſay on the Hiſt. of Civil Society, part iii. c. 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THIS powerful operation of climate, is felt moſt ſenſibly by rude nations, and produces greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects than in ſocieties more improved. The talents of civilized men are continually exerted in render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own condition more comfortable; and by their ingenuity and inventions, they can, in a great meaſure, ſupply the defects, and guard againſt the inconveniencies of any climate. But the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:034476_0445_0FFDD8BE382E9568"/>
ſavage is affected by every circumſtance pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his ſituation. He takes no precaution ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to mitigate or to improve it. Like a plant, or an animal, he is formed by the climate under which he is placed, and feels the full force of its influence.</p>
                  <p>IN ſurveying the rude nations of America, this natural diſtinction between the inhabitants of the temperate and torrid zones is very remarkable. They may, accordingly, be divided into two great claſſes. The one comprehends all the North Americans, from the river St. Laurence to the Gulf of Mexico, together with the people of Chili, and a few ſmall tribes towards the extremity of the ſouthern continent. To the other belong all the inhabitants of the iſlands, and thoſe ſettled in the various provinces which extend from the iſthmus of Darien almoſt to the ſouthern confines of Braſil, along the eaſt ſide of the Andes. In the former, which comprehends all the regions of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zone that in America are inhabited, the human ſpecies appears manifeſtly to be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The natives are more robuſt, more active, more intelligent, and more courageous. They poſſeſs, in the moſt eminent degree, that force of mind, and love of independence, which I have pointed out as the chief virtues of man in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage ſtate. They have defended their liberty with perſevering fortitude againſt the Europeans, who ſubdued the other rude nations of America with the greateſt eaſe. The natives of the temperate zone are the only people in the New World who are indebted for their freedom to their own valour. The North Americans, though long encompaſſed by three formidable European powers, ſtill retain part of their original poſſeſſions, and continue to exiſt as independent nations. The people of Chili, though early invaded, ſtill maintain a gallant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:034476_0446_0FFDD8C0E6FBB0C8"/>
with the Spaniards, and have ſet bounds to their encroachments; whereas, in the warmer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, men are more feeble in their frame, leſs vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in the efforts of their mind, of a gentle but daſtardly ſpirit, more enſlaved by pleaſure, and more ſunk in indolence. Accordingly, it is in the torrid zone that the Europeans have moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely eſtabliſhed their dominion over America; the moſt fertile and deſirable provinces in it are ſubjected to their yoke; and if ſeveral tribes there ſtill enjoy independence, it is either becauſe they have never been attacked by an enemy already ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with conqueſt, and poſſeſſed of larger terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories than he was able to occupy, or becauſe they have been ſaved from oppreſſion by their remote and inacceſſible ſituation.</p>
                  <p>CONSPICUOUS as this diſtinction may appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the inhabitants of thoſe different regions, it is not, however, univerſal. Moral and political cauſes, as I have formerly obſerved, affect the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and character of individuals as well as nations, ſtill more powerfully than the influence of climate. There are, accordingly, ſome tribes, in various parts of the torrid zone, poſſeſſed of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, high ſpirit, and the love of independence, in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more temperate climates. We are too little acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe people, to be able to trace the ſeveral circumſtances in their progreſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to which they are indebted for this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pre-eminence. The fact, nevertheleſs, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. As early as the firſt voyage of Columbus, he received information that ſeveral of the iſlands were inhabited by the <hi>Caribbees,</hi> a fierce race of men, no wiſe reſembling their feeble and timid neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In his ſecond expedition to the New World he found his information to be juſt, and was himſelf a witneſs of their intrepid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour<note n="*" place="bottom">Life of Columbus, c. 47, 48.

The ſame character they have maintained invariably in all ſubſequent conteſts with the people of Europe<note n="†" place="bottom">Rochefort Hiſt. des Antilles, 531.</note>; and, even in our own times, we have ſeen them make a gallant ſtand in defence of the laſt territory which the rapacity of their invaders had left in their poſſeſſion <note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE XCVII.</note>. Some nations in Braſil were no leſs eminent for vigiour of mind, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very in war<note n="§" place="bottom">Lery ap. de Bry, iii. 207, &amp;c.</note>.

Other inſtances might be produced. It is not attending to any ſingle cauſe or principle, how powerful and extenſive ſoever its influence may appear, that we can explain the actions, or account for the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of men. Even the law of climate, more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, perhaps, in its operation than any that affects the human ſpecies, cannot be applied, in judging of their conduct, without many exceptions.</p>

                     <p>THE Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic monument of the Carthaginian ſkill in naval affairs, and one of the moſt curious fragments tranſmitted to us by antiquity. The learned and induſtrious Mr. Dodwell, in a diſſertation prefixed to the Periplus of Hanno, in the edition of the Minor Geographers publiſhed at Oxford, endeavours to prove that this is a ſpurious work, the compoſition of ſome Greek, who aſſumed Hanno's name. But M. de Monteſquieu, in his l'Eſprit des Loix, liv. xxi. c. 8. and M. de Bougainville, in a diſſertation publiſhed, tom. xxvi. of the Memoires de l'Academie des Inſcriptions, &amp;c. have eſtabliſhed its authenticity by arguments which to me appear unanſwerable. Ramuſio has accompanied his tranſlation of this curious voyage with a diſſertation tending to illuſtrate it. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colte

de Viaggi, vol. i. p. 112. M. de Bouganville has, with great learning and ability, treated the ſame ſubject. It appears that Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took this voyage in ſmall veſſels, ſo conſtructed, that he could keep cloſe in with the coaſt. He ſailed from Gades to the iſland of Cerne in twelve days. This is probably what is known to the moderns by the name of the iſle of Arguim. It became the chief ſtation of the Carthaginians on that coaſt; and M. de Bouganville contends, that the ciſterns found there are monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Carthaginian power and ingenuity. Proceeding from Cerne, and ſtill following the winding of the coaſt, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, in ſeventeen days, at a promontory which he called <hi>The Weſt Horn,</hi> probably Cape Palmas. From this he advanced to another promontory, which he named <hi>The South Horn,</hi> and which is manifeſtly Cape de T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All the circumſtances contained in the ſhort ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of his journal, which is handed down, to us, concerning the appearance and ſtate of the countries on the coaſt of Africa, are confirmed and illuſtrated by a compariſon with the accounts of modern navigators. Even thoſe circumſtances, which, from their ſeeming improbability, have been produced to invalidate the credibility of his relation, tend to confirm it. He obſerves, that in the country to the ſouth of Cerne, a profound ſilence reigned through the day; but during the night innumerable fires were kindled along the banks of the rivers, and the air reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the noiſe of pipes and drums, and cries of joy. The ſame thing, as Ramuſio obſerves, ſtill takes place. The exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive heat obliges the negroes to take ſhelter in the woods, or in their houſes, during the day. As ſoon as the ſun ſets, they ſally out, and by torch-light enjoy the pleaſure of muſic and dancing, in which they ſpend the night. Ramuſ. i. 113. F. In another place, he mentions the ſea as burning with torrents of fire. What occurred to M Adanſon, on the ſame coaſt, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this: "As ſoon," ſays he, "as the ſun dipped beneath the horizon, and night overſpread the earth with darkneſs, the ſea lent us its friendly light. While the prow of our veſſel ploughed the ſoaming ſurges, it ſeemed to ſet them all on fire. Thus we ſailed in a luminous incloſure, which ſurrounded us like a large circle of rays, from whence darted in the wake of the ſhip a long ſtream of light." Voy. to Senegal, p. 176. This appearance of the ſea obſerved by Hunter, has been mentioned as an argument againſt the authenticity of the Periplus. It is, however, a phenomenon very common in warm climates. Capt. Cook's Second Voyage, vol. i. p. 15.

                     <p>LONG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus round Africa, Polybius, the moſt intelligent and beſt informed hiſtorian of antiquity, and particularly diſtinguiſhed by his attention to geographical reſearches, affirms, that it was not known, in his time, whether Africa was a continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, ſtretching to the ſouth, or whether it was encompaſſed by the ſea. Polybii Hiſt. lib. iii. Pliny the naturaliſt aſſerts, that there can be no communication between the ſouthern and northern temperate zones. Plini. Hiſt. Natur. Edit. in uſum Delph. 4to. lib. ii. c. 68. If they had given full credit to the accounts of thoſe voyages, the former could not have entertained ſuch a doubt, the latter could not have delivered ſuch an opinion. Strabo mentions the voyage of Eudoxus, but treats it as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous tale, lib ii. p. 155; and, according to his account of it, no other judgment can be formed with reſpect to it. Strabo ſeems not to have known any thing with certainty concerning the form and ſtate of the ſouthern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1180. Ptolemy, the moſt inquiſitive and learned of all the ancient geographers, was equally unacquainted with any part of Africa ſituated a few degrees beyond the equinoctial line; for he ſuppoſes that this great continent was not ſurrounded by the ſea, but that it ſtretched, without interruption, towards the ſouth pole: and he ſo far miſtakes its true figure, that he deſcribes the continent as becoming broader and broader as it advanced towards the ſouth.

                     <p>A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very ſtrong and ſingular proof of the ignorance of the ancients with reſpect to the ſituation of the various parts of the earth. When Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander marched along the banks of the Hydaſpes and Aceſine, two of the rivers which fall into the Indus, he obſerved that there were many crocodiles in thoſe rivers, and that the country produced beans of the ſame ſpecies with thoſe which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Egypt. From theſe circumſtances, he concluded that he had diſcovered the ſource of the Nile, and prepared a fleet to ſail down the Hydaſpes to Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1020. This amazing error did not ariſe from any ignorance of geography peculiar to that monarch; for we are informed by Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular attention in order to acquire the knowledge

of this ſcience, and had accurate maps or deſcriptions of the countries through which he marched. Lib. ii. p. 120. But in his age, the knowledge of the Greeks did not extend beyond the limits of the Mediterranean.</p>

                     <p>AS the flux and reflux of the ſea is remarkably great at the mouth of the river Indus, this would render the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon more formidable to the Greeks. Varen Geogr. vol. i. p. 251.</p>

                     <p>IT is probable that the ancients were ſeldom induced to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance ſo far as the mouth of the Ganges, either by motives of curioſity, or views of commercial advantage. In conſequence of this, their idea concerning the poſition of that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch of the Ganges which he diſtinguiſhes by the name of the Great Mouth, in the hundred and forty-ſixth degree of longitude from his firſt meridian in the Fortunate Iſlands. But its true longitude, computed from that meridian, is now determined by aſtronomical obſervations to be only a hundred and five degrees. A geographer ſo eminent, muſt have been betrayed into an error of this magnitude by the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the information which he had received concerning thoſe diſtant regions; and this affords a ſtriking proof of the intercourſe with them being extremely rare. With reſpect to the countries of India along the Ganges, his intelligence was ſtill more defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and his errors more enormous. I ſhall have occaſion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in another place, that he has placed the country of the Seres, or China, no leſs than ſixty degrees farther eaſt than its true po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. M d'Anville, one of the moſt learned and intelligent of the modern geographers, has ſet this matter in a clear light, in two diſſertations publiſhed in Mem. de l'Academ. des Inſcript. &amp;c. tom. xxxii. p. 573, 604.</p>

                     <p>IT is remarkable, that the diſcoveries of the ancients were made chiefly by land; thoſe of the moderns are carried on chiefly by ſea. The progreſs of conqueſt led to the former, that of commerce to the latter. It is a judicious obſervation of Strabo, that the conqueſts of Alexander the Great made known the Eaſt, thoſe of the Romans opened the Weſt, and thoſe of Mithridates

When it is carried on only by ſea, its ſphere may be more extenſive, and its advances more rapid; but it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours under peculiar defects. Though it may make known the poſition of different countries, and aſcertain their boundaries as far as theſe are determined by the ocean, it leaves us in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with reſpect to their interior ſtate. Above two centuries and a half have elapſed ſince the Europeans ſailed round the ſouthern promontory of Africa, and have traded in moſt of its ports; but, in a conſiderable part of that great continent, they have done little more than ſurvey its coaſts, and mark its capes and harbours. Its interior regions are in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. The ancients, who had a very imperfect knowledge of its coaſts, except where they are waſhed by the Mediterranean or Red Sea, were accuſtomed to penetrate into its inland provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and, if we may rely on the teſtimony of Herodotus and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus, had explored many parts of it now altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.

                     <p>THE notion of the ancients concerning ſuch an exceſſive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rendered it uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable, and their perſiſting in this error long after they began to have ſome commercial intercourſe with ſeveral parts of India lying within the tropics, muſt appear ſo ſingular and abſurd, that it may not be unacceptable to ſome of my readers to produce evidence of their holding this opinion, and to account for the apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtence of their theory with their experience. Cicero, who had beſtowed attention upon every part of philoſophy known to the ancients, ſeems to have believed that the torrid zone was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inhabitable, and, of conſequence, that there could be no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the northern and ſouthern temperate zones. He introduces Africanus thus addreſſing the younger Scipio: "You ſee this earth encompaſſed, and as it were, bound in by certain zones, of which, two, at the greateſt diſtance from each other, and ſuſtaining the oppoſite poles of heaven, are frozen with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual cold; the middle one, and the largeſt, of all, is burnt with the heat of the ſun; two are habitable, the people in the ſouthern one are antipodes to us, with whom we have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection." <hi>Somnium Scipionis,</hi> c. 6. Geminus, a Greek philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, contemporary with Cicero, delivers the ſame doctrine, not in a popular work, but in his <gap reason="foreign">

temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and concerning thoſe who are called antipodes, it muſt be always underſtood, that we have no certain knowledge or information concerning the ſouthern tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate zone, whether it be inhabited or not. But from the ſpherical figure of the earth, and the courſe which the ſun holds between the tropics, we conclude that there is another zone, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the ſouth, which enjoys the ſame degree of temperature with the northern one which we inhabit." Cap. xiii. p. 31. ap. Petavii Opus de Doctr. Temper. in quo Uranologium ſive Syſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata var. Auctorum. Amſt. 1705. vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturaliſt, with reſpect to both theſe points, was the ſame: "There are five diviſions of the earth, which are called zones. All that portion which lies near to the two oppoſite poles is oppreſſed with vehement cold, and eternal froſt. There unbleſt with the aſpect of milder ſtars, perpetual darkneſs reigns, or at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a feeble light reflected from ſurrounding ſnows. The mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the earth, in which is the orbit of the ſun, is ſcorched and burnt up with flames and fiery vapour. Between theſe torrid and frozen diſtricts lie two other portions of the earth, which are temperate; but, on account of the burning region interpoſed, there can be no communication between them. Thus Heaven has deprived us of three parts of the earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers his opinion to the ſame effect, in terms no leſs explicit: "The portion of the earth which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone, is rendered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. 154. To theſe I might add the authority of many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable philoſophers and hiſtorians of antiquity.</p>
                     <p>IN order to explain the ſenſe in which this doctrine was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, we may obſerve, that Parmenides, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Strabo, was the firſt who divided the earth into five zones, and he extended the limits of the zone which he ſuppoſed to be uninhabitable on account of heat, beyond the tropics. Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, as we learn likewiſe from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the different zones in the ſame manner as they are defined by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern geographers. But the progreſs of diſcovery having gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally demonſtrated that ſeveral regions of the earth which lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tropics were not only habitable, but populous and fertile, this induced later geographers to circumſcribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not eaſy to aſcertain with preciſion the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries which they allotted to it. From a paſſage in Strabo, who, as far as I know, is the only author of antiquity from whom we receive any hint concerning this ſubject, I ſhould conjecture, that thoſe who calculated according to the meaſurement of the earth by Eratoſthenes, ſuppoſed the torrid zone to comprehend near ſixteen degrees, about eight on each ſide of the equator; whereas ſuch as followed the computation of Poſidonius allotted about twenty-four degrees, or ſomewhat more than twelve degrees on
<pb n="457" facs="unknown:034476_0454_0FFDD8A99DE1B050"/>
each ſide of the equator to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib, ii. p. 151. According to the former opinion, about two-thirds of that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth which lies between the tropics was conſidered as habitable; according to the latter, about one half of it. With this reſtriction, the doctrine of the ancients concerning the torrid zone appears leſs abſurd; and we can conceive the reaſon of their aſſerting this zone to be uninhabitable, even after they had opened a communication with ſeveral places within the tropics. When men of ſcience ſpoke of the torrid zone, they conſidered it as it was limited by the definition of geographers to ſixteen, or at the utmoſt to twenty-four degrees; and as they knew almoſt nothing of the countries nearer to the equator, they might ſtill ſuppoſe them to be uninhabitable. In looſe and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar diſcourſe, the name of the torrid zone continued to be given to all that portion of the earth which lies within the tropics. Cicero ſeems to have been unacquainted with thoſe ideas of the later geographers, and adhering to the diviſion of Parmenides, deſcribes the torrid zone as the largeſt of the five. Some of the ancients rejected the notion concerning the intolerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular error. This, we are told by Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch, was the ſentiment of Pythagoras, and we learn from Strabo, that Eratoſthenes and Polybius had adopted the ſame opinion, lib. ii. 154. Ptolemy ſeems to have paid no regard to the ancient doctrine and opinions concerning the torrid zone.</p>

                     <p>THE ſpherical figure of the earth was known to the ancient geographers. They invented the method, ſtill in uſe, of computing the longitude and latitude of different places. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their doctrine, the equator, or imaginary line which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſes the earth, contained three hundred and ſixty degrees; theſe they divided into twenty-four parts, or hours, each equal to fifteen degrees. The country of the <hi>Seres,</hi> or <hi>Sinae,</hi> being the fartheſt part of India known to the ancients, was ſuppoſed, by Marinus Tyrius, the moſt eminent of the ancient geographers before Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees to the eaſt of the firſt meridian, paſſing through the Fortunate Iſlands. Ptolemaei Geogr. lib. i. c. 11. If this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was well-founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was only nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees weſt from the Fortunate or Canary Iſlands; and the navigation, in that direction, was much ſhorter than by the courſe which the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe were purſuing. Marco Polo, in his travels, had deſcribed countries, particularly the iſland of Cipango or Zipangri ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Japan, conſiderably to the eaſt of any part of Aſia known to the ancients. Marcus Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii. c. 70. lib. iii. c. 2. Of courſe, this country, as it exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded further to the eaſt, was ſtill nearer to the Canary Iſlands. The concluſions of Columbus, though drawn from inaccurate obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were juſt. If the ſuppoſitions of Marinus had been well

founded, and if the countries, which Marco Polo viſited, had been ſituated to the eaſt of thoſe whoſe longitude Marinus had aſcertained, the proper and neareſt courſe to the Eaſt Indies muſt have been to ſteer directly weſt. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. A more extenſive knowledge of the globe has now diſcovered the great error of Marinus, in ſuppoſing China to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees eaſt from the Canary Iſlands, and that even Ptolemy was miſtaken, when he reduced the longitude of China to twelve hours, or one hundred and eighty degrees. The longitude of the weſtern frontier of that vaſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is ſeven hours, or one hundred and fifteen degrees from the meridian of the Canary Iſlands. But Columbus followed the light which his age afforded, and relied upon the authority of writers, who were, at that time, regarded as the inſtructors and guides of mankind in the ſcience of geography.</p>

                     <p>AS the Portugueſe, in making their diſcoveries, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part far from the coaſt of Africa, they concluded that birds, whoſe flight they obſerved with great attention, did not venture to any conſiderable diſtance from land.

                     <p>THE account which Columbus gives of the humanity and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly behaviour of the natives on this occaſion is very ſtriking. "The king (ſays he, in a letter to Ferdinand and Iſabella) having been informed of our misfortune, expreſſed great grief for our loſs, and immediately ſent abroad all the people in the place in many large canoes; we ſoon unloaded the ſhip of every thing that was upon deck, as the king gave us great aſſiſtance: he himſelf, with his brothers and relations, took all poſſible care that every thing ſhould be properly done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both aboard and on ſhore. And, from time to time, he ſent ſome of his relations weeping, to beg of me not to be dejected, for he would give me all that he had. I can aſſure your highneſſes, that ſo much care would not have been taken in ſecuring our effects in any part of Spain, as all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was put together in one place near his palace, until the houſes which he wanted to prepare for the cuſtody of it, were emptied. He immediately placed a guard of armed men, who watched during the whole night, and thoſe on ſhore lamented as if they had been much intereſted in our loſs. The people are ſo affectionate, ſo tractable, and ſo peaceable, that I ſwear to your highneſſes, that there is not a better race of men, nor a better country in the world. They love their neighbour as themſelves; their converſation is the ſweeteſt and mildeſt in the world, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and always accompanied with a ſmile. And although it is true that they go naked, yet your highneſſes may be aſſured that they have many very commendable cuſtoms; the king is ſerved with great ſtate, and his behaviour is ſo decent, that it is pleaſant to ſee him, as it is likewiſe to obſerve the wonderful memory which theſe people have, and their deſire of knowing every thing,

which leads them to inquire into its cauſes and effects." Life of Columbus, c. 32. It is probable, that the Spaniards were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for this officious attention, to the opinion which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians entertained of them as a ſuperior order of beings.</p>

                     <p>EVERY monument or ſuch a man as Columbus is valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdinand and Iſabella, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what paſſed on this occaſion, exhibits a moſt ſtriking pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his intrepidity, his humanity, his prudence, his public ſpirit, and courtly addreſs. "I would have been leſs concerned for this misfortune, had I alone been in danger, both becauſe my life is a debt that I owe to the Supreme Creator, and becauſe I have at other times been expoſed to the moſt imminent hazard. But what gave me infinite grief and vexation was, that after it had pleaſed our Lord to give me faith to undertake this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, in which I had now been ſo ſucceſsful, that my opponents would have been convinced, and the glory of your highneſſes, and the extent of your territory increaſed by me; it ſhould pleaſe the Divine Majeſty to ſtop all by my death. All this would have been more tolerable, had it not been attended with the loſs of thoſe men whom I had carried with me, upon promiſe of the greateſt proſperity, who ſeeing themſelves in ſuch diſtreſs, curſed not only their coming along with me, but that fear and awe of me, which prevented them from returning as they often had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to have done. But beſides all this, my ſorrow was greatly increaſed, by recollecting that I had left my two ſons at ſchool at Cordova, deſtitute of friends, in a foreign country, when it could not in all probability be known that I had done ſuch ſervices as might induce your highneſſes to remember them. And though I comforted myſelf with the faith that our Lord would not permit that, which tended ſo much to the glory of his church, and which I had brought about with ſo much trouble, to remain imperfect, yet I conſidered that on account of my ſins, it was his will to deprive me of that glory, which I might have attained in this world. While in this confuſed ſtate, I thought on the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which accompanies your highneſſes, and imagined, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhould periſh, and the veſſel be loſt, it was poſſible that you might ſomehow come to the knowledge of my voyage, and the ſucceſs with which it was attended. For that reaſon I wrote upon parchment with the brevity which the ſituation required, that I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the lands which I promiſed, in how many days I had done it, and what courſe I had followed. I mentioned the goodneſs of the country, the character of the inhabitants, and that your
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:034476_0459_0FFDD8D5D7FC2AD0"/>
highneſſes ſubjects were left in poſſeſſion of all that I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Having ſealed this writing, I addreſſed it to your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and promiſed a thouſand ducats to any perſon who ſhould deliver it ſealed, ſo that if any foreigners found it, the promiſed reward might prevail on them not to give the information to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I then cauſed a great caſk to be brought to me, and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and afterwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the caſk, and having ſtopped it well, I caſt it, into the ſea. All the men believed that it was ſome act of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Imagining that this might never chance to be taken up, as the ſhips approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like the firſt, and placed it at the top of the poop, ſo that if the ſhip ſunk, the caſk remaining above water might be committed to the guidance of fortune."</p>

In a few days after their arrival, all the four died; but the pilot having been received into the houſe of Columbus, his intimate friend diſcloſed to him, before his death, the ſecret of the diſcovery which he had accidentally made, and left him his papers, containing a journal of the voyage, which ſerved as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking.

                     <p>THE Spaniards are not the only people who have called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Columbus's claim to the honour of having diſcovered Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Some German authors aſcribe this honour to Martin Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haim, their countryman. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of Schwartzbach, citizens of the firſt rank in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial town of Nuremberg. Having ſtudied under the celebrated John Muller, better known by the name of Regiomontanus, he acquired ſuch knowledge of coſmography, as excited a deſire of exploring thoſe regions, the ſituation and qualities of which he had been accuſtomed, under that able maſter, to inveſtigate and deſcribe. Under the patronage of the ducheſs of Burgundy he repaired to Liſbon, whither the fame of the Portugueſe diſcoveries invited all the adventurous ſpirits of the age. There, as we learn from Herman Schedel, of whoſe <hi>Chronicon Mundi</hi> a German tranſlation was printed at Nuremberg, A. D. 1493, his merit as a coſmographer raiſed him, in conjunction with Diego Cano, to the command of a ſquadron fitted out for diſcovery in the year 1483. In that voyage, he is ſaid to have diſcovered the kingdom of Congo. He ſettled in the iſland of Fayal, one of the Azores, and was a particular friend of Columbus. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terreſtrial globe made by Behaim, on which he demonſtrated the courſe that he purpoſed to hold in ſearch of the communication with the South Sea, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards diſcovered.

but from more full and accurate information, communicated to me by the learned Dr. John Reinold Forſter, I am now ſatisfied that I was miſtaken. Dr. Forſter has been likewiſe ſo good as to favour me with a copy of Behaim's map, as publiſhed by Dop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelmayer in his account of the Mathematicians and Artiſts of Nuremberg. From this map, the imperfection of coſmographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge at that period is manifeſt. Hardly one place is laid down in its true ſituation. Nor can I diſcover from it any reaſon to ſuppoſe that Behaim had the leaſt knowledge of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in America. He delineates, indeed, an iſland to which he gives the name of St. Brandon. This, it is imagined, may be ſome part of Guiana, ſuppoſed at firſt to be an iſland. He places it in the ſame latitude with the Cape Verd iſles, and I ſuſpect it to be an imaginary iſland which has been admitted into ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient maps on no better authority than the legend of the Iriſh St. Brandon or Brendan, whoſe ſtory is ſo childiſhly fabulous, as to be unworthy of any notice. Girald. Cambrienſis ap. Miſſingham Florilegium Sanctorum, p. 427.</p>
                     <p>THE pretenſions of the Welſh to the diſcovery of America ſeem not to reſt on a foundation much more ſolid. In the twelfth century, according to Powell, a diſpute having ariſen among the ſons of Owen Guyneth, king of North-Wales, concerning the ſucceſſion of his crown, Madoc, one of their number, weary of this contention, betook himſelf to ſea in queſt of a more quiet ſettlement. He ſteered due weſt, leaving Ireland to the north, and arrived in an unknown country, which appeared to him ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, that he returned to Wales, and carried thither ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his adherents and companions. This is ſaid to have happened about the year 1170, and after that, he and his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony were heard of no more. But it is to be obſerved, that Powell, on whoſe teſtimony the authenticity of this ſtory reſts, publiſhed his hiſtory above four centuries from the date of the event which he relates. Among a people as rude and illiterate as the Welſh at that period, the memory of a tranſaction ſo remote muſt have been very imperfectly preſerved, and would require to be confirmed by ſome author of greater credit, and nearer to the aera of Madoc's voyage than Powell. Later antiquaries have indeed appealed to the teſtimony of Meredith ap Rhees, a Welſh bard, who died A. D. 1477. But he too lived at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time from the event, that he cannot be conſidered as a witneſs of much more credit than Powell. Beſides, his verſes, publiſhed by Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 1. convey no information, but that Madoc, diſſatisfied with his domeſtic ſituation, employed himſelf in ſearching the ocean for new poſſeſſions. But even if we admit the authenticity of Powell's ſtory, it does not follow that the unknown country which Madoc diſcovered by ſteering weſt, in ſuch a courſe as to leave Ireland to the north, was any
<pb n="465" facs="unknown:034476_0462_0FFDD8DF0861DFC0"/>
part of America. The naval ſkill of the Welſh in the twelfth century was hardly equal to ſuch a voyage. If he made any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery at all, it is more probable that it was Madeira, or ſome other of the weſtern iſles. The affinity of the Welſh language with ſome dialects ſpoken in America, has been mentioned as a circumſtance which confirms the truth of Madoc's voyage. But that affinity has been obſerved in ſo few inſtances, and in ſome of theſe is ſo obſcure, or ſo fanciful, that no concluſion can be drawn from the caſual reſemblance of a ſmall number of words. There is a bird, which, as far as is yet known, is found only on the coaſts of South America, from Port Deſire to the Straits of Magellan. It is diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Penguin.</hi> This word in the Welſh language ſignifies <hi>White-head.</hi> Almoſt all the authors who favour the pretenſions of the Welſh to the diſcovery of America, mention this as an irrefragable proof of the affinity of the Welſh language with that ſpoken in this region of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. But Mr. Pennant, who has given a ſcientific deſcription of the Penguin, obſerves, that all the birds of this genus have black heads, "ſo that we muſt reſign every hope (adds he) founded on this hypotheſis of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New World." Philoſ. Tranſact. vol. lviii. p. 91, &amp;c. Beſide this, if the Welſh, towards the cloſe of the twelfth century, had ſettled in any part of America, ſome remains of the Chriſtian doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and rites muſt have been found among their deſcendants, when they were diſcovered about three hundred years poſterior to their migration; a period ſo ſhort, that, in the courſe of it, we cannot well ſuppoſe that all European ideas and arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttleton, in his notes to the fifth book of his Hiſtory of Henry II. p. 371, has examined what Powell relates concerning the diſcoveries made by Madoc, and invalidates the truth of his ſtory by other arguments of great weight.</p>
                     <p>THE pretenſions of the Norwegians to the diſcovery of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, ſeem to be better founded than thoſe of the Germans or Welſh. The inhabitants of Scandinavia were remarkable in the middle ages for the boldneſs and extent of their maritime excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. In 874, the Norwegians diſcovered, and planted a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony in Iceland. In 982, they diſcovered Greenland, and eſtabliſhed ſettlements there. From that, ſome of their naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors proceeded towards the weſt, and diſcovered a country more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting than thoſe horrid regions with which they were acquainted. According to their repreſentations, this country was ſandy on the coaſts, but in the interior parts level and covered with wood, on which account they gave it the name of <hi>Helle-land,</hi> and <hi>Mark-land,</hi> and having afterwards found ſome plants of the vine which bore grapes, they called it <hi>Win-land.</hi> The credit of this ſtory reſts, as far as I know, on the authority of the <hi>ſaga,</hi> or chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of king Olaus, compoſed by Snorro Sturlonides, or <hi>Sturluſons,</hi>
                        <pb n="466" facs="unknown:034476_0463_0FFDD8E10B8EEC60"/>
publiſhed by Perinſkiold at Stockholm, A. D. 1697. As Snorro was born in the year 1179, his chronicle might be compiled about two centuries after the event which he relates. His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the navigation and diſcoveries of <hi>Biorn,</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion <hi>Lief,</hi> is a very rude confuſed tale, p. 104. 110. 326. It is impoſſible to diſcover from him, what part of America it was in which the Norwegians landed. According to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the length of the days and nights, it muſt have been as far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, on ſome part of the coaſt of Labradore, approaching near to the entry of Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Straits. Grapes, certainly, are not the production of that country. Torfeus ſuppoſes that there is an error in the text, by rectifying of which, the place where the Norwegians landed may be ſuppoſed to be ſituated in latitude 49°. But neither is that the region of the vine in America. From peruſing Snorro's tale, I ſhould think the ſituation of Newfoundland correſponds beſt with that of the country diſcovered by the Norwegians. Grapes, however, are not the production of that barren iſland. Other conjectures are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. a l'Hiſt. de Dennem. 175, &amp;c. I am not ſufficiently acquainted with the literature of the north, to examine them. It ſeems manifeſt, that if the Norwegians did diſcover any part of America at that period, their attempts to plant colonies proved unſucceſsful, and all knowledge of it was ſoon loſt.</p>

This he delivered as his opinion to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus himſelf, who was his gueſt for ſome time on his return from his ſecond voyage; and he ſupports it by ſeveral arguments, moſtly founded on the authority of Sir John Mandeville.

                     <p>COLUMBUS ſeems to have formed ſome very ſingular opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the countries which he had now diſcovered. The violent ſwell and agitation of the waters on the coaſt of Trinidad led him to conclude this to be the higheſt part of the

                     <p>IT is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo, the moſt ancient Spaniſh hiſtorians of America, nor Herrera, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Ojeda, or his companion Veſpucci, as the firſt diſcoverers of the continent of America. They uniformly aſcribe this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Columbus. Some have ſuppoſed that national reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Veſpucci, for deſerting the ſervice of Spain, and entering into that of Portugal, may have prompted theſe writers to conceal the actions which he performed. But Martyr and Benzoni, both Italians, could not be warped by the ſame preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. Martyr was a contemporary author; he reſided in the court of Spain, and had the beſt opportunity to be exactly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reſpect to all public tranſactions; and yet, neither in his Decads, the firſt general hiſtory publiſhed of the New World, nor in his Epiſtles, which contain an account of all the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able events of his time, does he aſcribe to Veſpucci the honour of having firſt diſcovered the continent. Benzoni went as an adventurer to America in the year 1541, and reſided there a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. He appears to have been animated with a warm zeal for the honour of Italy, his native country, and yet does not mention the exploits and diſcoveries of Veſpucci-Herrera, who compiled his general hiſtory of America from the moſt authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic records, not only follows thoſe early writers, but accuſes Veſpucci of falſifying the dates of both the voyages which he made to the New World, and of confounding the one with the other, in order that he might arrogate to himſelf the glory of having diſcovered the continent. Her. dec. lib. iv. c. 2. He aſſerts, that in a judicial inquiry into this matter by the royal
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:034476_0466_0FFDD8EA4B872FE8"/>
fiſcal, it was proved by the teſtimony of Ojeda himſelf, that he touched at Hiſpaniola when returning to Spain from his firſt voyage; whereas Veſpucci gave out that they returned directly to Cadiz from the coaſt of Paria, and touched at Hiſpaniola only in their ſecond voyage; and that he had finiſhed the voyage in five months; whereas, according to Veſpucci's account, he had employed ſeventeen months in performing it. Viaggio primo de Am. Veſpucci, p. 36. Viag ſecundo, p. 45. Herrera gives a more full account of this inqueſt in another part of his decads, and to the ſame effect. Her dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 5. Columbus was in Hiſpaniola when Ojeda arrived there, and had by that time come to an agreement with Roldan, who oppoſed Ojeda's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to excite a new in ſurrection, and, of conſequence, his voyage muſt have been poſterior to that of the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 28. According to Veſpucci's account, he ſet out on his firſt voyage May 10th, 1497. Viag. primo, p. 6. At that time Columbus was in the court of Spain preparing for his voyage, and ſeems to have enjoyed a conſiderable degree of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The affairs of the New World were at this juncture under the direction of Antonio Torres, a friend of Columbus. It is not probable, that at that period a commiſſion would be granted to another perſon, to anticipate the admiral, by undertaking a voyage which he himſelf intended to perform. Fonſeca, who patronized Ojeda, and granted the licence for his voyage, was not recalled to court, and reinſtated in the direction of Indian affairs, until the death of prince John, which happened Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1497, P. Martyr, Ep. 182. ſeveral months poſterior to the time at which Veſpucci pretends to have ſet out upon his voyage. A life of Veſpucci was publiſhed at Florence by the Abate Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini, A. D. 1745, 4to. It is a work of no merit, written with little judgment, and leſs candour. He contends for his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's title to the diſcovery of the continent with all the blind zeal of national partiality, but produces no new evidence to ſupport it.

When I approached its mouth, I had the moſt vehement deſire to aſcertain the truth with my own eyes; and I have found the matter to be exactly as it was repreſented. This I deduce particularly from one circumſtance: When we took our departure from Monte-Viedo, a fort ſituated more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the river, and where its breadth is conſiderably diminiſhed, we ſailed a complete day before we diſcovered the land on the oppoſite bank of the river; and when we were in the middle of the channel, we could not diſcern land on either ſide, and ſaw nothing but the ſky and water, as if we had been in ſome great ocean. Indeed, we ſhould have taken it to be ſea, if the freſh water of the river, which was turbid like the Po, had not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us that it was a river. Moreover, at Buenos Ayres, another hundred miles up the river, and where it is ſtill much narrower,
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:034476_0471_0FFDD8F6AD6FDDD0"/>
it is not only impoſſible to diſcern the oppoſite coaſt, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very low and flat; but one cannot perceive the houſes or the tops of the ſteeples in the Portugueſe ſettlement at Colonia on the other ſide of the river."

                     <p>ACOSTA is the firſt philoſopher, as far as I know, who endeavoured to account for the different degrees of heat in the old and new continents, by the agency of the winds which blow in each. Hiſt. Moral. &amp;c. lib. ii. and iii. M. de Buffon adopts this theory, and has not only improved it by new obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but has employed his amazing powers of deſcriptive elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in embelliſhing and placing it in the moſt ſtriking light. Some remarks may be added, which tend to illuſtrate more fully a doctrine of much importance in every inquiry concerning the temperature of various climates.</p>
                     <p>WHEN a cold wind blows over land, it muſt in its paſſage rob the ſurface of ſome of its heat. By means of this, the coldneſs of the wind is abated. But if it continue to blow in the ſame direction, it will come, by degrees, to paſs over a ſurface already cooled, and will ſuffer no longer any abatement of its own keen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thus as it advances over a large tract of land, it brings on all the ſeverity of intenſe froſt.</p>
                     <p>LET the ſame wind blow over an extenſive and deep ſea; the ſuperficial water muſt be immediately cooled to a certain degree, and the wind proportionally warmed. But the ſuperficial and colder water becoming ſpecifically heavier than the warmer water below it, deſcends; what is warmer ſupplies its place, which, as
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:034476_0472_0FFDD8FA5D02BE18"/>
it comes to be cooled in its turn, continues to warm the air which paſſes over it, or to diminiſh its cold. This change of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial water, and ſucceſſive aſcent of that which is warmer, and the conſequent ſucceſſive abatement of coldneſs in the air, is aided by the agitation cauſed in the ſea by the mechanical action of the wind, and alſo by the motion of the tides. This will go on, and the rigour of the wind will continue to diminiſh until the whole water is ſo far cooled, that the water on the ſurface is no longer removed from the action of the wind, faſt enough to hinder it from being arreſted by froſt. Whenever the ſurface freezes, the wind is no longer warmed from the water below, and it goes on with undiminiſhed cold.</p>
                     <p>FROM thoſe principles, may be explained the ſeverity of winter froſts in extenſive continents; their mildneſs in ſmall iſlands, and the ſuperior rigour of winter in thoſe parts of North America with which we are beſt acquainted. In the north-weſt parts of Europe, the ſeverity of winter is mitigated by the weſt winds, which uſually blow in the months of November, December, and part of January.</p>
                     <p>ON the other hand, when a warm wind blows over land, it heats the ſurface, which muſt therefore ceaſe to abate the fervour of the wind. But the ſame wind blowing over water, agitates it, brings up the colder water from below, and thus is continually loſing ſomewhat of its own heat.</p>
                     <p>BUT the great power of the ſea to mitigate the heat of the wind or air paſſing over it, proceeds from the following circumſtance: that on account of the tranſparency of the ſea, its ſurface cannot be heated to a great degree by the ſun's rays; whereas the ground, ſubjected to their influence, very ſoon acquires great heat. When, therefore, the wind blows over a torrid continent, it is ſoon raiſed to a heat almoſt intolerable; but during its paſſage over an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ocean, it is gradually cooled; ſo that on its arrival at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt ſhore, it is again fit for reſpiration.</p>
                     <p>THOSE principles will account for the ſultry heats of large continents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate of iſlands in the ſame latitude; and for the ſuperior warmth in ſummer, which large continents, ſituated in the temperate or colder zones of the earth, enjoy, when compared with that of iſlands. The heat of a climate depends not only upon the immediate effect of the ſun's rays, but on their continued operation, on the effect which they have formerly produced, and which remains for ſome time in the ground. This is the reaſon why the day is warmeſt about two in ths afternoon, the ſummer warmeſt about the middle of July, and the winter coldeſt about the middle of January.</p>
                     <p>THE foreſts which cover America, and hinder the ſun-beams from heating the ground, are a great cauſe of the temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the equatorial parts. The ground, not being heated,
<pb n="476" facs="unknown:034476_0473_0FFDD8FD1D163A60"/>
cannot heat the air; and the leaves, which receive the rays inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from the ground, have not a maſs of matter ſufficient to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb heat enough for this purpoſe. Beſides, it is a known fact, that the vegetative power of a plant occaſions a perſpiration from the leaves in proportion to the heat to which they are expoſed; and, from the nature of evaporation, this perſpiration produces a cold in the leaf proportional to the perſpiration. Thus the effect of the leaf in heating the air in contact with it, is prodigiouſly diminiſhed. For thoſe obſervations, which throw much additional light on this curious ſubject, I am indebted to my ingenious friend, Mr. Robiſon, profeſſor of natural philoſophy in the univerſity of Edinburgh.</p>

with iſlands of floating ice. Hiſtoire des Navigations aux Terres Auſtrales, tom. ii. 256, &amp;c. Dr. Halley fell in with ice in latitude 59°. Id. tom. i. p. 47. Commodore Byron, when on the coaſt of Patagonia, latitude 50° 33′ ſouth, on the fifteenth of December, which is midſummer in that part of the globe, the twenty-firſt of December being the longeſt day there, compares the climate to that of England in the middle of winter. Voyages by Hawkeſworth, i. 25. Mr. Banks having landed on Terra del Fuego, in the Bay of Good Succeſs, latitude 55°, on the ſixteenth of January, which correſponds to the month of July in our hemiſphere, two of his attendants died in one night of extreme cold, and all the party were in the moſt imminent danger of periſhing. Id. ii. 51, 52. By the fourteenth of March, correſponding to September in our hemiſphere, winter was ſet in with rigour, and the mountains were covered with ſnow. Ibid. 72. Captain Cook, in his voyage towards the South pole, furniſhes new and ſtriking inſtances of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary predominance of cold in this region of the globe. "Who would have thought (ſays he) that an iſland, of no greater extent than ſeventy leagues in circuit, ſituated between the latitude of 54° and 55°, ſhould in the very height of ſummer be, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wholly covered, many fathoms deep, with frozen ſnow; but more eſpecially the S. W. coaſt? The very ſummits of the lofty mountains were caſed with ſnow and ice; but the quantity that lay in the valleys is incredible; and at the bottom of the bays, the coaſt was terminated by a wall of ice of conſiderable height." Vol. ii. p. 217.</p>
                     <p>IN ſome places of the ancient continent, an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mr. Bogle, in his embaſſy to the court of the Delai Lama, paſſed the winter of the year 1774 at Chamnenning, in latitude 31° 39′ N. He often found the thermometer in his room twenty-nine degrees un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the freezing point by Fahrenheit's ſcale; and in the middle of April the ſtanding waters were all frozen, and heavy ſhowers of ſnow frequently fell. The extraordinary elevation of the country ſeems to be the cauſe of this exceſſive cold. In travelling from Indoſtan to Thibet, the aſcent to the ſummit of the Boutan Mountains is very great, but the deſcent on the other ſide is not in equal proportion. The kingdom of Thibet is an elevated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, extremely bare and deſolate. Account of Thibet by Mr. Stewart, read in the Royal Society, p. 7. The extraordinary cold in low latitudes in America cannot be accounted for by the ſame cauſe. Thoſe regions are not remarkable for elevation. Some of them are countries depreſſed and level.</p>
                     <p>THE moſt obvious and probable cauſe of the ſuperior degree of cold, towards the ſouthern extremity of America, ſeems to be the form of the continent there. Its breadth gradually decreaſes
<pb n="478" facs="unknown:034476_0475_0FFDD902821825E8"/>
as it ſtretches from St. Antonio ſouthwards, and from the bay of St. Julian to the Straits of Magellan its dimenſions are much contracted. On the caſt and weſt ſides, it is waſhed by the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic and Pacific Oceans. From its ſouthern point it is probable that a great extent of ſea, without any conſiderable tract of land, reaches to the Antarctic pole In whichever of theſe directions the wind blows, it is cooled before it approaches the Magellanic regions, by paſſing over a vaſt body of water, nor is the land there of ſuch extent that it can recover any conſiderable degree of heat in its progreſs over it. Theſe circumſtances concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this diſtrict of America, more ſimilar to that of an inſular, than to that of a continental climate, and hinder it from acquiring the ſame degree of ſummer heat with places in Europe and Aſia, in a correſponding northern latitude. The north wind is the only one that reaches this part of America, after blowing over a great continent. But from an attentive ſurvey of its poſition, this will be found to have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, rather to diminiſh than augment the degree of heat. The ſouthern extremity of America is properly the termination of the immenſe ridge of the Andes, which ſtretches nearly in a direct line from north to ſouth, through the whole extent of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. The moſt ſultry regions in South America, Guiana, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil, Paraguay, and Tucaman, lie many degrees to the eaſt of the Magellanic regions. The level country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is ſituated conſiderably to the weſt of them. The north wind then, though it blows over land, does not bring to the ſouthern extremity of America, an increaſe of heat col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in its paſſage over torrid regions; but before it arrives there, it muſt have ſwept along the ſummits of the Andes, and comes impregnated with the cold of that frozen region.</p>
                     <p>THOUGH it be now demonſtrated that there is no ſouthern continent in that region of the globe which it was ſuppoſed to occupy, it appears to be certain from Captain Cook's diſcoveries, that there is a large tract of land near the ſouth pole, which is the ſource of moſt of the ice ſpread over the vaſt ſouthern ocean. Vol. ii. p. 230, 239, &amp;c. Whether the influence of this remote frozen continent may reach the ſouthern extremity of America, and affect its climate, is an inquiry not unworthy of attention.</p>

In the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſettlements, which are ſituated either within the torrid zone, or in countries bordering upon it, the increaſe of heat, and diverſity of food, prevent ſheep and horned cattle from attaining the ſame ſize as in Europe.

                     <p>WERE this the place for entering into a long and intricate geographical diſquiſition, many curious obſervations might ariſe from comparing the accounts of the two Ruſſian voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and the charts of their reſpective navigations. One remark is applicable to both. We cannot rely with abſolute certainty on the poſition which they aſſign to ſeveral of the places which they viſited. The weather was ſo extremely foggy, that they ſeldom ſaw the ſun or ſtars, and the poſition of the iſlands and ſuppoſed continents was commonly determined by reckoning, not by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.

Behring and Tſchirikow proceeded much farther towards the eaſt than Krenitzin. The land diſcovered by Behring, which he imagined to be the American continent, is in the 236th degree of longitude from the firſt meridian in the iſle of Ferro, and in 58° 28′ of latitude. Tſchirikow came upon the ſame coaſt in lon. 241°, lat. 56°. Muller, i. 248, 249. The former muſt have advanced 60 degrees from the port of Petropawlowſki, from which he took his departure, and the latter 65 degrees. But from the chart of Krenitzin's voyage, it appears that he did not ſail farther towards the eaſt than the 208th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and only 32 degrees from Petropawlowſki. In 1741, Behring and Tſchirikow, both in going and returning, held a courſe which was moſtly to the ſouth of that chain of iſlands, which they diſcovered; and obſerving the mountainous and rugged aſpect of the head-lands which they deſcried towards the north, they ſuppoſed them to be promontories belonging to ſome part of the American continent, which, as they fancied, ſtretched as far South. as the latitude 56. In this manner they are laid down in the chart publiſhed by Muller, and likewiſe in a manuſcript chart drawn by a mate of Behring's ſhip, communicated to me by Mr. Profeſſor Robiſon. But in 1769, Krenitzin, after wintering in the iſland Alaxa, ſtood ſo far towards the north in his return, that his courſe lay through the middle of what Behring and Tſchirikow had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a continent, which he found to be an open ſea, and that they had miſtaken rocky iſles for the head-lands of a continent. It is probable, that the countries diſcovered in 1741, towards the eaſt, do not belong to the American continent, but are only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the chain of iſlands. The number of volcanos in this region of the globe is remarkable. There are ſeveral in Kamchatka, and not one of the iſlands, great or ſmall, as far as the Ruſſian navigation extends, is without them. Many are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually burning, and the mountains in all bear parts of having been once in a ſtate of eruption. Were I diſpoſed to admit ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures as have found place in other enquiries concerning the peopling of America, I might ſuppoſe that this part of the earth, having manifeſtly ſuffered violent convulſions from earthquakes and volcanos, an iſthmus, which may have formerly united Aſia to America, has been broken, and formed into a cluſter of iſlands by the ſhock.</p>
                     <p>IT is ſingular, that at the very time the Ruſſian navigators were attempting to make diſcoveries in the north-weſt of America, the Spaniards were proſecuting the ſame deſign from another quarter. In 1769, two ſmall veſſels ſailed from Loretto in California to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the coaſts of the country to the north of that peninſula. They advanced no farther than the port of Monte-Rey in latitude 36. But, in ſeveral ſucceſſive expeditions fitted out from the port of St. Blas in New Galicia, the Spaniards have advanced as

far as the latitude 58. <hi>Gazeta de Madrid,</hi> March 19, and May 14, 1776. But as the journals of thoſe voyages have not yet been publiſhed, I cannot compare their progreſs with that of the Ruſſians, or ſhew how near the navigators of the two nations have approached to each other. It is to be hoped, that the enlightened miniſter, who has now the direction of American affairs in Spain, will not withhold this information from the public.</p>

                     <p>OUR knowledge of the vicinity of the two continents of Aſia and America, which was very imperfect when I publiſhed the hiſtory of America in the year 1777, is now complete. Mr. Cox's Account of the Ruſſian diſcoveries between Aſia and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, printed in the year 1780, contains many curious and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant facts with reſpect to the various attempts of the Ruſſians to open a communication with the New World. The Hiſtory of the great Voyage of Diſcovery, begun by Captain Cook in 1776, and completed by Captains Clerk and Gore, publiſhed in the year 1780, communicates all the information that the curioſity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could deſire with regard to this ſubject.</p>
                     <p>AT my requeſt, my friend Mr. Playfair, Profeſſor of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks in the Univerſity of Edinburgh, has compared the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and charts of thoſe illuſtrious navigators, with the more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect relations and maps of the Ruſſians. The reſult of this compariſon I communicate in his own words, and with much greater confidence in his ſcientific accuracy, that I could have ventured to place in any obſervations which I myſelf might have made upon the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>"THE diſcoveries of Captain Cook in his laſt voyage, have confirmed the concluſions which Dr. Robertſon had drawn, and have connected together the facts from which they were deduced. They have now rendered it certain that Behring and Tſchirikow touched on the coaſt of America in 1741. The former diſcovered land in lat. 58° 28′, and about 236° eaſt from Ferro. He has given ſuch a deſcription of the Bay in which he anchored, and the high mountain to the weſtward of it, which he calls St. Elias, that though the account of his voyage is much abridged in the Engliſh tranſlation, Captain Cook recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the place as he ſailed along the Weſtern coaſt of America, in the year 1778. The iſle of St. Hermogenes, near the mouth of Cook's river, Schumagins Iſles on the coaſt of Alaſhka, and Foggy iſle, retain in Captain Cook's chart the names which they had received from the Ruſſian navigator.

                     <p>"WITH regard to Krenitzin, we learn from Coxe's Account of the Ruſſian Diſcoveries, that he ſailed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river with two ſhips in the year 1768. With his own ſhip he reached the iſland Oonolaſhka, in which there had been a Ruſſian ſettlement ſince the year 1762, where he wintered probably in the ſame harbour or bay where Captain Cook afterwards anchored. The other ſhip wintered at Alaſhka, which was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be an iſland, though it be in fact a part of the American continent. Krenitzin, accordingly, returned without knowing that either of his ſhips had been on the coaſt of America; and this is the more ſurpriſing, becauſe Captain Cook has informed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s that Alaſhka is underſtood to be a great continent both by the Ruſſians and the natives at Oonolaſhka.</p>
                     <p>"ACCORDING to Krenitzin, the ſhip which had wintered at Alaſhka had hardly ſailed 32° to the eaſtward of the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtchatka; but, according to the more accurate charts of Captain Cook, it had ſailed no leſs than 37° 17′ to the eaſtward of that harbour. There is nearly the ſame miſtake of 5° in the longitude which Krenitzin aſſigns to Oonolaſhka. It is remarkable enough, that in the chart of thoſe ſeas, put into the hands of Captain Cook by the Ruſſians on that iſland, there was an error of the ſame kind, and very nearly of the ſame extent.</p>
                     <p>"BUT what is of moſt conſequence to be remarked on this ſubject is, that the diſcoveries of Captain Cook have fully veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Dr. Robertſon's conjecture, "that it is probable that future navigators in thoſe ſeas, by ſteering farther to the north than Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Tſchirikow or Krenitzin had done, may find that the continent of America approaches ſtill nearer to that of Aſia." Vol. ii. p. 44. It has accordingly been found that theſe two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents, which in the parallel of 55°, or that of the ſouthern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Alaſhka, are about four hundred leagues aſunder, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach continually to one another as they ſtretch together toward the north, until, within leſs than a degree from the polar circle, they are terminated by two capes, only thirteen leagues diſtant. The eaſt cape of Aſia is in latitude 66° 6′, and in longitude 190° 22′ eaſt from Greenwich, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he weſtern extremity of America, or Prince of Wales Cape, is in latitude 65° 46′, and in longitude 191° 45′. Nearly in the middle of the narrow ſtrait (Behring's Strait) which ſeparates theſe capes, are the two iſlands of St. Diomede, from which both continents may be ſeen. Captain King informs us; that as he was ſailing through this ſtrait July 5, 1779, the fog having cleared away, he enjoyed the pleaſure of ſeeing from the ſhip the continents of Aſia and America at the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="486" facs="unknown:034476_0483_0FFDD916CE3C5D08"/>
together with the iſlands of St. Diomede lying between them. Cook's Voy. vol. iii. p. 244.</p>
                     <p>"BEYOND this point the ſtrait opens towards the Arctic Sea, and the coaſts of Aſia and America diverge ſo faſt from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in the parallel of 69° they are more than one hundred leagues aſunder. Ib. p. 277. To the ſouth of the ſtrait there are a number of iſlands, Clerke's Kings, Anderſon's, &amp;c. which, as well as thoſe of St. Diomede, may have facilitated the migra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the natives from the one continent to the other. Captain Cook, however, on the authority of the Ruſſians at Oonolaſhka, and for other good reaſons, has diminiſhed the number of iſlands which had been inſerted in former charts of the northern Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago. He has alſo placed Alaſhka, or the promontory which ſtretches from the continent of America S. W. towards Kamt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chatka, at the diſtance of five degrees of longitude farther from the coaſt of Aſia than it was reckoned by the Ruſſian naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
                     <p>"THE geography of the Old and the New World is therefore equally indebted to the diſcoveries made in this memorable voyage; and as many errors have been corrected, and many deficiencies ſupplied by means of theſe diſcoveries, ſo the accuracy of ſome former obſervations has been eſtabliſhed. The baſis of the map of the Ruſſian Empire, as far as regarded Kamtchatka, and the country of the Tſchutzki, was the poſition of four places, Yak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utſh, Ochotz, Bolchereſk, and Petropawlowſki, which had been determined by the aſtronomer Kraſſilnicow in the year 1744. Nov. Coment. Petrop. vol. iii. p. 465, &amp;c. But the accuracy of his obſervations was conteſted by M. Engel, and Mr. Robert de Vaugondy; Coxe Append. i. No. 2. p. 267, 272; and the former of theſe geographers ventured to take away no leſs than 28 degrees from the longitude, which, on the faith of Kraſſilnicow's obſervations, was aſſigned to the eaſtern boundary of the Ruſſian empire. With how little reaſon this was done, will appear from conſidering that our Britiſh navigators, having determined the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Petropawlowſki by a great number of very accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, found the longitude of that port 158° 43′ E. from Greenwich, and its latitude 53° 1′; agreeing, the firſt to leſs than ſeven minutes, and the ſecond to leſs than half a minute, with the calculations of the Ruſſian aſtronomer: a coincidence which, in the ſituation of ſo remote a place, does not leave an uncertainty of more than four Engliſh miles, and which, for the credit of ſcience, deſerves to be particularly remarked. The chief error in the Ruſſian maps has been in not extending the boundaries of that empire ſufficiently towards the eaſt. For as there was nothing to connect the land of the Tſchutzki and north eaſt point of Aſia with thoſe places whereof the poſition had been carefully aſcertained, except the imperfect accounts of Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring's
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:034476_0484_0FFDD91A6E870E78"/>
and Synd's voyages, conſiderable errors could not fail to be introduced, and that point was laid down as not more than 23° 2′ eaſt of the meridian of Petropawlowſki. Coxe App. i. No. 2. By the obſervations of Captain King, the difference of longitude between Petropawloſki and the Eaſt Cape is 31° 9′; that is 8° 7′ greater than it was ſuppoſed to be by the Ruſſian geographers." It appears from Cook's and King's Voy. iii. p. 272. that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents of Aſia and America are uſually joined together by ice during winter. Mr. Samwell confirms this account of his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior officer. "At this place, viz. near the latitude of 66° N. the two coaſts are only thirteen leagues aſunder, and about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way between them lie two iſlands, the diſtance from which to either ſhore is ſhort of twenty miles. At this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the natives of Aſia could find no difficulty in paſſing over to the oppoſite coaſt. which is in ſight of their own. That in a courſe of years ſuch an event would happen, either through deſign or accident, cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a doubt. The canoes which we ſaw among the Tſchutzſki were capable of performing a much longer voyage; and, however rude they may have been at a diſtant period<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we can ſcarcely ſuppoſe them unequal to a paſſage of ſix or ſeven leagues. People might have been carried over by accident on floating pieces of ice. They might have alſo travelled acroſs on ſledges or on foot; for we have reaſon to believe that the ſtrait is entirely frozen over in the winter; ſo that during that ſeaſon, the continents, with reſpect to the communication between them, may be conſidered as one land." Letter from Mr. Samwell, Scots Magazine for 1788, p. 604. It is probable that this intereſting portion of geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical knowledge will, in the courſe of a few years, receive farther improvement. Soon after the publication of Capt. Cook's laſt voyage, the great and enlightened Sovereign of Ruſſia, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to every thing that may contribute to extend the bounds of ſcience, or to render it more accurate, formed the plan of a new voyage of diſcovery, in order to explore thoſe parts of the ocean lying between Aſia and America, which Captain Cook did not viſit, to examine more accurately the iſlands which ſtretch from one continent almoſt to the other, to ſurvey the north-eaſt coaſt of the Ruſſian empire, from the mouth of the Kovyma, or Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyma, to the North Cape, and to ſettle, by aſtronomical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the poſition of each place worth notice. The conduct of this important enterprize is committed to Captain Billings, an Engliſh officer in the Ruſſian ſervice, of whoſe abilities for that ſtation it will be deemed the beſt evidence, that he accompanied Captain Cook in his laſt voyage. To render the expedition more extenſively uſeful, an eminent naturaliſt is appointed to attend Captain Billings. Six years will be requiſite for accompliſhing the purpoſes of the voyage.

                     <p>FEW travellers have had ſuch opportunity of obſerving the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of America, in its various diſtricts, as Don Antonio Ulloa. In a work lately publiſhed by him, he thus deſcribes the characteriſtical features of the race:" a very ſmall forehead, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with hair towards its extremities, as far as the middle of the eye-brows; little eyes, a thin noſe, ſmall and bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the upper lip; the countenance broad; the ears large; the hair very black, lank, and coarſe; the limbs well turned, the feet ſmall, the body of juſt proportion; and altogether ſmooth and free from hair, until old age, when they acquire ſome beard, but never on the cheeks." Noticias Americanas, &amp;c. p. 307. M. le Chevalier de Pinto, who reſided ſeveral years in a part of America which Ulloa never viſited, gives a ſketch of the general 2aſpect of the Indians there. "They are all of copper colour, with ſome diverſity of ſhade, not in proportion to their diſtance from the equator, but according to the degree of elevation of the territory which they inhabit. Thoſe who live in a high country are fairer than thoſe in the marſhy low lands on the coaſt. Their face is round, farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people from an oval ſhape. Their forehead is ſmall, the extremity of their ears far from the face, their lips thick, their noſe flat, their eyes black, or of a cheſnut colour. ſmall. but capable of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objects at a great diſtance. Their hair is always thick and ſleek, and without any tendency to curl. They have no hair on any part of their body but the head. At the firſt aſpect, a ſouthern American appears to be mild and innocent, but on a more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive view, one diſcovers in his countenance ſomething wild, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful, and ſullen.'

The Indians, in warm climates, ſuch as thoſe on the coaſts of the South Sea, on the river of Amazons, and the river Orinoco, are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſtrength with thoſe in cold countries; and yet, ſays he, boats daily ſet out from Para, a Portugueſe ſettlement on the river of Amazons, to aſcend that river againſt the rapidity of the ſtream, and with the ſame crew they proceed to San Pablo, which is eight hundred leagues diſtant. No crew of white people, or even of negroes, would be found equal to a taſk of ſuch perſevering fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, as the Portugueſe have experienced, and yet the Indians, being accuſtomed to this labour from their infancy, perform it.

                     <p>THE teſtimonies of different travellers, concerning the Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians, have been collected and ſtated with a conſiderable degree of accuracy by the author of Recherches Philoſophiques, &amp;c. tom. i. 281, &amp;c. iii. 181, &amp;c. Since the publication of his work, ſeveral navigators have viſited the Magellanic regions, and, like their predeceſſors, differ very widely in their accounts of its inhabitants. By Commodore Byron and his crew, who ſailed through the Straits in 1764, the common ſize of the Patagonians was eſtimated to be eight feet, and many of them much taller. Phil. Tranſact. vol. lvii. p. 78. By Captains Wallis and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret, who actually meaſured them in 1766, they were found to be from ſix feet to ſix feet five and ſeven inches in height. Phil. Traſ. vol. lx. p. 22. Theſe, however, ſeem to have been the very people whoſe ſize had been rated ſo high in the year 1764; for ſeveral of them had beads and red baize of the ſame kind with what had been put aboard Captain Wallis's ſhip, and he naturally concluded that they had got theſe from Mr. Bryon. Hawkeſw. i. In 1767 they were again meaſured by M. Bougainville, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count differs little from that of Captain Wallis. Voy. 129. To theſe I ſhall add a teſtimony of great weight. In the year 1762, Don Bernardo Ibagnez de Echavrari accompanied the Marquis de Valdelirios to Buenos Ayres, and reſided there ſeveral years. He is a very intelligent author, and his reputation for veracity unimpeached among his countrymen. In ſpeaking of the country towards the ſouthern extremity of America, "By what Indians,"
<pb n="491" facs="unknown:034476_0488_0FFDD924EE1ACBA0"/>
ſays he, "is it poſſeſſed? Not certainly by the fabulous Patago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who are ſuppoſed to occupy this diſtrict. I have from many eye-witneſſes, who have lived among thoſe Indians, and traded much with them, a true and accurate deſcription of their perſons. They are of the ſame ſtature with Spaniards. I never ſaw one who roſe in height two <hi>varas</hi> and two or three inches," <hi>i. e.</hi> about 80 or 81.332 inches Engliſh, if Echavarri makes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation according to the <hi>vara</hi> of Madrid. This agrees nearly with the meaſurement of Captain Wallis. Reyno Jeſuitico, 238. Mr. Falkner, who reſided as a miſſionary forty years in the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of America, ſays, that "the Patagonians, or Puel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, are a large-bodied people; but I never heard of that gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic race which others have mentioned, though I have ſeen perſons of all the different tribes of ſouthern Indians." Introd. p. 26. M. Dobrizhoffer, a Jeſuit, who reſided eighteen years in Paraguay, and who had ſeen great numbers of the various tribes which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the countries ſituated upon the Straits of Magellan, confirms, in every point the teſtimony of his brother miſſionary Falkner.

                     <p>ANTONIO SANCHEZ RIBEIRO, a learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious phyſician, publiſhed a diſſertation in the year 1765, in which he endeavours to prove, that this diſeaſe was not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from America, but took its riſe in Europe, and was brought on by an epidemical and malignant diſorder.

The rapid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of this diſeaſe from Spain over Europe, ſeems how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to reſemble the progreſs of an epidemic, rather than that of a diſeaſe traſmitted by infection.

                     <p>AS the view which I have given of rude nations is extremely different from that exhibited by very reſpectable authors, it may be proper to produce ſome of the many authorities on which I found my deſcription. The manners of the ſavage tribes in America have never been viewed by perſons more capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them with diſcernment, than the philoſophers employed by France and Spain, in the year 1735, to determine the figure of the earth. M. Bouguer, D. Antonio d'Ulloa, and D. Jorge Juan, reſided long among the natives of the leaſt civilized provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Peru. M. de la Condamine had not only the ſame advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages with them for obſervation, but, in his voyage down the Maragnon, he had an opportunity of inſpecting the ſtate of the various nations ſeated on its banks, in its vaſt courſe acroſs the continent of South America. There is a wounderful reſemblance in their repreſentation of the character of the Americans. "They are all extremely indolent," ſays M. Bouguer, "they are ſtupid, they paſs whole days ſitting in the ſame place, without moving, or ſpeaking a ſingle word. It is not eaſy to deſcribe the degree of their indifference for wealth, and all its advantages. One does not well know what motive to propoſe to them, when one would perſuade them to perform any ſervice. It is vain to offer them money; they anſwer, that they are not hungry." Voyage au Perou, p. 102. "If one conſiders them as men, the narrowneſs of their underſtanding ſeems to be incompatible with the excellence of the ſoul. Their imbecility is ſo viſible, that one can hardly form an idea of them different from what one has of the brutes. Nothing diſturbs the tranquillity of their ſouls equally
<pb n="493" facs="unknown:034476_0490_0FFDD92A326A99D8"/>
inſenſible to diſaſters and to proſperity. Though half-naked, they are as contented as a monarch in his moſt ſplendid array. Riches do not attract them in the ſmalleſt degree, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or dignities to which they may aſpire are ſo little the objects of their ambition, that an Indian will receive with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference the office of a judge (Alcade) or that of a hangman, if deprived of the former and appointed to the latter. Nothing can move or change them. Intereſt has no power over them, and they often refuſe to perform a ſmall ſervice, though certain of a great recompence. Fear makes no impreſſion on them, and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as little. Their diſpoſition is ſo ſingular that there is no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of influencing them, no means of rouſing them from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, which is proof againſt all the endeavours of the wiſeſt perſons; no expedient which can induce them to abandon that groſs ignorance, or lay aſide that careleſs negligence, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert the prudence and diſappoint the care of ſuch as are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their welfare." Voyage d'Ulloa, tom. i. 335, 356. Of thoſe ſingular qualities he produces many extraordinary inſtances, p 336—347. "Inſenſibility," ſays M. de la Condamine, "is the baſis of the American character. I leave others to determine, whether this ſhould be dignified with the name of apathy, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced with that of ſtupidity. It ariſes, without doubt, from the ſmall number of their ideas, which do not extend beyond their wants. Gluttons even to voracity, when they have wherewithal to ſatisfy their appetite. Temperatc, when neceſſity obliges them to ſuch a degree, that they can endure want without ſeeming to deſire any thing. Puſillanimous and cowardly to exceſs, unleſs when they are rendered deſperate by drunkenneſs. Averſe to labour, indifferent to motives of glory, honour or gratitude; occupied entirely by the object that is preſent, and always determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it alone, without any ſolicitude about futurity; incapable of foreſight or of reflection; abandoning themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when under no reſtraint, to a puerile joy, which they expreſs by friſking about, and immoderate fits of laughter; without object or deſign, they paſs their life without thinking, and grow old without advancing beyond childhood, of which they retain all the defects. If this deſcription were applicable only to the Indians in ſome provinces of Peru, who are ſlaves in every reſpect but the name, one might believe, that this degree of degeneracy was occaſioned by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile dependence to which they are reduced; the example of the modern Greeks being proof how far ſervitude may degrade the human ſpecies. But the Indians in the miſſions of the Jeſuits, and the ſavages who ſtill enjoy unimpaired liberty, being as limited in their faculties, not to ſay as ſtupid as the other, one cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without humiliation, that man, when abandoned to ſimple nature, and deprived of the advantages reſulting from education and ſociety, differs but little from the brute creation."

de la Riv. de Amaz. 52, 53. M. de Chanvalon, an intelligent and philoſophical obſerver, who viſited Martinico in 1751, and reſided there ſix years, gives the following deſcription of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raibs: "It is not the red colour of their complexion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is not the ſingularity of their features, which conſtitute the chief difference between them and us. It is their exceſſive ſimplicity; it is the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited degree of their faculties. Their reaſon is not more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened or more provident than the inſtinct of brutes. The reaſon of the moſt groſs peaſants, that of the negroes brought up in the parts of Africa moſt remote from intercourſe with Europeans, is ſuch that we diſcover appearances of intelligence, which, though imperfect, is capable of increaſe. But of this the underſtanding of Caraibs ſeems to be hardly ſuſceptible. If ſound philoſophy and religion did not afford us their light, if we were to decide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the firſt impreſſion which the view of that people makes upon the mind, we ſhould be diſpoſed to believe that they do not belong to the ſame ſpecies with us. Their ſtupid eyes are the true mirrour of their ſouls; it appears to be without functions. Their indolence is extreme; they have never the leaſt ſolicitude about the moment which is to ſucceed that which is preſent." Voyage a la Martinique, p. 44, 45, 51. M. de la Borde, Tertre, and Rochefort, confirm this deſcription. "The characteriſtics of the Californians," ſays P. Venegas, "as well as of all other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; are ſtupidity and inſenſibility; want of knowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; inconſtancy, impetuoſity, and blindneſs of appetite; an exceſſive ſloth, and abhorrence of labour and fatigue; an exceſſive love of pleaſure and amuſement of every kind, however trifling or brutal; puſilanimity, and, in fine, a moſt wretched want of every thing which conſtitutes the real man, and renders him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, inventive, tractable, and uſeful to himſelf and ſociety. It is not eaſy for Europeans, who never were out of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to conceive an adequate idea of thoſe people; for, even in the leaſt frequented corners of the globe, there is not a nation ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, of ſuch contracted ideas, and ſo weak both in body and mind, as the unhappy Californians. Their underſtanding comprehends little more than what they ſee; abſtract ideas, and much leſs a chain of reaſoning, being far beyond their power; ſo that they ſcarce ever improve their firſt ideas, and theſe are in general falſe, or at leaſt inadequate. It is in vain to repreſent to them any future advantages which will reſult to them from doing or abſtaining from this or that particular immediately preſent; the relation of means and ends being beyond the ſtretch of their faculties. Nor have they the leaſt notion of purſuing ſuch intentions as will procure themſelves ſome future good, or guard them againſt future evils. Their will is proportional to their faculties, and all their paſſions move in a very narrow ſphere. Ambition they have none, and are more deſirous of being accounted ſtrong than valiant. The

ſubſiſtence was poor and precarious. "They live chiefly (ſays he) upon roots of different plants, which they procure with great difficulty, wandering from place to place in ſearch of them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they kill game, ſometimes they catch fiſh, but in ſuch ſmall quantities, that their hunger is ſo extreme as compels them to eat ſpiders, the eggs of ants, worms, lizards, ſerpents, a kind of unctuous earth, and I am perſuaded, that if in this country there were any ſtones they would ſwallow theſe. They preſerve the bones of fiſhes and ſerpents, which they grind into powder, and eat. The only ſeaſon when they do not ſuffer much from famine, is when a certain fruit, which he calls <hi>Tunas,</hi> is ripe.

                     <p>I STRONGLY ſuſpect that a community of goods, and an undivided ſtore, are known only among the rudeſt tribes of hunters; and that as ſoon as any ſpecies of agriculture or regular induſtry is known, the idea of an excluſive right of property to the fruits of them is introduced. I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which I have received concerning the ſtate of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among the Indians in very different regions of America. "The idea of the natives of Braſil concerning property is, that if any perſon cultivate a field, he alone ought to enjoy the produce of it, and no other has a title to pretend to it. If an individual or family go a-hunting or fiſhing, what is caught belongs to the individual or to the family<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they communicate no part of it to any but to their cazique, or to ſuch of their kindred as happen to be indiſpoſed. If any perſon in the village come to their hut, he may ſit down freely, and eat without aſking liberty. But this is the conſequence of their general principle of hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; for I never obſerved any partition of the increaſe of their fields, or the produce of the chace, which I could conſider as the reſult of any idea concerning a community of goods.
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:034476_0497_0FFDD94EADAF2CD8"/>
On the contrary, they are ſo much attached to what they deem to be their property, that it would be extremely dangerous to encroach upon it. As far as I have ſeen, or can learn, there is not one tribe of Indians in South America, among whom that community of goods which has been ſo highly extolled is known. The circumſtance in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Jeſuits, moſt irkſome to the Indians of Paraguay, was the community of goods which thoſe fathers introduced. This was repugnant to the original ideas of the Indians. They were acquainted with the rights of private excluſive property, and they ſubmitted with impatience to regulations which deſtroyed them." M. de Cheval. de Pinto, MS. <hi>penes me.</hi> "Actual poſſeſſion (ſays a miſſionary who reſided ſeveral years among the Indians of the Five Nations) gives a right to the ſoil, but whenever a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor ſees fit to quit it, another has as good right to take it as he who left it. This law, or cuſtom, reſpects not only the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpot on which he erects his houſe, but alſo his planting-ground. If a man has prepared a particular ſpot of ground, on which he deſigns in future to build or plant, no man has a right to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode him, much leſs to the fruit of his labours, until it appears that he voluntarily gives up his views. But I never heard of any formal conveyance from one Indian to another in their natural ſtate. The limits of every canton is circumſcribed; that is, they are allowed to hunt as far as ſuch a river on this hand, and ſuch a mountain on the other. This area is occupied and improved by individuals and their families. Individuals, not the community, have the uſe and profit of their own labours, or ſucceſs in hunting."

A judicious miſſionary has given a view of the military operations of the people of Gran Chaco, in South America, perfectly ſimilar to thoſe of the Iroquois. "They are much addicted to war (ſays he) which they carry on frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among themſelves, but perpetually againſt the Spaniards. But they may rather be called thieves than ſoldiers, for they never make head againſt the Spaniards, unleſs when they can aſſault them by ſtealth, or have guarded againſt any miſchance by ſpies, who may be called indefatigable; they will watch the ſettlements of the Spaniards for one, two, or three years. obſerving by night every thing that paſſes with the utmoſt ſolicitude, whether they may expect reſiſtance or not, and until they are perfectly ſecure of the event, they will not venture upon an attack; ſo that when they give the aſſault, they are certain of ſucceſs, and free from all danger. Theſe ſpies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order that they may not be obſerved, will creep on all-four like cats in the night; but if they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, make their eſcape with much dexterity. But although they never chuſe to face the Spaniards, if they be ſurrounded in any place, whence they cannot eſcape, they will fight with deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate valour, and ſell their lives very dear."

In the expedition of Narvaez into Florida in the year 1528, the Spaniards were reduced to ſuch extreme diſtreſs by famine, that in order to preſerve their own lives, they eat ſuch of their companions as happened to die.

                     <p>I HAVE referred the reader to ſeveral of the authors who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the moſt uncivilized nations in America. Their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony is uniform. That of P. Ribas concerning the people of Cinaloa, coincides with the reſt. "I was extremely attentive (ſays he), during the years I reſided among them, to aſcertain whether they were to be conſidered as idolaters; and it may be affirmed with the moſt perfect exactneſs, that though among ſome of them there may be traces of idolatry, yet others have not the leaſt knowledge of God, or even of any falſe deity, nor pay any formal adoration to the Supreme Being, who exerciſes dominion over the world; nor have they any conception of the providence of a creator or governor, from whom they expect in the next life the reward of their good, or the puniſhment of their evil deeds. Neither do they publicly join in any act of divine worſhip." Ribas Triumphos, &amp;c. p. 16.</p>

                     <p>THE people of Braſil were ſo much affrighted by thunder, which is frequent and awful in their country, as well as in other parts of the torrid zone, that it was not only the object of religious reverence; but the moſt expreſſive name in their language for the Deity, was <hi>Toupan</hi> the ſame by which they diſtinguiſhed thunder.

                     <p>BY the account which M. Dumont, an eye-witneſs, gives of the funeral of the great chief of the Natchez, it appears, that the feelings of the perſons who ſuffered on that occaſion were very different. Some ſolicited the honour with eagerneſs; others laboured to avoid their doom, and ſeveral ſaved their lives by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the woods. As the Indian Bramins give an intoxicating draught to the women, who are to be burnt together with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their huſbands, which renders them inſenſible of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching fate, the Natchez obliged their victims to ſwallow ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral large pills of tobacco, which produce a ſimilar effect.

At the ſame time he adds, "that it behoves their envoys or plenipotentiaries to exert their abilities and eloquence, for if the terms which they offer are not accepted of, they had need to ſtand on their guard. It frequently happens, that a blow with a hatchet is the only return given to their propoſitions. The envoy is not out of danger even if he is ſo fortunate as to avoid the ſtroke, he may expect to be purſued, and if taken, to be burnt." Hiſt. N. Fr. iii 251.

                     <p>AND, BERNALDES, the contemporary and friend of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, has preſerved ſome circumſtances concerning the bravery of the Caribbees, which are not mentioned by Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Columbus, or the other hiſtorians of that period, whoſe works have been publiſhed. A Caribbean canoe, with four men, two women, and a boy, fell in unexpectedly with the fleet of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus in his ſecond voyage, as it was ſteering through their iſlands. At firſt they were ſtruck almoſt ſtupid with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

at ſuch a ſtrange ſpectacle, and hardly moved from the ſpot for above an hour. A Spaniſh bark, with twenty-five men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards them, and the fleet gradually ſurrounded them, ſo as to cut off their communication with the ſhore. "When they ſaw that it was impoſſible to eſcape (ſays the hiſtorian), they ſeized their arms, with undaunted reſolution, and began the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.

They wounded ſeveral of the Spaniards, although they had targets as well as other defenſive armour; and even after their canoe was overſet, it was with no little difficulty and danger that part of them were taken, as they continued to defend themſelves, and to uſe their bows with great dexterity while ſwimming in the ſea."

                     <p>A PROBABLE conjecture may be formed with reſpect to the cauſe of the diſtinction in character between the Carib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees and the inhabitants of the larger iſlands. The former appear manifeſtly to be a ſeparate race. Their language is totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of their neighbours in the large iſlands. They themſelves have a tradition, that their anceſtors came originally from ſome part of the continent, and having conquered and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminated the ancient inhabitants, took poſſeſſion of their lands, and of their women. Rochefort, 384. Tertre, 360. Hence they call themſelves <hi>Banaree,</hi> which ſignifies a man come from beyond ſea. Labat. vi. 131. Accordingly, the Caribbees ſtill uſe two diſtinct languages, one peculiar to the men and the other to the women. Tertre, 361. The language of the men has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing common with that ſpoken in the large iſlands. The dialect of the women conſiderably reſembles it. Labat. 129. This ſtrongly confirms the tradition which I have mentioned. The Carribees themſelves imagine, that they were a colony from the <hi>Galibis,</hi> a powerful nation of Guiana, in South America. Tertre, 361. Rochefort, 348. But as their fierce manners approach nearer to thoſe of the people in the northern continent, than to thoſe of the natives of South America; and as their language has likewiſe ſome affinity to that ſpoken in Florida, their origin ſhould be deduced rather from the former than from the latter. Labat. 128, &amp;c. Herrera, dec. i. lib. ix. c. 4. In their wars, they ſtill obſerve their ancient practice of deſtroying all the males, and preſerving the women either for ſervitude or for breeding.</p>

                     </note> he found the armament deſtined to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that rich country which he had diſcovered, almoſt complete. Not only ambition, but avarice, had urged Velaſquez to haſten his preparations; and having ſuch a proſpect of gratifying both, he had advanced conſiderable ſums out of his private fortune towards defraying the expence of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. At the ſame time, he exerted his influence as governor, in engaging the moſt diſtinguiſhed perſons in the colony to undertake the ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE I.</note>. At a time when the ſpirit of the Spaniſh nation was adventurous to exceſs, a number of ſoldiers, eager to embark in any daring enterpriſe, ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. But it was not eaſy to find a perſon qualified to take the command in an expedition of ſo much importance; and the character of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſquez, who had the right of nomination, greatly increaſed the difficulty of the choice. Though of moſt aſpiring ambition, and not deſtitute of talents for government, he poſſeſſed neither ſuch courage,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:034476_0512_0FFDD96785D0A5C0"/>
nor ſuch vigour and activity of mind, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in perſon the conduct of the armament which he was preparing. In this embarraſſing ſituation, he formed the chimerical ſcheme, not only of atchieving great exploits by a deputy, but of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to himſelf the glory of conqueſts which were to be made by another. In the execution of this plan, he fondly aimed at reconciling contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. He was ſolicitous to chooſe a commander of intrepid reſolution, and of ſuperior abilities, becauſe he knew theſe to be requiſite in order to enſure ſucceſs; but at the ſame time, from the jealouſy natural to little minds, he wiſhed this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be of a ſpirit ſo tame and obſequious, as to be entirely dependant on his will. But when he came to apply thoſe ideas in forming an opinion concerning the ſeveral officers who occurred to his thoughts as worthy of being intruſted with the command, he ſoon perceived that it was impoſſible to find ſuch incompatible qualities united in one character. Such as were diſtinguiſhed for courage and talents were too high-ſpirited to be paſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in his hands. Thoſe who appeared more gentle and tractable, were deſtitute of capacity, and unequal to the charge. This augmented his perplexity and his fears. He deliberated long, and with much ſolicitude, and was ſtill wavering in his choice, when Amador de Lares, the royal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer in Cuba, and Andres Duero, his own ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, the two perſons in whom he chiefly confided, were encouraged by this irreſolution to propoſe a new candidate, and they ſupported their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation with ſuch aſſiduity and addreſs, that, no leſs fatally for Velaſquez than happily for their country, it proved ſucceſsful<note n="*" place="bottom">B.

                  <p>THOUGH Cortes had not hitherto acted in high command, he had diſplayed ſuch qualities in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcenes of difficulty and danger, as raiſed uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal expectation, and turned the eyes of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen towards him, as one capable of performing great things. The turbulence of youth, as ſoon as he found objects and occupations ſuited to the ardour of his mind, gradually ſubſided, and ſettled into a habit of regular indefatigable activity. The impetuoſity of his temper, when he came to act with his equals, inſenſibly abated, by being kept under reſtraint, and mellowed into a cordial ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dierly frankneſs. Theſe qualities were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with calm prudence in concerting his ſchemes, with perſevering vigour in executing them, and with what is peculiar to ſuperior genius, the art of gaining the confidence and governing the minds of men. To all which were added the inferior accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments that ſtrike the vulgar, and command their reſpect; a graceful perſon, a winning aſpect, extraordinary addreſs in martial exerciſes, and a conſtitution of ſuch vigour as to be capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during any fatigue.</p>
                  <p>AS ſoon as Cortes was mentioned to Velaſquez by his two confidents, he flattered himſelf that he had at length found what he had hitherto ſought in vain, a man with talents for command, but not an object for jealouſy. Neither the rank nor the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

He had reaſon to believe that by his own readineſs to bury ancient animoſities in oblivion, as well as his liberality in conferring ſeveral recent favours, he had already gained the good-will of Cortes, and hoped, by this new and unexpected mark of confidence, that he might attach him for ever to his intereſt.</p>

They repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him as aiming already, with little diſguiſe, at eſtabliſhing an independent authority over his troops, and endeavouring to ſecure their reſpect or love by his oſtentatious and intereſted liberality. They reminded Velaſquez of his former diſſenſions with the man in whom he now repoſed ſo much confidence, and foretold that Cortes would be more apt to avail himſelf of the power, which the governor was inconſiderately putting in his hands, to avenge paſt injuries, than to requite recent obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.

Fully ſenſible of this danger, he urged forward his preparations with ſuch rapidity, that he ſet ſail from St. Jago de Cuba on the eighteenth of November, Velaſquez accompanying him to the ſhore, and taking leave of him with an appearance of perfect friendſhip and confidence, though he had ſecretly given it in charge to ſome of Cortes's officers, to keep a watchful eye upon every part of their commander's conduct <note n="*" place="bottom">Gomara Cron. c. 7.

He had hardly left St. Jago, when the jealouſy which had been working in the breaſt of Velaſquez, grew ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that it was impoſſible to ſuppreſs it. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament was no longer under his own eye and direction; and he felt, that as his power over it ceaſed, that of Cortes would become more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. Imagination now aggravated every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which had formerly excited ſuſpicion: the rivals of Cortes induſtriouſly threw in reflections which increaſed his fears; and with no leſs art than malice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they called ſuperſtition to their aid, employing the predictions of an aſtrologer in order to complete the alarm. All theſe, by their united operation, produced the deſired effect. Velaſquez repented bitterly of his own imprudence, in having committed a truſt of ſo much importance to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034476_0517_0FFDD976D424E7F8"/>
whoſe fidelity appeared ſo doubtful, and haſtily diſpatched inſtructions to Trinidad, empowering Verdugo, the chief magiſtrate there, to deprive Cortes of his commiſſion. But Cortes had already made ſuch progreſs in gaining the eſteem and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of his troops, that finding officers as well as ſoldiers equally zealous to ſupport his authority, he ſoothed or intimidated Verdugo, and was permitted to depart from Trinidad without moleſtation.</p>
                  <p>FROM Trinidad Cortes ſailed for the Havana,<note place="margin">and to lay him under arreſt.</note> in order to raiſe more ſoldiers, and to complete the victualling of his fleet. There ſeveral perſons of diſtinction entered into the ſervice, and engaged to ſupply what proviſions were ſtill wanting; but as it was neceſſary to allow them ſome time for performing what they had promiſed, Velaſquez, ſenſible that he ought no longer to rely on a man of whom he had ſo openly diſcovered his diſtruſt, availed himſelf of the interval, which this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable delay afforded, in order to make one attempt more to wreſt the command out of the hands of Cortes. He loudly complained of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dugo's conduct, accuſing him either of childiſh facility, or of manifeſt treachery, in ſuffering Cortes to eſcape from Trinidad. Anxious to guard againſt a ſecond diſappointment, he ſent a perſon of confidence to the Havana, with peremptory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions to Pedro Barba, his lieutenant-governor in that colony, inſtantly to arreſt Cortes, to ſend him priſoner to St. Jago under a ſtrong guard, and to countermand the ſailing of the armament until he ſhould receive farther orders. He wrote like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the principal officers, requiring them to aſſiſt Barba in executing what he had given him in charge. But before the arrival of his meſſenger, a Franciſcan friar of St. Jaga had ſecretly conveyed an account of this intereſting tranſaction to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew

His firſt ſtep was to find ſome pretext for removing from the Havana Diego de Ordaz, an officer of great me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but in whom, on account of his known at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to Velaſquez, he could not confide in this trying and delicate juncture. He gave him the command of a veſſel, deſtined to take on board ſome proviſions, in a ſmall harbour beyond Cape Antonio, and thus made ſure of his abſence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to ſuſpect his fidelity. When he was gone, Cortes no longer concealed the intentions of Velaſquez from his troops; and as officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were equally impatient to ſet out on an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in preparing for which moſt of them had expended all their fortunes, they expreſſed their aſtoniſhment and indignation at that illiberal jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, to which the governor was about to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, not only the honour of their general, but all their ſanguine hopes of glory and wealth. With one voice they intreated that he would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the important ſtation to which he had ſuch a good title. They conjured him not to deprive them of the leader whom they followed with ſuch well-founded confidence, and offered to ſhed the laſt drop of their blood in maintaining his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Cortes was eaſily induced to comply with what he himſelf ſo ardently deſired. He ſwore that he would never deſert ſoldiers who had given him ſuch a ſignal proof of their attachment, and promiſed inſtantly to conduct them to that rich country, which had been ſo long the object of their thoughts and wiſhes. This declaration was received with tranſports of military applauſe, accompanied with threats and imprecations againſt all who ſhould preſume to call in queſtion the juriſdiction of their

                  <p>EVERY thing was now ready for their departure; but though this expedition was fitted out by the united effort of the Spaniſh power in Cuba;<note place="margin">The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of his forces.</note> though every ſettlement had contributed its quota of men and proviſions; though the governor had laid out conſiderable ſums, and each adventurer had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted his ſtock, or ſtrained his credit, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of the preparations was ſuch as muſt aſtoniſh the preſent age, and bore, indeed, no reſemblance to an armament deſtined for the conqueſt of a great empire. The fleet conſiſted of eleven veſſels; the largeſt of a hundred tons, which was dignified by the name of Admiral; three of ſeventy or eighty tons, and the reſt ſmall open barks. On board of theſe were ſix hundred and ſeventeen men; of which five hundred and eight belonged to the land ſervice, and a hundred and nine were ſeamen or artificers. The ſoldiers were divided into eleven companies, according to the number of the ſhips; to each of which Cortes appointed a captain, and committed to him the command of the veſſel while at ſea, and of the men when on ſhore<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE IV.</note>. As the uſe of fire-arms among the nations of Europe was hitherto confined to a few battalions of regularly diſciplined infantry, only thirteen ſoldiers were armed with muſkets, thirty-two were croſs-bow men, and the reſt had ſwords and ſpears. Inſtead of the uſual defenſive armour, which muſt have been cumberſome in a hot climata, the ſoldiers wore jackets quilted with cotton, which experience had taught the Spaniards to be a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection againſt the weapons of the Americans.

After repeated endeavours to conciliate their good-will, he was conſtrained to have recourſe to violence. Though the forces of

                  <p>CORTES continued his courſe to the weſt ward,<note place="margin">Arrives at St. Juan de Ulua.</note> keeping as near the ſhore as poſſible, in order to obſerve the country; but could diſcover no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for landing, until he arrived at St. Juan de Ulua<note n="†" place="bottom">B.

They came on board without fear or diſtruſt, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed him in a moſt reſpectful manner, but in a language altogether unknown to Aguilar. Cortes was in the utmoſt perplexity and diſtreſs, at an event of which he inſtantly foreſaw all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and already felt the heſitation and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty with which he ſhould carry on the great ſchemes which he meditated, if, in his tranſactions with the natives, he muſt depend entirely upon ſuch an imperfect, ambiguous, and conjectural mode of communication, as the uſe of ſigns. But he did not remain long in his embarraſſing ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a fortunate accident extricated him, when his own ſagacity could have contributed little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his relief. One of the female ſlaves, whom
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:034476_0522_0FFDD9853958C170"/>
he had received from the cazique of Tabaſco, happened to be preſent at the firſt interview be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cortes and his new gueſts. She perceived his diſtreſs, as well as the confuſion of Aguilar; and as ſhe perfectly underſtood the Mexican lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſhe explained what they had ſaid in the Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. This woman, known afterwards by the name of Donna Marina, and who makes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous figure in the hiſtory of the New World, where great revolutions were brought about by ſmall cauſes and inconſiderable inſtruments, was born in one of the provinces of the Mexican em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Having been ſold as a ſlave in the early part of her life, after a variety of adventures ſhe fell into the hands of the Tabaſcans, and had reſided long enough among them to acquire their language, with out loſing the uſe of her own. Though it was both tedious and troubleſome to converſe by the intervention of two different interpreters, Cortes was ſo highly pleaſed with having diſcovered this method of carrying on ſome intercourſe with the people of a country into which he was determined to penetrate, that in the tranſports of his joy he conſidered it as a viſible interpoſition of Providence in his favour<note n="*" place="bottom">B Diaz. c. 37, 38, 39.

Cortes, ſtruck with the appearance of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034476_0523_0FFDD987D4764800"/>
thoſe people, as well as the tenor of the meſſage, aſſured them, in reſpectful terms, that he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their country with moſt friendly ſentiments, and came to propoſe matters of great importance to the welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he would unfold more fully, in perſon, to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and the general. Next morning, without waiting for any anſwer, he landed his troops, his horſes, and artillery; and having choſen proper ground, began to erect huts for his men, and to fortify his camp. The natives, inſtead of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the entrance of thoſe fatal gueſts into their country, aſſiſted them in all their operations, with an alacrity of which they had ere long good reaſon to repent.</p>
                  <p>NEXT day Teutile and Pilpatoe entered the Spaniſh camp with a numerous retinue,<note place="margin">His firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with the Mexicans.</note> and Cortes conſidering them as the miniſters of a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, entitled to a degree of attention very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which the Spaniards were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to pay to the petty caziques, with whom they had intercourſe in the iſles, received them with much formal ceremony. He informed them, that he came as ambaſſador from Don Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los of Auſtria, king of Caſtile, the greateſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the Eaſt, and was intruſted with propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of ſuch moment, that he could impart them to none but the emperor Montezuma himſelf, and therefore required them to conduct him, without loſs of time, into the preſence of their maſter. The Mexican officers could not conceal their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs at a requeſt, which they knew would be diſagreeable, and which they foreſaw might prove extremely embarraſſing to their ſovereign, whoſe mind had been filled with many diſquieting appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, ever ſince the former appearance of the Spaniards to his coaſts. But before they attempted to diſſuade Cortes from inſiſting on this demand,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034476_0524_0FFDD98D2CFE91E8"/>
they endeavoured to conciliate his good-will, by entreating him to accept of certain preſents, which, as humble ſlaves of Montezuma, they laid at his feet. They were introduced with great parade, and conſiſted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and ſilver, to a conſiderable value; the workmanſhip of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich. The diſplay of theſe produced an effect very different from what the Mexicans intended. Inſtead of ſatisfying, it increaſed the avidity of the Spaniards, and rendered them ſo eager and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to become maſters of a country which abounded with ſuch precious productions, that Cortes could hardly liſten with patience to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which Pilpatoe and Teutile employed to diſſuade him from viſiting the capital, and in a haughty determined tone he inſiſted on his demand, of being admitted to a perſonal audience of their ſovereign. During this interview, ſome painters, in the train of the Mexican chiefs, had been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently employed in delineating, upon white cotton cloths, figures of the ſhips, the horſes, the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, the ſoldiers, and whatever elſe attracted their eyes, as ſingular. When Cortes obſerved this, and was informed that theſe pictures were to be ſent to Montezuma, in order to convey to him a more lively idea of the ſtrange and wonderful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects now preſented to their view, than any words could communicate, he reſolved to render the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation ſtill more animated and intereſting, by exhibiting ſuch a ſpectacle as might give both them and their monarch an awful impreſſion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary proweſs of his followers, and the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force of their arms. The trumpets, by his order, ſounded an alarm; the troops, in a moment, formed in order of battle, the infantry performed ſuch martial exerciſes as were beſt ſuited to diſplay
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034476_0525_0FFDD98EC0298CB8"/>
the effect of their different weapons; the horſe, in various evolutions, give a ſpecimen of their agility and ſtrength; the artillery, pointed towards the thick woods which ſurrounded the camp, were fired, and made dreadful havoc among the trees. The Mexicans looked on with that ſilent amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is natural when the mind is ſtruck with objects, which are both awful and above its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But, at the exploſion of the cannon, many of them fled, ſome fell to the ground, and all were ſo much confounded at the ſight of men whoſe power ſo nearly reſembled that of the gods, that Cortes found it difficult to compoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſure them. The painters had now many new objects on which to exerciſe their art, and they put their fancy on the ſtretch in order to invent figures and ſymbols to repreſent the extraordinary things which they had ſeen.</p>
                  <p>MESSENGERS were immediately diſpatched to Montezuma with thoſe pictures,<note place="margin">Negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Monteſuma</note> and a full account of every thing that had paſſed ſince the arrival of the Spaniards, and by them Cortes ſent a preſent of ſome European curioſities to Montezuma, which though of no great value, he believed would be acceptable on account of their novelty. The Mexican monarchs, in order to obtain early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of every occurrence in all the corners of their extenſive empire, had introduced a refinement in police, unknown, at that time, in Europe. They had couriers poſted at proper ſtations along the principal roads; and as theſe were trained to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by a regular education, and relieved one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other at moderate diſtances, they conveyed intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with ſurpriſing rapidity. Though the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital in which Montezuma reſided was above a hundred and eight miles from St. Juan de Ulua, Cortes's preſents were carried thither, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his demands was received in few days. The
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034476_0526_0FFDD99261A265B8"/>
ſame officers who had hitherto treated with the Spaniards, were employed to deliver this anſwer; but as they knew how repugnant the determination of their maſter was to all the ſchemes and wiſhes of the Spaniſh commander, they would not venture to make it known until they had previouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſooth and mollify him.<note place="margin">His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents.</note> For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they renewed their negociation, by introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a train of a hundred Indians, loaded with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſent to him by Montezuma. The magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of theſe was ſuch as became a great monarch, and far exceeded any idea which the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth. They were placed on mats ſpread on the ground, in ſuch order, as ſhewed them to the greateſt advantage. Cortes and his officers viewed, with admiration, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manufactures of the country, cotton ſtuffs ſo fine, and of ſuch delicate texture, as to reſemble ſilk; pictures of animals, trees, and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, diſpoſed and mingled with ſuch ſkill and elegance, as to rival the works of the pencil in truth and beauty of imitation. But what chiefly attracted their eyes, were two large plates of a circular form, one of maſſive gold repreſenting the ſun, the other of ſilver, an emblem of the moon <note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE VI.</note>. Theſe were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of gold; and that nothing might be wanting which could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what the country afforded, with ſome boxes filled with pearls, precious ſtones, and grains of gold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought, as they had been found in the mines or rivers. Cortes received all theſe with an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of profound veneration for the monarch by whom they were beſtowed.<note place="margin">Forbids Cortes to approach his capital.</note> But when the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, preſuming upon this, informed him, that their

maſter, though he deſired him to accept of what he had ſent as a token of regard for that monarch whom Cortes repreſented, would not give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that foreign troops ſhould approach nearer to his capital, or even to allow them to continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in his dominions, the Spaniſh general declared, in a manner more reſolute and peremptory than formerly, that he muſt inſiſt on his firſt demand, as he could not, without diſhonour, return to his own country, until he was admitted into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the prince whom he was appointed to viſit in the name of his ſovereign. The Mexicans, aſtoniſhed at ſeeing any man dare to oppoſe that will, which they were accuſtomed to conſider as ſupreme and irreſiſtible, yet afraid of precipitating their country into an open rupture with ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable enemies, prevailed with Cortes to promiſe, that he would not move from his preſent camp, until the return of a meſſenger, whom they ſent to Montezuma for farther inſtructions <note n="*" place="bottom">B.

                  <p>THE firmneſs with which Cortes adhered to his original propoſal,<note place="margin">State of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can empire at that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</note> ſhould naturally have brought the negociation between him and Montezuma to a ſpeedy iſſue, as it ſeemed to leave the Mexican monarch no choice, but either to receive him with confidence as a friend, or to oppoſe him openly as an enemy. The latter was what might have been expected from a haughty prince in poſſeſſion of extenſive power. The Mexican empire, at this period, was at a pitch of grandeur to which no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ever attained in ſo ſhort a period. Though it had ſubſiſted, according to their own traditions, only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the North to the South Sea, over ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories ſtretching, with ſome ſmall interruption,

The people were warlike and enterpriſing; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the monarch unbounded, and his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues conſiderable. If, with the forces which might have been ſuddenly aſſembled in ſuch an empire, Montezuma had fallen upon the Spaniards while encamped on a barren unhealthy coaſt, unſupported by any ally, without a place of retreat, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of proviſions, it ſeems to be impoſſible, even with all the advantages of their ſuperior diſcipline and arms, that they could have ſtood the ſhock, and they muſt either have periſhed in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal conteſt, or have abandoned the enterpriſe.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Character of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</note>AS the power of Montezuma enabled him to take this ſpirited part, his own diſpoſitions were ſuch as ſeemed naturally to prompt him to it.

His ſubjects looked up to him with awe, and his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with terror. The former he governed with unexampled rigour, but they were impreſſed with ſuch an opinion of his capacity, as commanded their reſpect; and, by many victories over the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he had ſpread far the dread of his arms, and had added ſeveral conſiderable provinces to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.

The perplexity and diſcompoſure of Montezuma's mind upon this occaſion, as well as the general diſmay of his ſubjects, were not owing wholly to the impreſſion which the Spaniards had made by the novelty of their appearance and the terror of their arms. Its original may be traced up to a more remote ſource. There was an opinion, if we may believe the earlieſt and moſt authentic Spaniſh hiſtorians, almoſt univerſal among the Americans, that ſome dreadful calamity was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over their heads, from a race of formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable invaders who ſhould come from regions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the riſing ſun, to overrun and deſolate their country.

From what they had already ſeen, many of them formed ſuch extravagant ideas concerning the opulence of the country, that deſpiſing danger or hardſhips, when they had in view treaſures which appeared to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible, they were eager to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. Others, eſtimating the power of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can empire by its wealth, and enumerating the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious proofs which had occurred of its being under a well-regulated adminiſtration, contended, that it would be an act of the wildeſt frenzy to attack ſuch a ſtate with a ſmall body of men, in want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, unconnected with any ally, and already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled by the diſeaſes peculiar to the climate, and

the loſs of ſeveral of their number<note n="*" place="bottom">B. Diaz. c. 40.</note>. Cortes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly applauded the advocates for bold meaſures, and cheriſhed their romantic hopes, as ſuch ideas correſponded with his own, and favoured the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſchemes which he had formed. From the time that the ſuſpicions of Velaſquez broke out with open violence in the attempts to deprive him of the command. Cortes ſaw the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving a connection which would obſtruct and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs all his operations,<note place="margin">Schemes of Cortes.</note> and watched for a proper opportunity of coming to a final rupture with him. Having this in view, he had laboured by every art to ſecure the eſteem and affection of his ſoldiers. With his abilities for command, it was eaſy to gain their eſteem; and his followers were quickly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they might rely, with perfect confidence, on the conduct and courage of their leader. Nor was it more difficult to acquire their affection. Among adventurers, nearly of the ſame rank, and ſerving at their own expence, the dignity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did not elevate a general above mingling with thoſe who acted under him. Cortes availed himſelf of this freedom of entercourſe, to inſinuate himſelf into their favour, and by his affable manners, by well-timed acts of liberality to ſome, by inſpiring all with vaſt hopes, and by allowing them to trade privately with the natives<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE VII.</note>, he attached the greater part of his ſoldiers ſo firmly to himſelf, that they almoſt forgot that the armament had been fitted out by the authority, and at the expence, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

of an audience, the Mexican turned from him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, and quitted the camp with looks and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which ſtrongly expreſſed his ſurpriſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Next morning, none of the natives, who uſed to frequent the camp in great numbers, in order to barter with the ſoldiers, and to bring in proviſions, appeared. All friendly correſpondence ſeemed now to be at an end, and it was expected every moment that hoſtilities would commence. This, though an event that might have been fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, occaſioned a ſudden conſternation among the Spaniards, which emboldened the adherents of Velaſquez not only to murmur and cabal againſt their general, but to appoint one of their number to remonſtrate openly againſt his imprudence in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the conqueſt of a mighty empire with ſuch inadequate force, and to urge the neceſſity of returning to Cuba, in order to refit the fleet and augment the army. Diego de Ordaz, one of his principal officers, whom the malecontents charged with this commiſſion, delivered it with a ſoldierly freedom and bluntneſs, aſſuring Cortes that he ſpoke the ſentiments of the whole army. He liſtened to this remonſtrance without any appearance of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as he well knew the temper and wiſhes of his ſoldiers, and foreſaw how they would receive a propoſition fatal at once to all the ſplendid hopes and ſchemes which they had been forming with ſuch complacency, he carried his diſſimulation ſo far as to ſeem to relinquiſh his own meaſures in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the requeſt of Ordaz, and iſſued orders that the army ſhould be in readineſs next day to reimbark for Cuba. As ſoon as this was known, the diſappointed adventurers exclaimed and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened; the emiſſaries of Cortes, mingling with them, inflamed their rage; the ferment became general; the whole camp was almoſt in open mutiny; all demanding with eagerneſs to ſee their commander.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:034476_0533_0FFDD9A4CAE31818"/>
Cortes was not ſlow in appearing; when, with one voice, officers and ſoldiers expreſſed their aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and indignation at the orders which they had received. It was unworthy, they cried,<note place="margin">1518.</note> of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian courage, to be daunted at the firſt aſpect of danger, and infamous to ſly before any enemy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. For their parts, they were determined not to relinquiſh an enterpriſe, that had hitherto been ſucceſsful, and which tended ſo viſibly to ſpread the knowledge of true religion, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the glory and intereſt of their country. Happy under his command, they would follow him with alacrity through every danger, in queſt of thoſe ſettlements and treaſures which he had ſo long held out to their view; but if he choſe rather to return to Cuba, and tamely give up all his hopes of diſtinction and opulence to an envious rival, they would inſtantly chooſe another general to conduct them in that path of glory, which he had not ſpirit to enter.</p>
                  <p>CORTES, delighted with their ardour, took no offence at the boldneſs with which it was uttered. The ſentiments were what he himſelf had inſpired, and the warmth of expreſſion ſatisfied him that his followers had imbibed them thoroughly. He af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, however, to be ſurpriſed at what he heard, declaring that his orders to prepare for embarking were iſſued from a perſuaſion that this was agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his troops; that, from deference to what he had been informed was their inclination, he had ſacrificed his own private opinion, which was firmly bent on eſtabliſhing immediately a ſettlement on the ſea-coaſt, and then on endeavouring to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the interior part of the country; that now he was convinced of his error; and as he perceived that they were animated with the generous ſpirit which breathed in every true Spaniard, he would reſume, with freſh ardour, his original plan of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,

and doubted not to conduct them, in the career of victory, to ſuch independent fortunes as their valour merited.<note place="margin">1519.</note> Upon this declaration, ſhouts of applauſe teſtified the exceſs of their joy.

In order to give a beginning to a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, he aſſembled the principal perſons in his army, and by their ſuffrage elected a council and magiſtrates in whom the government was to be veſted.

All the perſons choſen were moſt firmly devoted to Cortes, and the inſtrument of their election was framed in the king's name, without any mention of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on Velaſquez.

great diſtance; and from their anſwers to a variety of queſtions which he put to them, according to his uſual practice in every enterview with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the country, he gathered, that their maſter, though ſubject to the Mexican empire, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the yoke, and filled with ſuch dread and hatred of Montezuma, that nothing could be more acceptable to him than any proſpect of deliverance from the oppreſſion under which he groaned. On hearing this, a ray of light and hope broke in upon the mind of Cortes.

He was a tyrant, as the cazique told him with tears, haughty, cruel, and ſuſpicious; who treated his own ſubjects with arrogance, ruined the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered provinces by exceſſive exactions, and often tore their ſons and daughters from them by violence; the former to be offered as victims to his gods; the latter, to be reſerved as concubines for himſelf or favorites. Cortes, in reply to him, artfully inſinuated, that one great object of the Spaniards in viſiting a country ſo remote from their own, was to redreſs grievances, and to relieve the oppreſſed; and having encouraged him to hope for this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in due time, he continued his march to Quiabiſlan.</p>

Some of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma's officers having appeared to levy the uſual tribute, and to demand a certain number of human victims, as an expiation for their guilt in preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to hold intercourſe with thoſe ſtrangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, inſtead of obeying the order, the caziques made them priſoners, treated them with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, and, as their ſuperſtition was no leſs barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than that of the Mexicans, they prepared to ſacrifice them to their gods.

By his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs in conducting his intrigues with his own army, as well as his fagacity in carrying on his negociations with the natives, he had already laid the foundations of his future ſucceſs. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever confidence he might place in the plan which he had formed, he could not but perceive, that as his title to command was derived from a doubtful authority, he held it but a precarious tenure. The injuries which Velaſquez had received, were ſuch as would naturally prompt him to apply for redreſs to their common ſovereign; and ſuch a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he foreſaw, might be given of his conduct, that he had reaſon to apprehend, not only that he might be degraded from his preſent rank, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to puniſhment. Before he began his march, it was neceſſary to take the moſt effectual precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt this impending danger. With this view he perſuaded the magiſtrates of the colony at Vera Cruz to addreſs a letter to the king, the chief object of which was to juſtify their own conduct in eſtabliſhing a colony independent on the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Velaſquez. In order to accompliſh this, they endeavoured to detract from his merit, in fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the two former armaments under Cordova and Grijalva, affirming that theſe had been equipped by the adventurers who engaged in the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not by the governor. They contended that the ſole object of Velaſquez was to trade or barter with the natives, not to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of New Spain, or to ſettle a colony there. They aſſerted that Cortes and the officers who ſerved under him had defrayed the greater part of the expence in fitting out the armament. On this

account, they humbly requeſted their ſovereign to ratify what they had done in his name, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm Cortes in the ſupreme command by his royal commiſſion. That Charles might be induced to grant more readily what they demanded, they give him a pompous deſcription of the country which they had diſcovered; of its riches, the number of its inhabitants, their civilization and arts; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the progreſs which they had already made in annexing ſome parts of the country ſituated on the ſea-coaſt to the crown of Caſtile; and mention the ſchemes which they had formed, as well as the hopes which they entertained, of reducing the whole to ſubjection<note n="*" place="bottom">In this letter it is aſſerted, that though a conſiderable number of Spaniards have been wounded in their various encounters with the people of Tobaſco, not one of them died, and all had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a very ſhort time.

                  <p>WHILE a veſſel was preparing for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, an unexpected event occaſioned a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alarm.

                  <p>THOUGH the good fortune of Cortes interpoſed ſo ſeaſonably on this occaſion,<note place="margin">He deſtroys his fleet.</note> the detection of this conſpiracy filled his mind with moſt diſquieting apprehenſions, and prompted him to execute a ſcheme which he had long revolved. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the ſpirit of diſaffection ſtill lurked among his troops; that though hitherto checked by the uniform ſucceſs of his ſchemes, or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the hand of authority, various events might occur which would encourage and call it

forth. He obſerved, that many of his men, weary of the fatigue of ſervice, longed to reviſit their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements in Cuba; and that upon any appearance of extraordinary danger, or any reverſe of fortune, it would be impoſſible to reſtrain them from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither. He was ſenſible that his forces, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too feeble, could bear no diminution, and that a very ſmall defection of his followers would oblige him to abandon the enterpriſe. After ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating often, and with much ſolicitude, upon thoſe particulars, he ſaw no hope of ſucceſs, but in cutting off all poſſibility of retreat, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his men to the neceſſity of adopting the ſame reſolution with which he himſelf was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, either to conquer or to periſh. With this view, he determined to deſtroy his fleet; but as he durſt not venture to execute ſuch a bold reſolution by his ſingle authority, he laboured to bring his ſoldiers to adopt his ideas with reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this meaſure. His addreſs in accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this was not inferior to the arduous occaſion in which it was employed. He perſuaded ſome, that the ſhips had ſuffered ſo much by having been long at ſea, as to be altogether unfit for ſervice; to others he pointed out what a ſeaſonable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſtrength they would derive from the junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an hundred men, now unprofitably employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſailors; and to all, he repreſented the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of fixing their eyes and wiſhes upon what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, without allowing the idea of a retreat once to enter their thoughts. With univerſal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſhips were drawn aſhore, and after ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their ſails, rigging, iron works, and whatever elſe might be of uſe, they were broke in pieces.

                  <p>NOTHING now retarded Cortes; the alacrity of his troops and the diſpoſition of his allies were equally favourable. All the advantages, however, derived from the latter, though procured by much aſſiduity and addreſs, were well nigh loſt in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by an indiſcreet ſally of religious zeal, which, on many occaſions, precipitated Cortes into actions inconſiſtent with the prudence that diſtinguiſhes his character. Though hitherto he had neither time nor opportunity to explain to the natives the errors of their own ſuperſtition, or to inſtruct them in the principles of the Chriſtian faith, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his ſoldiers to overturn the altars and to deſtroy the idols in the chief temple of Zempoalla, and in their place to erect a crucifix and an image of the Virgin Mary. The people beheld this with aſtoniſhment and horror; the prieſts excited them to arms; but ſuch was the authority of Cortes, and ſo great the aſcendant which the Spaniards had acquired, that the commotion was appeaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bloodſhed, and concord perfectly re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed<note n="†" place="bottom">B.

The cazique of Zempoalla ſupplied him with proviſions, and with two hundred of thoſe Indians called <hi>Tamemes,</hi> whoſe office, in a country where
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:034476_0546_0FFDD9B894371068"/>
tame animals were unknown, was to carry burdens; and to perform all ſervile labour. They were a great relief to the Spaniſh ſoldiers, who hitherto had been obliged, not only to carry their own bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, but to drag along the artillery by main force. He offered likewiſe a conſiderable body of his troops, but Cortes was ſatisfied with four hundred; taking care, however, to chuſe perſons of ſuch note as might prove hoſtages for the fidelity of their maſter. Nothing memorable happened in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, until he arrived on the confines of Tlaſcala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike people, were implacable enemies of the Mexicans, and had been united in an ancient alliance with the caziques of Zompoalla. Though leſs civilized than the ſubjects of Montezuma, they were advanced in improvement far beyond the rude nations of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, whoſe manners we have deſcribed. They had made conſiderable progreſs in agriculture; they dwelt in large towns: they were nor ſtrangers to ſome ſpecies of commerce; and in the imperfect accounts of their inſtitutions and laws, tranſmitted to us by the early Spaniſh writers, we diſcern traces both of diſtributive juſtice and of criminal juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in their interior police. But ſtill, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their civilization was incomplete, and as they depended for ſubſiſtence not on agriculture alone, but truſted for it, in a great meaſure, to hunting, they retained many of the qualities natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to men in this ſtate. Like them, they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too, they were high-ſpirited and independent. In conſequence of the former, they were involved in peapetual hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and had but a ſlender and occaſional inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with neighbouring ſtates. The latter inſpired them with ſuch deteſtation of ſervitude, that they not only refuſed to ſtoop to a foreign yoke, and maintained an obſtinate and ſucceſsful conteſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:034476_0547_0FFDD9BC3740E9A8"/>
of their liberty againſt the ſuperior power of the Mexican empire, but they guarded with equal ſolicitude againſt domeſtic tyranny; and diſdaining to acknowledge any maſter, they lived under the mild and limited juriſdiction of a council elected by their ſeveral tribes.</p>
                  <p>CORTES,<note place="margin">His war with the Tlaſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans.</note> though he had received information concerning the martial character of this people, flattered himſelf that his profeſſions of delivering the oppreſſed from the tyranny of Montezuma, their inveterate enmity to the Mexicans, and the example of their ancient allies the Zempoallans, might induce the Tlaſcalans to grant him a friendly reception. In order to diſpoſe them to this, four Zempoallans of great eminence were ſent ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, to requeſt, in his name, and in that of their cazique, that they would permit the Spaniards to paſs through the territories of the republic in their way to Mexico. But inſtead of the favourable anſwer which was expected, the Tlaſcalans ſeized the ambaſſadors, and, without any regard to their public character, made preparations for ſacrificing them to their gods. At the ſame time, they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled their troops, in order to oppoſe thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known invaders, if they ſhould attempt to make their paſſage good by force of arms. Various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives concurred in precipitating the Tlaſcalans into this reſolution. A fierce people, ſhut up within its own narrow precincts, and little accuſtomed to any intercourſe with foreigners, is apt to conſider every ſtranger as an enemy, and is eaſily excited to arms. They concluded, from Cortes's propoſal of viſiting Montezuma in his capital, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his profeſſions, he courted the friendſhip of a monarch whom they both hated and feared. The imprudent zeal of Cortes in violating the temples in Zempoalla, filled the Tlaſcalans with horror; and as they were no leſs attached to their

ſuperſtition than the other nations of New Spain, they were impatient to avenge their injured gods, and to acquire the merit of offering up to them, as victims, thoſe impious men who had dared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane their altars; they contemned the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Spaniards, as they had not yet meaſured their own ſtrength with that of theſe new enemies, and had no idea of the ſuperiority which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from their arms and diſcipline.</p>

As the reſolutions of people who delight in war are executed with no leſs promptitude than they are formed, he found troops in the field ready to oppoſe him.

His army marched in cloſe order; he choſe the ſtations, where he halted, with attention, and fortified every camp with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary care. During fourteen days he was expoſed to almoſt uninterrupted aſſaults, the Tlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calans advancing with numerous armies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the attack in various forms, with a degree of valour and perſeverance to which the Spaniards had ſeen nothing parallel in the New World. The Spaniſh hiſtorians deſcribe thoſe ſucceſſive battles with great pomp, and enter into a minute detail of particulars, mingling many exaggerated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible circumſtances<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE IX.</note>, with ſuch as are real and marvellous. But no power of words can render the recital of a combat intereſting, where there is no equality of danger; and when the narrative

                  <p>THERE are ſome circumſtances, however,<note place="margin">Some ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in it.</note> in this war, which are memorable, and merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as they throw light upon the character both of the people of New Spain, and of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors. Though the Tlaſcalans brought into the field ſuch numerous armies as appear ſufficient to have overwhelmed the Spaniards, they were never able to make any impreſſion upon their ſmall batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. Singular as this may ſeem, it is not inexpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. The Tlaſcalans, though addicted to war, were, like all unpoliſhed nations, ſtrangers to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary order and diſcipline, and loſt in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the advantage which they might have derived from their numbers, and the impetuoſity of their attack, by their conſtant ſolicitude to carry off the dead and wounded. This point of honour, founded on a ſentiment of tenderneſs natural to the human mind, and ſtrengthened by anxiety to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the bodies of their countrymen from being devoured by their enemies, was univerſal among the people of New Spain. Attention to this pious office occupied them even during the heat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat<note n="*" place="bottom">B. Diaz. c. 65.</note>, broke their union, and diminiſhed the force of the impreſſion which they might have made by a joint effort.</p>
                  <p>NOT only was their ſuperiority in number of little avail, but the imperfection of their military weapons rendered their valour in a great meaſure inoffenſive. After three battles, and many ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and aſſaults, not one Spaniard was killed in the field. Arrows and ſpears, headed with flint
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:034476_0550_0FFDD9C37AC1E690"/>
or the bones of fiſhes, ſtakes hardened in the fire, and wooden ſwords, though deſtructive weapons among naked Indians,<note place="margin">1519.</note> were eaſily turned aſide by the Spaniſh bucklers, and could hardly penetrate the <hi>eſcaupiles,</hi> or quilted jackets, which the ſoldiers wore. The Tlaſcalans advanced boldly to the charge, and often fought hand to hand. Many of the Spaniards were wounded, though all ſlightly, which cannot be imputed to any want of courage or ſtrength in their enemies, but to the defect of the arms with which they aſſailed them.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the fury with which the Tlaſcalans attacked the Spaniards, they ſeem to have conducted their hoſtilities with ſome degree of barbarous generoſity. They gave the Spaniards warning of their hoſtile intentions, and as they knew that their invaders wanted proviſions, and imagined, perhaps, like the other Americans, that they had left their own country becauſe it did not afford them ſubſiſtence, they ſent to their camp a large ſupply of poultry and maize, deſiring them to eat plentifully, becauſe they ſcorned to attack an enemy enfeebled by hunger, and it would be an affront to their Gods to offer them famiſhed vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, as well as diſagreeable to themſelves to feed on ſuch emaciated prey<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. vi. c. 6.

In conſequence of this, the Tlaſcalans, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit confidence of men who fancy themſelves to be under the guidance of heaven, acted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to one of their moſt eſtabliſhed maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy, with a ſtrong body, in the night-time, in hopes of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them when enfeebled and ſurpriſed. But Cortes had greater vigilance and diſcernment than to be deceived by the rude ſtratagems of an Indian army. The centinels at his out poſts, obſerving ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary movement among the Tlaſcalans, gave the alarm. In a moment the troops were under arms, and ſallying out, diſperſed the party with great ſlaughter, without allowing it to approach the camp.

As not a moment was to be loſt, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolved to prevent his enemies, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on them ſuch dreadful vengeance as might ſtrike Montezuma and his ſubjects with terror.

When Cortes firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſeeds of diſcontent in the remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the empire, hope dawned upon his mind; but when he now diſcovered ſuch ſymptoms of alienation from their monarch near the ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he concluded that the vital parts of the conſtitution were affected, and conceived the moſt ſanguine expectations of overturning a ſtate, whoſe natural ſtrength was thus divided and impaired. While thoſe reflections encouraged the general to perſiſt in his arduous undertaking, the ſoldiers were no leſs animated by obſervations more obvious to their capacity. In deſcending from the mountains of Chalco, acroſs which the road lay, the vaſt plain of Mexico opened gradually to their view.<note place="margin">Firſt view of it.</note> When they firſt beheld this proſpect, one of the moſt ſtriking and beautiful on the face of the earth;

when they obſerved fertile and cultivated fields, ſtretching farther than the eye could reach; when they ſaw a lake reſembling the ſea in extent, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with large towns, and diſcovered the capital city riſing upon an iſland in the middle, adorned with its temples and turrets; the ſcene ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their imagination, that ſome believed the fanciful deſcriptions of romance were realized, and that its enchanted palaces and gilded domes were preſented to their ſight; others could hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade themſelves that this wonderful ſpectacle was any thing more than a dream<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XIII.</note>. As they advanced, their doubts were removed, but their amazement increaſed.

Many meſſengers arrived ſucceſſively from Montezuma, permitting them one day to advance, requiring them on the next to retire, as his hopes or fears alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately prevailed; and ſo wonderful was this infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, which ſeems to be unaccountable on any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition but that of a ſuperſtitious dread of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, as beings of a ſuperior nature, that Cortes was almoſt at the gates of the capital, before the monarch had determined whether to receive him as a friend, or to oppoſe him as an enemy. But as no ſign of open hoſtility appeared, the Spaniards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the fluctuations of Montezuma's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, continued their march along the cauſeway which led to Mexico through the lake, with great

Each of theſe, in his order, paſſed by Cortes, and ſaluted him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mode deemed moſt reſpectful and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive in their country. They announced the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Montezuma himſelf, and ſoon after his harbingers came in ſight. There appeared firſt two hundred perſons in an uniform dreſs, with large plumes of feathers, alike in faſhion, marching two and two, in deep ſilence, bare-footed, with their eyes fixed on the ground. Theſe were followed by a company of higher rank, in their moſt ſhowy apparel, in the midſt of whom was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold, and feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites carried him on their ſhoulders, others ſupported a canopy of curious workmanſhip over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals, and at that ſignal all the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unworthv to look on ſo great a monarch. When he drew near, Cortes diſmounted, advancing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him with officious haſte, and in a reſpectful poſture. At the ſame time Montezuma alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near relations, approached with a ſlow and ſtately pace, his attendants covering the ſtreet with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the ground. Cortes accoſted him with profound reverence, after the European faſhion. He returned the ſalutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kiſſing it. This
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:034476_0562_0FFDD9E1B10D1160"/>
ceremony, the cuſtomary expreſſion of veneration from inferiors towards thoſe who were above them in rank, appeared ſuch amazing condeſcenſion in a proud monarch, who ſcarcely deigned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the reſt of mankind as of the ſame ſpecies with himſelf, that all his ſubjects firmly believed thoſe perſons, before whom he humbled himſelf in this manner, to be ſomething more than human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd, the Spaniards frequently, and with much ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heard themſelves denominated <hi>Toules,</hi> or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinities. Nothing material paſſed in this firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview. Montezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters which he had prepared for his reception, and immediately took leave of him, with a polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not unworthy of a court more refined. "You are now," ſays he, "with your brothers in your own houſe; refreſh yourſelves after your fatigue, and be happy until I return<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes. Relat. Ram. iii. 232—235. B.

The place allotted to the Spaniards for their lodging was a houſe built by the father of Montezuma.

The firſt care of Cortes was to take pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions for his ſecurity, by planting the artillery ſo as to command the different avenues which led to it, by appointing a large diviſion of his troops to be always on guard, and by poſting centinels at proper ſtations, with injunctions to obſerve the ſame vigilant diſcipline as if they were within ſight of an enemy's camp.</p>

to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be ſuitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference enſued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with reſpect to the Spaniards. It was an eſtabliſhed tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now ſubject to his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; that after they were ſettled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promiſing, that at ſome future period his deſcendants ſhould viſit them, aſſume the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and reform their conſtitution and laws; that, from what he had heard and ſeen of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very perſons whoſe appearance the Mexican traditions and prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as ſtrangers, but as relations of the ſame blood and parentage, and deſired that they might conſider themſelves as maſters in his dominions, for both himſelf and his ſubjects ſhould be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wiſhes. Cortes made a reply in his uſual ſtyle, with reſpect to the dignity and power of his ſovereign, and his intention in ſending him into that country; artfully endeavouring ſo to frame his diſcourſe, that it might coincide as much as poſſible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and ſome of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor. The three ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent days were employed in viewing the city; the appearance of which, ſo far ſuperior in the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and

                  <p>MEXICO, or <hi>Tenuchtitlan,</hi> as it was anciently called by the natives, is ſituated in a large plain, environed by mountains of ſuch height, that, though within the torrid zone, the temperature of its climate is mild and healthful. All the moiſture which deſcends from the high grounds is collected in ſeveral lakes, the two largeſt of which, of about ninety miles in circuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one are freſh, thoſe of the other brackiſh. On the banks of the latter, and on ſome ſmall iſlands adjoining to them, the capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The acceſs to the city was by artificial cauſeways or ſtreets formed of ſtones and earth, about thirty feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake during the rainy ſeaſon overflowed the flat country, theſe cauſeways were of conſiderable length. That of Tacuba, on the weſt, extended a mile and a half; that of Tepeaca<note n="*" place="bottom">I am indebted to M. Clavigero for correcting an error of importance in my deſcription of Mexico. From the eaſt, where Tezcuco was ſituated, there was no cauſeway, as I have obſerved, and yet by ſome inattention on my part, or on that of the printer, in all the former editions one of the cauſeways was ſaid to lead to Tezcuco.

On the eaſt there was no cauſeway, and the city could be approached only by canoes<note n="†" place="bottom">F. Torribio MS.</note>. In each of theſe cauſeways were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters flowed, and over theſe beams of timber were laid, which being covered with earth, the cauſeway or ſtreet had every where an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city were ſingular, its conſtruction was remarkable.

Not only the temples of their gods, but the houſes belonging to the monarch, and to perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, were of ſuch dimenſions, that,<note place="margin">1518.</note> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with any other buildings which had been hitherto diſcovered in America, they might be termed magnificent. The habitations of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people were mean, reſembling the huts of other Indians. But they were all placed in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner, on the banks of the canals which paſſed through the city, in ſome of its diſtricts, or on the ſides of the ſtreets which interſected it in other quarters. In ſeveral places were large open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or ſquares, one of which, allotted for the great market, is ſaid to have been ſo ſpacious, that forty or fifty thouſand perſons carried on tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Diaz. c. 93, 94. Herrera, dec. 2. lib. viii. c. 1.</note>. Cortes, though alarmed with this intelligence, as an indication of Montezuma's hoſtile intentions, had continued his march. But as ſoon as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Mexico, he became ſenſible, that, from an exceſs of confidence in the ſuperior valour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of his troops, as well as from the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of having nothing to guide him in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known country, but the defective intelligence which he had received from people with whom his mode of communication was very imperfect, he had puſhed forward into a ſituation, where it was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire. Diſgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſequence of attempting the latter. The ſucceſs of his enterpriſe depended upon ſupporting the high opinion which the people of New Spain had formed with reſpect to the irreſiſtible power of his arms. Upon the firſt ſymptom of timidity on his part, their veneration would ceaſe, and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma, whom fear alone reſtrained at preſent, would let looſe upon him the whole force of his empire. At the ſame time, he knew that the countenance of his own ſovereign was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by a ſeries of victories, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the merit of extraordinary ſucceſs could ſcreen his conduct from the cenſure of irregularity. From all theſe conſiderations, it was neceſſary to maintain his ſtation, and to extricate himſelf out of the difficulties in which one bold ſtep had involved

him, by venturing upon another ſtill bolder. The ſituation was trying, but his mind was equal to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan no leſs extraordinary than daring.<note place="margin">Reſolves to ſeize Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma</note> He determined to ſeize Montezuma in his palace, and to carry him as a priſoner to the Spaniſh quarters. From the ſuperſtitious veneration of the Mexicans for the perſon of their monarch, as well as their implicit ſubmiſſion to his will, he hoped, by having Montezuma in his power, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſupreme direction of their affairs; or, at leaſt, with ſuch a ſacred pledge in his hands, he made no doubt of being ſecure from any effort of their violence.</p>

At his uſual hour of viſiting Montezuma, Cortes went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, Lugo, Velaſquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers, and as many truſty ſoldiers. Thirty choſen men followed, not in regular order, but ſauntering at ſome diſtance, as if they had no object but curioſity; ſmall parties were poſted at proper intervals, in all the ſtreets leading from the Spaniſh quarters to the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlaſcalan allies, were under arms, ready to ſally out on the firſt alarm. Cortes and his attendants were admitted without ſuſpicion; the Mexicans retiring, as uſual, out of reſpect. He addreſſed the monarch in a tone very different from that which he had employed in former conferences, reproaching him bitterly as the author of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

aſſault made upon the Spaniards by one of his officers, and demanded public reparation for the loſs which they had ſuſtained by the death of ſome of their companions, as well as for the inſult offered to the great prince whoſe ſervants they were. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma, confounded at this unexpected accuſation, and changing colour, either from conſciouſneſs of guilt, or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, aſſerted his own innocence with great earneſtneſs, and, as a proof of it, gave orders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accomplices priſoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with ſeeming complaiſance, that a declaration ſo reſpectable left no doubt remaining in his own mind, but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more was requiſite to ſatisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Montezuma did not harbour hoſtile intentions againſt them, unleſs, as an evidence of his confidence and attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he removed from his own palace, and took up his reſidence in the Spaniſh quarters, where he ſhould be ſerved and honoured as became a great monarch. The firſt mention of ſo ſtrange a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal bereaved Montezuma of ſpeech, and almoſt of motion. At length, indignation gave him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, and he haughtily anſwered, "That per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his rank were not accuſtomed volutarily to give up themſelves as priſoners; and were he mean enough to do ſo, his ſubjects would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch an affront to be offered to their ſovereign." Cortes, unwilling to employ force, endeavoured alternately to ſooth and to intimidate him. The altercation became warm; and having continued above three hours, Velaſquez de Leon, an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and gallant young man, exclaimed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, "Why waſte more time in vain?

The execution of ſuch atrocious deeds is ſeldom long ſuſpended. The unhappy victims were inſtantly led forth. The pile on which they were laid was compoſed of the weapons collected in the royal magazine for the public defence. An innumerable multitude of Mexicans beheld, in ſilent aſtoniſhment, the double inſult offered to the majeſty of their empire, an officer of diſtinction committed to the flames by the authority of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for having done what he owed in duty to his natural ſovereign; and the arms provided by the

The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, convinced that Qualpopoca would not have ventured to attack Eſcalante without orders from his maſter, were not ſatisfied with inflicting venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the inſtrument employed in committing that crime, while the author of it eſcaped with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. Juſt before Qualpopoca was led but to ſuffer, Cortes entered the apartment of Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma, followed by ſome of his officers, and a ſoldier carrying a pair of fetters; and approaching the monarch with a ſtern countenance, told him, that as the perſons who were now to undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they merited, had charged him as the cauſe of the outrage committed, it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he likewiſe ſhould make atonement for that guilt; then turning away abruptly, without waiting for a reply, commanded the ſoldier to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders were inſtantly executed.

His attendants, ſpeechleſs with horror, fell at his feet, bathing them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters in their hands, endeavoured with officious tenderneſs to lighten their preſſure. Nor did their grief and deſpondency abate, until Cortes returned from the execution, and with a cheerful countenance ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montezuma's ſpirits had ſunk with unmanly dejection, they now roſe into indecent joy; and with an unbecoming tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he paſſed at once from the anguiſh of deſpair to tranſports of gratitude and expreſſions of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards his deliverer.</p>

To put the monarch of a great kingdom in irons, and, after ſuch ignominious treatment, ſuddenly to releaſe him, ſeems to be a diſplay of power no leſs incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate than wanton. According to the common relation, no account can be given either of the one action or the other, but that Cortes, intoxicated with ſucceſs, and preſuming on the aſcendant which he had acquired over the minds of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, thought nothing too bold for him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, or too dangerous to execute. But, in one view, theſe proceedings, however repugnant to juſtice and humanity, may have flowed from that artful policy which regulated every part of Cortes's behaviour towards the Mexicans. They had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spaniards to be an order of beings ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to men. It was of the utmoſt conſequence to cheriſh this illuſion, and to keep up the veneration which it inſpired.

                  <p>ONE thing ſtill was wanting to complete his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.

With this requiſition, the laſt and moſt humbling that can be made to one poſſeſſed of ſovereign authority, Montezuma was ſo obſequious as to comply. He called together the chief men of his empire, and in a ſolemn harangue, reminded them of the traditions and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which led them to expect the arrival of a people ſprung from the ſame ſtock with themſelves, in order to take poſſeſſion of the ſupreme power, he declared his belief that the Spaniards were this promiſed race; that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern the Mexican empire; that he would lay his crown at his feet, and obey him as a tributary. While uttering theſe words, Montezuma diſcovered how deeply he was afflicted in making ſuch a ſacrifice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his diſcourſe.

ſuch a ſenſe of dignity, as to feel that pang which pierces the heart of princes when conſtrained to reſign independent power. The firſt mention of ſuch a reſolution ſtruck the aſſembly dumb with aſtoniſhment. This was followed by a ſullen mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur of ſorrow, mingled with indignation, which indicated ſome violent eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes foreſaw, and ſeaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed to prevent it, by declaring that his maſter had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the conſtitution and laws of the Mexican empire.

The Spaniards now collected all the treaſure which had been either voluntarily beſtowed upon them at different times by Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma, or had been extorted from his people under various pretexts; and having melted the gold and ſilver, the value of theſe, without including jewels and ornaments of various kinds, which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on account of their curious workmanſhip, amounted to ſix hundred thouſand <hi>peſos.</hi> The ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were impatient to have it divided,<note place="margin">Diviſion of it, and the diſcontent it occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and Cortes complied with their deſire.

fifth was allotted to Cortes, as commander in chief. The ſums advanced by Velaſquez, by Cortes, and by ſome of the officers, towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expence of fitting out the armament, were then deducted. The remainder was divided among the army, including the garriſon of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks. After ſo many defalcations, the ſhare of a private man did not exceed a hundred peſos. This ſum fell ſo far below their ſanguine expectations, that ſome ſoldiers rejected it with ſcorn, and others murmured ſo lonely at this cruel diſappointment of their hopes, that it required all the addreſs of Cortes, and no ſmall exertion of his liberality, to appeaſe them. The complaints of the army were not altogether deſtitute of foundation. As the crown had contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted nothing towards the equipment or ſucceſs of the armament, it was not without regret that the ſoldiers beheld it ſweep away ſo great a proportion of the treaſure purchaſed by their blood and toil. What fell to the ſhare of the general appeared, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ideas of wealth in the ſixteenth century, an enormous ſum. Some of Cortes's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites had ſecretly appropriated to their own uſe ſeveral ornaments of gold, which neither paid the royal fifth, nor were brought into account as part of the common ſtock. It was, however, ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly the intereſt of Cortes at this period to make a large remittance to the king, that it is highly probable thoſe concealments were not of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Reaſons why gold was found in ſuch ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities.</note>THE total ſum amaſſed by the Spaniards bears no proportion to the ideas which might be formed, either by reflecting on the deſcriptions given by hiſtorians of the ancient ſplendour of Mexico, or by conſidering the productions of its mines in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern times. But, among the ancient Mexicans, gold and ſilver were not the ſtandards by which the

worth of other commodities was eſtimated; and deſtitute of the artificial value derived from this circumſtance, were no farther in requeſt than as they furniſhed materials for ornaments and trinkets. Theſe were either conſecrated to the gods in their temples, or were worn as marks of diſtinction by their princes and ſome of their moſt eminent chiefs. As the conſumption of the precious metals was inconſiderable, the demand for them was not ſuch as to put either the ingenuity or induſtry of the Mexicans on the ſtretch, in order to augment their ſtore. They were altogether unacquainted with the art of working the rich mines with which their country abounded. What gold they had was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the beds of rivers, native, and ripened into a pure metallic ſtate <note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. p. 236. F. B.

The utmoſt effort of their labour in ſearch of it was to waſh the earth carried down by torrents from the mountains, and to pick out the grains of gold which ſubſided; and even this ſimple operation, according to the report of the perſons whom Cortes appointed to ſurvey the provinces where there was a proſpect of finding mines, they performed very unſkilfully<note n="†" place="bottom">B. Diaz. c. 103.</note>. From all thoſe cauſes, the whole maſs of gold in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Mexicans was not great. As ſilver is rarely found pure, and the Mexican art was too rude to conduct the proceſs for refining it in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner, the quantity of this metal was ſtill leſs conſiderable<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ix. c. 4.</note>. Thus, though the Spaniards had exerted all the power which they poſſeſſed in Mexico, and often with indecent rapacity, in order to gratify their predominant paſſion; and though Montezuma had fondly exhauſted his treaſures, in hopes of ſatiating their thirſt for gold, the product of both, which probably included a great part of

Though Cortes often urged him, with the importunate zeal of a miſſionary, to renounce his falſe gods, and to embrace the Chriſtian faith, he always rejected the propoſition with horror. Superſtition, among the Mexicans, was formed into ſuch a regular and complete ſyſtem, that its inſtitutions naturally took faſt hold of the mind; and while the rude tribes in other parts of America were eaſily induced to relinquiſh a few notions and rites, ſo looſe and arbitrary as hardly to merit the name of a public religion, the Mexicans adhered tenaciouſly to their mode of worſhip, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever barbarous, was accompanied with ſuch order and ſolemnity as to render it an object of the higheſt veneration. Cortes, finding all his attempts inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to ſhake the conſtancy of Montezuma, was ſo much enraged at his obſtinacy, that in a tranſport of zeal he led out his ſoldiers to throw down the idols in the great temple by for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prieſts and leading men held frequent conſultations
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:034476_0581_0FFDDA15D6A35D48"/>
with Montezuma for this purpoſe. But as it might prove fatal to the captive monarch to attempt either the one or the other by violence, he was willing to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes into his preſence, he obſerved, that now, as all the purpoſes of his embaſſy were fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, the gods had declared their will, and the people ſignified their deſire that he and his followers ſhould inſtantly depart out of the empire. With this he required them to comply, or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable deſtruction would fall ſuddenly on their heads. The tenor of this unexpected requiſition, as well as the determined tone in which it was uttered, left Cortes no room to doubt that it was the reſult of ſome deep ſcheme concerted between Montezuma and his ſubjects. He quickly perceived that he might derive more advantage from a ſeeming com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the monarch's inclination, than from an ill-timed attempt to change or to oppoſe it; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with great compoſure, that he had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to prepare for returning to his own country; but as he had deſtroyed the veſſels in which he arrived, ſome time was requiſite for building other ſhips. This appeared ſeaſonable. A number of Mexicans were ſent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and ſome Spaniſh carpenters were appointed to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend the work.

They, from ſome motive which is not clearly explained by the contemporary hiſtorians, touched at the iſland of Cuba, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the peremptory orders of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral<note n="*" place="bottom">B.

By this means Valaſquez not only learned that Cortes and his followers, after formally renouncing all connection with him, had eſtabliſhed an independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colony in New Spain, and were ſoliciting the king to confirm their proceedings by his authority; but he obtained particular information concerning the opulence of the country, the valuable preſents which Cortes had received, and the inviting proſpects of ſucceſs that opened to his view. Every paſſion which can agitate an ambitious mind; ſhame, at having been ſo groſsly overreached; indignation, at being betrayed by the man whom he had ſelected as the object of his favour and confidence; grief, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſted his fortune to aggrandize an enemy; and deſpair of recovering ſo fair an opportunity of eſtabliſhing his fame and extending his power, now raged in the boſom of Velaſquez. All theſe, with united force, excited him to make an extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on the author of his wrongs, and to wreſt from him his uſurped autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and conqueſts. Nor did he want the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a good title to juſtify ſuch an attempt. The agent whom he ſent to Spain with an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with a moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reception; and from the ſpecimens which he produced, ſuch high expectations were formed concerning the opulence of New Spain, that Velaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quez was authoriſed to proſecute the diſcovery of the country, and appointed governor of it during life, with more extenſive power and privileges than had been granted to any adventurer from the time of Columbus<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iii. c. 11.</note>.

As Velaſquez's experience of the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of committing to another what he ought to have executed himſelf, had not rendered him more enterpriſing, he veſted the command of this formidable body, which, in the infancy of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh power in America, merits the appellation of an army, in Pamphilo de Narvaez, with inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ſeize Cortes and his principal officers, to ſend them priſoners to him, and then to complete the diſcovery and conqueſt of the country in his name.</p>

                     </note>AFTER a proſperous voyage, Narvaez landed his men without oppoſition near St. Juan de Ullua. Three ſoldiers, whom Cortes had ſent to ſearch for mines in that diſtrict, immediately joined him. By this accident, he not only received information concerning the progreſs and ſituation of Cortes, but as theſe ſoldiers had made ſome progreſs in the knowledge of the Mexican language, he acquired interpreters, by whoſe means he was enabled to hold ſome intercourſe with the people of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But, according to the low cunning of deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they framed their intelligence with more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to what they thought would be agreeable, than to what they knew to be true; and repreſented
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:034476_0585_0FFDDA204D0173D8"/>
the ſituation of Cortes to be ſo deſperate, and the diſaffection of his followers to be ſo general, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the natural confidence and preſumption of Narvaez. His firſt operation, however, might have taught him not to rely on their partial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. Having ſent to ſummon the governor of Vera Cruz to ſurrender, Guevara, a prieſt whom he employed in that ſervice, made the requiſition with ſuch inſolence, that Sandoval, an officer of high ſpirit, and zealouſly attached to Cortes, inſtead of complying with his demands, ſeized him and his attendants, and ſent them in chains to Mexico.</p>
                  <p>CORTES received them not like enemies,<note place="margin">Cortes deeply alarmed.</note> but as friends, and condemning the ſeverity of Sandoval, ſet them immediately at liberty. By this well-timed clemency, ſeconded by careſſes and preſents, he gained their confidence, and drew from them ſuch particulars concerning the force and intentions of Narvaez, as gave him a view of the impending danger in its full extent. He had not to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match for him in war, and ſtill more inferior in the arts of policy, but to take the field againſt an army in courage and martial diſcipline equal to his own, in number far ſuperior, acting under the ſanction of royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and commanded by an officer of known bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. He was informed that Narvaez, more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to gratify the reſentment of Velaſquez, than attentive to the honour or intereſt of his country, had begun his intercourſe with the natives, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting him and his followers as fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion againſt their own ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and of injuſtice in invading the Mexican empire; and had declared that his chief object in viſiting the country was to puniſh the Spaniards who had committed theſe crimes, and to reſcue the Mexicans from oppreſſion. He ſoon perceived
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:034476_0586_0FFDDA22E7E3E618"/>
that the ſame unfavourable repreſentations of his character and actions had been conveyed to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma, and that Narvaez had found means to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that as the conduct of thoſe who kept him under reſtraint was highly diſpleaſing to the king his maſter, he had it in charge not only to reſcue an injured monarch from confinement, but to reinſtate him in the poſſeſſion of his ancient power and independence. Animated with this proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being ſet free from ſubjection to ſtrangers, the Mexicans in ſeveral provinces began openly to revolt from Cortes, and to regard Narvaez as a deliverer no leſs able than willing to ſave them. Montezuma himſelf kept up a ſecret intercouſe with the new commander, and ſeemed to court him as a perſon ſuperior in power and dignity to thoſe Spaniards whom he had hitherto revered as the firſt of men<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XX.</note>.</p>

No ſituation can be conceived more trying to the capacity and firmneſs of a general, or where the choice of the plan which ought to be adopted was more difficult. If he ſhould wait the approach of Narvaez in Mexico, deſtruction ſeemed to be unavoidable; for while the Spaniards preſſed him from without, the inhabitants, whoſe turbulent ſpirit he could hardly reſtrain with all his authority and attention would eagerly lay hold on ſuch a favourable opportunity of avenging all their wrongs. If he ſhould abandon the capital, ſet the captive monarch at liberty, and march out to meet the enemy; he muſt at once forego the fruits of all his toils and victories, and relinquiſh advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which could not be recovered without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary efforts, and infinite danger. If, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:034476_0587_0FFDDA24A3B87478"/>
of employing force, he ſhould have recourſe to conciliating meaſures, and attempt an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with Narvaez; the natural haughtineſs of that officer, augmented by conſciouſneſs of his preſent ſuperiority, forbad him to cheriſh any ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hope of ſucceſs. After revolving every ſcheme with deep attention, Cortes fixed upon that which in execution was moſt hazardous, but if ſucceſsful, would prove moſt beneficial to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his country; and with the deciſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity ſuited to deſperate ſituations, determined to make one bold effort for victory under every diſadvantage, rather than ſacrifice his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and the Spaniſh intereſt in Mexico.</p>
                  <p>BUT though he foreſaw that the conteſt muſt be terminated finally by arms,<note place="margin">His negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations with the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaez.</note> it would have been not only indecent, but criminal, to have marched againſt his countrymen, without attempting to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt matters by an amicable negociation. In this ſervice he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to whoſe character the function was well ſuited, and who poſſeſſed, beſides, ſuch prudence and addreſs as qualified him to carry on the ſecret intrigues in which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Narvaez rejected, with ſcorn, every ſcheme of accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation that Olmedo propoſed, and was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty reſtrained from laying violent hands on him and his attendants. He met, however, with a more favorable reception among the followers of Narvaez, to many of whom he delivered letters, either from Cortes or his officers, their ancient friends and companions. Cortes artfully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied theſe with preſents of rings, chains of gold, and other trinkets of value, which inſpired thoſe needy adventurers with high ideas of the wealth that he had acquired, and with envy of their good fortune who were engaged in his ſervice. Some, from hopes of becoming ſharers in thoſe rich ſpoils,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:034476_0588_0FFDDA274695DE08"/>
declared for an immediate accommodation with Cortes. Others, from public ſpirit, laboured to prevent a civil war, which, whatever party ſhould prevail, muſt ſhake, and perhaps ſubvert the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh power, in a country where it was ſo imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eſtabliſhed. Narvaez diſregarded both, and by a public proclamation denounced Cortes and his adherents rebels and enemies to their country. Cortes, it is probable, was not much ſurpriſed at the untractable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after having given ſuch a proof of his own pacific diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition as might juſtify his recourſe to other means, he determined to advance towards an enemy whom he had laboured in vain to appeaſe.</p>

To the cuſtody of this ſlender garriſon he committed a great city, with all the wealth he had amaſſed, and, what was ſtill of greater importance, the perſon of the impriſoned monarch. His utmoſt art was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in concealing from Montezuma the real cauſe of his march. He laboured to perſuade him, that the ſtrangers who had lately arrived were his friends and fellow-ſubjects; and that, after a ſhort interview with them, they would depart together, and return to their own country. The captive prince, unable to comprehend the deſigns of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he now heard with the declarations of Narvaez, and afraid to diſcover any ſymptom of ſuſpicion or diſtruſt of Cortes, promiſed to remain quietly in the Spaniſh quarters, and to cultivate the ſame friendſhip with Alvarado which he had uniformly maintained with him. Cortes, with ſeeming confidence in this promiſe, but relying principally upon the injunctions which he had given Alvarado to guard his priſoner

with the moſt ſcrupulous vigilance, ſet out from Mexico.</p>

But as he dreaded extremely the impreſſion which the enemy might make with their cavalry, he had provided againſt this danger with the foreſight and ſagacity which diſtinguiſh a great commander. Having obſerved that the Indians in the province of Chinantla uſed ſpears of extraordinary length and force, he arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſoldiers with theſe, and accuſtomed them to that deep and compact arrangement which the uſe of this formidable weapon, the beſt perhaps that ever was invented for defence, enabled them to aſſume.</p>
                  <p>WITH this ſmall but firm battalion,<note place="margin">Continues to negociate as he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</note> Cortes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards Zempoalla, of which Narvaez had taken poſſeſſion. During his march, he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated attempts towards ſome accommodation with his opponent. But Narvaez requiring that Cortes and his followers ſhould inſtantly recognize his title to be governor of New Spain, in virtue of the powers which he derived from Velaſquez; and Cortes refuſing to ſubmit to any authority which was not founded on a commiſſion from the emperor himſelf, under whoſe immediate protection he and his adherents had placed their infant colony; all theſe attempts proved fruitleſs. The intercourſe, however, which this occaſioned between the two parties, proved of no ſmall advantage to Cortes, as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining ſome of Narvaez's officers by liberal preſents, of ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others by a ſemblance of moderation, and of dazzling all by the appearance of wealth among his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:034476_0590_0FFDDA2D8280CAF8"/>
troops, moſt of his ſoldiers having converted their ſhare of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets, and other ornaments, which they diſplayed with military oſtentation. Narvaez and a little junto of his creatures excepted, all the army leaned towards an accommodation with their countrymen. This diſcovery of their inclination irritated his violent temper almoſt to madneſs. In a tranſport of rage, he ſet a price on the head of Cortes, and of his principal officers; and having learned that he was now advanced within a league of Zempoalla with his ſmall body of men, he conſidered this as an inſult which merited immediate chaſtiſement, and marched out with all his troops to offer him battle.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Attacks Narvaez in the night.</note>BUT Cortes was a leader of greater abilities and experience than, on equal ground, to fight an enemy ſo far ſuperior in number, and ſo much better appointed. Having taken his ſtation on the oppoſite bank of the river de Canoas, where he knew that he could not be attacked, be beheld the approach of the enemy without concern, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded this vain bravade. It was then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the wet ſeaſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Hackluyt, vol. iii. 467. De Laet. Deſcr. Ind.

The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Narvaez, unaccuſtomed to the hardſhips of military ſervice, murmured ſo much at being thus fruitleſsly expoſed, that, from their unſoldier-like impatience, as well as his own contempt of his adverſary, their general permitted them to retire to Zempoalla. The very circumſtance which induced them to quit the field, encouraged Cortes to form a ſcheme, by which he hoped at once to terminate the war. He obſerved, that his hardy veterans, though ſtanding under the torrents which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:034476_0591_0FFDDA2F65A45270"/>
to fall, without a ſingle tent or any ſhelter whatſoever to cover them, were ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at hardſhips which were become familiar to them, that they were ſtill freſh and alert for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He foreſaw that the enemy would naturally give themſelves up to repoſe after their fatigue, and that, judging of the conduct of others by their own effeminacy, they would deem themſelves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſecure at a ſeaſon ſo unfit for action. He reſolved, therefore, to fall upon them in the dead of night, when the ſurpriſe and terror of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected attack might more than compenſate the inferiority of his numbers. His ſoldiers, ſenſible that no reſource remained but in ſome deſperate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of courage, approved of the meaſure with ſuch warmth, that Cortes, in a military oration which he addreſſed to them before they began their march, was more ſolicitous to temper than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame their ardour. He divided them into three parties. At the head of the firſt he placed Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; entruſting this gallant officer with the moſt dangerous and important ſervice, that of ſeizing the enemy's artillery, which was planted before the principal tower of the temple, where Narvaez had fixed his head-quarters. Chriſtoval de Olid commanded the ſecond, with orders to aſſault the tower, and lay hold on the general. Cortes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conducted the third and ſmalleſt diviſion, which was to act as a body of reſerve, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the other two as there ſhould be occaſion. Having paſſed the river de Canoas, which was much ſwelled with the rains, not without difficulty, the water reaching almoſt to their chins, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in profound ſilence, without beat of drum, or ſound of any warlike inſtrument; each man armed with his ſword, his dagger, and his Chinant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan ſpear. Narvaez, remiſs in proportion to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, had poſted only two centinels to watch the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:034476_0592_0FFDDA34126C7228"/>
motions of an enemy whom he had ſuch good cauſe to dread. One of theſe was ſeized by the advanced guard of Cortes's troops, the other made his eſcape, and hurrying to the town with all the precipitation of fear and zeal, gave ſuch timely notice of the enemy's approach, that there was full leiſure to have prepared for their reception. But, through the arrogance and infatuation of Narvaez, this important interval was loſt. He imputed this alarm to the cowardice of the centinel, and treated with deriſion the idea of being attacked by forces ſo unequal to his own. The ſhouts of Cortes's ſoldiers, ruſhing on to the aſſault, convinced him at laſt, that the danger which he deſpiſed was real. The rapidity with which they advanced was ſuch, that only one cannon could be fired, before Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val's party cloſed with the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began to force their way up the ſteps of the tower. Narvaez, no leſs brave in action than preſumptuous in conduct, armed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in haſte, and by his voice and example ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his men to the combat. Olid advanced to ſuſtain his companions; and Cortes himſelf, ruſhing to the front, conducted and added new vigour to the attack. The compact order in which this ſmall body preſſed on, and the impenetrable front which they preſented with their long ſpears, bore down all oppoſition before it.<note place="margin">and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him.</note> They had now reached the gate, and were ſtruggling to burſt it open, when a ſoldier having ſet fire to the reeds with which the tower was covered, compelled Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaez to ſally out. In the firſt encounter he was wounded in the eye with a ſpear, and falling to the ground, was dragged down the ſteps, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment clapt in fetters. The cry of victory reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the troops of Cortes. Thoſe who had ſallied out with their leader now maintained the conflict feebly, and began to ſurrender. Among
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:034476_0593_0FFDDA35A0A0D438"/>
the remainder of his ſoldiers, ſtationed in two ſmaller towers of the temple, terror and confuſion prevailed. The darkneſs was ſo great, that they could not diſtinguiſh between their friends and foes. Their own artillery was pointed againſt them. Wherever they turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleaming through the obſcurity of night, which, though proceeding only from a variety of ſhining inſects, that abound in moiſt and ſultry climates, their affrighted imaginations repreſented as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bands of muſketeers advancing with kindled matches to the attack. After a ſhort reſiſtance, the ſoldiers compelled their officers to capitulate, and before morning all laid down their arms, and ſubmitted quietly to their conquerors.</p>
                  <p>THIS complete victory proved more acceptable,<note place="margin">The effects of this victory.</note> as it was gained almoſt without bloodſhed, only two ſoldiers being killed on the ſide of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men, of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe faction. Cortes treated the vanquiſhed not like enemies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered either to ſend them back directly to Cuba, or to take them into his ſervice, as partners in his fortune, on equal terms with his own ſoldiers. This latter propoſition, ſeconded by a ſeaſonable diſtribution of ſome preſents from Cortes, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral promiſes of more, opened proſpects ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the romantic expectations which had invited them to engage in this ſervice, that all, a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of Narvaez excepted, cloſed with it, and vied with each other in profeſſions of fidelity and attachment to a general, whoſe recent ſucceſs had given them ſuch a ſtriking proof of his abilities for command. Thus by a ſeries of events no leſs fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only eſcaped from perdition which ſeemed inevitable, but, when he had leaſt reaſon to expect it, was placed at the head of a thouſand Spaniards, ready to follow
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:034476_0594_0FFDDA3873D65ED8"/>
wherever he ſhould lead them. Whoever reflects upon the facility with which this victory was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, or conſiders with what ſudden and unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous tranſition the followers of Narvaez ranged themſelves under the ſtandard of his rival, will be apt to aſcribe both events as much to the intrigues as to the arms of Cortes, and cannot but ſuſpect that the ruin of Narvaez was occaſioned, no leſs by the treachery of his own followers, than by the valour of his enemy<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 242.

If, by the rapidity of his operations after he began his march, he had not brought matters to ſuch a ſpeedy iſſue, even this deciſive victory would have come too late to have ſaved his companions whom he left in Mexico. A few days after the diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Narvaez, a courier arrived with an account that the Mexicans had taken arms, and having ſeized and deſtroyed the two brigantines, which Cortes had built in order to ſecure the command of the lake, and attacked the Spaniards in their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, had killed ſeveral of them, and wounded more, had reduced to aſhes their magazine of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and carried on hoſtilities with ſuch fury, that, though Alvarado and his men defended themſelves with undaunted reſolution, they muſt either be ſoon cut off by famine, or ſink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it ſtill more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themſelves, that the long-expected oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of reſtoring their ſovereign to liberty, and of vindicating their country from the odious domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſtrangers, was at length arrived; that while
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:034476_0595_0FFDDA3B4ED7D1E8"/>
the forces of their oppreſſors were divided, and the arms of one party turned againſt the other, they might triumph with greater facility over both. Conſultations were held, and ſchemes formed with this intention. The Spaniards in Mexico, conſcious of their own feebleneſs, ſuſpected and dreaded thoſe machinations. Alvarado, though a gallant officer, poſſeſſed neither that extent of capacity, nor dignity of manners, by which Cortes had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch an aſcendant over the minds of the Mexicans, as never allowed them to form a juſt eſtimate of his weakneſs or of their own ſtrength. Alvarado knew no mode of ſupporting his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but force. Inſtead of employing addreſs to diſconcert the plans or to ſooth the ſpirits of the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their ſolemn feſtivals, when the principal perſons in the empire were dancing, according to cuſtom, in the court of the great temple; he ſeized all the avenues which led to it, and, allured partly by the rich or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that conſpiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and unſuſpicious of any danger, and maſſacred a great number, none eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſuch as made their way over the battlements of the temple. An action ſo cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage. All called aloud for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; and regardleſs of the ſafety of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, whoſe life was at the mercy of the Spaniards, or of their own danger in aſſaulting an enemy who had been ſo long the object of their terror, they committed all thoſe acts of violence of which Cortes received an account.</p>
                  <p>TO him the danger appeared ſo imminent,<note place="margin">He marches back to the capital.</note> as to admit neither of deliberation nor delay. He ſet out inſtantly with all his forces, and returned from

On entering the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can territories he found that diſaffection to the Spaniards was not confined to the capital. The principal inhabitants had deſerted the towns through which he paſſed; no perſon of note appearing to meet him with the uſual reſpect; no proviſion was made for the ſubſiſtence of his troops; and though he was permitted to advance without oppoſition, the ſolitude and ſilence which reigned in every place, and the horror with which the people avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all intercourſe with him, diſcovered a deep-rooted antipathy, that excited the moſt juſt alarm. But, implacable as the enmity of the Mexicans was, they were ſo unacquainted with the ſcience of war, that they knew not how to take the proper meaſures, either for their own ſafety or the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spaniards.

appeared to him ſo irreſiſtible, that he might aſſume an higher tone, and lay aſide the maſk of moderation, under which he had hitherto concealed his deſigns. Some Mexicans who underſtood the Spaniſh lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, heard the contemptuous words which Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes uttered, and reporting them to their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, kindled their rage anew. They were now convinced that the intentions of the general were equally bloody with thoſe of Alvarado, and that his original purpoſe in viſiting their country, had not been, as he pretended, to court the alliance of their ſovereign, but to attempt the conqueſt of his dominions. They reſumed their arms with the additional fury which this diſcovery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired,<note place="margin">The violent hoſtility of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> attacked a conſiderable body of Spaniards who were marching towards the great ſquare in which the public market was held, and compelled them to retire with ſome loſs. Emboldened by this ſucceſs, and delighted to find that their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors were not invincible, they advanced next day with extraordinary martial pomp to aſſault the Spaniards in their quarters. Their number was formidable, and their undaunted courage ſtill more ſo. Though the artillery pointed againſt their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous battalions, crowded together in narrow ſtreets, ſwept off multitudes at every diſcharge; though every blow of the Spaniſh weapons fell with mortal effect upon their naked bodies, the impetuoſity of the aſſault did not abate. Freſh men ruſhed forward to occupy the places of the ſlain, and meeting with the ſame fate, were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by others no leſs intrepid and eager for vengeance. The utmoſt effort of Cortes's abilities and experience, ſeconded by the diſciplined valour or his troops, were hardly ſufficient to defend the fortifications, that ſurrounded the poſt where the Spaniards were ſtationed, into which the enemy were more than once on the point of forcing their way.</p>

whom they had long been accuſtomed to honour, and almoſt to revere as a god, the weapons dropt from their hands, every tongue was ſilent, all bowed their heads, and many proſtrated themſelves on the ground. Montezuma addreſſed them with every argument that could mitigate their rage, or perſuade them to ceaſe from hoſtilities. When he ended his diſcourſe, a ſuller murmur of diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation run through the ranks; to this ſucceeded reproaches and threats; and the fury of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude riſing in a moment above every reſtraint of decency or reſpect, flights of arrows and volleys of ſtones poured in ſo violently upon the ramparts, that before the Spaniſh ſoldiers, appointed to cover Montezuma with their bucklers, had time to lift them in his defence, two arrows wounded the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy monarch, and the blow of a ſtone on his temple ſtruck him to the ground. On ſeeing him fall, the Mexicans were ſo much aſtoniſhed, that, with a tranſition not uncommon in popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, they paſſed in a moment from one extreme to the other, remorſe ſucceeded to inſult, and they fled with horror, as if the vengeance of Heaven were purſuing the crime which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.

But a ſudden motion of the Mexicans engaged him in new conflicts. They took poſſeſſion of a high tower in the great temple which overlooked the Spaniſh quarters, and placing there a garriſon of their principal warriors, not a Spaniard could ſtir without being expoſed to their miſſile weapons. From this poſt it was neceſſary to diſlodge them at any riſk; and Juan de Eſcobar, with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous detachment of choſen ſoldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Eſcobar, though a gallant officer, and at the head of troops accuſtomed to conquer, and who now fought under the eyes of their countrymen, was thrice repulſed. Cortes, ſenſible that not only the reputation, but the ſafety of his army depended on the ſucceſs of this aſſault, ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and ruſhed with his drawn ſword into the thickeſt of the combatants. Encouraged by the preſence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with ſuch vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the ſteps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at the top of the tower. There a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful carnage began, when two young Mexicans of high rank, obſerving Cortes as he animated his ſoldiers by his voice and example, reſolved to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of all the calamities which deſolated their country. They approached him in a ſupplicant poſture, as if they had intended to lay down their arms, and ſeizing him in a moment, hurried him towards the battlements, over which they threw themſelves

The firſt point to be determined by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and his followers, was, whether they ſhould march out openly in the face of day, when they could diſcern every danger, and ſee how to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their own motions, as well as how to reſiſt the aſſaults of the enemy; or, whether they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deavour to retire ſecretly in the night?

they made their retreat in this manner. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move, towards midnight, in three diviſions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſquez de Leon, had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded in the centre, where he placed the priſoners, among whom were a ſon and two daughters of Montezuma, together with ſeveral Mexicans of diſtinction, the artillery, the baggage, and a portable bridge of timber, intended to be laid over the breaches in the cauſeway. They marched in profound ſilence along the cauſeway which led to Tacuba, becauſe it was ſhorter than any of the reſt, and laying moſt remote from the road towards Tlaſcala and the ſea-coaſt, had been left more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by the Mexicans. They reached the firſt breach in it without moleſtation, hoping that their retreat was undiſcovered.</p>
                  <p>BUT the Mexicans, unperceived,<note place="margin">Attacked by the Mexicans.</note> had not only watched all their motions with attention, but had made proper diſpoſitions for a moſt formidable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack. While the Spaniards were intent upon placing their bridge in the breach, and occupied in conducting their horſes and artillery along it, they were ſuddenly alarmed with the tremendous ſound of warlike inſtruments, and a general ſhout from an innumerable multitude of enemies; the lake was covered with canoes; flights of arrows, and ſhowers of ſtones poured in upon them from every quarter; the Mexicans ruſhing forward to the charge with fearleſs impetuoſity, as if they hoped in that moment to be avenged for all their wrongs. Unfortunately the wooden bridge, by the weight of the artillery, was wedged ſo faſt into the ſtones and mud, that it was impoſſible to remove it.

All Mexico were now in arms, and ſo eager were the people on the deſtruction of their oppreſſors, that they who were not near enough to annoy them in perſon, impatient of the delay, preſſed forward with ſuch ardour, as drove on their countrymen in the front with irreſiſtible violence. Freſh warriors inſtantly filled the place of ſuch as fell. The Spaniards, weary with ſlaughter, and unable to ſuſtain the weight of the torrent that poured in upon them, began to give way. In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the confuſion was univerſal; horſe and foot, officers and ſoldiers, friends and enemies, were mingled together; and while all fought, and many fell, they could hardly diſtinguiſh from what hand the blow came.</p>

He directed his march towards the riſing ground, and having fortunately diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a temple ſituated on an eminence, took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it. There he found not only the ſhelter for which he wiſhed, but, what was no leſs wanted, ſome proviſions to refreſh his men; and though the enemy did not intermit their attacks through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the day, they were with leſs difficulty prevented from making any impreſſion. During this time Cortes was engaged in deep conſultation with his officers, concerning the route which they ought to take in their retreat. They were now on the weſt ſide of the lake. Tlaſcala, the only place where they could hope for a friendly reception, lay about ſixty-four miles to the eaſt of Mexico<note n="*" place="bottom">Ville Segnor Teatro Americanos, lib. ii. c. 11.</note>; ſo that they were obliged to go round the north end of the lake before they could fall into the road which led thither. A Tlaſcalan ſoldier undertook to be their guide, and conducted them through a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in ſome places marſhy, in other mountainous, in all ill-cultivated and thinly peopled. They marched for ſix days with little reſpite, and under continual alarms, numerous bodies of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans hovering around them, ſometimes haraſſing them at a diſtance with their miſſile weapons, and ſometimes attacking them cloſely in front, in rear, in flank, with great boldneſs, as they now knew that they were not invincible. Nor were the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and danger of thoſe inceſſant conflicts the worſt evils to which they were expoſed. As the barren country through which they paſſed afforded hardly any proviſions, they were reduced to feed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:034476_0607_0FFDDA5B8C30FCA8"/>
on berries, roots, and the ſtalks of green maize; and at the very time that famine was depreſſing their ſpirits and waſting their ſtrength, their ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required the moſt vigorous and unremitting exertions of courage and activity. Amidſt thoſe complicated diſtreſſes, one circumſtance ſupported and animated the Spaniards. Their commander ſuſtained this ſad reverſe of fortune with unſhaken magnanimity. His preſence of mind never forſook him; his ſagacity foreſaw every event, and his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance provided for it. He was foremoſt in every danger, and endured every hardſhip with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. The difficulties with which he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded ſeemed to call forth new talents; and his ſoldiers, though deſpairing themſelves, continued to follow him with encreaſing confidence in his abilities.</p>
                  <p>ON the ſixth day they arrived near to Otumba,<note place="margin">Battle of Otumba.</note> not far from the road between Mexico and Tlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cala. Early next morning they began to advance towards it, flying parties of the enemy ſtill hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their rear; and, amidſt the inſolts with which they accompanied their hoſtilities, Marina remarked that they often exclaimed with exultation, "Go on, robbers; go to the place where you ſhall quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes." The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, until they reached the ſummt of an eminence before them. There a ſpacious valley opened to their view, covered with a vaſt army, extending as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they haraſſed the Spaniards in their retreat, had aſſembled their principal force on the other ſide of the lake; and marching along the road which led directly to Tlaſcala, poſted it in the plain of Otum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, through which they knew Cortes muſt paſs. At the ſight of this incredible multitude, which
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:034476_0608_0FFDDB55AFC05998"/>
they could ſurvey at once from the riſing ground, the Spaniards were aſtoniſhed, and even the boldeſt began to deſpair. But Cortes, without allowing leiſure for their fears to acquire ſtrength by reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after warning them briefly that no alternative now remained but to conquer or to die, led them inſtantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited their approach with unuſual fortitude. Such, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was the ſuperiority of the Spaniſh diſcipline and arms, that the impreſſion of this ſmall body was irreſiſtible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and diſperſed the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous battalions. But while theſe gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and the Spaniards, though ſucceſsful in every attack, were ready to ſink under thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated efforts, without ſeeing any end of their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the great ſtandard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he aſſembled a few of his braveſt officers, whoſe horſes were ſtill capable of ſervice, and placing himſelf at their head, puſhed forward towards the ſtandard with an impetuoſity which bore down every thing before it. A choſen body of nobles, who guarded the ſtandard, made ſome reſiſtance, but were ſoon broken. Cortes, with a ſtroke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of the Spaniſh officers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the Imperial ſtandard. The moment that their leader fell, and the ſtandard, towards which all directed their eyes, diſappeared, an univerſal panic ſtruck the Mexicans, and, as if the bond which held them together had been diſſolved, every enſign was lowered, each ſoldier threw away

The Spaniards, unable to purſue them far, returned to collect the ſpoils of the field, which were ſo valuable, as to be ſome compenſation for the wealth which they had loſt in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were moſt of their principal warriors, dreſſed out in their richeſt ornaments, as if they had been marching to aſſured victory.<note place="margin">July 8.</note> Next day, to their great joy, they entered the Tlaſcalan territories.<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. p. 219.

the effects of the Mexican enmity. A conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able detachment, which was marching from Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poalla towards the capital, had been cut off by the people of Tepeaca. A ſmaller party, returning from Tlaſcala to Vera Cruz, with the ſhare of the Mexican gold allotted to the garriſon, had been ſurpriſed and deſtroyed in the mountains. At a juncture when the life of every Spaniard was of importance, ſuch loſſes were deeply felt. The ſchemes which Cortes was meditating rendered them peculiarly afflictive to him. While his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and even many of his own followers, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the diſaſters which had befallen him as fatal to the progreſs of his arms, and imagined that nothing now remained but ſpeedily to abandon a country which he had invaded with unequal force, his mind, as eminent for perſeverance as for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, was ſtill bent on accompliſhing his original purpoſe, of ſubjecting the Mexican empire to the crown of Caſtile. Severe and unexpected as the check was which he had received, it did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him a ſufficient reaſon for relinquiſhing the conqueſts which he had already made, or againſt reſuming his operations with better hopes of ſucceſs. The colony at Vera Cruz was not only ſafe, but had remained unmoleſted. The people of Zempoalla and the adjacent diſtricts had diſcovered no ſymptoms of defection. The Tlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calans continued firm to their alliance. On their martial ſpirit, eaſily rouſed to arms, and inflamed with implacable hatred of the Mexicans, Cortes depended for powerful aid. He had ſtill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a body of Spaniards, equal in number to that with which he had opened his way into the centre of the empire, and had taken poſſeſſion of the capital; ſo that with the benefit of greater experience, as well as more perfect knowledge of the country, he did not deſpair of quickly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering

They unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly made their attempt on the northern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where the country was poor, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fierce and warlike; and, after a cruel ſucceſſion of diſaſters, famine compelled them to venture into Vera Cruz, and caſt themſelves upon the mercy of their countrymen.<note place="margin">October 28.</note> Their fidelity was not proof againſt the ſplendid hopes and promiſes which had ſeduced other adventurers, and as if the ſpirit of revolt had been contagious in New Spain, they likewiſe abandoned the maſter whom they were bound to ſerve, and inliſted under Cortes<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes.

A ſhip arrived from Spain, freighted by ſome private merchants with military ſtores, in hopes of a profitable market in a country, the fame of whoſe opulence begun to ſpread over Europe. Cortes eagerly purchaſed a cargo which to him was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and the crew following the general exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, joined him at Tlaſcala <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. c. 136.</note>.</p>
                  <p>FROM thoſe various quarters, the army of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes was augmented with an hundred and eighty men, and twenty horſes, a reinforcement too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable to produce any conſequence which would entitle it to have been mentioned in the hiſtory of other parts of the globe.

becauſe they were ſufficient to decide with reſpect to the fate of kingdoms. Nor is it the leaſt remarkable inſtance of the ſingular felicity conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in many paſſages of Cortes's ſtory, that the two perſons chiefly inſtrumental in furniſhing him with thoſe ſeaſonable ſupplies, ſhould be an avowed enemy who aimed at his deſtruction, and an envious rival who wiſhed to ſupplant him.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt effect of the junction with his new fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers was to enable him to diſmiſs ſuch of Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaez's ſoldiers as remained with reluctance in his ſervice.

At the head of theſe, accompanied by ten thouſand Tlaſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans and other friendly Indians, Cortes began his march towards Mexico, on the twenty-eighth of December, ſix months after his diſaſtrous retreat from that city<note n="†" place="bottom">Relat. 256, A.

                  <p>NOR did he advance to attack an enemy unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive him.<note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Mexicans for their defence.</note> Upon the death of Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma, the Mexican chiefs, in whom the right of electing the emperor was veſted, had inſtantly raiſed his brother Quetlavaca to the throne. His avowed and inveterate enmity to the Spaniards would have been ſufficient to gain their ſuffrages, although he had been leſs diſtinguiſhed for courage and capacity. He had an immediate opportunity of ſhewing that he was worthy of their choice, by conducting, in perſon, thoſe fierce attacks which compelled the Spaniards to abandon his capital; and as ſoon as their retreat afforded him any reſpite from action, he took meaſures for preventing their return to Mexico, with prudence equal to the ſpirit

which he had diſplayed in driving them out of it. As from the vicinity of Tlaſcala, he could not be unacquainted with the motions and intentions of Cortes, he obſerved the ſtorm that was gathering, and began early to provide againſt it. He repaired what the Spaniards had ruined in the city, and ſtrengthened it with ſuch new fortifications as the ſkill of his ſubjects was capable of erecting. Beſide filling his magazines with the uſual weapons of war, he gave directions to make long ſpears headed with the ſwords and daggers taken from the Spaniards, in order to annoy the cavalry.

But what he laboured with the greateſt earneſtneſs was, to deprive the Spaniards of the advantages which they derived from the friendſhip of the Tlaſcalans, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to perſuade that people to renounce all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with men, who were not only avowed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the gods whom they worſhipped, but who would not fail at laſt to ſubject them to the ſame yoke, which they were now inconſiderately lending their aid to impoſe upon others.

to turn his arms directly againſt the capital. To have attacked, at this period, a city ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſo well prepared for defence, and in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch peculiar ſtrength, muſt have expoſed his troops to inevitable deſtruction. Three months elapſed before the materials for the brigantines were finiſhed, and before he heard my thing with reſpect to the ſucceſs of the officer whom he had ſent to Hiſpaniola. This, however, was not a ſeaſon of inaction to Cortes. He attacked ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſeveral of the towns ſituated around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was exerted to obſtruct his operations, he either compelled them to ſubmit to the Spaniſh crown, or reduced them to ruins. The inhabitants of other towns he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conciliate by more gentle means, and though he could not hold any intercourſe with them but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the diſadvantage of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired ſuch thorough knowledge of the ſtate of the country, as well as of the diſpoſitions of the people, that he conducted his negociations and intrigues with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing dexterity and ſucceſs. Moſt of the cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capitals of ſmall independent ſtates; and ſome of them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire, ſtill retained the remembrance of their ancient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and bore with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new maſters. Cortes having early obſerved ſymptoms of their diſaffection, availed himſelf of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. By offering, with confidence, to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promiſes of more indulgent treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they would unite with him againſt their oppreſſors, he prevailed on the people of ſeveral conſiderable diſtricts, not only to acknowledge the

king of Caſtile as their ſovereign, but to ſupply the Spaniſh camp with proviſions, and to ſtrengthen his army with auxiliary troops. Guatimozin, on the firſt appearance of defection among his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, exerted himſelf with vigour to prevent or to puniſh their revolt; but in ſpite of his efforts, the ſpirit continued to ſpread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies, and with deep concern he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held Cortes arming againſt his empire thoſe very hands which ought to have been active in its defence; and ready to advance againſt the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal at the head of a numerous body of his own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 256—260.

                  <p>WHILE, by thoſe various methods, Cortes was gradually circumſcribing the Mexican power in ſuch a manner that his proſpect of overturning it ſeemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his ſchemes were well nigh defeated, by a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy no leſs unexpected than dangerous. The ſoldiers of Narvaez had never united perfectly with the original companions of Cortes; nor did they enter into his meaſures with the ſame cordial zeal. Upon every occaſion that required any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary effort of courage or of patience, their ſpirits were apt to ſink; and now, on a near view of what they had to encounter, in attempting to reduce a city ſo inacceſſible as Mexico, and defended by a numerous army, the reſolution even of thoſe among them who had adhered to Cortes when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by their aſſociates, began to fail. Their fears led them to preſumptuous and unſoldier-like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions concerning the propriety of their general's meaſures, and the improbability of their ſucceſs. From theſe they proceeded to cenſure and invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and at laſt began to deliberate how they
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:034476_0620_0FFDDA794EB4D8C8"/>
might provide for their own ſafety, of which they deemed their commander to be totally negligent. Antonio Villefagna, a private ſoldier, but bold, intriguing, and ſtrongly attached to Velaſquez, art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fomented this growing ſpirit of diſaffection. His quarters became the rendezvous of the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, where, after many conſultations, they could diſcover no method of checking Cortes in his career, but by aſſaſſinating him and his moſt conſiderable officers, and conferring the command upon ſome perſon who would relinquiſh his wild plans, and adopt meaſures more conſiſtent with the general ſecurity. Deſpair inſpired them with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The hour for perpetrating the crime, the perſons whom they deſtined as victims, the officers to ſucceed them in command, were all named; and the conſpirators ſigned an aſſociation, by which they bound themſelves with moſt ſolemn oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening before the appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient followers, who had been ſeduced into the conſpiracy, touched with compunction at the imminent danger of a man whom he had long been accuſtomed to revere, or ſtruck with horror at his own treachery, went pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to his general, and revealed to him all that he knew. Cortes, though deeply alarmed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at once what conduct was proper in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo critical. He repaired inſtantly to Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagna's quarters, accompanied by ſome of his moſt truſty officers. The aſtoniſhment and confuſion of the man at this unexpected viſit anticipated the confeſſion of his guilt. Cortes, while his attendants ſeized the traitor, ſnatched from his boſom a paper containing the aſſociation, ſigned by the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Impatient to know how far the defection extended, he retired to read it, and found there names which filled him with ſurpriſe and ſorrow. But, aware how dangerous a ſtrict ſcrutiny might
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:034476_0621_0FFDDA7C0F029338"/>
prove at ſuch a juncture, he confined his judicial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries to Villefagna alone. As the proofs of his guilt were manifeſt, he was condemned after a ſhort trial,<note place="margin">1521.</note> and next morning he was ſeen hanging before the door of the houſe in which he had lodged. Cortes called his troops together, and having explained to them the atrocious purpoſe of the conſpirators, as well as the juſtice of the puniſhment inflicted on Villefagna, he added, with an appearance of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, that he was entirely ignorant with reſpect to all the circumſtances of this dark tranſaction, as the traitor, when arreſted, had ſuddenly torn and ſwallowed a paper which probably contained an account of it, and under the ſevereſt tortures poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſuch conſtancy as to conceal the names of his accomplices. This artful declaration reſtored tranquillity to many a breaſt that was throbbing, while he ſpoke, with conſciouſneſs of guilt and dread of detection; and by this prudent modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Cortes had the advantage of having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and of being able to obſerve ſuch of his followers as were diſaffected; while they, flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves that their paſt crime was unknown, endeavoured to avert any ſuſpicion of it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling their activity and zeal in his ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 283.

Fortunately, a proper occaſion for this occurred without his ſeeming to court it. He received intelligence that the materials for building the brigantines were at length completely finiſhed, and waited only for a body of Spaniards to conduct them to Tezeuco. The command of this convoy, conſiſting of two hundred foot ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,

fifteen horſemen, and two field-pieces, he gave to Sandoval, who, by the vigilance, activity, and courage which he manifeſted on every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the eſtimation of his fellow-ſoldiers. The ſervice was no leſs ſingular than important; the beams, the planks, the maſts, the cordage, the ſails, the iron-work, and all the infinite variety of articles requiſite for the conſtruction of thirteen brigantines, were to be carried ſixty miles over land, through a mountainous country, by people who were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the miniſtry of domeſtic animals, or the aid of machines to facilitate any work of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. The Tlaſcalans furniſhed eight thouſand <hi>Tamenes,</hi> an inferior order of men deſtined for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile taſks, to carry the materials on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and appointed fifteen thouſand warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the diſpoſition for their progreſs with great propriety, placing the <hi>Tamenes</hi> in the centre, one body of warriors in the front, another in the rear, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable parties to cover the flanks. To each of theſe he joined ſome Spaniards, not only to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them in danger, but to accuſtom them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and ſubordination. A body ſo numerous, and ſo much encumbered, advanced leiſurely, but in excellent order; and in ſome places, where it was confined by the woods or mountains, the line of march extended above ſix miles. Parties of Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but perceiving no proſpect of ſucceſs in attacking an enemy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not venture to moleſt him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting ſafely to Tezeuco, a convoy on which all the future operations of his countrymen depended <note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 260.

Cortes formed the brigantines in three diviſions, appointing one to cover each of

the ſtations from which an attack was to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt the city, with orders to ſecond the operations of the officer who commanded there. From all the three ſtations he puſhed on the attack againſt the city with equal vigour; but in a manner ſo very different from the conduct of ſieges in regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar war, that he himſelf ſeems afraid it would appear no leſs improper than ſingular, to perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with his ſituation<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 270, F.</note>. Each morning his troops aſſaulted the barricades which the enemy had erected on the cauſeways, forced their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtaining ſome deciſive advantage, which might force the enemy to ſurrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the obſtinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their former quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in ſome meaſure, continually renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Mexicans repairing in the night what the Spaniards had deſtroyed through the day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the poſts from which they had driven them. But neceſſity preſcribed this ſlow and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward mode of operation. The number of his troops were ſo ſmall, that Cortes durſt not, with a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgment in a city where he might be ſurrounded and annoyed by ſuch a multitude of enemies. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what he had already ſuffered by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into ſuch a dangerous ſituation, was ſtill freſh in his mind. The Spaniards, exhauſted with fatigue, were unable to guard the various poſts which they daily gained; and though their camp was filled
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:034476_0627_0FFDDA8BDD6C70B0"/>
with Indian auxiliaries, they durſt not devolve this charge upon them, becauſe they were ſo little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to diſcipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance. Beſides this, Cortes was extremely ſolicitous to preſerve the city as much as poſſible from being deſtroyed, both becauſe he deſtined it to be the capital of his conqueſts, and wiſhed that it might remain as a monument of his glory. From all theſe conſiderations, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered obſtinately, for a month after the ſiege was opened, to the ſyſtem which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence, diſplayed valour which was hardly inferior to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on water, by night and by day, one furious conflict ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and all were ready to ſink under the toils of unintermitting ſervice, which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the ſeaſon, the periodical rains being now ſet in with their uſual violence<note n="*" place="bottom">B.

ſpite of the multitude and ferocity of their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity of his progreſs, did not forget that he might ſtill find it neceſſary to retreat; and in order to ſecure it, appointed Julien de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the troops which he had received from Hiſpaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the cauſeway as the main body advanced. That offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while his companions were in the heat of action and the career of victory, neglected the important charge committed to him, and hurried on, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, to mingle with the combatants.

Finding all his endeavours to renew the combat fruitleſs, his next care was to ſave ſome of thoſe who had thrown themſelves into the water; but while thus employed, with more attention to their ſituation than to his own, ſix Mexican captains ſuddenly laid hold of him, and were hurrying him off in triumph; and though two of his officers reſcued him at the expence of their own lives, he received ſeveral dangerous wounds before he could break looſe.<note place="margin">with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſs.</note> Above ſixty Spaniards periſhed in the rout; and what rendered the diſaſter more afflicting, forty of theſe fell alive into the hands of an enemy never known to ſhew mercy to a captive<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. p. 273.

At length all the three diviſions penetrated into the great ſquare in the centre of the city, and made a ſecure lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there. Three fourths of the city were now reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo cloſely preſſed, that it could not long withſtand aſſailants, who attacked it from their new ſtation with ſuperior advantage, and more aſſured expectation of ſucceſs. The Mexican nobles, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to ſave the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where reſiſtance was now vain, that he might rouſe the more diſtant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more ſucceſsful ſtruggle with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of this meaſure, they endeavoured to amuſe Cortes with overtures of ſubmiſſion, that, while his attention was employed in adjuſting the articles of pacification, Guatimozin might eſcape unperceived. But they made this attempt upon a leader of greater ſagacity and diſcernment than to be deceived by their arts.

This was the original and favourite project of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus, and Magellan founded his hopes of ſucceſs on the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by many obſervations, the reſult of his own naval ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as well as that of his countrymen in their intercourſe with the Eaſt. But though the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe monarchs had the merit of having firſt awakened and encouraged the ſpirit of diſcovery in that age, it was their deſtiny, in the courſe of a few years, to reject two grand ſchemes for this purpoſe, the execution of which would have been attended with a great acceſſion of glory to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and of power to their kingdom. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſome ill-founded prejudice againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan, or of ſome dark intrigue which contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary hiſtorians have not explained, Emanuel would neither beſtow the recompence which he claimed, nor approve of the ſcheme which he propoſed; and diſmiſſed him with a diſdainful coldneſs intolerable to a man conſcious of what he deſerved, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the ſanguine hopes of ſucceſs peculiar to thoſe who are capable of forming or conducting new and great undertakings.

monarch againſt whom he was exaſperated in the moſt tender part. In order to eſtabliſh the juſtneſs of his theory, he produced the ſame arguments which he had employed at Liſbon; acknowledging, at the ſame time, that the undertaking was both arduous and expenſive, as it could not be attempted but with a ſquadron of conſiderable force, and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualled for at leaſt two years. Fortunately, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a miniſter who was not apt to be deterred, either by the boldneſs of a deſign, or the expence of carrying it into execution.

                  <p>THE Spaniards were not ſatisfied with the glory of having firſt encompaſſed the earth; they expected to derive great commercial advantages from this new and boldeſt effort of their maritime ſkill. The men of ſcience among them contended, that the ſpice iſlands, and ſeveral of the richeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in the Eaſt, were ſo ſituated as to belong of right to the crown of Caſtile, in conſequence of the partition made by Alexander VI. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, without attending to this diſcuſſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged early in that lucrative and alluring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which was now opened to them. The Portugueſe, alarmed at the intruſion of ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable rivals, remonſtrated and negociated in Europe, while in Aſia they obſtructed the trade of the Spaniards by force of arms. Charles V. not ſufficiently inſtructed with reſpect to the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this valuable branch of commerce, or diſtracted by the multiplicity of his ſchemes and operations, did not afford his ſubjects proper pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. At laſt, the low ſtate of his finances, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by the efforts of his arms in every part of Europe, together with the dread of adding a new war with Portugal to thoſe in which he was already engaged, induced him to make over his claim of the Moluccas to the Portugueſe for three hundred and fifty thouſand ducats. He reſerved, however, to the crown of Caſtile the right of reviving its pretentions on repayment of that ſum; but other objects engroſſed his attention and that of his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and Spain was finally excluded from a

                  <p>THOUGH the trade with the Moluccas was relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, the voyage of Magellan was followed by commercial effects of great moment to Spain. Philip II. in the year one thouſand five hundred and ſixty four, reduce thoſe iſlands which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Eaſtern Ocean to ſubjection, and eſtabliſhed ſettlements there; between which and the kingdom of New Spain, a regular intercourſe, the nature of which ſhall be explained in its proper place, is ſtill carried on.

                     <note place="margin">An order to ſuperſede Cortes,</note>AT the time that Cortes was acquiring ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive territories for his native country, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the way for future conqueſts, it was his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular fate not only to be deſtitute of any commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or authority from the ſovereign whom he was ſerving with ſuch ſucceſsful zeal, but to be regarded as an undutiful and ſeditious ſubject. By the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Fonſeca, biſhop of Burgos, his conduct in aſſuming the government of New Spain was declared to be an irregular uſurpation, in contempt of the royal authority; and Chriſtoval de Tapia received a commiſſion, impowering him to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede Cortes, to ſeize his perſon, to confiſcate his effects, to make a ſtrict ſcrutiny into his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to tranſmit the reſult of all the enquiries carried on in New Spain to the council of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of which the biſhop of Burgos was preſident. A few weeks after the reduction of Mexico, Tapia landed at Vera Cruz with the royal mandate to ſtrip its conqueror of his power, and to treat him as a criminal. But Fonſeca had choſen a very improper inſtrument to wreak his vengeance on Cortes. Tapia had neither the reputation nor the

He determined to eſtabliſh the ſeat of government in its ancient ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to raiſe Mexico again from its ruins; and having conceived high ideas concerning the future grandeur of the ſtate of which he was laying the foundation, he began to rebuild its capital on a plan which hath gradually formed the moſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent city in the New World. At the ſame time, he employed ſkilful perſons to ſearch for mines in different parts of the country, and opened ſome which were found to be richer than any which the Spaniards had hitherto diſcovered in America. He detached his principal officers into the remote pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,

and encouraged them to ſettle there, not only by beſtowing upon them large tracts of land, but by granting them the ſame dominion over the Indians, and the ſame right to their ſervice, which the Spaniards had aſſumed in the iſlands.</p>
                  <p>IT was not, however,<note place="margin">Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Mexicans, and cruelty of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</note> without difficulty that the Mexican empire could be entirely reduced into the form of a Spaniſh colony. Enraged and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered deſperate by oppreſſion, the natives often forgot the ſuperiority of their enemies, and ran to arms in defence of their liberties. In every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, however, the European valour and diſcipline prevailed. But fatally for the honour of their country, the Spaniards ſullied the glory redound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from theſe repeated victories by their mode of treating the vanquiſhed people. After taking Guatimozin, and becoming maſters of his capital, they ſuppoſed that the king of Caſtile entered on poſſeſſion of all the rights of the captive monarch, and affected to conſider every effort of the Mexicans to aſſert their own independence, as the rebellion of vaſſals againſt their ſovereign, or the mutiny of ſlaves againſt their maſter. Under the ſanction of thoſe ill-founded maxims, they violated every right that ſhould be held ſacred between hoſtile nations. After each inſurrection, they reduced the common people in the provinces which they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, to the moſt humiliating of all conditions, that of perſonal ſervitude. Their chiefs, ſuppoſed to be more criminal, were puniſhed with greater ſeverity, and put to death in the moſt ignominious or the moſt excruciating mode, that the inſolence or the cruelty of their conquerors could deviſe. In almoſt every diſtrict of the Mexican empire, the progreſs of the Spaniſh arms is marked with blood, and with deeds ſo atrocious, as diſgrace the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing valour that conducted them to ſucceſs.

It was the act of Sandoval, an officer whoſe name is entitled to the ſecond rank in the annals of New Spain, and executed after a ſolemn conſultation with Cortes; and to complete the horror of the ſcene, the children and relations of the wretched victims were aſſembled, and compelled to be ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of their dying agonies<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. 291, C.

It ſeems hardly poſſible to exceed in horror this dreadful example of ſeverity; but it was followed by another, which affected the Mexicans ſtill more ſenſibly, as it gave them a moſt feeling proof of their own degradation, and of the ſmall regard which their haughty maſters retained for the ancient dignity and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of their ſtate. On a ſlight ſuſpicion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by very imperfect evidence, that Guati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mozin had formed a ſcheme to ſhake off the yoke, and to excite his former ſubjects to take arms, Cortes, without the formality of a trial, ordered the unhappy monarch, together with the caziques of Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two perſons of greateſt eminence in the empire, to be hanged; and the Mexicans, with aſtoniſhment and horror, beheld this diſgraceful puniſhment inflicted upon perſons, to whom they were accuſtomed to look up with reverence, hardly inferior to that which they paid to the gods themſelves<note n="†" place="bottom">Gomara Cron. c. 170.

Though Cortes earneſtly ſolicited to be reinſtated in the government of New Spain, Charles, too ſagacious to commit ſuch an important charge to a man whom he had once ſuſpected, peremptorily refuſed to inveſt him again with powers which he might find it impoſible to controul. Cortes, though dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico with diminiſhed authority. The military department, with powers to attempt new diſcoveries, was left in his hands; but the ſupreme direction of civil affairs was placed in a board, called <hi>The Audience of New Spain.</hi> At a ſubſequent period, when, upon the increaſe of the colony, the exertion of authority more united and extenſive became neceſſary, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio de Mendoza, a nobleman of high rank, was ſent thither as <hi>Viceroy,</hi> to take the government into his hands.</p>
                  <p>THIS diviſion of power in New Spain, proved,<note place="margin">New ſchemes of Cortes.</note> as was unavoidable, the ſource of perpetual diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which imbittered the life of Cortes, and thwarted all his ſchemes.

In an age when the ſpirit of adventure was ſo ardent and vigorous, that large fortunes were waſted, and the moſt alarming dangers braved, in purſuit of diſcoveries merely poſſible, the fainteſt ray of hope was followed with an eager expectation, and the ſlighteſt information was ſufficient to inſpire ſuch perfect confidence, as conducted men to the moſt arduous undertakings<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXIX.</note>.</p>

As the excurſions of thoſe adventurers did not extend beyond the limits of the province to which the Spaniards have given the name of Tierra Firme, a mountainous region covered with woods, thinly inhabited, and extremely unhealthy, they returned with diſmal accounts concerning the diſtreſſes to which they had been expoſed, and the unpromiſing aſpect of the places which they had viſited. Damped by theſe tidings, the rage for diſcovery in that direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abated; and it became the general opinion, that Balboa had founded viſionary hopes, on the tale of an ignorant Indian, ill underſtood, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to deceive.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Undertaken by Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque. 1524.</note>BUT there were three perſons ſettled in Panama, on whom the circumſtances which deterred others made ſo little impreſſion, that at the very moment when all conſidered Balboa's expectations of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering a rich country, by ſteering towards the eaſt, as chimerical, they reſolved to attempt the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſcheme. The names of thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary men were Franciſco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando Luque. Pizarro was the natural ſon of a gentleman of an honourable family by a very low woman, and according to the cruel fate which often attends the offspring of unlawful love, had been ſo totally neglected in his youth by the author of his birth, that he ſeems to have deſtined him never to riſe beyond the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his mother. In conſequence of this unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous idea, he ſet him, when bordering on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to keep hogs. But the aſpiring mind of young Pizarro diſdaining that ignoble occupation, he abruptly abandoned his charge, enliſted as a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and, after ſerving ſome years in Italy, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked for America, which, by opening ſuch a

With a temper of mind no leſs daring than the conſtitution of his body was robuſt, he was foremoſt in every danger, patient under the greateſt hardſhips, and unſubdued by any fatigue. Though ſo illiterate that he could not even read, he was ſoon conſidered as a man formed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Every operation committed to his conduct proved ſucceſsful, as, by a happy but rare conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he united perſeverance with ardour, and was as cautious in executing, as he was bold in forming his plans. By engaging early in active life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſource but his own talents and induſtry, and by depending on himſelf alone in his ſtruggles to emerge from obſcurity, he acquired ſuch a thorough knowledge of affairs, and of men, that he was fitted to aſſume a ſuperior part in conducting the former, and in governing the latter<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 1 &amp; 2, paſſim. dec. 4. lib. vi. c. 107.

                  <p>ALMAGRO had as little to boaſt of his deſcent as Pizarro. The one was a baſtard, the other a found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

But in Almagro theſe virtues were accompanied with the openneſs, generoſity, and candour, natural to men whoſe profeſſion is arms; in Pizarro, they were united with the addreſs, the craft, and the diſſimulation of a politician, with the art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing his own purpoſes, and with ſagacity to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into thoſe of other men.</p>

Their confederacy for this purpoſe was authoriſed by Pedrarias, the governor of Panama. Each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to employ his whole fortune in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Pizarro, the leaſt wealthy of the three, as he could not throw ſo large a ſum as his aſſociates into the common ſtock, engaged to take the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of greateſt fatigue and danger, and to command in perſon the armament which was to go firſt upon diſcovery.

As the ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm uniformly accompanied that of adventure in the New World, and by that ſtrange union both acquired an increaſe of force, this confederacy, formed by ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the moſt ſolemn act of religion. Luque celebrated maſs, divided a conſecrated hoſt into three, and reſerving one part to himſelf, gave the other two to his aſſociates, of which they partook; and thus, in the name of the Prince of Peace, ratified a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of which plunder and bloodſhed were the objects<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. vi. c. 13.

But in that age, ſo little were the Spaniards acquainted with the peculiarities of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in America,<note place="margin">Nov. 14.</note> that the time which Pizarro choſe for his departure was the moſt improper in the whole year; the periodical winds, which were then ſet in, being directly adverſe to the courſe which he purpoſed to ſteer<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 4. lib. ii. c. 8. Xerez, p. 179.</note>. After beating about for ſeventy days, with much danger and inceſſant fatigue, Pizarro's progreſs towards the ſouth-eaſt was not greater than what a ſkilful navigator will now make in as many hours. He touched at ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places on the coaſt of Tierra Firme, but found every where the ſame uninviting country which former adventures had deſcribed; the low grounds converted into ſwamps by an overflowing of rivers; the higher, covered with impervious woods; few inhabitants, and thoſe fierce and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.

Feeble as this reinforcement was, Almagro took the command of it, and having joined Pizarro, they did not he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate about reſuming their operations. After a long ſeries of diſaſters and diſappointments, not inferior to thoſe which they had already experienced, part of the armament reached the Bay of St. Matthew, on the coaſt of Quito, and landed at Tacamez, to the ſouth of the river of Emeraulds, they beheld a country more champaign and fertile than any they had yet diſcovered in the Southern Ocean, the natives clad in garments of woollen or cotton ſtuff, and adorned with ſeveral trinkets of gold and ſilver.</p>

They retired to the ſmall iſland of Gallo, where Pizarro remained with part of the troops, and his aſſociate returned to Panama, in hopes of bringing ſuch a reinforcement as might enable them to take poſſeſſion of the opulent territories, whoſe exiſtence ſeemed to be no longer doubtful <note n="*" place="bottom">Xerez, 181.

                  <p>BUT ſome of the adventurers, leſs enterpriſing,<note place="margin">Pizarro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called by the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama.</note> or leſs hardy than their leaders, having ſecretly conveyed lamentable accounts of their ſufferings and loſſes to their friends at Panama, Almagro met with an unfavourable reception from Pedro de los Rios, who had ſucceeded Pedradrias in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that ſettlement. After weighing the matter with that cold oeconomical prudence which appears the firſt of all virtues to perſons whoſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited faculties are incapable of conceiving or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting great deſigns, he concluded an expedition, attended with ſuch certain waſte of men, to be ſo detrimental to an infant and feeble colony, that he not only prohibited the raiſing of new levies, but diſpatched a veſſel to bring home Pizarro and his companions from the iſland of Gallo. Almagro and Luque, though deeply affected with thoſe meaſures, which they could not prevent, and durſt not oppoſe, found means of communicating their ſentiments privately to Pizarro, and exhorted him not to relinquiſh an enterpriſe that was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their hopes, and the only means of re-eſtabliſhing their reputation and fortune, which

But the incredible calamities to which they had been expoſed were ſtill ſo recent in their memories, and the thoughts of reviſiting their families and friends after a long abſence, ruſhed with ſuch joy into their minds, that when Pizarro drew a line upon the ſand with his ſword, permitting ſuch as wiſhed to return home to paſs over it, only thirteen of all the daring veterans in his ſervice had reſolution to remain with their commander.<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. x. c. 2, 3.

This, as it was farther remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the coaſt than Galloa, and uninhabited, they conſidered as a more ſecure retreat, where, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted, they might wait for ſupplies from Panama, which they truſted that the activity of their aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates would be able to procure. Almagro and Luque were not inattentive or cold ſolicitors, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant importunity was ſeconded by the general voice of the colony, which exclaimed loudly againſt the infamy of expoſing brave men, engaged in the public ſervice, and chargeable with no error but what flowed from an exceſs of zeal and courage, to periſh like the moſt odious criminals in a deſert iſland. Overcome by thoſe entreaties and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations, the governor at laſt conſented to ſend

a ſmall veſſel to their relief. But that he might not ſeem to encourage Pizarro to any new enterpriſe, he would not permit one landman to embark on board of it.</p>
                  <p>BY this time,<note place="margin">Hardſhips he endured.</note> Pizarro and his companions had remained five months in an iſland, infamous for the moſt unhealthy climate in that region of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XXXI.</note>.

But, on the arrival of the veſſel from Panama, they were tranſported with ſuch joy, that all their ſufferings were forgotten. Their hopes revived, and, with a rapid tranſition, not unnatural among men accuſtomed by their mode of life to ſudden viciſſitudes of fortune, high confidence ſucceeding to extreme dejection, Pizarro eaſily induced not only his own followers, but the crew of the veſſel from Panama, to reſume his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſcheme with freſh ardour. Inſtead of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Panama, they ſtood towards the ſouth-eaſt, and more fortunate in this than in any of their paſt efforts, they, on the twentieth day after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Gorgona, diſcovered the coaſt of Peru.<note place="margin">Diſcovers Peru.</note> After touching at ſeveral villages near the ſhore, which they found to be no wiſe inviting, they landed at Tumbez, a place of ſome note, about three degrees ſouth of the line, diſtinguiſhed for its ſtately temple, and a palace of the <hi>Incas</hi> or ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of the country<note n="†" place="bottom">Calancha, p. 103.</note>.

He was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed governor, captain-general, and adelantado of all the country which he had diſcovered, and hoped to conquer, with ſupreme authority, civil, as well as military; and with full right to all the privileges and emoluments uſually granted to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers in the New World. His juriſdiction was declared to extend two hundred leagues along the coaſt to the ſouth of the river St. Jago; to be independent of the governor of Panama; and he had power to nominate all the officers who were to ſerve under him. In return for thoſe conceſſions, which coſt the court of Spain nothing, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them depended upon the ſucceſs of Pizarro's own efforts, he engaged to raiſe two hundred and fifty men, and to provide the ſhips, arms, and warlike ſtores requiſite towards ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to the crown of Caſtile, the country of which the government was allotted him.</p>
                  <p>INCONSIDERABLE as the body of men was which Pizarro had undertaken to raiſe,<note place="margin">1529. Slender force he was able to raiſe.</note> his funds and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit were ſo low that he could hardly complete half the number; and after obtaining his patents from the crown, he was obliged to ſteal privately out of the port of Seville, in order to elude the ſcrutiny of the officers who had it in charge to examine, whether he had fulfilled the ſtipulations in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 4. lib. vii. c. 9.</note>. Before his departure, however, he received ſome ſupply of money from Cortes, who having returned to Spain about this time, was willing to contribute his aid towards enabling an ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, with whoſe talents and courage he was well acquainted, to begin a career of glory ſimilar to that which he himſelf had finiſhed<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. lib. vii. c. 10.</note>.</p>
                  <p>HE landed at Nombre de Dios, and marched acroſs the iſthmus to Panama, accompanied by his three brothers, Ferdinand, Juan, and Gonzalo, of whom the firſt was born in lawful wedlock, the two latter, like himſelf, were of illegitimate birth, and by Franciſco de Alcantara, his mother's brother.

By offering vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to relinquiſh the office of adelantado, and promiſing to concur in ſoliciting that title, with an independent government, for Almagro, he gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually mitigated the rage of an open-hearted ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, which had been violent, but was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable. Luque, highly ſatisfied with having been ſucceſsful in all his own pretenſions, cordially ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded Pizarro's endeavours.

                     </gap>es, ſtretching from its one extremity to the other. Peru, like the reſt of the New World, was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally poſſeſſed by ſmall independent tribes, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from each other in manners, and in their forms of rude policy. All, however, were ſo little civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, that, if the traditions concerning their mode of life, preſerved among their deſcendants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve credit, they muſt be claſſed among the moſt unimproved ſavages of America. Strangers to every ſpecies of cultivation or regular induſtry, without any fixed reſidence, and unacquainted with thoſe ſentiments and obligations which form the firſt bonds of ſocial union, they are ſaid to have roamed about naked in the foreſts, with which the country was then covered, more like wild beaſts than like men. After they had ſtruggled for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ages with the hardſhips and calamities which are inevitable in ſuch a ſtate, and when no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſeemed to indicate the approach of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common effort towards improvement, we are told
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:034476_0673_0FFDDB06A55F9C98"/>
that there appeared on the banks of the lake Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaca, a man and woman of majeſtic form, and clothed in decent garments. They declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be children of the Sun, ſent by their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent parent, who beheld with pity the miſeries of the human race, to inſtruct and to reclaim them. At their perſuaſion, enforced by reverence for the divinity in whoſe name they were ſuppoſed to ſpeak, ſeveral of the diſperſed ſavages united together, and receiving their commands as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly injunctions, followed them to Cuzco, where they ſettled, and began to lay the foundations of a city.</p>
                  <p>MANCO CAPAC and Mama Ocollo, for ſuch were the names of thoſe extraordinary perſonages, having thus collected ſome wandering tribes, formed that ſocial union, which, by multiplying the deſires, and uniting the efforts of the human ſpecies, excites induſtry, and leads to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Manco Capac inſtructed the men in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, and other uſeful arts. Mama Ocollo taught the women to ſpin and to weave. By the labour of the one ſex, ſubſiſtence became leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious; by that of the other, life was rendered more comfortable. After ſecuring the objects of firſt neceſſity in an infant ſtate, by providing food, raiment, and habitations, for the rude people of whom he took charge, Manco Capac turned his attention towards introducing ſuch laws and policy as might perpetuate their happineſs. By his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which ſhall be more particularly explained hereafter, the various relations in private life were eſtabliſhed, and the duties reſulting from them preſcribed with ſuch propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to decency of manners. In public adminiſtration, the functions of perſons in authority were ſo preciſely defined, and the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of thoſe under their juriſdiction maintained
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:034476_0674_0FFDDB0A58EE2FD8"/>
with ſuch a ſteady hand, that the ſociety in which he preſided, ſoon aſſumed the aſpect of a regular and well-governed ſtate.</p>
                  <p>THUS, according to the Indian tradition, was founded the empire of the <hi>Incas</hi> or <hi>Lords</hi> of Peru. At firſt its extent was ſmall. The territory of Manco Capac did not reach above eight leagues from Cuzco. But within its narrow precincts he exerciſed abſolute and uncontrouled authority. His ſucceſſors, as their dominions extended, arrogated a ſimilar juriſdiction over the new ſubjects which they acquired: the deſpotiſm of Aſia was not more complete. The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs, but revered as divinities. Their blood was held to be ſacred, and, by prohibiting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriages with the people, was never contaminated by mixing with that of any other race. The family, thus ſeparated from the reſt of the nation, was diſtinguiſhed by peculiarities in dreſs and ornaments, which it was unlawful for others to aſſume. The monarch himſelf appeared with enſigns of royalty reſerved for him alone; and received from his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects marks of obſequious homage and reſpect, which approached almoſt to adoration.</p>
                  <p>BUT, among the Peruvians, this unbounded power of their monarchs ſeems to have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly accompanied with attention to the good of their ſubjects. It was not the rage of conqueſt, if we may believe the accounts of their countrymen, that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions, but the deſire of diffuſing the bleſſings of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the knowledge of the arts which they poſſeſſed, among the barbarous people whom they reduced. During a ſucceſſion of twelve monarchs, it is ſaid that not one deviated from this beneficent character<note n="*" place="bottom">Cieca de Leon, Chron, c. 44.

                     <pb n="168" facs="unknown:034476_0675_0FFDDB0CF084BB08"/>WHEN the Spaniards firſt viſited the coaſt of Peru, in the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty-ſix, Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch from the founder of the ſtate, was ſeated on the throne. He is repreſented as a prince diſtinguiſhed not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to the race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious arms the kingdom of Quito was ſubjected, a conqueſt of ſuch extent and importance as almoſt doubled the power of the Peruvian empire. He was fond of reſiding in the capital of that valuable province, which he had added to his dominions; and notwithſtanding the ancient and fundamental law of the monarchy againſt polluting the royal blood by any foreign alliance, he married the daughter of the vanquiſhed monarch of Quito.— She bore him a ſon named Atahualpa, whom, on his death at Quito, which ſeems to have happened about the year one thouſand five hundred and twenty-nine, he appointed his ſucceſſor in that kingdom, leaving the reſt of his dominions to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſcar, his eldeſt ſon, by a mother of the royal race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory of a monarch who had reigned with greater reputation and ſplendour than any of his predeceſſors, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination of Huana Capac concerning the ſucceſſion, appeared ſo repugnant to a maxim coeval with the empire, and founded on authority deemed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that it was no ſooner known at Cuzco than it excited general diſguſt. Encouraged by thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of his ſubject, Huaſcar required his brother to renounce the government of Quito, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him as his lawful ſuperior. But it had been the firſt care of Atahualpa to gain a large body of troops which had accompanied his father to Quito. Theſe were the flower of the Peruvian warriors, to whoſe valour Huana Capac had been indebted for all his victories. Relying on their
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:034476_0676_0FFDDB0F8FE57928"/>
ſupport, Atahualpa firſt eluded his brother's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and then marched againſt him in hoſtile array.</p>
                  <p>THUS the ambition of two young men, the title of the one founded on ancient uſage, and that of the other aſſerted by the veteran troops, involved Peru in civil war, a calamity to which, under a ſucceſſion of virtuous princes, it had hitherto been a ſtranger. In ſuch a conteſt the iſſue was obvious. The force of arms triumphed over the authority of laws. Atahualpa remained victorious, and made a cruel uſe of his victory. Conſcious of the defect in his own title to the crown, he attempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate the royal race, by putting to death all the children of the Sun deſcended from Manco Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac, whom he could ſeize either by force or ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem. From a political motive, the life of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate rival Huaſcar, who had been taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in a battle which decided the fate of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was prolonged for ſome time, that, by iſſuing orders in his name, the uſurper might more eaſily eſtabliſh his own authority<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. i. c. 15.

But at this time, the two competitors, though they received early accounts of the arrival and violent proceedings of the Spaniards, were ſo intent upon the operations of a war, which they
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:034476_0677_0FFDDB1230C438F0"/>

During their progreſs, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards had acquired ſome imperfect knowledge of this ſtruggle between the two contending factions. The firſt complete information with reſpect to it, they received from the meſſengers whom Huaſcar ſent to Pizarro, in order to ſolicit his aid againſt Atahualpa, whom he repreſented as a rebel and an uſurper<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. ii. c. 3.</note>. Pizarro perceived at once the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this intelligence, and foreſaw ſo clearly all the advantages which might be derived from this divided ſtate of the kingdom, which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, that, without waiting for the reinforcement which he expected from Panama, he determined to puſh forward, while inteſtine diſcord put it out of the power of the Peruvians to attack him with their whole force, and while, by taking part, as circumſtances ſhould incline him, with one of the competitors, he might be enabled with greater eaſe to cruſh both.

Before he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded far, an officer diſpatched by the Inca met him with a valuable preſent from that prince, accompanied with a proffer of his alliance, and aſſurances of a friendly reception at Caxamalca. Pizarro, according to the uſual artifice of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in America, pretended to come as the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of a very powerful monarch, and declared that he was now advancing with an intention to offer Atahualpa his aid againſt thoſe enemies who diſputed his title to the throne<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. i. c. 3.

The decent deportment of the Peruvian monarch, the order of his court, and the reverence with which his ſubjects approached his perſon and obeyed his commands, aſtoniſhed thoſe Spaniards, who had never met in America with any thing more digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied than the petty cazique of a barberous tribe. But their eyes were ſtill more powerfully attracted by the vaſt profuſion of wealth which they obſerved in the Inca's camp. The rich ornaments worn by him and his attendants, the veſſels of gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in which the repaſt offered to them was ſerved up, the multitude of utenſils of every kind formed of thoſe precious metals, opened proſpects far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding any idea of opulence that a European of the ſixteenth century could form.</p>

He prepared for the execution of his ſcheme with the ſame deliberate arrangement, and with as little compunction, as if it had reflected no diſgrace on himſelf or his country. He divided his cavalry into three ſmall ſquadrons, under the command of his brother Ferdinand, Soto, and Benalcazar; his infantry were formed in one body, except twenty of moſt tried courage, whom he kept near his own perſon to ſupport him in the dangerous ſervice which he reſerved for himſelf; the artillery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two field-pieces<note n="*" place="bottom">Xerez, p. 194.</note> and the croſs-bowmen, were placed oppoſite to the avenue by which Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hualpa was to approach. All were commanded to keep within the ſquare, and not to move until the ſignal for action was given.</p>

to ruin him by private machinations, that unhappy prince inadvertently contributed to haſten his own fate. During his confinement he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached himſelf with peculiar affection to Ferdinand Pizarro and Hernando Soto; who, as they were perſons of birth and education ſuperior to the rough adventurers with whom they ſerved, were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to behave with more decency and attention to the captive monarch. Soothed with this reſpect from perſons of ſuch high rank, he delighted in their ſociety. But in the preſence of the governor he was always uneaſy and overawed. This dread ſoon came to be mingled with contempt. Among all the European arts, what he admired moſt was that of reading and writing; and he long delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with himſelf, whether he ſhould regard it as a natural or acquired talent. In order to determine this, he deſired one of the ſoldiers, who guarded him, to write the name of God on the nail of his thumb. This he ſhewed ſucceſſively to ſeveral Spaniards, aſking its meaning; and to his amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they all, without heſitation, returned the ſame anſwer. At length Pizarro entered; and on preſenting it to him, he bluſhed, and with ſome confuſion was obliged to acknowledge his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. From that moment, Atahualpa conſidered him as a mean perſon, leſs inſtructed than his own ſoldiers; and he had not addreſs enough to conceal the ſentiments with which this diſcovery inſpired him. To be the object of a barbarian's ſcorn, not only mortified the pride of Pizarro, but excited ſuch reſentment in his breaſt, as added force to all the other conſiderations which promped him to put the Inca to death<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4.

exempted from ſtanding ſingly reſponſible for the commiſſion of it, Pizarro, reſolved to try the Inca with all the formalities obſerved in the criminal courts of Spain. Pizarro himſelf, and Almagro, with two aſſiſtants, were appointed judges, with full power to acquit or to condemn; an attorney-general was named to carry on the proſecution in the king's name; counſellors were choſen to aſſiſt the priſoner in his defence; and clerks were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to record the proceedings of court. Before this ſtrange tribunal, a charge was exhibited ſtill more amazing. It conſiſted of various articles; that Atahualpa, though a baſtard, had diſpoſſeſſed the rightful owner of the throne, and uſurped the regal power; that he had put his brother and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſovereign to death; that he was an idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded the offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of human ſacrifices; that he had a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of concubines; that ſince his impriſonment he had waſted and embezzled the royal treaſures, which now belonged of right to the conquerors; that he had incited his ſubjects to take arms againſt the Spaniards. On theſe heads of accuſation, ſome of which are ſo ludicrous, others ſo abſurd, that the effrontery of Pizarro, in making them the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a ſerious procedure, is not leſs ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than his injuſtice, did this ſtrange court go on to try the ſovereign of a great empire, over whom it had no juriſdiction. With reſpect to each of the articles, witneſſes were examined; but as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their evidence in their native tongue, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippillo had it in his power to give their words whatever turn beſt ſuited his malevolent intentions. To judges predetermined in their opinion,<note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</note> this evidence appeared ſufficient. They pronounced Atahualpa guilty, and condemned him to be burnt alive. Friar Valverde proſtituted the authority of his ſacred function to confirm this ſentence, and by

Aſtoniſhed at his fate, Atahualpa endeavoured to avert it by tears, by promiſes, and by entreaties, that he might be ſent to Spain, where a monarch would be the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of his lot. But pity never touched the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling heart of Pizarro. He ordered him to be led inſtantly to execution; and, what added to the bitterneſs of his laſt moments, the ſame monk who had juſt ratified his doom, offered to conſole, and attempted to convert him. The moſt powerful argument Valverde employed to prevail with him to embrace the Chriſtian faith, was a promiſe of mitigation in his puniſhment.

Though ill qualified by his education to enter into any diſquiſition concerning the principles of civil policy, and little accuſtomed by his former habits of life to attend to its arrangements, his natural ſagacity ſupplied the want both of ſcience and experience.

But, though, for the preſent, he adapted his plan to the infant ſtate of the colony, his aſpiring mind looked forward to its future grandeur. He conſidered himſelf as laying the foundation of a great empire,<note place="margin">Foundation of Lima.</note> and deliberated long, and with much ſolicitude, in what place he ſhould fix the ſeat of government. Cuzco, the imperial city of the Incas, was ſituated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles from the ſea, and much farther from Quito, a province of whoſe value he had

formed an high idea. No other ſettlement of the Peruvians was ſo conſiderable as to merit the name of a town, or to allure the Spaniards to fix their reſidence in it. But, in marching through the country, Pizarro had been ſtruck with the beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the moſt extenſive and beſt cultivated in Peru. There, on the banks of a ſmall river, of the ſame name with the vale which it waters and enriches, at the diſtance of ſix miles from Callao, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious harbour in the Pacific Ocean, he founded a city which he deſtined to be the capital of his government.<note place="margin">1535.

Peru. From impatience to finiſh the expedition, or from that contempt of hardſhip and danger acquired by all the Spaniards who had ſerved long in America, Almagro, inſtead of advancing along the level country on the coaſt, choſe to march acroſs the mountains by a route that was ſhorter indeed, but almoſt impracticable. In this attempt his troops were expoſed to every calamity which men can ſuffer, from fatigue, from famine, and from the rigour of the climate in thoſe elevated regions of the torrid zone, where the degree of cold is hardly inferior to what is felt within the polar circle. Many of them periſhed; and the ſurvivors, when they deſcended into the fertile plains of Chili, had new difficulties to encounter. They found there a race of men very different from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent, and in their bodily conſtitution, as well as vigour of ſpirit, nearly reſembling the warlike tribes in North America. Though filled with wonder at the firſt appearance of the Spaniards, and ſtill more aſtoniſhed at the operations of their cavalry and the effects of their fire-arms, the Chileſe ſoon recovered ſo far from their ſurprize, as not only to defend themſelves with obſtinacy, but to attack their new enemies with more determined fierceneſs than any American nation had hitherto diſcovered. The Spaniards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and collected ſome conſiderable quantities of gold; but were ſo far from thinking of making any ſettlement amidſt ſuch formidable neighbours, that, in ſpite of all the experience and valour of their leader, the final iſſue of the expedition ſtill remained extremely dubious, when they were recalled from it by an unexpected revolution in Peru<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib iii. c. 1.

His opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> as he did not ſtudy to conceal his pretenſions, were at a loſs whether to welcome him as a deliverer, or to take precautions againſt him as an enemy. The latter, knowing the points in conteſt between him and his countrymen, flattered themſelves that they had more to hope than to dread from his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Almagro himſelf, unacquainted with the detail of the events which had happened in his abſence, and ſolicitous to learn the preciſe poſture or affairs, advanced towards the capital ſlowly, and with great circumſpection. Various negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with both parties were ſet on foot. The Inca conducted them on his part with much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. At firſt he endeavoured to gain the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almagro; and after many fruitleſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, diſpairing of any cordial union with a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard, he attacked him by ſurpriſe with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body of choſen troops. But the Spaniſh diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and valour maintained their wonted ſuperiority. The Peruvians were repulſed with ſuch ſlaughter, that a great part of their army diſperſed, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption.</p>
                  <p>THE Pizarros,<note place="margin">Takes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Cuzco.</note> as they had no longer to make head againſt the Peruvians, directed all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention towards their new enemy, and took mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to obſtruct his entry into the capital. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, however, reſtrained both parties for ſome time from turning their arms againſt one another while ſurrounded by common enemies, who would rejoice in the mutual ſlaughter. Different ſchemes of accommodation were propoſed. Each endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to deceive the other, or to corrupt his followers. The generous, open, affable temper of Almagro gained many adherents of the Pizarros,

Rodrigo Orgognez, an officer of great abilities, who having ſerved under the conſtable Bourbon, when he led the Imperial army to Rome, had been accuſtomed to bold and deciſive meaſures, adviſed him inſtantly to iſſue orders for putting to death Ferdinand and Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalo Pizarros, Alvarado, and a few other perſons whom he could not hope to gain, and to march directly with his victorious troops to Lima, before the governor had time to prepare for his defence. But Almagro, though he diſcerned at once the utility of the counſel, and though he had courage to have carried it into execution, ſuffered himſelf to be influenced by ſentiments unlike thoſe of a ſoldier of fortune grown old in ſervice, and by ſcruples which ſuited not the chief of a party who had drawn his ſword in civil war. Feelings of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity reſtrained him from ſhedding the blood of his opponents; and the dread of being deemed a rebel, deterred him from entering a province which the king had allotted to another. Though he knew that arms muſt terminate the diſpute between him and Pizarro, and reſolved not to ſhun that mode of deciſion, yet, with a timid delicacy prepoſterous at ſuch a juncture, he was ſo ſolicitous that his rival ſhould be conſidered as the aggreſſor, that he marched quietly back to Cuzco, to wait his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. ii. c. 10, 11.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="unknown:034476_0711_0FFDDB662BBFF380"/>PIZARRO was ſtill unacquainted with all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting events which had happened near Cuzco. Accounts of Almagro's return, of the loſs of the capital,<note place="margin">Diſtreſs of Pizarro.</note> of the death of one brother, of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of the other two, and of the defeat of Alvarado, were brought to him at once. Such a tide of misfortunes almoſt overwhelmed a ſpirit which had continued firm and erect under the rudeſt ſhocks of adverſity. But the neceſſity of attending to his own ſafety, as well as the deſire of revenge, preſerved him from ſinking under it. He took meaſures for both with his wonted ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.<note place="margin">His artful conduct.</note>
As he he had the command of the ſea-coaſt, and expected conſiderable ſupplies both of men and military ſtores, it was no leſs his intereſt to gain time, and to avoid action, than it was that of Almagro to precipitate operations, and bring the conteſt to a ſpeedy iſſue. He had recourſe to arts which he had formerly practiſed with ſucceſs, and Almagro was again weak enough to ſuffer himſelf to be amuſed with a proſpect of terminating their differences by ſome amicable accommodation. By varying his overtures, and ſhifting his ground as often as it ſuited his purpoſe, ſometimes ſeeming to yield every thing which his rival could deſire, and then retracting all that he had granted, Pizarro dexterouſly protracted the negociation to ſuch a length, that though every day was precious to Almagro, ſeveral months elapſed without coming to any final agreement. While the attention of Almagro, and of the officers with whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, was occupied in detecting and eluding the fraudulent intentions of the governor, Gonzalo Pizarro and Alvarado found means to corrupt the ſoldiers to whoſe cuſtody they were committed, and not only made their eſcape themſelves, but perſuaded ſixty of the men who formerly guarded

Fortune having thus delivered one of his brothers, the governor ſcrupled not at one act of perfidy more to procure the releaſe of the other. He propoſed, that every point in controverſy between Almagro and himſelf ſhould be ſubmitted to the deciſion of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; that until his award was known, each ſhould retain undiſturbed poſſeſſion of whatever part of the country he now occupied; that Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Pizarro ſhould be ſet at liberty, and return inſtantly to Spain, together with the officers, whom Almagro purpoſed to ſend thither to repreſent the juſtice of his claims. Obvious as the deſign of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro was in thoſe propoſitions, and familiar as his artifices might now have been to his opponent, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magro with a credulity approaching to infatuation, relied on his ſincerity, and concluded an agreement on theſe terms<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. iii. c. 9.

                  <p>THE moment that Ferdinand Pizarro recovered his liberty, the governor,<note place="margin">His prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for war.</note> no longer fettered in his operations by anxiety about his brother's life, threw off every diſguiſe which his concern for it had obliged him to aſſume. The treaty was forgotten; pacific and conciliating meaſures were no more mentioned; it was in the field he openly declared, and not in the cabinet; by arms, and not by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation; that it muſt now be determined who ſhould be maſter of Peru. The rapidity of his preparations ſuited ſuch a deciſive reſolution. Seven hundred men were ſoon ready to march towards Cuzco.<note place="margin">1538.</note> The command of theſe was given to his two brothers, in whom he could perfectly confide for the execution of his moſt violent ſchemes, as they were urged on, not only by the enmity flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

from the rivalſhip between their family and Almagro, but animated with the deſire of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, excited by recollection of their own recent diſgrace and ſufferings. After an unſucceſsful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to croſs the mountains in the direct road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lima and Cuzco, they marched towards the ſouth along the coaſt as far as Naſca, and then turning to the left, penetrated through the defiles in that branch of the Andes which lay between them and the capital. Almagro, inſtead of hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome of his officers, who adviſed him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the defence of thoſe difficult paſſes, waited the approach of the enemy in the plain of Cuzco. Two reaſons ſeem to have induced him to take this reſolution. His followers amounted hardly to five hundred, and he was afraid of weakening ſuch a feeble body by ſending any detachment towards the mountains. His cavalry far exceeded that of the adverſe party, both in number and diſcipline, and it was only in an open country that he could avail himſelf of that advantage.</p>

                     <note place="margin">His army marches to Cuzco.</note>THE Pizarros advanced without any obſtruction, but what aroſe from the nature of the deſert and horrid regions through which they marched.

for Almagro, he was ſo worn out with the fatigues of ſervice, to which his advanced age was unequal, that, at this criſis of his fate, he could not exert his wonted activity; and he was obliged to commit the leading of his troops to Orgognez, who, though an officer of great merit, did not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſame aſcendant either over the ſpirit or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſoldiers, as the chief whom they had long been accuſtomed to follow and revere.</p>
                  <p>THE conflict was fierce,<note place="margin">April 26. Almagro defeated.</note> and maintained by each party with equal courage. On the ſide of Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, were more veteran ſoldiers, and a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of cavalry; but theſe were counterbalanced by Pizarro's ſuperiority in numbers, and by two companies of well diſciplined muſketeers, which, on receiving an account of the inſurrection of the Indians, the emperor had ſent from Spain<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. iii. c. 8.</note>. As the uſe of fire-arms was not frequent among the adventurers in America<note n="†" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. iii. c. 8.</note>, haſtily equipped for ſervice, at their own expence, this ſmall band of ſoldiers, regularly trained and armed, was a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty in Peru, and decided the fate of the day. Wherever it advanced, the weight of a heavy and well-ſuſtained fire bore down horſe and foot before it; and Orgognez, while he endeavoured to rally and animate his troops, having received a dangerous wound, the rout become general. The barbarity of the conquerors ſtained the glory which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by this complete victory.

Unfortunately for the victorious faction, the firſt intelligence was brought thither by ſome or Almagro's officers, who left the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon the ruin of their cauſe; and they related what had happened, with every circumſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to Pizarro and his brothers. Their ambition, their breach of the moſt ſolemn engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their violence and cruelty, were painted with all the malignity and exaggeration of party hatred. Ferdinand Pizarro, who arrived ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and appeared in court with extraordinary ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, endeavoured to efface the impreſſion which their accuſations had made, and to juſtify his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf by repreſenting Almagro as the aggreſſor. The emperor and his miniſters, though

they could not pronounce which of the contending factions was moſt criminal, clearly diſcerned the fatal tendency of their diſſentions. It was obvious, that while the leader, entruſted with the conduct of two infant colonies, employed the arms which ſhould have been turned againſt the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, in deſtroying one another, all attention to the public good muſt ceaſe, and there was reaſon to dread that the Indians might improve the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which the diſunion of the Spaniards preſented to them, and extirpate both the victors and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed. But the evil was more apparent than the remedy. Where the information which had been received was ſo defective and ſuſpicious, and the ſcene of action ſo remote, it was almoſt impoſſible to chalk out the line of conduct that ought to be followed; and before any plan that ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of in Spain could be carried into execution, the ſituation of the parties, and the circumſtances of affairs, might alter ſo entirely as to render its effects extremely pernicious.</p>

His inſtructions, though ample, were not ſuch as to fetter him in his operations. According to the different aſpect of affairs, he had power to take upon him different characters. If he found the

This attention to Pizarro, however, ſeems to have flowed rather from dread of his power, than from any approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his meaſures; for at the very time that the court ſeemed ſo ſolicitous not to irritate him, his brother Ferdinand was arreſted at Madrid, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a priſon, where he remained above twenty years <note n="*" place="bottom">Gomara Hiſt. c. 142.

But Pizarro conducted this tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not with the equity and candour of a judge attentive to diſcover and to reward merit, but with the illiberal ſpirit of a party leader. Large diſtricts, in parts of the country moſt cultivated and populous, were ſet apart as his own property, or granted to his brother, his adherents and favourites.

to have reſolved that no perſon in Peru ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs any ſtation of diſtinguiſhed eminence or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity but thoſe of his own family, had deprived Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalcazar, the conqueror of Quito, of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in that kingdom, and appointed his brother Gonzalo to take the government of it. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him to attempt the diſcovery and conqueſt of the country to the eaſt of the Andes, which, according to the information of the Indians, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with cinnamon and other valuable ſpices. Gonzalo, not inferior to any of his brothers in courage, and no leſs ambitious of acquiring diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, eagerly engaged in this difficult ſervice.

The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, though more robuſt, and inured to a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of climates, ſuffered conſiderably, and loſt ſome men; but when they deſcended into the low country their diſtreſs increaſed.

They could not advance a ſtep but as they cut a road through woods, or made it through marſhes. Such inceſſant toil, and continual ſcarcity of food, ſeem more than ſufficient to have exhauſted and diſpirited

any troops. But the fortitude and perſeverance of the Spaniards in the ſixteenth century were inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable. Allured by frequent but falſe accounts of rich countries before them, they perſiſted in ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling on, until they reached the banks of the Coca or Napo, one of the large rivers whoſe waters pour into the Maragnon, and contribute to its grandeur. There, with infinite labour, they built a bark, which they expected would prove of great utility, in conveying them over rivers, in procuring proviſions, and in exploring the country. This was manned with fifty ſoldiers, under the command of Francis Orellana, the officer next in rank to Pizarro. The ſtream carried them down with ſuch rapidity, that they were ſoon far a-head of their countrymen, who followed ſlowly and with difficulty by land.</p>
                  <p>AT this diſtance from his commander, Orellana,<note place="margin">Deſerted by Orellana.</note> a young man of an aſpiring mind, began to fancy himſelf independent, and tranſported with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant paſſion of the age, he formed the ſcheme of diſtinguiſhing himſelf as a diſcoverer, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the courſe of the Maragnon, until it joined the ocean, and by ſurveying the vaſt regions through which it ſlows. This ſcheme of Orel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lana's was as bold as it was treacherous. For, if he be chargeable with the guilt of having violated his duty to his commander, and with having aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned his fellow-ſoldiers in a pathleſs deſert, where they had hardly any hopes of ſucceſs, or even of ſafety, but what were founded on the ſervice which they expected from the bark; his crime is, in ſome meaſure, balanced by the glory of having ventured upon a navigation of near two thouſand leagues, through unknown nations, in a veſſel haſtily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed with green timber, and by very unſkilful hands, without proviſions, without a compaſs, or
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:034476_0723_0FFDDB864F151580"/>
a pilot. But his courage and alacrity ſupplied every defect. Committing himſelf fearleſsly to the guidance of the ſtream, the Napo bore him along to the ſouth,<note place="margin">Sails down the Marag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</note> until he reached the great channel of the Maragnon. Turning with it towards the coaſt, he held on his courſe in that direction. He made frequent deſcents on both ſides of the river, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeizing by force of arms the proviſions of the fierce ſavages ſeated on its banks; and ſometimes procuring a ſupply of food by a friendly intercourſe with more gentle tribes. After a long ſeries of dangers which he encountered with amazing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and of diſtreſſes which he ſupported with no leſs magnanimity, he reached the ocean <note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLI.</note>, where new perils awaited him. Theſe he likewiſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and got ſafe to the Spaniſh ſettlement in the iſland Cubagua; from thence he ſailed to Spain. The vanity natural to travellers who viſit regions unknown to the reſt of mankind, and the art of an adventurer, ſolicitous to magnify his own merit, concurred in prompting him to mingle an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary proportion of the marvellous in the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his voyage. He pretended to have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered nations ſo rich, that the roofs of their temples were covered with plates of gold; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a republic of women ſo warlike and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to have extended their dominion over a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable tract of the fertile plains which he had viſited. Extravagant as thoſe tales were, they gave riſe to an opinion, that a region abounding with gold, diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>El Dorado,</hi> and a community of Amazons, were to be found in this part of the New World; and ſuch is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of mankind to believe what is wonderful, that it has been ſlowly and with difficulty that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

and obſervation have exploded thoſe fables. The voyage, however, even when ſtripped of every romantic embelliſhment, deſerves to be recorded, not only as one of the moſt memorable occurrences in that adventurous age, but as the firſt event which led to any certain knowledge of the extenſive coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that ſtretch eaſtward from the Andes to the ocean <note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. iv. c. 4.

He would not allow himſelf to ſuſpect that a man, whom he had intruſted with ſuch an important command, could be ſo baſe and ſo unfeeling, as to deſert him at ſuch a juncture. But imputing his abſence from the place of rendezvous to ſome unknown accident, he advanced above fifty leagues along the banks of the Maragnon, expecting every moment to ſee the bark appear with a ſupply of proviſions.<note place="margin">1541.</note> At length he came up with an officer whom Orellana had left to periſh in the deſert, becauſe he had the courage to remonſtrate againſt his perfidy.

The ſpirit of the ſtouteſt hearted veteran ſunk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and all demanded to be led back inſtantly. Pizarro, though he aſſumed an appearance of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, did not oppoſe their inclination.

Hunger compelled them to feed on roots and berries, to eat all their dogs and horſes, to devour the moſt loathſome reptiles, and even to gnaw the leather of their faddles and ſword-belts. Four thouſand Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards, periſhed in this wild diſaſtrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, which continued near two years; and as fifty men were aboard the bark with Orellana, only fourſcore got back to Quito.

In this young man the Almagrians found a point of union which they wanted, and looking up to him as their head, were ready to undertake any thing for his advancement.

                  <p>ON Sunday, the twenty-ſixth of June, at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, the ſeaſon of tranquillity and repoſe in all ſultry climates, Herrada, at the head of eighteen of the moſt determined conſpirators, ſallied out of Almagro's houſe in complete armour; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſwords, as they advanced haſtily towards the governor's palace, cried out, "Long live the king, but let the tyrant die!" Their aſſociates, warned of their motions by a ſignal, were in arms at different ſtations ready to ſupport them. Though Pizarro was uſually ſurrounded by ſuch a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous train of attendants as ſuited the magnificence of the moſt opulent ſubject of the age in which he lived, yet as he was juſt riſen from table, and moſt of his domeſtics had retired to their own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the conſpirators paſſed through the two outer courts of the palace unobſerved. They were at the bottom of the ſtaircaſe, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to his maſter, who was converſing with a few friends in a large hall. The governor, whoſe ſteady mind no form of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could appal, ſtarting up, called for arms, and commanded Franciſco de Chaves to make faſt the door. But that officer, who did not retain ſo much preſence of mind as to obey this prudent order, running to the top of the ſtair-caſe, wildly aſked the conſpirators what they meant, and whither they were going?

Some of the perſons who were there threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the windows; others attempted to fly; and a few drawing their ſwords, followed their leader into an inner apartment. The conſpirators, animated with having the object of their vengeance now in view, ruſhed forward after them. Pizarro, with no other arms than his ſword and buckler, defended the entry, and ſupported by his half-brother Alcantara, and his little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal conteſt with intrepidity worthy of his paſt exploits, and with the vigour of a youthful combatant, "Courage," cried he, "companions, we are yet enow to make thoſe traitors repent of their audacity." But the armour of the conſpirators protected them, while every thruſt they made took effect. Alcantara fell dead at his brother's feet; his other defenders were mortally wounded. The governor, ſo weary that he could hardly wield his ſword, and no longer able to parry the many weapons furiouſly aimed at him, received a deadly thriſt full in his throat, ſunk to the ground, and expired.</p>

As his youth and inexperience diſqualified him from taking the command of them himſelf, he appointed Herrada to act as general. But though Almagro ſpeedily collected ſuch a reſpectable force, the acquieſcence in his government was far from being general. Pizarro had left many friends to whom his memory was dear; the barbarous aſſaſſination of a man to whom his country was ſo highly indebted, filled every impartial perſon with horror. The ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful title on which he ſounded his pretenſions, led others to conſider him as an uſurper. The officers who commanded in ſome provinces refuſed to recognize his authority, until it was confirmed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. In others, particularly at Cuzco, the royal ſtandard was erected, and preparations were begun in order to revenge the murder of their ancient leader.</p>

After a long and diſaſtrous voyage, he was driven by ſtreſs of weather into a ſmall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the province of Popayan; and proceeding from thence by land, after a journey no leſs tedious than difficult, reached Quito. In his way he received accounts of Pizarro's death, and of the events which followed upon it.

It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from all the events recorded in the hiſtory of America, that rapid and extenſive as the Spaniſh conqueſts there had been, they were not carried on by any regular exertion of the national force, but by the occaſional efforts of private adventurers. After fitting out a few of the firſt armaments for diſcovering new regions, the court of Spain, during the buſy reigns of Ferdinand and of Charles V. the former the moſt intriguing prince of the age, and the latter the moſt ambitious, was encumbered with ſuch a multiplicity of ſchemes, and involved in war with ſo many nations of Europe, that it had not leiſure to attend to diſtant and leſs intereſting objects. The care of proſecuting diſcovery, or of attempting conqueſt, was abandoned to individuals; and with ſuch ardour did men puſh forward in this new career, on which novelty, the ſpirit of
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:034476_0734_0FFDDBA59E614C48"/>
adventure, avarice, ambition, and the hope of meriting heaven, prompted them with combined influence to enter, that in leſs than half a century almoſt the whole of that extenſive empire which Spain now poſſeſſes in the New World, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to its dominion. As the Spaniſh court con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed nothing towards the various expeditions undertaken in America, it was not entitled to claim much from their ſucceſs. The ſovereignty of the conquered provinces, with the fifth of the gold and ſilver, was reſerved for the crown; every thing elſe was ſeized by the aſſociates in each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition as their own right. The plunder of the countries which they invaded ſerved to demnify them for what they had expended in equipping themſelves for the ſervice, and the conquered ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory was divided among them, according to rules which cuſtom had introduced, as permanent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments which their ſucceſsful valour merited. In the infancy of thoſe ſettlements, when their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent as well as their value were unknown, many irregularities eſcaped obſervation, and it was found neceſſary to connive at many exceſſes. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered people were frequently pillaged with deſtructive rapacity, and their country parcelled out among its new maſters in exorbitant ſhares, far exceeding the higheſt recompence due to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. The rude conquerors of America, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of forming their eſtabliſhments upon any general or extenſive plan of policy, attentive only to private intereſt, unwilling to forego preſent gain from the proſpect of remote or public benefit, ſeem to have had no object but to amaſs ſudden wealth, without regarding what might be the conſequences of the means by which they acquired it. But when time at length diſcovered to the Spaniſh court the importance of its American poſſeſſions, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of new-modelling their whole frame became
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:034476_0735_0FFDDBA7B13ADC08"/>
obvious, and in place of the maxims and practices, prevalent among military adventurers, it was found requiſite to ſubſtitute the inſtitutions of regular government.</p>
                  <p>ONE evil in particular called for an immediate remedy. The conquerors of Mexico and Peru imitated the fatal example of their countrymen ſettled in the iſlands, and employed themſelves in ſearching for gold and ſilver with the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate eagerneſs. Similar effects followed. The natives employed in this labour by maſters, who in impoſing taſks had no regard either to what they felt or to what they were able to perform, pined away and periſhed ſo faſt, that there was reaſon to apprehend that Spain, inſtead of poſſeſſing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries peopled to ſuch a degree as to be ſuſceptible of progreſſive improvement, would ſoon remain proprietor only of a vaſt uninhabited deſert.</p>
                  <p>THE emperor and his miniſters were ſo ſenſible of this, and ſo ſolicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which threatened to render their acquiſitions of no value, that from time to time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been made for ſecuring to that unhappy people more gentle and equitable treatment. But the diſtance of America from the ſeat of empire, the feebleneſs of government in the new colonies, the avarice and audacity of ſoldiers unaccuſtomed to reſtraint, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented theſe ſalutary regulations from operating with any conſiderable influence.

Fortunately for the people of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, among theſe was Bartholomew de las Caſas, who happened to be then at Madrid on a miſſion from a Chapter of his order at Chiapa<note n="*" place="bottom">Remeſ. Hiſt. de Chiapa, p. 146.</note>. Though, ſince the miſcarriage of his former ſchemes for the relief of the Indians, he had continued ſhut up in his cloiſter, or occupied in religious functions, his zeal in behalf of the former objects of his pity was ſo far from abating, that, from an increaſed knowledge of their ſufferings, its ardour had aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. He ſeized eagerly this opportunity of reviving his favourite maxims concerning the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Indians. With the moving eloquence natural to a man on whoſe mind the ſcenes which he had beheld had made a deep impreſſion, he deſcribed the irreparable waſte of the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in the New World, the Indian race almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſwept away in the iſlands in leſs than fifty years, and haſtening to extinction on the continent with the ſame rapid decay. With the deciſive tone of one ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed with the truth of his own ſyſtem, he imputed all this to a ſingle cauſe, to the exactions and cruelty of his countrymen, and contended that nothing could prevent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population of America, but the declaring of its natives to be freemen, and treating them as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, not as ſlaves. Nor did he confide for the ſucceſs of this propoſal in the powers of his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory alone. In order to enforce them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his famous treatiſe concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of America<note n="†" place="bottom">Remeſ. p. 192, 199.</note>, in which he relates, with many horrid circumſtances, but with apparent marks of exaggerated deſcription, the devaſtation of every province which had been viſited by the Spaniards.</p>

The magiſtrates and principal inhabitants, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, preſented dutiful addreſſes to the viceroy and ſuperintendent, repreſenting the fatal conſequences of enforcing them. Happily for them, Mendoza, by long reſidence in the country, was ſo thoroughly acquainted with its ſtate, that he knew what was for its intereſt as well as what it could bear; and Sandoval, though new in office, diſplayed a degree of moderation ſeldom poſſeſſed by perſons juſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon the exerciſe of power.

From the time that the purport of the new regulations was known in Peru, every Spaniard there turned his eyes towards Gonzalo Pizarro, as the only perſon able to avert the ruin with which they threatened the colony.

Gonzalo, though inferior in talents to his other brothers, was equally ambitious, and of courage no leſs daring. The behaviour of an ungrateful court towards his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and himſelf, dwelt continually on his mind. Ferdinand a ſtate priſoner in Europe, the children of the governor in cuſtody of the viceroy, and ſent aboard his fleet, himſelf reduced to the condition

of a private citizen in a country, for the diſcovery and conqueſt of which Spain was indebted to his family. Theſe thoughts prompted him to ſeek for vengeance, and to aſſert the rights of his family, of which he now conſidered himſelf as the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and the heir. But as no Spaniard can eaſily ſurmount that veneration for his ſovereign which ſeems to be interwoven in his frame, the idea of marching in arms againſt the royal ſtandard filled him with horror. He heſitated long, and ſtill unreſolved, when the violence of the viceroy, the univerſal call of his countrymen, and the certainty of becoming ſoon a victim himſelf to the ſeverity of the new laws, moved him to quit his reſidence at Chuquiſaca de la Plata, and repair to Cuzco. All the inhabitants went out to meet him, and received him with tranſports of joy as the deliverer of the colony. In the fervour of their zeal, they elected him procurator-general of the Spaniſh nation in Peru, to ſolicit the repeal of the late regulations. They empowered him to lay their remonſtrances before the royal audience in Lima, and upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of danger from the Indians, authoriſed him to march thither in arms.<note place="margin">1544.</note> Under ſanction of this nomination Pizarro took poſſeſſion of the royal treaſure, appointed officers, levied ſoldiers, ſeized a large train of artillery which Vaca de Caſtro had depoſited in Gumanga, and ſet out for Lima, as if he had been advancing againſt a public enemy.

this requiſition. It was made, probably, with no ſuch intention, but only to throw a decent veil over their own conduct; for Cepeda, the preſident of the court of audience, a pragmatical and aſpiring lawyer, ſeems to have held a ſecret correſpondence with Pizarro, and had already formed the plan, which he afterwards executed, of devoting himſelf to his ſervice. The impriſonment of the viceroy, the uſurpation of the judges, together with the univerſal confuſion and anarchy conſequent upon events ſo ſingular and unexpected, opened new and vaſt proſpects to Pizarro. He now beheld the ſupreme power within his reach. Nor did he want courage to puſh on towards the object which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune preſented to his view. Carvajal, the promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his reſolutions, and guide of all his actions, had long fixed his eye upon it as the only end at which Pizarro ought to aim. Inſtead of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior function of procurator for the Spaniſh ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Peru, he openly demanded to be gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and captain-general of the whole province, and required the court of audience to grant him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to that effect. At the head of twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, within a mile of Lima, where there was neither leader nor army to oppoſe him, ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt carried with it the authority of a command. But the judges, either from unwillingneſs to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh power, or from a deſire of preſerving ſome attention to appearances, heſitated, or ſeemed to heſitate, about complying with what he demanded. Carvajal,<note place="margin">He aſſumes the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> impatient of delay, and impetuous in all his operations, marched into the city by night, ſeized ſeveral officers of diſtinction obnoxious to Pizarro, and hanged them without the formality of a trial.

Nugnez Vela ordered the pilot of the veſſel to ſhape his courſe towards Tumbez, and as ſoon as he landed there, erected the royal ſtandard, and reſumed his functions of viceroy. Several perſons of note, to whom the contagion of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious ſpirit which reigned at Cuzco and Lima had not reached, inſtantly avowed their reſolution to ſupport his authority<note n="†" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. v. c. 9.

While he was gathering ſuch ſtrength at Tumbez, that his forces began to aſſume the appearance of what was conſidered as an army in America, Diego Centeno, a bold and active officer, exaſperated by the cruelty and oppreſſion of Pizarro's lieutenant-governor in the province of Charcas, formed a conſpiracy againſt his life, cut him off, and declared for the viceroy<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib v. c. 18.

an account of the victory at Quito, he remonſtrated with him in a tone ſtill more peremptory, "You have uſurped (ſaid he, in a letter written to Pizarro on that occaſion) the ſupreme power in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in contempt of the emperor's commiſſion to the viceroy. You have marched, in hoſtile array, againſt the royal ſtandard; you have attacked the repreſentative of your ſovereign in the field, have defeated him, and cut off his head. Think not that ever a monarch will forgive ſuch inſults on his dignity, or that any reconciliation with him can be cordial or ſincere. Depend no longer on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious favour of another. Aſſume yourſelf the ſovereignty over a country, to the dominion of which your family has a title founded on the rights both of diſcovery and conqueſt. It is in your power to attach every Spaniard in Peru of any conſequence inviolably to your intereſt by liberal grants of lands and of Indians, or by inſtituting ranks of nobility, and creating titles of honour ſimilar to thoſe which are courted with ſo much eagerneſs in Europe. By eſtabliſhing orders of knighthood, with privileges and diſtinctions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thoſe in Spain, you may beſtow a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication upon the officers in your ſervice, ſuited to the ideas of military men. Nor is it to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen only that you ought to attend; endeavour to gain the natives. By marrying the Coya, or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sun next in ſucceſſion to the crown, you will induce the Indians, out of veneration for the blood of their antient princes, to unite with the Spaniards in ſupport of your authority.

Though unacquainted with the laſt exceſſes of outrage to
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:034476_0754_0FFDDBDB0F80DF40"/>

A revolution ſo alarming called for an immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the emperor's abilities and authority. But as he was fully occupied at that time in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, in conducting the war againſt the famous league of Smalkalde, one of the moſt intereſting and arduous enterpriſes in his reign, the care of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a remedy for the diſorders in Peru devolved upon his ſon Philip, and the counſellors whom Charles had appointed to aſſiſt him in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spain during his abſence. At firſt view, the actions of Pizarro and his adherents, appeared ſo repugnant to the duty of ſubjects towards their ſovereign, that the greater part of the miniſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on declaring them inſtantly to be guilty of rebellion, and on proceeding to puniſh them with exemplary rigour. But when the fervour of their zeal and indignation began to abate, innumerable obſtacles to the execution of this meaſure preſented themſelves. The veteran bands of infantry, the ſtrength and glory of the Spaniſh armies, were then employed in Germany. Spain, exhauſted of men and money by a long ſeries of wars, in which ſhe had been involved by the reſtleſs ambition of two ſucceſſive monarchs, could not eaſily equip an armament of ſufficient force to reduce Pizarro. To tanſport any reſpectable body of troops to a country ſo remote as Peru, appeared almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.

                  <p>BUT events happened in other parts of Peru, which more than counterbalanced the ſplendid victory at Huarina.

More ſolicitous to reclaim than to puniſh, he upbraided no man for paſt offences, but received them as a father receives penitent children returning to a ſenſe of their duty. Though deſirous of peace, he did not ſlacken his preparations for war.

Pizarro, intoxicated with the ſucceſs which had hitherto accompanied his arms, and elated with having again near a thouſand men under his command, refuſed to liſten to any terms, although Cepeda, together with ſeveral of his officers, and even Carvajal himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLVI.</note>, gave it as their advice to cloſe with the preſident's offer of a general indemnity, and the revocation of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious laws<note n="†" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. vii. c. 6.

                  <p>PIZARRO, confident of victory,<note place="margin">Both parties prepare for battle</note> ſuffered the royaliſts to paſs all the rivers which lie between Guamanga and Cuzco without oppoſition,<note place="margin">1548.</note> and to advance within four leagues of that capital, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering himſelf that a defeat in ſuch a ſituation as rendered eſcape impracticable would at once ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the war.

As the two armies moved forward ſlowly to the charge, the appearance of each was ſingular.

who contended for ſuperiority, not one man acted as a hired ſoldier, that follows his ſtandard for pay. Every adventurer in Peru conſidered himſelf as a conqueror, entitled, by his ſervices, to an eſtabliſhment in that country which had been acquired by his valour. In the conteſts between the rival chiefs, each choſe his ſide as he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by his own judgment or affections. He joined his commander as a companion of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and diſdained to degrade himſelf by receiving the wages of a mercenary. It was to their ſword, not to pre-eminence in office, or nobility of birth, that moſt of the leaders whom they followed were indebted for their elevation; and each of their adherents hoped, by the ſame means, to open a way for himſelf to the poſſeſſion of power and wealth<note n="*" place="bottom">Vega, p. 11. lib. iv. c. 38, 41.</note>.<note place="margin">Armies im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive;</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT though the troops in Peru ſerved without any regular pay, they were raiſed at immenſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Among men accuſtomed to divide the ſpoils of an opulent country, the deſire of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wealth acquired incredible force. The ardour of purſuit augmented in proportion to the hope of ſucceſs. Where all were intent on the ſame object, and under the dominion of the ſame paſſion, there was but one mode of gaining men, or of ſecuring their attachment. Officers of name and influence, beſides the promiſe of future eſtabliſhments, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in hand large gratuities from the chief with whom they engaged. Gonzalo Pizarro, in order to raiſe a thouſand men, advanced five hundred thouſand peſos<note n="†" place="bottom">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 54.</note>.

The diſtribution of property,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:034476_0768_0FFDDC028D146768"/>
beſtowed as the reward of ſervices, was ſtill more exorbitant. Cepeda, as the recompence of his perfidy and addreſs, in perſuading the court of royal audience to give the ſanction of its authority to the uſurped juriſdiction of Pizarro,<note place="margin">and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to individuals.</note> received a grant of lands which yielded an annual income of a hundred and fifty thouſand peſos<note n="*" place="bottom">Gomara, c. 164.</note>. Hinojoſa, who, by his early defection from Pizarro, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the fleet to Gaſca, decided the fate of Peru, obtained a diſtrict of country affording two hundred thouſand peſos of yearly value<note n="†" place="bottom">Vega, p. 11. lib. vi. c. 3.</note>. While ſuch rewards were dealt out to the principal offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with more than royal munificence, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſhares were conferred upon thoſe of inferior rank.</p>
                  <p>SUCH a rapid change of fortune produced its natural effects. It gave birth to new wants,<note place="margin">Their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and luxury.</note> and new deſires. Veterans, long accuſtomed to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and toil, acquired of a ſudden a taſte for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and inconſiderate diſſipation, and indulged in all the exceſſes of military licentiouſneſs.

Civil diſcord never raged with a more fell ſpirit than among the Spaniards in Peru. To all the paſſions which uſually envenom conteſts among countrymen, avarice was added, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their enmity more rancorous. Eagerneſs to ſeize the valuable forfeitures expected upon the death of every opponent, ſhut the door againſt mercy. To be wealthy, was of itſelf ſufficient to expoſe a man to accuſation, or to ſubject him to puniſhment. On the ſlighteſt ſuſpicions, Pizarro condemned many of the moſt opulent inhabitants in Peru to death. Carvajal, without ſearching for any pretext to juſtify his cruelty, cut off many more. The number of thoſe who ſuffered by the hand of the executioner, was not much inferior to what fell in the field<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XLVII.</note>; and the greater part was condemned without the formality of any legal trial.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">and want of faith.</note>THE violence with which the contending parties treated their opponents was not accompanied with its uſual attendants, attachment and fidelity to thoſe with whom they acted. The ties of honour, which ought to be held ſacred among ſoldiers and the principle of integrity, interwoven as thoroughly in the Spaniſh character as in that of any nation, ſeem to have been equally forgotten. Even regard for decency, and the ſenſe of ſhame, were totally loſt. During their diſſentions, there was hardly a Spaniard in Peru who did not abandon the party which he had originally eſpouſed, betray the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates with whom he had united, and violate the engagements under which he had come. The viceroy Nugnez Vela was ruined by the treachery of Cepeda and the other judges of the royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, who were bound by the duties of their
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:034476_0770_0FFDDC05E30B7B38"/>
function to have ſupported his authority. The chief adviſers and companions of Gonzalo Pizarro's revolt, were the firſt to forſake him, and ſubmit to his enemies. His fleet was given up to Gaſca, by the man whom he had ſingled out among his officers to entruſt with that important command. On the day that was to decide his fate, an army of veterans, in ſight of the enemy, threw down their arms without ſtriking a blow, and deſerted a leader who had often conducted them to victory. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch general and avowed contempt of the principles and obligations which attach man to man, and bind them together in ſocial union, rarely occur in hiſtory. It is only where men are far removed from the ſeat of government, where the reſtraints of law and order are little felt, where the proſpect of gain is unbounded, and were immenſe wealth may cover the crimes bv which it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that we can find any parallel to the levity, the rapaciouſneſs, the perfidy and corruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent among the Spaniards in Peru.</p>

But two very intereſting objects ſtill remained to occupy the preſident's attention. The one was to find immediately ſuch employment for a multitude of turbulent and daring adventurers with which the country was filled, as might prevent them from exciting new commotions. The other, to beſtow proper gratifications upon thoſe to whoſe loyalty and valour he had been indebted for his ſucceſs. The former of theſe was in ſome meaſure accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, by appointing Pedro de Valdivia to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the conqueſt of Chili; and by empowering Diego Centeno to undertake the diſcovery of the vaſt regions bordering on the river De la Plata.

The reputation of thoſe leaders, together with the hopes of acquiring wealth, and of riſing to conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in ſome unexplored country, alluring many of the moſt indigent and deſperate ſoldiers to follow their ſtandards, drained off no inconſiderable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that mutinous ſpirit which Gaſca dreaded.</p>

But the number of claimants was great; and whilſt the vanity or avarice of every, individual fixed the value of his own ſervices, and eſtimated the recompence which he thought due to him, the pretenſions of each were ſo extravagant, that it was impoſſible to ſatisfy all. Gaſca liſtened to them one by one, with the moſt patient atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that he might have leiſure to weigh the comparative merit of their ſeveral claims with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy, he retired, with the archbiſhop of Lima and a ſingle ſecretary, to a village twelve leagues from Cuzco.

                  <p>HE was received in his native country with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal admiration of his abilities, and of his virtue. Both were, indeed, highly conſpicuous. Without army, or fleet, or public funds; with a train ſo ſimple, that only three thouſand ducats were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in equipping him<note n="*" place="bottom">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 18.</note>, he ſet out to oppoſe a formidable rebellion.

He raiſed a body of men able to cope with the veteran bands which gave law to Peru. He vanquiſhed their leader, on whoſe arms victory had hitherto attended, and in place of anarchy and uſurpation, he eſtabliſhed the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of laws, and the authority of the rightful ſovereign. But the praiſe beſtowed on his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was exceeded by that which his virtue merited. After reſiding in a country where wealth preſented allurements which had ſeduced every perſon who

After diſtributing among his countrymen poſſeſſions of greater extent and value than had ever been in the diſpoſal of a ſubject of any age or nation, he himſelf remained in his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtate of poverty; and at the very time when he brought ſuch a large recruit to the royal treaſury, he was obliged to apply by petition for a ſmall ſum to diſcharge ſome petty debts which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted during the courſe of his ſervice<note n="*" place="bottom">MS. penes me.</note>. Charles was not inſenſible to ſuch diſintereſted merit. Gaſca was received by him with the moſt diſtinguiſhing marks of eſteem, and being promoted to the biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric of Palencia, he paſſed the remainder of his days in the tranquillity of retirement, reſpected by his country, honoured by his ſovereign, and beloved by all.</p>
                  <p>NOTWITHSTANDING all Gaſca's wiſe regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the tranquillity of Peru was not of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. In a country, where the authority of government had been almoſt forgotten during the long prevalence of anarchy and miſrule, where there were diſappointed leaders ripe for revolt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious ſoldiers ready to follow them, it was not difficult to raiſe combuſtion. Several ſucceſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections deſolated the country for ſome years. But as thoſe, though fierce, were only tranſient ſtorms, excited rather by the ambition and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of particular men, than by general or public motives, the detail of them is not the object of this hiſtory. Theſe commotions in Peru, like every thing of extreme violence either in the natural or political body, were not of long duration, and by carrying off the corrupted humours which had given riſe to the diſorders, they contributed in the

end to ſtrengthen the ſociety which at firſt they threatened to deſtroy, During their fierce conteſts, ſeveral of the firſt invaders of Peru, and many of thoſe licentious adventurers whom the ſame of their ſucceſs had allured thither, fell by each other's hands. Each of the parties, as they alternately prevailed in the ſtruggle, gradually cleared the country of a number of turbulent ſpirits, by exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, proſcribing, or baniſhing their opponents. Men leſs enterpriſing, leſs deſperate, and more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to move in the path of ſober and peaceable induſtry, ſettled in Peru; and the royal authority was gradually eſtabliſhed as firmly there as in the other Spaniſh colonies.</p>

The people of both the great empires in America, like the rude tribes around them, were totally unacquainted with the uſeful metals, and the progreſs which they had made in extending their dominion over the animal creation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. The Mexicans had gone no farther than to tame and rear turkeys, ducks, a ſpecies of ſmall dogs, and rabbits<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 11. lib. vii. c. 12.</note>. By this feeble eſſay of ingenuity, the means of ſubſiſtence were rendered ſomewhat more plentiful and ſecure, than when men depend ſolely on hunting; but they had no idea of attempting to ſubdue the more robuſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, or of deriving any aid from their miniſtry in carrying on works of labour. The Peruvians ſeem to have neglected the inferior animals, and had not rendered any of them domeſtic except the duck; but they were more fortunate in taming the Llama, an animal peculiar to their country, of a form which bears ſome reſemblance to a deer, and ſome to a camel, and is of a ſize ſomewhat larger than a ſheep. Under the protection of man, this ſpecies multiplied greatly. Its wool furniſhed the Peruvians with clothing. Its fleſh with food. It was even employed as a beaſt of burden, and carried a moderate load with much patience and

It was never uſed for draught; and the breed being confined to the mountainous country, its ſervice, if we may judge by incidents which occur in the early Spaniſh writers, was not very extenſive among the Peruvians in their original ſtate.</p>
                  <p>IN tracing the line by which nations proceed towards civilization, the diſcovery of the uſeful metals, and the acquiſition of dominion over the animal creation, have been marked as ſteps of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital importance in their progreſs. In our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, long after men had attained both, ſociety continued in that ſtate which is denominated bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. Even with all that command over nature which theſe confer, many ages elapſe, before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry becomes ſo regular as to render ſubſiſtence ſecure, before the arts which ſupply the wants and furniſh the accommodations of life, are brought to any conſiderable degree of perfection, and before any idea is conceived of various inſtitutions requiſite in a well-ordered ſociety. The Mexicans and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvians, without knowledge of the uſeful metals, or the aid of domeſtic animals, laboured under diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which muſt have greatly retarded their progreſs, and in their higheſt ſtate of improvement their power was ſo limited, and their operations ſo feeble, that they can hardly be conſidered as having advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.</p>

What I have remarked concerning the defective and inaccurate information on which we muſt rely with reſpect to the condition and cuſtoms of the ſavage tribes in America, may be applied likewiſe to our knowledge of the Mexican empire. Cortes, and the rapacious adventurers who accompanied him, had not leiſure or capacity to enrich either civil or natural hiſtory with new obſervations. They undertook their expedition in queſt of one object, and ſeemed hardly to have turned their eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards any other. Or, if during ſome ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of tranquillity, when the occupations of war ceaſed, and the ardour of plunder was ſuſpended, the inſtitutions and manners of the people whom they had invaded drew their attention, the inquiries of illiterate ſoldiers were conducted with ſo little ſagacity and preciſion, that the accounts given by them of the policy and order eſtabliſhed in the Mexican monarchy are ſuperficial, confuſed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable. It is rather from indicents which they relate occaſionally, than from their own deductions and remarks, that we are enabled to form ſome idea of the genius and manners of that people. The obſcurity in which the ignorance of its conquerors involved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by the ſuperſtition of thoſe who ſucceeded them. As the memory of paſt events was preſerved among the Mexicans by figures painted on ſkins, on cotton cloth, on a kind of paſteboard, or on the bark of trees, the early miſſionaries, unable to comprehend their meaning, and ſtruck with their uncouth forms,
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:034476_0780_0FFDDC202CDDA820"/>
conceived them to be monuments of idolatry which ought to be deſtroyed, in order to facilitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Indians. In obedience to an edict iſſued by Juan de Zummaraga, a Franciſcan monk, the firſt biſhop of Mexico, as many records of the ancient Mexican ſtory as could be collected were committed to the flames. In conſequence of this fanatical zeal of the monks who firſt viſited New Spain (which their ſucceſſors ſoon began to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment), whatever knowledge of remote events ſuch rude monuments contained was almoſt entirely loſt, and no information remained concerning the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient revolutions and policy of the empire, but what was derived from tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From the experience of all nations it is manifeſt, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of paſt tranſactions can neither be long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, nor be tranſmitted with any fidelity, by tradition. The Mexican paintings, which are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have ſerved as annals of their empire, are few in number, and of ambiguous meaning. Thus, amidſt the uncertainty of the former, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of the latter, we muſt glean what intelligence can be collected from the ſcanty materials ſcattered in the Spaniſh writers<note n="†" place="bottom">In the firſt edition, I obſerved that in conſequence of the deſtruction of the ancient Mexican paintings, occaſioned by the zeal of Zummaraga, whatever knowledge they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed was <hi>entirely</hi> loſt. Every candid reader muſt have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the expreſſion was inaccurate; as in a few lines afterwards I mention ſome ancient paintings to be ſtill extant. M. Clavigero, not ſatisfied with laying hold of this inaccuracy, which I corrected in the ſubſequent editions, labours to render is more glaring, by the manner in which he quotes the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the ſentence. He reprehends with great aſperity the account which I gave of the ſcanty materials for writing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory of Mexico Vol. I Account of Writers, p. xxvi. Vol. II, 380. My words, however, are almoſt the ſame with thoſe of Torquemada, who ſeems to have been better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ancient monuments of the Mexicans than any Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh author whoſe works I have ſeen. Lib. xiv. c. 6. M. Clavigero himſelf gives a deſcription of the deſtruction of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent paintings in almoſt the ſame terms that I have uſed; and mentions, as an additional reaſon of there being ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ancient paintings known to the Spaniards, that the natives have become ſo ſolicitous to preſerve and conceal them, that it is <q>difficult, if not impoſſible, to make them part with one of them.</q> Vol. I. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though ſeveral Spaniards have carried on inquiries into the antiquities of the Mexican empire, no engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from Mexican paintings have been communicated to the public, except thoſe by Purchas, Gemelli Carreri, and Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zana. It affords me ſome ſatisfaction, that in the courſe of my reſearches, I have diſcovered two collections of Mexican paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which were unknown to former inquirers. The cut which I publiſhed is an exact copy of the original, and gives no high idea of the progreſs which the Mexicans had made in the art of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I cannot conjecture what could induce M. Clavigero to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome diſſatisfaction with me for having publiſhed it without the ſame colours it has in the original painting. p. xxix. He might have recollected, that neither Purchas, nor Gemelli Carreri, nor Lorenzana, thought it neceſſary to colour the prints which they have publiſhed, and they have never been cenſured on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. He may reſt aſſured, that though the colours in the paintings in the Imperial Library are remarkably bright, they are laid on without art, and without <q>any of that regard to light and ſhade, or the rules of perſpective,</q> which M. Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigero requires. V. II. 378. If the public expreſs any deſire to have the ſeven paintings ſtill in my poſſeſſion engraved, I am ready to communicate them. The print publiſhed by Gemelli Carreri, of the route of the ancient Mexicans when they travelled towards the lake on which they built the capital of their empire, Churchill, Vol. IV. p. 481, is the moſt finiſhed monument of art brought from the New World, and yet a very ſlight inſpection of it will ſatisfy every one, that the annals of a nation conveyed in this manner muſt be very meagre and imperfect.</note>.</p>

At length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, the Mexicans, a people more poliſhed than any of the former, advanced from the border of the Californian gulf, and took poſſeſſion of the plains adjacent to the great lake near the centre of the country. After reſiding there about fifty years, they founded a town, ſince diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which from humble beginnings ſoon grew to be the moſt conſiderable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after they were eſtabliſhed in their new poſſeſſions, continued, like other martial tribes in America, unacquainted with regal dominion, and were governed in peace, and conducted in war, by ſuch as were entitled to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence by their wiſdom or their valour. But among them, as in other ſtates whoſe power and territories become extenſive, the ſupreme authority centered at laſt in a ſingle perſon; and when the Spaniards under Cortes invaded the country, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma was the ninth monarch in order who had ſwayed the Mexican ſceptre, not by hereditary right, but by election.</p>

If, on one hand, we ſuppoſe the Mexican ſtate to have been of higher antiquity, and to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted during ſuch a length of time as the Spaniſh accounts of its civilization would naturally lead us to conclude, it is difficult to conceive how, among a people who poſſeſſed the art of recording events by pictures, and who conſidered it as an eſſential part of their national education, to teach their children to repeat the hiſtorical ſongs which cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the exploits of their anceſtors<note n="‡" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 18.</note>, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of paſt tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But in Mexico, where agriculture and induſtry had made ſome progreſs, the diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween property in land and property in goods had taken place. Both might be transferred from one perſon to another by ſale or barter; both might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend by inheritance.

The title of others to their lands was derived from the office or dignity which they enjoyed; and when deprived of the latter, they loſt poſſeſſion of the former. Both theſe modes of occupying land were deemed noble, and peculiar to citizens of the higheſt claſs. The tenure, by which the great body of the people held their property, was very different. In every diſtrict a certain quantity of land was meaſured out in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of families.

what he relates, there were in the Mexican empire thirty of this order, each of whom had in his territories about an hundred thouſand peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſubordinate to theſe, there were about three thouſand nobles of a lower claſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. viii. c. 12.</note>. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories belonging to the chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba were hardly inferior in extent to thoſe of the Mexican monarch<note n="†" place="bottom">Torquem, lib. ii. c. 57.

But all followed the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of Mexico in war, ſerving with a number of men in proportion to their domain, and moſt of them pain tribute to its monarch as their ſuperior lord.</p>

Its ſpirit and principles ſeem to have operated in the New World in the ſame manner as in the ancient. The juriſdiction of the crown as extremely limited. All real and effective authority was retained by the Mexican nobles in their own hands, and the ſhadow of it only left to the king. Jealous to exceſs of their own rights, they guarded with the moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant anxiety againſt the encroachments of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns. By a fundamental law of the empire, it was provided that the king ſhould not determine concerning any point of general importance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of a council compoſed of the

In order to ſecure full effect to thoſe conſtitutional reſtraints, the Mexican nobles did not permit their crown to deſcend by inheritance, but diſpoſed of it by election. The right of election ſeems to have been originally veſted in the whole body of nobility, but was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards committed to ſix electors, of whom the Chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba were always two. From reſpect for the family of their monarchs, the choice fell generally upon ſome perſon ſprung from it. But as the activity and valour of their prince were of greater moment to a people perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in war, than a ſtrict adherence to the order of birth, collaterals of mature age or of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed merit were often preferred to thoſe who were nearer the throne in direct deſcent<note n="‡" place="bottom">Acoſta, lib. vi. c. 24.

The ſecond is a tribute-roll, repreſenting what each conquered town paid into the royal treaſury. The third is a code of their inſtitutions, domeſtic, political, and military.

                     </gap>ea of theſe, it muſt have been a very imperfect art. The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of improving it muſt have rouzed and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened invention, and the human mind holding the ſame courſe in the New World as in in the Old, might have advanced by the ſame ſucceſſive ſteps, firſt, from an actual picture to the plain hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic; next, to the allegorical ſymbol; then to the arbitrary character; until, at length, an alphabet of letters was diſcovered, capable of expreſſing all the various combinations of ſound employed in ſpeech. In the paintings of the Mexicans we, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, perceive, that this progreſs was begun among them. Upon an attentive inſpection of the plates, which I have mentioned, we may obſerve ſome approach to the plain or ſimple hieroglyphic, where ſome principal part or circumſtance in the ſubject is made to ſtand for the whole. In the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of their kings, publiſhed by Purchas, the towns conquered by each are uniformly repreſented in the ſame manner by a rude delineation of a houſe; but in order to point out the particular towns which ſubmitted to their victorious arms, peculiar emblems, ſometimes natural objects, and ſometimes artificial figures, are employed. In the tribute-roll publiſhed by the archbiſhop of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, the houſe which was properly the picture of the town, is omitted, and the emblem alone is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:034476_0801_0FFDDC5A9AC71658"/>
to repreſent it. The Mexicans ſeem even to have made ſome advances beyond this, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the uſe of the more figurative and fanciful hieroglyphic. In order to deſcribe a monarch, who had enlarged his dominions by force of arms, they painted a target ornamented with arts, and placed it between him and thoſe towns which he ſubdued. But it is only in one inſtance, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of numbers, that we diſcern any attempt to exhibit ideas which had no corporeal form. The Mexican painters had invented artificial marks, or <hi>ſigns of convention,</hi> for this purpoſe. By means of theſe, they computed the years of their kings' reigns, as well as the amount of tribute to be paid into the royal treaſury. The figure of a circle repreſented unit, and in ſmall numbers, the computation was made by repeating it. Larger numbers were expreſſed by a peculiar mark, and they had ſuch as denoted all integral numbers, from twenty to eight thouſand. The ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their empire prevented the Mexicans from advancing farther in that long courſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts men from the labour of delineating real ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to the ſimplicity and eaſe of alphabetic writing. Their records, notwithſtanding ſome dawn of ſuch ideas as might have led to a more perfect ſtyle, can be conſidered as little more than a ſpecies of picture-writing, ſo far improved as to mark their ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the the ſavage tribes of America; but ſtill ſo defective, as to prove that they had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far beyond the firſt ſtage in that progreſs which muſt be completed before any people can be ranked among poliſhed nations <note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LIV.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THEIR mode of computing time may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a more deciſive evidence of their progreſs

in improvement. They divided their year into eighteen months, each conſiſting of twenty days, amounting in all to three hundred and ſixty. But as they obſerved that the courſe of the ſun was not completed in that time, they added five days to the year.

The Spaniſh hiſtorians, in order to magnify the valour of their countrymen, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to repreſent the dominion of Montezuma as ſtretching over all the provinces of New Spain from the northern to the Southern Ocean.

The provinces towards the north and weſt of Mexico were occupied by the <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecas,</hi> and other tribes of hunters. None of theſe recognized the Mexican monarch as their ſuperior. Even in the interior and more level country, there were ſeveral cities and provinces which had never ſubmitted to the Mexican yoke. Tlaſcala, though only twenty-one leagues from the capital of the empire, was an independent and hoſtile republic. Cholula, though ſtill nearer, had been ſubjected only a ſhort time before the arrival of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.

In ſome places he could hardly force a paſſage through impervious woods, and plains overflowed with water. In others he found ſo little cultivation, that his troops were frequently in danger of periſhing by famine. Such facts correſpond ill with the pompous deſcription which the Spaniſh writers give of Mexican police and induſtry, and convey an idea of a country nearly ſimilar to that poſſeſſed by the Indian tribes in North America.

But if buildings corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding to ſuch deſcriptions had ever exiſted in the Mexican cities, it is probable that ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of them would ſtill be viſible. From the manner in which Cortes conducted the ſiege of Mexico, we can indeed eaſily account for the total deſtruction of whatever had any appearance of ſplendour in that capital. But as only two centuries

                  <p>EVEN in a village of the rudeſt Indians, there are buildings of greater extent and elevation than common dwelling-houſes. Such as are deſtined for holding the council of the tribe, and in which all aſſemble on occaſions of public feſtivity, may be called ſtately edifices, when compared with the reſt. As among the Mexicans the diſtinction of rank was eſtabliſhed, and property was unequally divided, the number of diſtinguiſhed ſtructures in their towns would of courſe be greater than in other parts of America. But theſe ſeem not to have been either ſo ſolid or magnificent as to merit the pompous epithets which ſome Spaniſh authors employ in deſcribing them.

frequent or a more fertile ſource of deception in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the manners and arts of ſavage nations, or of ſuch as are imperfectly civilized, than that of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to them the names and phraſes appropriated to the inſtitutions and refinements of poliſhed life. When the leader of a ſmall tribe, or the head of a rude community, is dignified with the name of king or emperor, the place of his reſidence can receive no other name but that of his palace; and whatever his attendants may be, they muſt be called his court. Under ſuch appellations they acquire, in our eſtimation, an importance and dignity which does not belong to them. The illuſion ſpreads, and giving a falſe colour to every part of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, the imagination is ſo much carried away with the reſemblance, that it becomes difficult to diſcern objects as they really are. The Spaniards, when they firſt touched on the Mexican coaſt, were ſo much ſtruck with the appearance of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in policy and in the arts of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, far ſuperior to thoſe of the rude tribes with which they were hitherto acquainted, that they fancied they had at length diſcovered a civilized people in the New World. This compariſon between the people of Mexico and their uncultivated neighbours, they appear to have kept conſtantly in view, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving with admiration many things which marked the pre-eminence of the former, they employ in deſcribing their imperfect policy and infant arts, ſuch terms as are applicable to the inſtitutions of men far beyond them in improvement. Both theſe circumſtances concur in detracting from the credit due to the deſcriptions of Mexican manners by the early Spaniſh writers. By drawing a parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and thoſe of people ſo much leſs civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, they raiſed their own ideas too high. By their mode of deſcribing them, they conveyed
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:034476_0812_0FFDDC7F9030E1D8"/>
ideas to others no leſs exalted above truth. Later writers have adopted the ſtyle of the original hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and improved upon it. The colours with which De Solis delineates the character, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the actions of Montezuma, the ſplendor of his court, the laws and policy of his empire, are the ſame that he muſt have employed in exhibiting to view the monarch and inſtitutions of an highly poliſhed people.</p>
                  <p>BUT though we may admit, that the warm ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the Spaniſh writers has added ſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhment to their deſcriptions, this will not juſtify the deciſive and peremptory tone, with which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral authors pronounce all their accounts of the Mexican power, policy and laws, to be the fictions of men who wiſhed to deceive, or who delighted in the marvellous. There are few hiſtorical facts that can be aſcertained by evidence more unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable, than may be produced in ſupport of the material articles, in the deſcription of the Mexican conſtitution and manners. Eye witneſſes relate what they beheld. Men who had reſided among the Mexicans, both before and after the conqueſt, deſcribe inſtitutions and cuſtoms which were familiar to them. Perſons of profeſſions ſo different that objects muſt have preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their view under every various aſpect; ſoldiers, prieſts, and lawyers, all concur in their teſtimony. Had Cortes ventured to impoſe upon his ſovereign, by exhibiting to him a picture of imaginary manners, there wanted not enemies and rivals who were qualified to detect his deceit, and who would have rejoiced in expoſing it. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the juſt remark of an author, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity has illuſtrated, and whoſe eloquence has adorned the hiſtory of America<note n="*" place="bottom">M. l'Abbe Raynal Hiſt. philoſ. &amp; polit. &amp;c. iii. 127.</note>, this ſuppoſition
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:034476_0813_0FFDDC811F580470"/>
is in itſelf as improbable, as the attempt would have been audacious. Who among the deſtroyers of this great empire was ſo enlightened by ſcience, or ſo attentive to the progreſs and operations of men in ſocial life, as to frame a fictitious ſyſtem of policy ſo well combined and ſo conſiſtent, as that which they delineate, in their accounts of the Mexican government? Where could they have borrowed the idea of many inſtitutions in legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and police, to which, at that period, there was nothing parallel in the nations with which they were acquainted? There was not, at the beginning of the ſixteenth century, a regular eſtabliſhment of poſts for conveying intelligence to the ſovereign of any kingdom in Europe. The ſame obſervation will apply to what the Spaniards relate, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſtructure of the city of Mexico, the regulations concerning its police, and various laws eſtabliſhed for the adminiſtration of juſtice, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the happineſs of the community. Whoever is accuſtomed to contemplate the progreſs of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will often, at very early ſtages of it, diſcover a premature and unexpected dawn of thoſe ideas, which give riſe to inſtitutions that are the pride and ornament of its moſt advanced period. Even in a ſtate as imperfectly poliſhed as the Mexican empire, the happy genius of ſome ſagacious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver, excited or aided by circumſtances unknown to us, may have introduced inſtitutions which are ſeldom found but in ſocieties highly refined. But it is almoſt impoſſible that the illiterate conquerors of the New World ſhould have formed in any one inſtance a conception of cuſtoms and laws, beyond the ſtandard of improvement in their own age and country. Or if Cortes had been capable of this, what inducement had thoſe by whom he was ſuperſeded to continue the deception? Why ſhould

Their religious tenets, and the rites of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are deſcribed by them as wild and cruel in an extreme degree. Religion, which occupies no conſiderable place in the thoughts of a ſavage, whoſe conceptions of any ſuperior power are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and his ſacred rites few as well as ſimple, was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular ſyſtem, with its complete train of prieſts, temples, victims, and feſtivals. This, of itſelf, is a clear proof that the ſtate of the Mexicans was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of the ruder American tribes. But from the extravagance of their religious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the barbarity of their rites, no concluſion can be drawn with certainty concerning the degree of their civilization. For nations, long after their ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to refine, adhere to ſyſtems of ſuperſtition founded on the crude conceptions of early ages. From the genius of the Mexican religion we may, however, form a moſt juſt concluſion with reſpect to its influence upon the character of the people. The aſpect of ſuperſtition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious. Its divinities were clothed with terror, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in vengeance. They were exhibited to the people under deteſtable forms, which created horror. The figures of ſerpents, of tygers, and of other deſtructive animals, decorated their temples. Fear was the only principle that inſpired their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. Faſts, mortifications, and penances, all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, and many of them excruciating to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme degree, were the means employed to appeaſe
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:034476_0815_0FFDDC877026A518"/>
the wrath of their gods, and the Mexicans never approached their altars without ſprinkling them with blood drawn from their own bodies. But, of all offerings, human ſacrifices were deemed the moſt acceptable. This religious belief, mingling with the implacable ſpirit of vengeance, and adding new force to it, every captive taken in war was brought to the temple, was devoted as a victim to the deity, and ſacrificed with rites no leſs ſolemn than cruel<note n="*" place="bottom">Cortes Relat. ap Ramuſ. iii. 240, &amp;c.

But as by theſe knots, however varied or combined, no moral or abſtract idea, no operation or quality of the mind could be repreſented, they contributed little towards preſerving the memory of ancient events and inſtitutions. By the Mexican paintings and ſymbols, rude as they were, more knowledge of remote tranſactions ſeems to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, than the Peruvians could derive from their boaſted quipos.

Manco Capac and his conſort, taking advantage of the propenſity in the Peruvians to ſuperſtition, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of their veneration for the Sun, pretended to be children of that glorious luminary, and to deliver their inſtructions in his name, and by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from him.

                     <note place="margin">Founded in religion.</note>THE moſt ſingular and ſtriking circumſtance in the Peruvian government, is the influence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon its genius and laws. Religious ideas make ſuch a feeble impreſſion on the mind of a ſavage, that their effect upon his ſentiments and manners is hardly perceptible. Among the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, religion, reduced into a regular ſyſtem, and holding a conſiderable place in their public inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, operated with conſpicuous efficacy in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peculiar character of that people. But in Peru, the whole ſyſtem of civil policy was founded on religion. The Inca appeared not only as a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, but as the meſſenger of Heaven. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts were received not merely as the injunctions of a ſuperior, but as the mandates of the Deity. His race was to be held ſacred; and in order to preſerve it diſtinct, without being polluted by any mixture of leſs noble blood, the ſons of Manco Capac married their own ſiſters, and no perſon was ever admitted to the throne who could not claim it by ſuch a pure deſcent. To thoſe <hi>Children of the Sun,</hi> for that was the appellation beſtowed upon all the offspring of the firſt Inca, the people looked up with the reverence due to beings of a ſuperior order. They were deemed to be under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate protection of the deity from whom they iſſued, and by his every order of the reigning Inca was ſuppoſed to be dictated.</p>

This muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be the effect of every government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on pretenſions of intercourſe with ſuperior powers. Such accordingly was the blind ſubmiſſion which the Peruvians yielded to their ſovereigns. The perſons of higheſt rank and greateſt power in their dominions acknowledged them to be of a more exalted nature; and in teſtimony of this, when admitted into their preſence, they entered with a burden upon their ſhoulders, as an emblem of their ſervitude, and willingneſs to bear whatever the Inca was pleaſed to impoſe. Among their ſubjects, force was not requiſite to ſecond their commands. Every officer entruſted with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them was revered, and, according to the account of an intelligent obſerver of Peruvian manners<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. i. c. 13.</note>, he might proceed alone from one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the empire to another without meeting op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; for, on producing a fringe from the royal <hi>Borla,</hi> an ornament of the head peculiar to the reigning Inca, the lives and fortunes of the people were at his diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>ANOTHER conſequence of eſtabliſhing govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Peru on the foundation of religion was,<note place="margin">All crimes puniſhed capitally.</note> that all crimes were puniſhed capitally. They were not conſidered as tranſgreſſions of human laws, but as inſults offered to the Deity. Each, without any diſtinction between ſuch as were ſlight and ſuch as were atrocious, called for vengeance, and could be expiated only by the blood of the offender.
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:034476_0821_0FFDDC97B13B9B70"/>
Conſonantly to the ſame ideas, puniſhment followed the treſpaſs with inevitable certainty, becauſe an offence againſt Heaven was deemed ſuch an high enormity as could not be pardoned<note n="*" place="bottom">Vega, lib. ii. c. 6.</note>. Among a people of corrupted morals, maxims of juriſprudence ſo ſevere and unrelenting, by rendering men fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and deſperate, would be more apt to multiply crimes than to reſtrain them. But the Peruvians, of ſimple manners and unſuſpicious faith, were held in ſuch awe by this rigid diſcipline, that the number of offenders was extremely ſmall. Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for monarchs, enlightened and directed, as they believed, by the divinity whom they adored, prompted them to their duty; the dread of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which they were taught to conſider as unavoidable vengeance inflicted by offended Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, withheld them from evil.</p>

The Peruvians had not, indeed, made ſuch progreſs in obſervation or inquiry, as to have attained juſt conceptions of the deity; nor was there in their language any proper name or appellation of the Supreme Power, which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that they had formed any idea of him as the Creator and Governor of the World<note n="*" place="bottom">Acoſta, lib. v. c. 3.</note>.

But the Incas never ſtained his altars with human blood, nor could they conceive that their beneficent father the Sun would be delighted with ſuch horrid victims<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE LXI.</note>.

The idols of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered province were carried in trumph to the great temple at Cuzco<note n="*" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iv. c. 4.

                  <p>THE ſtate of property in Peru was no leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular than that of religion, and contributed,<note place="margin">Peculiar ſtate of property.</note> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, towards giving a mild turn of character to the people. All the lands capable of cultivation were divided into three ſhares. One was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the Sun, and the product of it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the erection of temples, and furniſhing what was requiſite towards celebrating the public rites of religion. The ſecond belonged to the Inca, and was ſet apart as the proviſion made by the community for the ſupport of government. The third and largeſt ſhare was reſerved for the maintenance of the people, among whom it was parcelled out. Neither individuals, however, nor communities, had a right of excluſive property in the portion ſet apart for their uſe. They poſſeſſed it only for a year, at the expiration of which a new diviſion was made in proportion to the rank, the number, and exigencies of each family. All thoſe lands were cultivated by the joint induſtry of the community. The people, ſummoned by a proper officer, repaired in a body to the fields, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their common taſk, while ſongs and muſical

By this ſingular diſtribution of territory, as well as by the mode of cultivating it,<note place="margin">Effects of this.</note> the idea of a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and of mutual ſubſerviency, was continually inculcated. Each individual felt his connection with thoſe around him, and knew that he depended on their friendly aid for what increaſe he was to reap. A ſtate thus conſtituted may be conſidered as one great family, in which the union of the members was ſo complete, and the exchange of good offices ſo perceptible, as to create ſtronger attachment, and to bind man to man in cloſer intercourſe, than ſubſiſted under any form of ſociety eſtabliſhed in America.

The quantity of ſoil under cultivation was not left to the diſcretion of individuals, but regulated by public authority in proportion to the exigencies of the community. Even the calamity of an unfruitful ſeaſon was but little felt, for the product of the lands conſecrated to the Sun, as well as thoſe ſet apart for the Incas, being depoſited in the <hi>Tambes,</hi> or public ſtorehouſes, it remained there as a ſtated proviſion for times of ſcarcity<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. i. c. 14.

to the demands of the ſtate, the invention and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Peruvians were called forth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exertions, by certain defects peculiar to their climate and ſoil. All the vaſt rivers that flow from the Andes take their courſe eaſtward to the Atlantic Ocean. Peru is watered only by ſome ſtreams which ruſh down from the mountains like torrents. A great part of the low country is ſandy and barren, and never refreſhed with rain. In order to render ſuch an unpromiſing region fertile, the ingenuity of the Peruvians had recourſe to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expedients. By means of artificial canals conducted, with much patience and conſiderable art, from the torrents that poured acroſs their country, they conveyed a regular ſupply of moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to their fields<note n="*" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. i. c. 4. Vega, lib. v. c. 1, &amp; 24.</note>.

                     </gap>, they are entitled to notice as ſingular proofs of induſtry and of art. The uſe of the plough, indeed, was unknown to the Peruvians. They turned up the earth with a kind of mattock of hard wood<note n="‡" place="bottom">Zarate, lib. i. c. 8.</note>. Nor was this labour deemed ſo degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to be devolved wholly upon the women. Both ſexes joined in performing this neceſſary work.

                  <p>THE ſuperior ingenuity of the Peruvians is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, likewiſe,<note place="margin">Their buildings.</note> in the conſtruction of their houſes and public buildings. In the extenſive plains which ſtretch along the Pacific Ocean, where the ſky is perpetually ſerene, and the climate mild, their houſes were very properly of a fabric ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſlight. But in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the viciſſitude of ſeaſons is known, and their rigour felt, houſes were conſtructed with greater ſolidity. They were generally of a ſquare form, the walls about eight feet high, built with bricks hardened in the ſun, without any windows, and the door low and ſtrait. Simple as theſe ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were, and rude as the materials may ſeem to be of which they were formed, they were ſo durable, that many of them ſtill ſubſiſt in different parts of Peru, long after every monument that might have conveyed to us any idea of the domeſtic ſtate of the other American nations has vaniſhed from the face of the earth. But it was in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples conſecrated to the Sun, and in the buildings deſtined for the reſidence of their monarchs, that the Peruvians diſplayed the utmoſt extent of their art and contrivance. The deſcriptions of them by ſuch of the Spaniſh writers as had an opportunity of contemplating them, while, in ſome meaſure, entire, might have appeared highly exaggerated, if the ruins which ſtill remain, did not vouch the truth of their relations. Theſe ruins of ſacred or royal buildings are found in every province of the empire, and by their frequency demonſtrate that they are monuments of a powerful people, who muſt have ſubſiſted, during a period of ſome extent, in

a ſtate of no inconſiderable improvement. They appear to have been edifices various in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions. Some of a moderate ſize, many of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe extent, all remarkable for ſolidity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling each other in the ſtile of architecture. The temple of Pachacamac, together with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the Inca, and a fortreſs, were ſo connected together as to form one great ſtructure, above half a league in circuit. In this prodigious pile, the ſame ſingular taſte in building is conſpicuous, as in other works of the Peruvians. As they were unacquainted with the uſe of the pulley, and other mechanical powers, and could not elevate the large ſtones and bricks which they employed in building to any conſiderable height, the walls of this edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in which they ſeem to have made their greateſt effort towards magnificence, did not riſe above twelve feet from the ground. Though they had not diſcovered the uſe of mortar or of any other cement in building, the bricks or ſtones were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſo much nicety, that the ſeams can hardly be diſcerned<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXIII.</note>. The apartments, as far as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of them can be traced in the ruins, were ill-diſpoſed, and afforded little accommodation. There was not a ſingle window in any part of the building; and as no light could enter but by the door, all the apartments of largeſt dimenſion muſt either have been perfectly dark, or illuminated by ſome other means. But with all theſe, and many other imperfections that might be mentioned in their art of building, the works of the Peruvians which ſtill remain, muſt be conſidered as ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous efforts of a people unacquainted with the uſe of iron, and convey to us an high idea of the power poſſeſſed by their ancient monarchs.</p>

The Peruvian roads were only fifteen feet in breadth<note n="*" place="bottom">Cieca, c. 60.</note>, and in many places ſo ſlightly formed, that time has effaced every veſtige of the courſe in which they ran. In the low country little more ſeems to have been done, than to plant trees or to fix poſts at certain intervals, in order to mark the proper rout to travellers. To open a path through the mountainous country was a more arduous taſk. Eminences were levelled, and hollows filled up, and for the preſervation of the road it was fenced with a bank of turf. At proper diſtances, Tambos, or ſtorehouſes, were erected for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inca and his attendants, in their progreſs, through his dominions. From the manner in which the road was originally formed in this higher and

It was a capital object of Roman policy to open a communication with all the provinces of their extenſive empire, by means of thoſe roads which are juſtly conſidered as one of the nobleſt monuments both of their wiſdom and their power. But during the long reign of barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm, the Roman roads were neglected or deſtroyed; and at the time when the Spaniards entered Peru, no kingdom in Europe could boaſt of any work of public utility that could be compared with the great roads formed by the Incas.</p>

Some expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, however, was to be found for paſſing them. The Peruvians, from their unacquaintance with the uſe of arches, and their inability to work in wood, could not conſtruct bridges either of ſtone or tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

They had not, indeed, attained the art of ſinking a ſhaft into the bowels of the earth, and penetrating to the riches concealed there; but they hollowed deep caverns on the banks of rivers and the ſides of mountains, and emptied ſuch veins as did not dip ſuddenly beyond their reach. In other places, where the vein lay near the ſurface, they dug pits to ſuch a depth, that the perſon who worked below could throw out the ore, or hand it up in baſkets<note n="*" place="bottom">Ramuſio, iii. 414, A.</note>. They had diſcovered the art of ſmelting and refining this, either by the ſimple ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of fire, or where the ore was more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and impregnated with foreign ſubſtances, by placing it in ſmall ovens or furnaces, on high grounds, ſo artificially conſtructed, that the draught of air performed the function of a bellows, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with which they were totally unacquainted. By this ſimple device, the purer ores were ſmelted with facility, and the quantity of ſilver in Peru was ſo conſiderable, that many of the utenſils employed in the functions of common life were made of it<note n="†" place="bottom">Acoſta, lib. iv. c. 4, 5.

                  <p>IN other works of mere curioſity or ornament,<note place="margin">Works of elegance.</note> their ingenuity has been highly celebrated. Many ſpecimens of thoſe have been dug out of the <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> or mounds of earth, with which the Peruvians covered the bodies of the dead. Among theſe are mirrors of various dimenſions, of hard ſhining ſtones highly poliſhed; veſſels of earthen ware of different forms; hatchets, and other inſtruments, ſome deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined for war, and others for labour. Some were of flint, ſome of copper, hardened to ſuch a degree by an unknown proceſs, as to ſupply the place of iron on ſeveral occaſions. Had the uſe of thoſe tools formed of copper been general, the progreſs of the Peruvians in the arts might have been ſuch, as to emulate that of more cultivated nations. But either the metal was ſo rare, or the operation by which it was hardened ſo tedious, that their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of copper were few, and ſo extremely ſmall, that they ſeem to have been employed only in ſlighter works. But even to ſuch a circumſcribed uſe of this imperfect metal, the Peruvians were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for their ſuperiority to the other people of America in various arts<note n="*" place="bottom">Ulloa Voy. tom. i. 381, &amp;c.

                  <p>FROM the want of cities in Peru,<note place="margin">Little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe.</note> another conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence followed. There was little commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe among the inhabitants of that great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The activity of commerce is coeval with the foundation of cities; and from the moment that the members of any community ſettle in conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able numbers in one place, its operations become vigorous. The citizen muſt depend for ſubſiſtence on the labour of thoſe who cultivate the ground. They, in return, muſt receive ſome equivalent. Thus mutual intercourſe is eſtabliſhed, and the productions of art are regularly exchanged for the fruits of agriculture. In the towns of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can empire, ſtated markets were held, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could ſupply any want or deſire of man was an object of commerce. But in Peru, from the ſingular mode of dividing property, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which the people were ſettled, there was hardly any ſpecies of commerce carried on between different provinces<note n="†" place="bottom">Vega, lib. vi. c. 8.</note>, and the community was leſs acquainted with that active intercourſe, which is at once a bond of union, and an incentive to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
                  <p>BUT the unwarlike ſpirit of the Peruvians was the moſt remarkable,<note place="margin">Unwarlike ſpirit of the Peruvians.</note> as well as moſt fatal defect in

their character<note n="*" place="bottom">Xeres, 190. Sancho ap. Ramuſ. iii. 372. Herrera, dec. 5. lib. i. c. 3.</note>. The greater part of the rude nations of America oppoſed their invaders with undaunted ferocity, though with little conduct or ſucceſs. The Mexicans maintained the ſtruggle in defence of their liberties, with ſuch perſevering fortitude, that it was with difficulty the Spaniards triumphed over them. Peru was ſubbued at once, and almoſt without reſiſtance; and the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opportunities of regaining their freedom, and of cruſhing their oppreſſors, were loſt through the timidity of the people. Though the traditional hiſtory of the Peruvians repreſents all the Incas as warlike princes, frequently at the head of armies, which they led to victory and conqueſt; few ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of ſuch a martial ſpirit appear in any of their operations ſubſequent to the invaſion of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. The influence, perhaps, of thoſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which rendered their manners gentle, gave their minds this unmanly ſoftneſs; perhaps, the conſtant ſerenity and mildneſs of the climate may have enervated the vigour of their frame; perhaps, ſome principle in their government, unknown to us, was the occaſion of this political debility. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may have been the cauſe, the fact is certain, and there is not an inſtance in hiſtory of any people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

facts occur in the Spaniſh writers, which diſcover a conſiderable remainder of barbarity in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. A cruel cuſtom, that prevailed in ſome of the moſt ſavage tribes, ſubſiſted among the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians. On the death of the Incas, and of other eminent perſons, a conſiderable number of their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants was put to death, and interred around their Guacas, that they might appear in the next world with their former dignity, and be ſerved with the ſame reſpect. On the death of Huana-Capac, the moſt powerful of their monarchs, above a thouſand victims were doomed to accompany him to the tomb<note n="*" place="bottom">Acoſta, lib. v. c. 7.</note>. In one particular, their manners appear to have been more barbarous than thoſe of moſt rude tribes. Though acquainted with the uſe of fire in preparing maize, and other vegetables for food; they devoured both fleſh and fiſh perfectly raw, and aſtoniſhed the Spaniards, with a practice repugnant to the ideas of all civilized people<note n="†" place="bottom">Xerez. p. 190.

The war was conducted by an officer of abilities; and after being protracted for three years, chiefly by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of purſuing the fugitives over mountains and through defiles which were almoſt impaſſable, it terminated, in the year 1771, in the final ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the tribes, which had been ſo long the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of terror to the two provinces. In the courſe of this ſervice, the Spaniards marched through countries into which they ſeem not to have pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated before that time, and diſcovered mines of ſuch value, as was aſtoniſhing even to men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the riches contained in the mountains of the New World. At Cineguilla, in the province of Sonora, they entered a plain of fourteen leagues in extent, in which, at the depth of only ſixteen inches, they found gold in grains of ſuch a ſize, that ſome of them weighed nine marks, and in ſuch quantities, that in a ſhort time with a few labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they collected a thouſand marks of gold in grains, even without taking time to waſh the earth that had been dug, which appeared to be ſo rich, that perſons of ſkill computed that it might yield what would be equal in value to a million of peſos. Before the end of the year 1771,<note place="margin">Probable effects of this.</note> above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons were ſettled in Cineguilla, under the government of proper magiſtrates, and the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral eccleſiaſtics.

Though the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of this country, if we may judge from its ſituation, muſt be very deſirable; the Spaniards have made ſmall progreſs in peopling it. Towards the cloſe of the laſt century, the Jeſuits, who had great merit in exploring this neglected province, and in civilizing its rude inhabitants, imperceptibly acquired a dominion over it as complete as that which they poſſeſſed in their miſſions in Paraguay, and they laboured to introduce into it the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, and to govern the natives by the ſame maxims.

The Incas had eſtabliſhed their dominion in ſome of its northern diſtricts; but in the greater part of the country, its gallant and high-ſpirited inhabitants maintained their independence. The Spaniards, allured by the ſame of its opulence, early attempted the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of it under Diego Almagro; and after his death, Pedro de Valdivia reſumed the deſign. Both met with fierce oppoſition. The former relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the enterprize in the manner which I have mentioned<note n="†" place="bottom">Book vi. c. 60, &amp;c.</note>.

Franciſco de Villagra, Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia's lieutenant, by his ſpirited conduct, checked the natives in their career, and ſaved the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Spaniards from deſtruction. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, all the champaign country along the coaſt was ſubjected to the Spaniſh dominion. The mountainous country is ſtill poſſeſſed by the Puel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Araucos, and other tribes of its original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, formidable neighbours to the Spaniards;
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:034476_0846_0FFDDCDB46A90078"/>
with whom, during the courſe of two centuries, they have been obliged to maintain almoſt perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hoſtility, ſuſpended only by a few intervals of inſecure peace.</p>
                  <p>THAT part of Chili then,<note place="margin">Excellence of its cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſoil.</note> which may properly be deemed a Spaniſh province, is a narrow diſtrict, extended along the coaſt from the deſert of Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camas to the iſland of Chiloe, above nine hundred miles. Its climate is the moſt delicious in the New World, and is hardly equalled by that of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion on the face of the earth. Though bordering on the Torrid Zone, it never feels the extremity of heat, being ſcreened on the eaſt by the Andes, and refreſhed from the weſt by cooling ſea-breezes. The temperature of the air is ſo mild and equable, that the Spaniards give it the preference to that of the ſouthern provinces in their native country. The fertility ot the ſoil correſponds with the benignity of the climate, and is wonderfully accommodated to European productions. The moſt valuable of theſe, corn, wine, and oil, abound in Chili, as if they had been native to the country. All the fruits imported from Europe attain to full maturity there. The animals of our hemiſphere not only multiply, but improve in this delightful region. The horned cattle are of larger ſize than thoſe of Spain. Its breed of horſes ſurpaſſes, both in beauty and in ſpirit, the famous Andaluſian race, from which they ſprung. Nor has nature exhauſted her bounty on the ſurface of the earth; ſhe has ſtored its bowels with riches. Valuable mines of gold, of ſilver, of copper, and of lead, have been diſcovered in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of it.</p>
                  <p>A COUNTRY diſtinguiſhed by ſo many bleſſings,<note place="margin">Cauſe of its being neglected by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</note> we may be apt to conclude, would early become a favourite ſtation of the Spaniards, and muſt have been cultivated with peculiar predilection and care.
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:034476_0847_0FFDDCDDE85706C0"/>
Inſtead of this, a great part of it remains unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. In all this extent of country, there are not above eighty thouſand white inhabitants, and about three times that number of negroes and people of a mixed race. The moſt fertile ſoil in America lies uncultivated, and ſome of its moſt promiſing mines remain unwrought. Strange as this neglect of the Spaniards to avail themſelves of advantages, which ſeemed to court their acceptance, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, the cauſes of it can be traced. The only intercourſe of Spain with its colonies in the South Sea, was carried on during two centuries by the annual fleet to Porto-bello. All the produce of theſe colonies was ſhipped in the ports of Callao, or Arica in Peru, for Panama, and carried from thence acroſs the iſthmus. All the commodities which they received from the mother-country, were conveyed from Panama, to the ſame harbours. Thus both the exports and imports of Chili paſſed through the hands of merchants ſettled in Peru. Theſe had of courſe a profit on each; and in bou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now that Spain, from motives which I ſhall mention hereafter, has adopted a new ſyſtem, and carries on her commerce with the colonies in the South Sea, by ſhips which go round Cape Horn, a direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe is opened between Chili and the mother-country. The gold, the ſilver, and the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the province will be exchanged in its own harbours for the manufactures of Europe, Chili may ſpeedily riſe into that importance among

It may ſupply them with wine, with cattle, with horſes, with hemp, and many other articles for which they now depend upon Europe. Though the new ſyſtem has been eſtabliſhed only a few years, thoſe effects of it begin already to be obſerved<note n="*" place="bottom">Campomanes, ii. 157.</note>. If it ſhall be adhered to with any ſteadineſs for half a century, one may venture to foretel, that popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, induſtry, and opulence will advance in this province with rapid progreſs.</p>

But as diſputes have long ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the courts of Spain and Portugal, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its boundaries, which, it is probable, will be ſoon finally aſcertained, either amicably, or by the deciſion of the ſword, I chuſe to reſerve my account of this northern diviſion, until I enter upon the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Portugueſe America, with which it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately connected; and, in relating it, I ſhall be able, from authentic materials, ſupplied both by Spain and Portugal, to give a full and accurate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the operations and views of the jeſuits, in rearing that ſingular fabric of policy in America,
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:034476_0849_0FFDDCE8A57B7198"/>
which has drawn ſo much attention, and has been ſo imperfectly underſtood. The latter diviſion of the province contains the governments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, and to theſe I ſhall at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my obſervations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">View of the latter.</note>THE Spaniards entered this part of America by the river De la Plata; and though a ſucceſſion of cruel diſaſters beſel them in their early attempts to eſtabliſh their dominion in it, they were encouraged to perſiſt in the deſign, at firſt by the hopes of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering mines in the interior country, and afterwards by the neceſſity of occupying it, in order to prevent any other nation from ſettling there, and penetrating by this rout into their rich poſſeſſions in Peru. But except at Buenos-Ayres, they have made no ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any conſequence in all the vaſt ſpace which I have mentioned. There are, indeed, ſcattered over it, a few places on which they have beſtowed the name of towns, and to which they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to add ſome dignity, by erecting them into biſhoprics; but they are no better than paltry vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, each with two or three hundred inhabitants. One circumſtance, however, which was not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally foreſeen, has contributed to render this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, though thinly peopled, of conſiderable import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. The province of Tucuman, together with the country to the ſouth of the Plata, inſtead of being covered with wood like other parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, forms one extenſive open plain, almoſt without a tree. The ſoil is a deep fertile mould, watered by many ſtreams deſcending from the Andes, and clothed in perpetual verdure. In this rich paſturage, the horſes and cattle imported by the Spaniards from Europe have multiplied to a degree which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exceeds belief. This has enabled the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants not only to open a lucrative trade with Peru, by ſupplying it with cattle, horſes, and mules, but
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:034476_0850_0FFDDCEDF7FB2188"/>
to carry on a commerce no leſs beneficial, by the exportation of hides to Europe. From both, the colony has derived great advantages. But its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious ſituation for carrying on contraband trade, has been the chief ſource of its proſperity. While the court of Madrid adhered to its ancient ſyſtem, with reſpect to its communication with America, the river De la Plata lay ſo much out of their courſe of Spaniſh navigation, that interlopers, almoſt without any riſk of being either obſerved or obſtructed, could pour in European manufactures in ſuch quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, that they not only ſupplied the wants of the colony, but were conveyed into all the eaſtern diſtricts of Peru. When the Portugueſe in Braſil extended their ſettlements to the banks of Rio de la Plata, a new channel was opened, by which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited commodities flowed into the Spaniſh ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, with ſtill more facility, and in greater abundance. This illegal traffic, however detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the parent ſtate, contributed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the ſettlement, which had the immediate benefit of it, and Buenos-Ayres became gradually a populous and opulent town. What may be the effect of the alteration lately made in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this colony, the nature of which ſhall be deſcribed in the ſubſequent Book, cannot hitherto be known.</p>
                  <p>ALL the other territories of Spain in the New World, the iſlands excepted,<note place="margin">Other ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of Spain.</note> of whoſe diſcovery and reduction I have formerly given an account, are comprehended under two great diviſions; the former denominated the kingdom of Tierra Firme, toe provinces of which ſtretch along the Atlantic, from the eaſtern frontier of New Spain to the mouth of the Orinoco; the latter, the New King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Granada, ſituated in the interior country.

Though it was in this part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent that the Spaniards firſt began to plant co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, they have made no conſiderable progreſs in peopling it. As the country is extremely moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, deluged with rain during a good part of the year, remarkably unhealthful, and contains no mines of great value, the Spaniards would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have abandoned it altogether, if they had not been allured to continue by the excellence of the harbour of Porto-bello on the one ſea, and that of Panama on the other. Theſe have been called the keys to the communication between the north and ſouth ſea, between Spain and her moſt valuable colonies. In conſequence of this advantage, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nama has become a conſiderable and thriving town. The peculiar noxiouſneſs of its climate has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Porto-bello from increaſing in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. As the intercourſe with the ſettlements in the pacific Ocean is now carried on by another channel, it is probable that both Porto-bello and Panama will decline, when no longer nouriſhed and enriched by that commerce<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which they were indebted for their proſperity, and even their exiſtence.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Carthagena and Santa Martha.</note>THE provinces of Carthagena and Santa Martha ſtretch to the eaſtward of the iſthmus of Darien. The country ſtill continues mountainous, but its vallies begin to expand, are well watered, and extremely fertile. Pedro de Heredia ſubjected this part of America to the crown of Spain, about the year 1532. It is thinly peopled, and of courſe ill cultivated. It produces, however, a variety of valuable drugs, and ſome precious ſtones, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly emeralds. But its chief importance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the harbour of Carthagena, the ſafeſt
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:034476_0852_0FFDDCF35D6089D0"/>
and beſt fortified of any in the American dominions of Spain. In a ſituation ſo favourable, commerce ſoon began to flouriſh. As early as the year 1544, it ſeems to have been a town of ſome note. But when Carthagena was choſen as the port in which the galeons ſhould firſt begin to trade on their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival from Europe, and to which they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to return, in order to prepare for their voyage homeward, the commerce of its inhabitants was ſo much favoured by this arrangement, that it ſoon became one of the moſt populous, opulent, and beautiful cities in America. There is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, reaſon to apprehend, that it has reached its higheſt point of exaltation, and that it will be ſo far affected by the change in the Spaniſh ſyſtem of trade with America, which has withdrawn from it the deſirable viſits of the galeons, as to feel at leaſt a temporary decline. But the wealth now collected there, will ſoon find or create employment for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and may be turned with advantage into ſome new channel. Its harbour is ſo ſafe, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently ſituated for receiving commodities from Europe, its merchants have been ſo long accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to convey theſe into all the adjacent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that it is probable they will ſtill retain this branch of trade, and Carthagena continue to be a city of great importance.</p>
                  <p>THE province contiguous to Santa Martha on the eaſt, was firſt viſited by Alonſo de Ojeda,<note place="margin">Venezuela.</note> in the year 1499<note n="*" place="bottom">Book ii. vol. i. p. 212.</note>; and the Spaniards, on their landing there, having obſerved ſome huts in an Indian village built upon piles, in order to raiſe them above the ſtagnated water which covered the plain, were led to beſtow upon it the name of Venezuela, or Little Venice, by their uſual propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:034476_0853_0FFDDCFA214F9298"/>
to find a reſemblance between what they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in America, and the objects which were familiar to them in Europe. They made ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to ſettle there, but with little ſucceſs. The final reduction of the province was accompliſhed by means very different from thoſe to which Spain was indebted for its other acquiſitions in the New World. The ambition of Charles V. often engaged him in operation of ſuch variety and extent, that his revenues were not ſufficient to defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of carrying them into execution. Among other expedients for ſupplying the deficiency of his funds, he had borrowed large ſums from the Velſers of Augſburgh, the moſt opulent merchants at that time in Europe. By way of retribution for theſe, or in hopes, perhaps, of obtaining a new loan, he beſtowed upon them the province of Venezuela, to be held as an hereditary fief from the crown of Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, on condition that within a limited time they ſhould render themſelves maſters of the country, and eſtabliſh a colony there. Under the direction of ſuch perſons, it might have been expected, that a ſettlement would have been eſtabliſhed on maxims very different from thoſe of the Spaniards, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calculated to encourage ſuch uſeful induſtry, as mercantile proprietors might have known to be the moſt certain ſource of proſperity and opulence. But unfortunately they committed the execution of their plan to ſome of thoſe ſoldiers of fortune with which Germany abounded in the ſixteenth century. Theſe adventurers, impatient to amaſs riches, that they might ſpeedily abandon a ſtation which they ſoon diſcovered to be very uncomfortable, inſtead of planting a colony in order to cultivate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the country, wandered from diſtrict to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict in ſearch of mines, plundering the natives with unfeeling rapacity, or oppreſſing them by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

of intolerable taſks. In the courſe of a few years, their avarice and exactions, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with which thoſe of the Spaniards were mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, deſolated the province ſo completely, that it could hardly afford them ſubſiſtence, and the Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers relinquiſhed a property from which the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate conduct of their agents left them no hope of ever deriving any advantage<note n="*" place="bottom">Civedo y Bagnos Hiſt. de Venezuela, p. 11, &amp;c.</note>.

                  <p>THE New Kingdom of Granada is ſo far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the level of the ſea, that though it approaches almoſt to the equator, the climate is remarkably temperate. The fertility of its vallies is not inferior to that of the richeſt diſtricts in America, and its higher grounds yield gold and precious ſtones of various kinds. It is not by digging into the bowels of the earth that this gold is found; it is mingled with the ſoil near the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and ſeparated from it by repeated waſhing with water. This operation is carried on wholly by negro ſlaves; for though the chill ſubterranean air has been diſcovered, by experience, to be ſo fatal to them, that they cannot be employed with advantage in the deep ſilver mines, they are more capable of performing the other ſpecies of labour than Indians. As the natives in the New Kingdom of Granada are exempt from that ſervice, which has waſted their race ſo rapidly in other parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the country is ſtill remarkably populous. Some diſtricts yield gold with a profuſion no leſs wonderful than that in the vale of Cineguilla, which I have formerly mentioned, and it is often found in large <hi>pepitas,</hi> or grains, which manifeſt the abundance in which it is produced. On a riſing ground near Pampalona, ſingle labourers have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in a day what was equal in value to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand peſos<note n="*" place="bottom">Piedrahita Hiſt. del.

A late governor of Santa Fé brought with him to Spain a lump of pure gold, eſtimated to be worth ſeven hundred and forty pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This, which is, perhaps, the largeſt and fineſt ſpecimen ever found in the New World, is
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:034476_0856_0FFDDD0740C334A8"/>
now depoſited in the royal cabinet of Madrid. But without founding any calculation on what is rare and extraordinary, the value of the gold uſually collected in this country, particularly in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Popayan and Choco, is of conſiderable amount. Its towns are populous and flouriſhing. The number of inhabitants in almoſt every part of the country daily increaſes. Cultivation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of various kinds begin to be encouraged, and to proſper. A conſiderable trade is carried on with Carthagena, the produce of the mines, and other commodities, being conveyed down the great river of St. Magdalen to that city. On another quarter, the New Kingdom of Granada has a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Atlantic by the river Orinoco; but the country which ſtretches along its banks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eaſt, is little known, and imperfectly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the Spaniards.</p>

with the people of our hemiſphere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, both in the iſlands, and in ſeveral parts of the continent, and have touched upon various cauſes of their rapid conſumption. Wherever the inhabitants of America had reſolution to take arms in defence of their liberty and rights, many periſhed in the unequal conteſt, and were cut off by their fierce invaders. But the greateſt deſolation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after the ſword was ſheathed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors were ſettled in tranquillity.<note place="margin">Cauſes of this in the iſlands, and ſome parts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent.</note> It was in the iſlands, and in thoſe provinces of the continent which ſtretch from the Gulf of Trinidad to the confines of Mexico, that the fatal effects of the Spaniſh dominion were firſt and moſt ſenſibly felt. All theſe were occupied either by wandering tribes of hunters, or by ſuch as had made but ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in cultivation and induſtry. When they were compelled by their new maſters to take up a fixed reſidence, and to apply to regular labour; when taſks were impoſed upon them diſproportioned to their ſtrength, and were exacted with unrelenting ſeverity, they poſſeſſed not vigour either of mind or of body to ſuſtain this unuſual load of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Dejection and deſpair drove many to end their lives by violence. Fatigue and famine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed more. In all thoſe extenſive regions, the original race of inhabitants waſted away; in ſome it was totally extinguiſhed. In Mexico, where a powerful and martial people diſtinguiſhed their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Spaniards by efforts of courage wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a better fate, great numbers fell in the field; and there, as well as in Peru, ſtill greater numbers periſhed under the hardſhips of attending the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh armies in their various expeditions and civil wars, worn out with the inceſſant toil of carrying their baggage, proviſions, and military ſtores.</p>

and Peru, as the inconſiderate policy with which they eſtabliſhed their new ſettlements. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were temporary calamities, fatal to individuals; the latter was a permanent evil, which, with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual conſumption, waſted the nation. When the provinces of Mexico and Peru were divided among the conquerors, each was eager to obtain a diſtrict, from which he might expect an inſtantaneous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for all his ſervices. Soldiers, accuſtomed to the careleſſneſs and diſſipation of a military life, had neither induſtry to carry on any plan of regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cultivation, nor patience to wait for its ſlow but certain returns, Inſtead of ſettling in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies occupied by the natives, where the fertility of the ſoil would have amply rewarded the diligence of the planter, they choſe to fix their ſtations in ſome of the mountainous regions, frequent both in New Spain and in Peru. To ſearch for mines of gold and ſilver, was the chief object of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. The proſpects which this opens, and the alluring hopes which it continually preſents corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond wonderfully with the ſpirit of enterprize and adventure that animated the firſt emigrants to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in every part of their conduct. In order to puſh forward thoſe favourite projects, ſo many hands were wanted, that the ſervice of the natives became indiſpenſably requiſite. They were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly compelled to abandon their ancient ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations in the plains, and driven in crowds to the mountains. This ſudden tranſition from the ſultry climate of the vallies, to the chill penetrating air peculiar to high lands in the torrid zone; exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant labour, ſcanty or unwholeſome nouriſhment, and the deſpondency occaſioned by a ſpecies of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to which they were not accuſtomed, and of which they ſaw no end, affected them nearly as much as their leſs induſtrious countrymen in the

Without attending to theſe, many authors, aſtoniſhed at the ſuddenneſs of the deſolation, have aſcribed this unexampled event to a ſyſtem of policy no leſs profound than atrocious. The Spaniards, as they pretend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own inability to occupy the vaſt regions which they had diſcovered, and foreſeeing the impoſſibility of maintaining their authority over a people infinitely ſuperior to themſelves in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in order to preſerve the poſſeſſion of America, reſolved to exterminate the inhabitants, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting a great part of the country into a deſert, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſecure their own dominion over it<note n="§" place="bottom">See NOTE LXIX.</note>. But nations ſeldom extend their views to objects ſo remote, or lay their plans ſo deep; and, for the honour of humanity we may obſerve, that no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever deliberately formed ſuch an execrable ſcheme. The Spaniſh monarchs, far from acting upon any ſuch ſyſtem of deſtruction, were uniformly ſolicitous for the preſervation of their new ſubjects. With Iſabella, zeal for propagating the Chriſtian

faith, together with the deſire of communicating the knowledge of truth, and the conſolations of religion, to people deſtitute of ſpiritual light, were more than oſtenſible motives for encouraging Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus to attempt his diſcoveries. Upon his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſhe endeavoured to fulfil her pious purpoſe, and manifeſted the moſt tender concern to ſecure not only religious inſtruction, but mild treatment, to that inoffenſive race of men ſubjected to her crown<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXX.</note>. Her ſucceſſors adopted the ſame ideas; and, on many occaſions, which I have mentioned, their authority was interpoſed in the moſt vigorous exertions, to protect the people of America from the oppreſſion of their Spaniſh ſubjects. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for this purpoſe were numerous, and often repeated. They were framed with wiſdom, and dictated by humanity. After their poſſeſſions in the New World became ſo extenſive, as might have excited ſome apprehenſion of difficulty in retaining their dominion over them, the ſpirit of their regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations was as mild as when their ſettlements were confined to the iſlands alone. Their ſolicitude to protect the Indians ſeems rather to have augmented as their acquiſitions increaſed; and from ardour to accompliſh this, they enacted, and endeavoured to enforce the execution of laws, which excited a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable rebellion in one of their colonies, and ſpread alarm and diſaffection through all the reſt. But the avarice of individuals was too violent to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by the authority of laws. Rapacious and daring adventurers, far removed from the ſeat of government, little accuſtomed to the reſtraints of military diſcipline while in ſervice, and ſtill leſs diſpoſed to reſpect the feeble juriſdiction of civil power in an infant colony, deſpiſed or eluded every
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:034476_0862_0FFDDD15676CB278"/>
regulation that ſet bounds to their exactions and tyranny. The parent ſtate, with perſevering atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, iſſued edicts to prevent the oppreſſion of the Indians, the coloniſts, regardleſs of theſe, or truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their diſtance for impunity, continued to conſider and treat them as ſlaves. The governors themſelves, and other officers employed in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, ſeveral of whom were as indigent and rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as the adventurers over whom they preſided, were too apt to adopt their contemptuouts ideas of the conquered people; and inſtead of checking, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged or connived at their exceſſes. The deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the New World ſhould not then be charged on the court of Spain, or be conſidered as the effect of any ſyſtem of policy adopted there. It ought to be imputed wholly to the indigent and often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled adventurers, whoſe fortune it was to be the conquerors and firſt planters of America, who, by meaſures no leſs inconſiderate than unjuſt, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted the edicts of their ſovereign, and have brought diſgrace upon their country.</p>

                     <note place="margin">nor the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>WITH ſtill greater injuſtice, have many authors repreſented the intolerating ſpirit of the Roman Catholic religion, as the cauſe of exterminating the Americans, and have accuſed the Spaniſh eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of animating their countrymen to the ſlaughter of that innocent people, as idolators and enemies of God. But the firſt miſſionaries who viſited Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, though weak and illiterate, were pious men. They early eſpouſed the defence of the natives, and vindicated their character from the aſperſions of their conquerors, who, deſcribing them as inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being formed to the offices of civil life, or of comprehending the doctrines of religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that they were a ſubordinate race of men, on whom the hand of nature had ſet the mark of ſervitude. From the accounts which I have given
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:034476_0863_0FFDDD1A45F31A10"/>
of the humane and perſevering zeal of the Spaniſh miſſionaries, in protecting the helpleſs flock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, they appear in a light which reflects luſtre upon their function. They were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of peace, who endeavoured to wreſt the rod from the hands of oppreſſors. To their powerful interpoſition, the Americans were indebted for every regulation tending to mitigate the rigour of their fate. The clergy in the Spaniſh ſettlements, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as well as ſecular, are ſtill conſidered by the Indians as their natural guardians, to whom they have recourſe under the hardſhips and exactions to which they are too often expoſed<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>BUT,<note place="margin">The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Indians ſtill remaining.</note> notwithſtanding the rapid depopulation of America, a very conſiderable number of the native race ſtill remains both in Mexico and Peru, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in thoſe parts which were not expoſed to the firſt fury of the Spaniſh arms, or deſolated by the firſt efforts of their induſtry, ſtill more ruinous. In Guatimala, Chiapa, Nicaragua, and the other delightful provinces of the Mexican empire, which ſtretch along the South-ſea, the race of Indians is ſtill numerous. Their ſettlements in ſome places are ſo populous, as to merit the name of cities<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXII.</note>. In the three audiences into which New Spain is divided, there are at leaſt two millions of Indians; a pitiful remnant, indeed, of its ancient population, but ſuch as ſtill forms a body of people ſuperior in number to that of all the other inhabitants of this extenſive country<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXI.</note>. In Peru ſeveral diſtricts, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the kingdom of Quito, are occupied almoſt entirely by Indians. In other provinces they are mingled with the Spaniards, and in many of their ſettlements are almoſt the only perſons who practiſe the mechanic arts, and fill moſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior <note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXIII.</note>

As the inhabitants both of Mexico and Peru were accuſtomed to a fixed reſidence, and to a certain degree of regular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, leſs violence was requiſite in bringing them to ſome conformity with the European modes of civil life. But wherever the Spaniards ſettled among the ſavage tribes of America, their attempts to incorporate with them have been always fruitleſs, and often fatal to the natives. Impatient of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, and diſdaining labour as a mark of ſervility, they either abandoned their original ſeats, and ſought for independence in mountains and foreſts inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to their oppreſſors, or periſhed when reduced to a ſtate repugnant to their ancient ideas and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.

                     <note place="margin">General ideas of the policy of Spain in its colonies.</note>BUT the eſtabliſhments of the Spaniards in the New World, though fatal to its ancient inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, were made at a period when that monarchy was capable of forming them to beſt advantage. By the union of all its petty kingdoms, Spain was become a powerful ſtate, equal to ſo great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. Its monarchs, having extended their prerogative far beyond the limits which once cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed the regal power in every kingdom of Europe, were hardly ſubject to controul, either in concerting or in executing their meaſures. In every wide extended empire, the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be ſimple, and the ſovereign authority ſuch, that its reſolutions may be taken with promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and may pervade the whole with ſufficient force. Such was the power of the Spaniſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, when they were called to deliberate concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mode of eſtabliſhing their dominion over
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:034476_0865_0FFDDD1E75F66460"/>
the moſt remote provinces, which had ever been ſubjected to any European ſtate. In this delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they felt themſelves under no conſtitutional reſtraint, and that, as independent maſters of their own reſolves, they might iſſue the edicts requiſite for modelling the government of the new colonies, by a mere act of prerogative.</p>
                  <p>THIS early interpoſition of the Spaniſh crown,<note place="margin">Early inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the regal authority.</note> in order to regulate the policy and trade of its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, is a peculiarity which diſtinguiſhes their progreſs from that of the colonies of any other European nation. When the Portugueſe, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and French, took poſſeſſion of the regions in America which they now occupy, the advantages which theſe promiſed to yield were ſo remote and uncertain, that their colonies were ſuffered to ſtruggle through a hard infancy, almoſt without guidance or protection from the parent ſtate. But gold and ſilver, the firſt productions of the Spaniſh ſettlements in the New World, were more alluring, and immediately attracted the attention of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs. Though they had contributed little to the diſcovery, and almoſt nothing to the conqueſt of the New World, they inſtantly aſſumed the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its legiſlators; and having acquired a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of dominion formerly unknown, they formed a plan for exerciſing it, to which nothing ſimilar occurs in the hiſtory of human affairs.</p>
                  <p>THE fundamental maxim of Spaniſh juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with reſpect to America,<note place="margin">All power and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty veſted in the crown.</note> is to conſider what has been acquired there as veſted in the crown rather than in the ſtate. By the bull of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander VI. on which, as its great charter, Spain founded its right, all the regions that had been, or ſhould be diſcovered, were beſtowed as a free gift upon Ferdinand and Iſabella. They and their ſucceſſors were uniformly held to be the univerſal

The people who compoſed infant ſettlements were entitled to no privileges inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the ſovereign, or that ſerved as a barrier againſt the power of the crown. It is true, that when towns were built, and formed into bodies corporate, the citizens were permitted to elect their own magiſtrates, who governed them by laws which the community enacted. Even in the moſt deſpotic ſtates, this feeble ſpark of liberty is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. But in the cities of Spaniſh America, this juriſdiction is merely municipal, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the regulation of their own interior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and police.

                        </gap>e an excluſive trade.</note>THE firſt object of the Spaniſh monarchs was to ſecure the productions of the colonies to the parent ſtate, by an abſolute prohibition of any intercourſe with foreign nations. They took poſſeſſion of America by right of conqueſt, and conſcious not only of the feebleneſs of their infant ſettlements, but aware of the difficulty in eſtabliſhing their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over regions ſo extenſive, or in retaining ſo many reluctant nations under the yoke, they dreaded the intruſion of ſtrangers; they even ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their inſpection, and endeavoured to keep them at a diſtance from their coaſts. This ſpirit of jealouſy and excluſion, which at firſt was natural, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps neceſſary, augmented as their poſſeſſions in America extended, and the value of them came to be more fully underſtood. In conſequence of it, a ſyſtem of colonizing was introduced, to which there had hitherto been nothing ſimilar among mankind. In the ancient world, it was not uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to ſend forth colonies. But they were of two kinds only. They were either migrations, which ſerved to diſburden a ſtate of its ſuperfluous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, when they multiplied too faſt for the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which they occupied; or they were military detachments, ſtationed as garriſons in a conquered province. The colonies of ſome Greek republics, and the ſwarms of northern barbarians which ſettled
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:034476_0873_0FFDDD32A9C45E18"/>
in different parts of Europe, were of the firſt ſpecies. The Roman colonies were of the ſecond. In the former, the connection with the mother-country quickly ceaſed, and they became independent ſtates. In the latter, as the disjunction was not complete, the dependence continued. In their American ſettlements,<note place="margin">Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> the Spaniſh monarchs took what was peculiar to each, and ſtudied to unite them. By ſending colonies to regions ſo remote, by eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in each a form of interior policy and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under diſtinct governors, and with peculiar laws, they disjoined them from the mother-country. By retaining in their own hands the rights of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as well as that of impoſing taxes, together with the power of nominating the perſons who filled every department of executive government, civil or military, they ſecured their dependence upon the parent ſtate. Happily for Spain, the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of her colonies was ſuch, as rendered it poſſible to reduce this new idea into practice. Almoſt all the countries which ſhe had diſcovered and occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, lay within the tropics. The productions of that large portion of the globe are different from thoſe of Europe, even in its moſt ſouthern provinces. The qualities of the climate and of the ſoil natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally turn the induſtry of ſuch as ſettle there into new channels. When the Spaniards firſt took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their dominions in America, the precious metals which they yielded, were the only object that attracted their attention. Even when their efforts began to take a better direction, they employed themſelves almoſt wholly in rearing ſuch peculiar productions of the climate, as, from their rarity or value, were of chief demand in the mother-country. Allured by vaſt proſpects of immediate wealth, they diſdained to waſte their induſtry on what was leſs lucrative, but of ſuperior moment.
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:034476_0874_0FFDDD366F1B5380"/>
In order to render it impoſſible to correct this error, and to prevent them from making any efforts in induſtry which might interfere with thoſe of the mother-country, the eſtabliſhment of ſeveral ſpecies of manufactures, and even the culture of the vine, or olive, are prohibited in the Spaniſh colonies<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXV.</note>, under ſevere penalties<note n="†" place="bottom">B. Ulloa Retab. des Manuf. &amp;c. p. 206.</note>. They muſt truſt entirely to the mother-country for the objects of primary neceſſity. Their clothes, their furniture, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of labour, their luxuries, and even a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of the proviſions which they conſume, were imported from Spain. During a great part of the ſixteenth century, Spain, poſſeſſing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive commerce and flouriſhing manufactures, could ſupply with eaſe the growing demands of her colonies, from her own ſtores. The produce of their mines and plantations was given in exchange for theſe. But all that the colonies received, as well as all that they gave, was conveyed in Spaniſh bottoms. No veſſel belonging to the colonies was ever permitted to carry the commodities of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to Europe. Even the commercial intercourſe of one colony with another, was either abſolutely prohibited, or limited by many jealous reſtrictions. All that America yields flows into the ports of Spain; all that it conſumes muſt iſſue from them. No foreigner can enter its colonies without expreſs permiſſion; no veſſel of any foreign nation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their harbours; and the pains of death, with confiſcation of moveables, are denounced againſt every inhabitant who preſumes to trade with them<note n="‡" place="bottom">Recopil. lib. ix. tit. xxvii. l. i. 4, 7, &amp;c.</note>. Thus the colonies are kept in a ſtate of perpetual pupillage; and by the introduction of this

commercial dependence, a refinement in policy of which Spain ſet the firſt example to the European nations, the ſupremacy of the parent ſtate hath been maintained over remote colonies during two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies and a half.</p>
                  <p>SUCH are the capital maxims to which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh monarchs ſeem to have attended in forming their new ſettlements in America.<note place="margin">Slow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</note> But they could not plant with the ſame rapidity that they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and from many concurring cauſes, their progreſs has been extremely ſlow, in filling up the immenſe void which their devaſtations had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned. As ſoon as the rage for diſcovery and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture began to abate, the Spaniards opened their eyes to dangers and diſtreſſes, which at firſt they did not perceive, or had deſpiſed. The numerous hardſhips with which the members of infant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have to ſtruggle, the diſeaſes of unwholeſome climates, fatal to the conſtitution of Europeans; the difficulty of bringing a country, covered with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, into culture; the want of hands neceſſary for labour in ſome provinces, and the ſlow reward of induſtry, in all unleſs where the accidental diſcovery of mines enriched a few fortunate adventurers, were evils univerſally felt and magnified. Diſcouraged by the view of theſe, the ſpirit of migration was ſo much damped, that ſixty years after the diſcovery of the New World, the number of Spaniards in all its provinces is computed not to have exceeded fifteen thouſand<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXVI.</note>.</p>

of people in any new ſettlement, property in land ought to be divided into ſmall ſhares, and the alienation of it ſhould be rendered extremely eaſy<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Smith's Inquiry, ii. 166.</note>. But the rapaciouſneſs of the Spaniſh conquerors of the New World paid no regard to this fundamental maxim of policy; and as they poſſeſſed power, which enabled them to gratify the utmoſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of their wiſhes, many ſeized diſtricts of great extent, and held them as <hi>encomiendas.</hi> By degrees they obtained the privilege of converting a part of theſe into <hi>Mayoraſges,</hi> a ſpecies of fief, introduced into the Spaniſh ſyſtem of feudal juriſprudence<note n="†" place="bottom">Recop. lib. iv. tit. iii l. 24.</note>, which can neither be divided nor alienated. Thus a great portion of landed property, under this rigid form of entail, is withheld from circulation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends from father to ſon unimproved, and of little value either to the proprietor or to the community. In the account which I have given of the reduction of Peru, various examples occur of enormous tracts of country occupied by ſome of the conquerors<note n="‡" place="bottom">Book vi. p. 139.</note>. The exceſſes in other provinces were ſimilar, for as the value of the lands which the Spaniards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, was originally eſtimated according to the number of Indians which lived upon them, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica was in general ſo thinly peopled, that only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts of great extent could afford ſuch a number of labourers as might be employed in the mines with any proſpect of conſiderable gain. The pernicious effects of thoſe radical errors in the diſtribution and nature of property in the Spaniſh ſettlements, are felt through every department of induſtry, and may be conſidered as one great cauſe of a progreſs in population ſo much ſlower than that which has taken place in better conſtituted colonies<note n="§" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXVII.</note>.</p>

                     <pb n="371" facs="unknown:034476_0877_0FFDDD3E4BD1FC58"/>TO this we may add, that the ſupport of the enormous and expenſive fabric of their eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment,<note place="margin">and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal policy.</note> has been a burden on the Spaniſh colonies, which has greatly retarded the progreſs of population and induſtry. The payment of tithes is a heavy tax on induſtry; and if the exaction of them be not regulated and circumſcribed by the wiſdom of the civil magiſtrate, it becomes intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ruinous. But, inſtead of any reſtraint on the claims of eccleſiaſtics, the inconſiderate zeal of the Spaniſh legiſlators admitted them into America in their full extent, and at once impoſed on their infant colonies a burden which is in no ſlight degree oppreſſive to ſociety, even in its moſt improved ſtate. As early as the year 1501, the payment of tithes in the colonies was enjoined, and the mode of it regulated by law. Every article of primary neceſſity, towards which the attention of new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers muſt naturally be turned, is ſubjected to that grievous exaction<note n="*" place="bottom">Recop. lib. i. tit xiv. l. 2.</note>. Nor were the demands of the clergy confined to articles of ſimple and eaſy cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

To the weight of this legal impoſition, the bigotry of the American Spaniards has made many volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary additions. From their fond delight in the external pomp and parade of religion, and from ſuperſtitious reverence for eccleſiaſtics of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, they have beſtowed profuſe donatives on churches and monaſteries, and have unprofitably waſted a large proportion of that wealth, which might have nouriſhed and given vigour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive labour in growing colonies.</p>

The court of Spain, from a refinement of diſtruſtful policy, cheriſhes thoſe ſeeds of diſcord, and foments this mutual jealouſy, which not only prevents the two moſt powerful claſſes of its ſubjects in the New World from combining againſt the parent ſtate, but

But it has been more owing to licentious indulgence, than to compliance with this injunction of their ſovereigns, that this mixed breed has multiplied ſo greatly, as to conſtitute a conſiderable part of the population in all the Spaniſh ſettlements. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtages of deſcent in this race, and the gradual variations of ſhade until the African black, or the copper colour of America, brighten into an Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean complexion, are accurately marked by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and each diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar name.

In ſeveral of their ſettlements, particularly in New Spain, negroes are moſtly employed in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic ſervice. They form a principal part in the train of luxury, and are cheriſhed and careſſed by their ſuperiors, to whoſe vanity and pleaſures they are equally ſubſervient.

Elevated by this diſtinction, they have aſſumed ſuch a tone of ſuperiority over the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and treat them with ſuch inſolence and ſcorn, that the antipathy between the two races has become implacable. Even in Peru, where negroes ſeem to be more numerous, and are employed in field-work as well as domeſtic ſervice, they maintain their aſcendant over the Indians, and the mutual hatred of one to the other ſubſiſts with equal violence. The laws have induſtriouſly fomented this averſion, to which accident gave riſe, and, by moſt rigorous injunctions, have endeavoured to prevent every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe that might form a bond of union between the two races.

                     <note place="margin">Their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>BY the famous regulations of Charles V. in 1542, which have been ſo often mentioned, the high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the conquerors of the New World, who conſidered its inhabitants as ſlaves, to whoſe ſervice they had acquired a full right of property, were finally abrogated. From that period, the Indians have been reputed freemen, and entitled to the privileges of ſubjects. When admitted into this rank, it was deemed juſt, that they ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the ſupport and improvement of the ſociety which had adopted them as members. But as no conſiderable benefit could be expected from the voluntary efforts of men unacquainted with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular induſtry, and averſe to labour, the court of Spain found it neceſſary to fix and ſecure, by proper regulations,<note place="margin">Tax im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on them.</note> what it thought reaſonable to exact from them. With this view, an annual tax

was impoſed upon every male, from the age of eighteen to fifty; and at the ſame time, the nature as well as the extent of the ſervices which they might be required to perform, were aſcertained with preciſion.

Recopil. lib. vi. tit. v. l. 42. Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luyt, vol. iii. p 461.</note>. The right of levying this tribute likewiſe varies. In America, every Indian is either an immediate vaſſal of the crown, or depends upon ſome ſubject to whom the diſtrict in which he reſides has been granted for a limited time, under the denomination of an <hi>encomienda.</hi> In the former caſe about three-fourths of the tax is paid into the royal treaſury; in the latter, the ſame proportion of it belongs to the holder of the grant. When Spain firſt took poſſeſſion of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the greater part of it was parcelled out among its conquerors, or thoſe who firſt ſettled there, and but a ſmall portion reſerved for the crown. As thoſe grants which were made for two lives only<note n="†" place="bottom">Recopil. lib. vi tit. viii. l. 48. Solorz. de Ind Jure, lib. ii. c 16</note>, reverted ſucceſſively to the ſovereign, he had it in his power either to diffuſe his favours by grants to new proprietors, or to augment his own revenue by valuable annexations<note n="‡" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXX.</note>. Of theſe, the latter has been frequently choſen; the number of Indians now depending immediately on the crown, is much greater than in the firſt age after the conqueſt, and this branch of the royal revenue continues to extend.</p>

Thoſe ſervices, however, which can now be legally exacted, are very different from the taſks originally impoſed upon the Indians. The nature of the work which they muſt perform is defined, and an equitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence is granted for their labour. The ſtated ſervices demanded of the Indians may be divided into two branches. They are either employed in works of primary neceſſity, without which ſociety cannot ſubſiſt comfortably, or are compelled to labour in the mines, from which the Spaniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies derive their chief value and importance. In conſequence of the former, they are obliged to aſſiſt in the culture of maize, and other grain of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſumption; in tending cattle; in erecting edifices of public utility; in building bridges; and in forming high roads<note n="*" place="bottom">Recopil lib. vi. tit xiii. l. 19.

Theſe regulate the petty affairs of the people under them according to maxims of juſtice, tranſmitted to them by tradition from their anceſtors. To the Indians, this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, lodged in ſuch friendly hands, affords ſome conſolation; and ſo little formidable is this dignity to their new maſters, that they often allow it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend by hereditary right<note n="**" place="bottom">Solorz de Jure Ind. lib. i. c. 26.

It is his
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:034476_0886_0FFDDD55C9317848"/>
function, as the name implies, to aſſert the rights of the Indians; to appear as their defender in the courts of juſtice; and, by the interpoſition of his authority to ſet bounds to the encroachments and exactions of his countrymen<note n="*" place="bottom">Solorz, lib. i. c. 17. p 201.

                  <p>SUCH are the leading principles in the juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and policy by which the Indians are now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned in the provinces belonging to Spain. In thoſe regulations of the Spaniſh monarchs, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover no traces of that cruel ſyſtem of extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they have been charged with adopting; and if we admit, that the neceſſity of ſecuring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence for their colonies, or the advantages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from working the mines, give them a right to avail themſelves of the labour of the Indians, we muſt allow, that the attention with which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and recompence that labour, is provident and
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:034476_0887_0FFDDD028B5CB8D0"/>
ſagacious. In no code of laws is greater ſolicitude diſplayed, or precautions multiplied with more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent concern for the preſervation, the ſecurity, and the happineſs of the ſubject, than we diſcover in the collection of the Spaniſh laws for the Indies. But thoſe later regulations, like the more early edicts which have been already mentioned, have too often proved ineffectual remedies againſt the evils which they were intended to prevent. In every age, if the ſame cauſes continue to operate, the ſame effects muſt follow. From the immenſe diſtance between the power entruſted with the execution of laws, and that by whoſe authority they are enacted, the vigour even of the moſt abſolute government muſt relax, and the dread of a ſuperior, too remote to obſerve with accuracy, or to puniſh with diſpatch, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly abate. Notwithſtanding the numerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the Spaniſh monarch, the Indians ſtill ſuffer on many occaſions, both from the avarice of individuals, and from the exactions of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, who ought to have protected them; unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable taſks are impoſed; the term of their labour is prolonged beyond the period fixed by law, and they groan under many of the inſults and wrongs which are the lot of a dependent people<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXXIV.</note>. From ſome information on which I can depend, ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion abounds more in Peru, than any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. But it is not general. According to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, even of thoſe authors who are moſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to exaggerate the ſufferings of the Indians, they, in ſeveral provinces, enjoy not only eaſe, but afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; they poſſeſs large farms; they are maſters of numerous herds and flocks: and by the knowledge which they have acquired of European arts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, are ſupplied not only with the neceſſaries, but with many luxuries of life<note n="†" place="bottom">Gage's Survey, p. 85, 90, 104, 119, &amp;c.</note>.</p>

Notwithſtanding the ſuperſtitious veneration with which the Spaniards are devoted to the Holy See, the vigilant and jealous policy of Ferdinand early prompted him to take precautions againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of the papal dominion into America. With this view,<note place="margin">Reſtraints on the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> he ſolicited Alexander VI. for a grant to the crown of the tithes in all the newly-diſcovered countries<note n="*" place="bottom">Bulla Alex. vi.

Solorz. de Jure Ind. ii. p. 498.</note>, which he obtained on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his making proviſion for the religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the natives. Soon after Julius II. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, and his ſucceſſors, the right of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, and the abſolute diſpoſal of all eccleſiaſtical benefices there<note n="†" place="bottom">Bulla Julii, ii. 1508, ap Solorz de Jure Ind. ii. 509.</note>. But theſe pontiffs, unacquainted with the value of what he demanded, beſtowed thoſe donations with an inconſiderate liberality, which their ſucceſſors have often lamented, and wiſhed to recal. In conſequence of thoſe grants, the Spaniſh monarchs have become in effect the heads of the American church. In them the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of its revenues is veſted. Their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of perſons to ſupply vacant benefices is inſtantly confirmed by the pope. Thus, in all Spaniſh America, authority of every ſpecies centers in the crown. There no colliſion is known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſpiritual and temporal juriſdiction. The king is the only ſuperior, his name alone is heard of, and no dependence upon any foreign power has been introduced. Papal bulls cannot be admitted into America, nor are they of any force there, until they have been previouſly examined, and approved

To this limitation of the papal juriſdiction, equally ſingular, whether we conſider the age and nation in which it was deviſed, or the jealous attention with which Ferdinand and his ſucceſſors have ſtudied to maintain it in full force<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid lib. i. tit. vii. l. 55. paſſim.</note>, Spain is indebted, in a great meaſure, for the uniform tranquillity which has reigned in her American dominions.</p>

Even the Spaniſh monarchs, on ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, ſeem to have been alarmed with the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſpirit ſo adverſe to the increaſe and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of their colonies, that they have endeavoured to check it<note n="†" place="bottom">Herrera, dec. v. lib ix. c. 1, 2.

leſs diſtinguiſhed than their brethern in Spain, for literary accompliſhments of any ſpecies; and though by the ample proviſion which has been made for the American church, many of its members enjoy the eaſe and independence which are favourable to the cultivation of ſcience, the body of ſecular clergy has hardly, during two centuries and a half, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one author whoſe works convey ſuch uſeful information, or poſſeſs ſuch a degree of merit, as to be ranked among thoſe which attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enlightened nations.<note place="margin">of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars.</note> But the greateſt part of the eccleſiaſtics in the Spaniſh ſettlements are regulars. On the diſcovery of America, a new field opened to the pious zeal of the monaſtic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and, with a becoming alacrity, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent forth miſſionaries to labour in it. The firſt attempt to inſtruct and convert the Americans, was made by monks; and, as ſoon as the conqueſt of any province was completed, and its eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eſtabliſhment began to aſſume ſome form, the popes permitted the miſſionaries of the four mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant orders, as a reward for their ſervices, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of parochial charges in America, to perform all ſpiritual functions, and to receive the tithes, and other emoluments of the benefice, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the juriſdiction of the biſhop of the dioceſe, or being ſubject to his cenſures. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, a new career of uſefulneſs, as well as new objects of ambition preſented themſelves. Whenever a call is made for a freſh ſupply of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, men of the moſt ardent and aſpiring minds, impatient under the reſtraint of a cloiſter, weary of its inſipid uniformity, and fatigued with the irkſome repetition of its frivolous functions, offer their ſervice with eagerneſs, and repair to the New World in queſt of liberty and diſtinction. Nor do they purſue diſtinction without ſucceſs. The

higheſt eccleſiaſtical honours, as well as the moſt lucrative preferments in Mexico and Peru, are often in the hands of regulars; and it is chiefly to the monaſtic orders that the Americans are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for any portion of ſcience which is culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated among them. They are almoſt the only Spaniſh eccleſiaſtics, from whom we have received any accounts, either of the civil or natural hiſtory of the various provinces in America. Some of them, though deeply tinged with the indelible ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of their profeſſion, have publiſhed books which give a favourable idea of their abilities. The natural and moral hiſtory of the New World, by the Jeſuit Acoſta, contains more accurate obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, perhaps, a more ſound ſcience, than are to be found in any deſcription of remote countries publiſhed in the ſixteenth century.</p>
                  <p>BUT the ſame diſguſt with monaſtic life,<note place="margin">Diſſolute manners of ſome of them.</note> to which America is indebted for ſome inſtructors of worth and abilities, filled it with others of a very different character. The giddy, the profligate, the avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, to whom the poverty and rigid diſcipline of a convent are intolerable, conſider a miſſion to America as a releaſe from mortification and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. There they ſoon obtain ſome parochial charge, and far removed, by their ſituation, from the inſpection of their monaſtic ſuperiors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt, by their character, from the juriſdiction of their dioceſan<note n="*" place="bottom">Avendano Theſ. Indie. ii. 253.</note>, they are hardly ſubject to any controul. According to the teſtimony of the moſt zealous catholics, many of the regular clergy in the Spaniſh ſettlements are not only deſtitute of the virtues becoming their profeſſion, but regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of that external decorum and reſpect for the opinion of mankind, which preſerve a reſemblance
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:034476_0894_0FFDDC6CB92D3500"/>
of worth where the reality is wanting. Secure of impunity, ſome regulars, in contempt of their vow of poverty, engage openly in commerce; and are ſo rapaciouſly eager in amaſſing wealth, that they become the moſt grievous oppreſſors of the Indians, whom it was their duty to have protected. Others, with no leſs flagrant violation of their vow of chaſtity, indulge with little diſguiſe in the moſt diſſolute licentiouſneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE LXXXVI.</note>.</p>
                  <p>VARIOUS ſchemes have been propoſed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing enormities ſo manifeſt and ſo offenſive. Several perſons, no leſs eminent for piety than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, have contended, that the regulars, in conformity to the canons of the church, ought to be confined within the walls of their cloiſters, and ſhould no longer be permitted to encroach on the functions of the ſecular clergy. Some public-ſpirited magiſtrates, from conviction of its being neceſſary to deprive the regulars of a privilege be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed at firſt with good intention, but of which time and experience had diſcovered the pernicious effects,<note place="margin">1618.</note> openly countenanced the ſecular clergy in their attempts to aſſert their own rights.

They had recourſe to their uſual arts. They alarmed the ſuperſtitious, by repreſenting the proceedings of the viceroy as innovations fatal to religion. They employed all the refinements of intrigue, in order to gain perſons in power; and ſeconded by the powerful influence of the Jeſuits, who claimed and enjoyed all the privileges which belonged to the Mendicant orders in America, they made a deep

impreſſion on a bigotted prince, and a weak mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. The ancient practice was tolerated. The abuſes which it occaſioned continued to increaſe, and the corruption of monks, exempt from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of diſcipline, and the inſpection of any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, became a diſgrace to religion. At laſt, as the veneration of the Spaniards for the monaſtic orders began to abate,<note place="margin">June 23, 1757.</note> and the power of the Jeſuits was on the decline, Ferdinand VI. ventured to apply the only effectual remedy by iſſuing an edict, prohibiting regulars of every denomination from taking the charge of any pariſh with the cure of ſouls; and declaring, that on the demiſe of the preſent incumbents, none but ſecular prieſts, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the juriſdiction of their dioceſans, ſhall be preſented to vacant benefices<note n="*" place="bottom">Rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If this regulation is carried into execution with ſteadineſs in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree proportional to the wiſdom with which it is framed, a very conſiderable reformation may take place in the eccleſiaſtical ſtate of Spaniſh America, and the ſecular clergy may gradually become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable body of men.

For this, various rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:034476_0896_0FFDDD5C1F6D0758"/>
may be aſſigned. The firſt miſſionaries, in their ardour to make proſelytes, admitted the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of America into the chriſtian church, without previous inſtruction in the doctrines of religion, and even before they themſelves had acquired ſuch knowledge of the Indian language, as to be able to explain to the natives the myſteries of faith, or the precepts of duty. Reſting upon a ſubtle diſtinction in ſcholaſtic theology, between that degree of aſſent which is founded on a complete knowledge and conviction of duty, and that which may be yielded when both theſe are imperfect, they adopted this ſtrange practice, no leſs inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of a religion which addreſſes itſelf to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of men, than repugnant to the dictates of reaſon. As ſoon as any body of people over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by dread of the Spaniſh power, moved by the example of their own chiefs, incited by levity, or yielding from mere ignorance, expreſſed the ſlighteſt deſire of embracing the religion of their conquerors, they were inſtantly baptized.

force, or mingled an attachment to its doctrines and rites with that ſlender knowledge of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity which they had acquired. Theſe ſentiments the new converts tranſmitted to their poſterity, into whoſe minds they have ſunk ſo deep, that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh eccleſiaſtics, with all their induſtry, have not been able to eradicate them. The religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of their anceſtors are ſtill remembered, and held in honour by many of the Indians, both in Mexico and Peru; and whenever they think themſelves out of reach of inſpection by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, they aſſemble and celebrate their idolatrous rites<note n="*" place="bottom">Voy. de Ulloa, i. 341.

                  <p>BUT this is not the moſt unſurmountable obſtacle to the progreſs of Chriſtianity among the Indians. The powers of their uncultivated underſtandings are ſo limited, their obſervations and reflections reach ſo little beyond the mere objects of ſenſe, that they ſeem hardly to have the capacity of forming abſtract ideas, and poſſeſs not language to expreſs them. To ſuch men, the ſublime and ſpiritual doctrines of Chriſtianity muſt be, in a great meaſure, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. The numerous and ſplendid cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the popiſh worſhip catch the eye, pleaſe and intereſt them; but when their inſtructors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to explain the articles of faith, with which thoſe external obſervances are connected, though the Indians may liſten with patience, they ſo little conceive the meaning of what they hear, that their acquieſcence does not merit the name of belief. Their indifference is ſtill greater than their incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Attentive only to the preſent moment, and ingroſſed by the objects before them, the Indians ſo ſeldom reflect upon what is paſt, or take thought

for what is to come, that neither the promiſes nor threats of religion, make much impreſſion upon them; and while their foreſight rarely extends ſo far as the next day, it is almoſt impoſſible to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with ſolicitude about the concerns of a future world. Aſtoniſhed equally at their ſlowneſs of comprehenſion, and at their inſenſibility, ſome of the early miſſionaries pronounced them a race of men ſo brutiſh, as to be incapable of underſtanding the firſt principles of religion. A council held at Lima decreed, that, on account of this incapacity, they ought to be excluded from the ſacrament of the Euchariſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Torquem. lib. xvi. c. 20.</note>. Though Paul III. by his famous bull, iſſued in the year 1537, declared them to be rational creatures, entitled to all the privileges of Chriſtians<note n="†" place="bottom">Torquem lib. xvi. c. 25.

From this idea of their incapacity and imperfect knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when the zeal of Philip II. eſtabliſhed the inquiſition in America in the year 1570, the Indians were exempted from the juriſdiction of that ſevere tribunal<note n="§" place="bottom">Recop. lib. vi. tit. i. l. 35.</note>, and ſtill continue under the inſpection of their dioceſans.

                  <p>FROM this brief ſurvey,<note place="margin">Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spaniſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.</note> ſome idea may be formed of the interior ſtate of the Spaniſh colonies. The various productions with which they ſupply and enrich the mother-country, and the ſyſtem of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe between them, come next in order to be explained. If the dominions of Spain in the New World had been of ſuch moderate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as bore a due proportion to the parent ſtate, the progreſs of her colonizing might have been attended with the ſame benefit as that of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But when, in leſs than half a century, her inconſiderate rapacity had ſeized on countries larger than all Europe, her inability to fill ſuch vaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions with a number of inhabitants ſufficient for the cultivation of them, was ſo obvious, as to give a wrong direction to all the efforts of the coloniſts. They did not form compact ſettlements, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, circumſcribed within proper limits, both in its views and operations, is conducted with that ſober perſevering ſpirit, which gradually converts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in its poſſeſſion to a proper uſe, and derives thence the greateſt advantage. Inſtead of this, the Spaniards, ſeduced by the boundleſs proſpect which opened to them, divided their poſſeſſions in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica into governments of great extent. As their number was too ſmall to attempt the regular culture of the immenſe provinces, which they occupied rather than peopled, they bent their attention to a few objects, that allured them with hopes of ſudden and exorbitant gain, and turned away with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt from the humbler paths of induſtry, which lead more ſlowly, but with greater certainty, to wealth and increaſe of national ſtrength.</p>

Accordingly, as ſoon as the ſeveral countries in America were ſubjected to the dominion of Spain, this was almoſt the only method of acquiring wealth which occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the adventurers, by whom they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. Such provinces of the continent as did not allure them to ſettle, by the proſpect of their affording gold and ſilver, were totally neglected. Thoſe in which they met with a diſappointment of the ſanguine expectations they had formed, were abandoned. Even the value of the iſlands, the firſt-fruits of their diſcoveries, and the firſt object of their attention, ſunk ſo much in their eſtimation, when the mines which had been opened in them were exhauſted, that they were deſerted by many of the planters, and left to be occupied by more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious poſſeſſors. All crowded to Mexico and Peru, where the quantities of gold and ſilver found among the natives, who ſearched for them with little induſtry and leſs ſkill, promiſed an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted ſtore, as the recompence of more intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and perſevering efforts.</p>

From that time, ſucceſſive diſcoveries have been made in both colonies, and ſilver mines are now ſo numerous, that the working of them, and of ſome few mines of gold in the province of Tierra Firmè, and the new kingdom of Granada, has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards, and is reduced into a ſyſtem no leſs complicated than intereſting. To deſcribe the nature of the various ores, the mode of extracting them from the bowels of the earth, and to explain the ſeveral proceſſes by which the metals are ſeparated from the ſubſtances with which they are mingled, either by the action of fire, or the attractive powers, of mercury, is the province of the natural philoſopher or chymiſt, rather than of the hiſtorian.</p>
                  <p>THE exuberant profuſion with which the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the New World poured forth their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, aſtoniſhed mankind,<note place="margin">Riches which they yield.</note> who had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed hitherto to receive a penurious ſupply of the precious metals, from the more ſcanty ſtores con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the mines of the ancient hemiſphere. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to principles of computation, which appear to be extremely moderate, the quantity of gold and ſilver that has been regularly entered in the ports of Spain, is equal in value to four millions ſterling annually, reckoning from the year 1492, in which America was diſcovered, to the preſent time. This, in two hundred and eighty three years, amounts to eleven hundred and thirty-two millions. Immenſe as this ſum is, the Spaniſh writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that as much more ought to be added to it, in conſideration of treaſure which has been extracted from the mines, and imported fraudulently into Spain, without paying duty to the king.

Quinqina, or Jeſuits Bark, the moſt ſalutary ſimple, perhaps, and of moſt reſtorative virtue, that Providence, in compaſſion to human infirmity, has made known unto man, is found only in Peru, to which it affords a lucrative branch of commerce.

To theſe muſt be added, an article of no inconſiderable account, the exportation of hides; for which, as well as for many of thoſe which I have enumerated, the Spaniards are more indebted to the wonderful fertility of the country than to their own foreſight and induſtry. The domeſtic animals of Europe, particularly horned cattle, have multiplied in the New World with a rapidity which almoſt exceeds belief. A few years after the Spaniards ſettled there, the herds of tame cattle became ſo numerous that their proprietors reckoned them by thouſands<note n="*" place="bottom">Oviedo ap Ramuſ iii. 101, B. Hackluyt, iii. 466, 511.</note>. Leſs attention being paid to them, as they continued to increaſe, they were ſuffered to run wild, and ſpreading over a country of boundleſs extent, under a mild cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and covered with rich paſture, their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber became immenſe. They range over the vaſt plains which extend from Buenos Ayres, towards the Andes, in herds of thirty or forty thouſand; and the unlucky traveller who once falls in among them, may proceed ſeveral days before he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entangle himſelf from among the crowd that covers the face of the earth, and ſeems to have no end. They are hardly leſs numerous in New Spain, and in ſeveral other provinces: they are killed merely for the ſake of their hides; and the ſlaughter at certain ſeaſons is ſo great, that the ſtench of their carcaſes, which are left in the field, would inſect the air, if large packs of wild dogs, and vaſt flocks of <hi>gallinazos,</hi> or American vultures, the moſt voracious of all the feathered kind, did not inſtantly devour them.

Under the reigns of Ferdinand and Iſabella, and Charles V. Spain was one of the moſt induſtrious countries in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and ſilk, were ſo extenſive, as not only to furniſh what was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for her own conſumption, but to afford a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus for exportation. When a market for them, formerly unknown, and to which ſhe alone had acceſs, opened in America, ſhe had recourſe to her domeſtic ſtore, and found there an abundant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE XCI.</note>.

By the aid which foreign trade and domeſtic induſtry give reciprocally to each other in their progreſs, the augmentation of both muſt have been rapid and entenſive, and Spain might have received the ſame acceſſion of opulence and vigour from her acquiſitions in the New World, that other powers have derived from their colonies there.</p>

Wealth, which flows in gradually, and with moderate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, feeds and nouriſhes that activity which is friendly to commerce, and calls it forth into vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-conducted exertions; but when opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence pours in ſuddenly, and with too full a ſtream, it overturns all ſober plans of induſtry, and brings along with it a taſte for what is wild and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and daring in buſineſs or in action. Such was the great and ſudden augmentation of power and revenue, that the poſſeſſion of America brought into Spain, and ſome ſymptoms of its pernicious influence upon the political operations of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ſoon began to appear. For a conſiderable time, however, the ſupply of treaſure from the New World was ſcanty and precarious, and the genius of Charles V. conducted public meaſures with ſuch prudence, that the effects of this influence were little perceived.

They received (as I have obſerved in another place) their cloathing, their furniture, whatever miniſters to the eaſe or luxury of life, and even their inſtruments of labour, from Europe.

In vain did the fundamental law, concerning the excluſion of foreigners from trade with America, oppoſe this innovation. Neceſſity more powerful than any ſtatute, defeated its operations, and conſtrained the Spaniards themſelves to concur in eluding it. The Engliſh, the French, and Dutch, relying on the fidelity and honour of Spaniſh merchants, who lend their names to cover the deceit, ſend out their manufactures to America, and receive the exorbitant price for which they are ſold there, either in ſpecie, or in the rich commodities of the New

In a ſhort time, not above a twentieth part of the commodities exported to America was of Spaniſh growth or fabric<note n="†" place="bottom">Campomanes, ii. 138.</note>. All the reſt was the property of foreign merchants, though entered in the name of Spaniards. The treaſure of the New World may be ſaid henceforward not to have belonged to Spain. Before it reached Europe, it was antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated as the price of goods purchaſed from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. That wealth which, by an internal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, would have ſpread through each vein of induſtry, and have conveyed life and movement to every branch of manufacture, flowed out of the kingdom with ſuch a rapid courſe, as neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched nor animated it. On the other hand, the artizans of rival nations, encouraged by this quick ſale of their commodities, improved ſo much in ſkill and induſtry, as to be able to afford them at a rate ſo low, that the manufactures of Spain, which could not vie with theirs, either in quality or cheapneſs of work, were ſtill farther depreſſed. This deſtructive commerce drained off the riches of the nation faſter and more completely, than even the extravagant ſchemes of ambition carried on by its monarchs. Spain was ſo much aſtoniſhed and diſtreſſed, at beholding her American treaſures vaniſh almoſt as ſoon as they were imported, that Philip III. unable to ſupply what was requiſite in circulation, iſſued an edict, by which he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to raiſe copper money to a value in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency

It is from her idea of monopolizing the trade with America, and debarring her ſubjects there from any communication with foreigners, that all her jealous and ſyſtematic arrangements have ariſen. Theſe are ſo ſingular in their nature and conſequences as to merit a particular explanation. In order to ſecure the monopoly at which ſhe aimed, Spain did not veſt the trade with her colonies in an excluſive company, a plan which has been adopted by nations more commercial, and at a period when

But under the feeble monarchs, with whom the reign of the Auſtrian line in Spain cloſed, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and indeciſion are conſpicuous in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of government. Inſtead of taking for their model the active adminiſtration of Charles V. they affected to imitate the cautious procraſtinating wiſdom of Philip II. and deſtitute of his talents, they deliberated perpetually, but determined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. No remedy was applied to the evils under which the national commerce, domeſtic as well as foreign, languiſhed.

At length, the violence of a great national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion rouſed the ſlumbering genius of Spain. The efforts of the two contending parties in the civil war, kindled by the diſpute concerning the ſucceſſion of the crown at the beginning of this century, called forth, in ſome degree, the ancient ſpirit and vigour of the nation. While men were thus forming, capable of adopting ſentiments more liberal than thoſe which had influenced the councils of the monarchy during the courſe of a century, Spain derived from an unexpected ſource the means of availing itſelf of their talents. The various powers who favoured the petenſions either of the

Theſe were ſpent in the provinces which became the theatre of war. Part of the American treaſure, of which foreigners had drained the kingdom, flowed back thither. From this aera, one of the moſt intelligent Spaniſh au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors dates the revival of the monarchy; and, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever humiliating the truth may be, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that it is to her enemies his country is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for the acquiſition of a fund of circulating ſpecie, in ſome meaſure adequate to the exigencies of the public<note n="*" place="bottom">Campomanes, i. 420.</note>.</p>

It was, accordingly, the firſt object of Philip V. to ſuppreſs an innovation which had crept in during the courſe of the war, and had overturned the whole ſyſtem of the Spaniſh commerce with Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.

The agents of a rival nation, reſiding in the towns of moſt extenſive trade, and of chief reſort, had the beſt opportunities of becoming acquainted with the interior condition of the American provinces, of obſerving their ſtated and occaſional wants, and of knowing what commodities might be imported into them with the greateſt advantage. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of information ſo authentic and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, the merchants of Jamaica and other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh colonies who traded to the Spaniſh main, were enabled to aſſort and proportion their cargoes ſo exactly to the demands of the market, that the contraband commerce was carried on with a faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to an extent unknown in any former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. This however was not the moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the aſſiento to the trade of Spain. The agents of the Britiſh South-Sea Company, under cover of the importation which they were autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſed to make by the ſhip ſent annually to Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bello, poured in their commodities on the Spaniſh continent, without limitation or reſtraint. Inſtead of a ſhip of five hundred tons, as ſtipulated in the treaty, they uſually employed one which exceeded nine hundred tons in burden.

From that period there has been no intercourſe with Chili and Peru but by ſingle ſhips, diſpatched from time to time as occaſion requires, and when the merchants expect a profitable market will open.

Among the new taſtes which the people of Europe have acquired in conſequence of importing the productions of thoſe countries which they conquered in America, that for chocolate is one of the moſt univerſal. The uſe of this liquor made with a paſte, formed of the nut, or almond of the cacao-tree, compounded with various ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the Spaniards firſt learned from the Mexicans; and it has appeared to them, and to the other Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean nations, ſo palatable, ſo nouriſhing, and ſo wholeſome, that it has become a commercial article of conſiderable importance. The cacao-tree grows ſpontaneouſly in ſeveral parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the beſt quality, next to thoſe of Guatimala, and the South Sea, are produced in the rich plains of Caraccas, a province of Tierra Firme. In conſequence of this acknowledged ſuperiority in the quality of cacao in that province, and its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Atlantic, which facilitates the conveyance to Europe, the culture of the cacao there is more extenſive than in any diſtrict of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. But the Dutch, by the vicinity of their ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements in the ſmall iſlands of Curazoa and Buen-Ayre, to the coaſt of Caraccas, gradually ingroſſed the greateſt part of the cacao trade.

year 1728, granted to a body of merchants, an excluſive right to the commerce with Garaccas and Cumana, on condition of their employing at their own expence, a ſufficient number of armed veſſels to clear the coaſt of interlopers. This ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, diſtinguiſhed ſometimes by the name of the Company of Guipuſcoa, from the province of Spain in which it is eſtabliſhed, and ſometimes by that of the Company of Caraccas, from the diſtrict of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to which it trades, has carried on its operations with ſuch vigour and ſucceſs, that Spain has reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an important branch of commerce, which ſhe had ſuffered to be wreſted from her, and is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſupplied with an article of extenſive conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at a moderate price. Not only the parent ſtate, but the colony of Caraccas, has derived great advantages from this inſtitution; for although, at the firſt aſpect it may appear to be one of thoſe monopolies, whoſe tendency is to check the ſpirit of induſtry inſtead of calling it forth to new exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it has been prevented from operating in this manner by ſeveral ſalutary regulations, framed upon foreſight of ſuch bad effects, and of purpoſe to obviate them.

At length Charles III. ſurmounted thoſe conſiderations which had deterred his predeceſſors, and in the year 1764 appointed packet-boats to be diſpatched on the firſt day of each month, from Corugna to the Havanna of Porto-Rico. From thence letters are conveyed in ſmaller veſſels to Vera Cruz and Porto-bello, and tranſmitted by poſt through the kingdoms of Tierra Firme, Granada, Peru, and New Spain. With no leſs regularity packet-boats ſail once in two months to Rio de la Plata, for the accommodation of the provinces to the eaſt of the Andes. Thus proviſion is made for a ſpeedy and certain circulation of intelligence throughout the vaſt dominions of Spain, from which equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages muſt redound to the political and mercantile intereſt of the kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Ponz Viage de Eſpagna, vi Prol. p. 15.</note>. With this new arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:034476_0929_0FFDDDAB6B500340"/>
a ſcheme of extending commerce has been more immediately connected. Each of the packet-boats, which are veſſels of ſome conſiderable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is allowed to take in half a loading of ſuch commodities as are the product of Spain, and moſt in demand in the ports whither they are bound. In return for theſe they may bring home to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugna an equal quantity of American productions<note n="*" place="bottom">Append. ii. a la Educ. Pop. p. 31.</note>.

                  <p>IT was ſoon followed by one more deciſive.<note place="margin">Free trade permitted to ſeveral provinces.</note> In the year 1765, Charles III. laid open the trade to the windward iſlands, Cuba, Hiſpaniola, Porto.

He permitted them to ſail from certain ports in each province, which are ſpecified in the edict, at any ſeaſon, and with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cargo they deemed moſt proper, without any other warrant than a ſimple clearance from the cuſtom-houſe of the place whence they took their departure. He releaſed them from the numerous and oppreſſive duties impoſed on goods exported to America, and in place of the whole, ſubſtituted a moderate tax of ſix in the hundred on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities ſent from Spain. He allowed them to return either to the ſame port, or to any other where they might hope for a more advantageous market, and there to enter the homeward cargo, on payment of the uſual duties.

                     <note place="margin">Beneficial effects of it.</note>THE propriety of this innovation, which may be conſidered as the moſt liberal effort of Spaniſh le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, has appeared from its effects. Prior to the edict in favour of the free trade, Spain derived hardly any benefit from its neglected colonies in Hiſpaniola, Porto-Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad. Its commerce with Cuba was inconſiderable, and that of Yucatan and Campeachy was ingroſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely by interlopers. But as ſoon as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral liberty of trade was permitted, the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with thoſe provinces revived, and has gone on with a rapidity of progreſſion, of which there are few examples in the hiſtory of nations. In leſs than ten years, the trade of Cuba has been more than tripled. Even in thoſe ſettlements where, from the languiſhing ſtate of induſtry, greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts were requiſite to reſtore its activity, their commerce has been doubled. It is computed, that ſuch a number of ſhips is already employed in the free trade, that the tonnage of them far exceeds that of the Galeons and Flota, at the moſt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aera of their commerce. The benefits of this arrangement are not confined to a few merchants, eſtabliſhed in a favourite port. They are diffuſed through every province of the kingdom; and by opening a new market for their various produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and manufactures, muſt encourage and add vivacity to the induſtry of the farmer and artificer. Nor does the kingdom profit only by what it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, it derives advantage likewiſe from what it receives in return, and has the proſpect of being ſoon able to ſupply itſelf with ſeveral commodities

of extenſive conſumption, for which it formerly depended on foreigners. The conſumption of ſugar in Spain is perhaps as great in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as that of any European kingdom. But though poſſeſſed of countries in the New World, whoſe ſoil and climate are moſt proper for rearing the ſugar cane; though the domeſtic culture of that valuable plant in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Granada was once conſiderable; ſuch has been the fatal tendency of ill judged inſtitutions in America, and ſuch the preſſure of improper taxes in Europe, that Spain has loſt almoſt entirely this branch of induſtry, which has enriched other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This commodity, which has now become an article of primary neceſſity in Europe, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards were obliged to purchaſe of foreigners, and had the mortification to ſee their country drained annually of great ſums on that account<note n="*" place="bottom">Uzt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if that ſpirit, which the permiſſion of free trade has put in motion, ſhall perſevere in its efforts with the ſame vigour, the cultivation of ſugar in Cuba and Porto-Rico may increaſe ſo much, that in a few years, it is probable, that their growth of ſugars may be equal to the demand of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>SPAIN has been induced,<note place="margin">Free trade permitted between the colonies.</note> by her experience of the beneficial conſequences reſulting from having relaxed ſomewhat of the rigour of her ancient laws with reſpect to the commerce of the mother-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with the colonies, to permit a more liberal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of one colony with another.

Of all the numerous reſtrictions deviſed by Spain for ſecuring the excluſive trade with her American ſettlements, none perhaps was more illiberal, none ſeems to have been more ſenſibly felt, or to have produced more hurtful effects.

What may be the effects of opening this communication between countries deſtined by their ſituation for reciprocal intercourſe, cannot yet be determined by experience. They can hardly fail of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and extenſive. The motives for granting this permiſſion are manifeſtly no leſs laudable, than the principle on which it is founded is liberal; and both diſcover the progreſs of a ſpirit in Spain, far elevated above the narrow prejudices and maxims on which her ſyſtem for regulating the trade, and conducting the government of her colonies, was originally founded.</p>

Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſubordinate to the viceroy of New Spain, lay above two thouſand miles from Mexico. There were countries ſubject to the viceroy of Peru ſtill farther from Lima. The people in thoſe remote diſtricts could hardly be ſaid to enjoy the benefit of civil government. The oppreſſion and inſolence of its inferior miniſters they often feel, and rather ſubmit to theſe in ſilence, than involve themſelves in the expence and trouble of reſorting to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant capitals, where alone they can find redreſs. As a remedy for this,<note place="margin">New vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royalty.

By this well-judged arrangement, two advantages are gained. All the inconveniencies occaſioned by the remote ſituation of thoſe provinces, which had been long felt, and long complained of, are in a great meaſure, removed. The countries moſt diſtant from Lima are ſeparated from the viceroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of Peru, and united under a ſuperior, whoſe ſeat of government at Buenos-Ayres, will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious and acceſſible. The contraband trade with the Portugueſe, which was become ſo exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as muſt have put a final ſtop to the exportation of commodities from Spain to her ſouthern colonies, may be checked more thoroughly, and with greater facility, when the ſupreme magiſtrate, by his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity to the places in which it is carried on, can view its progreſs and effects with his own eyes.

Nor has their attention been ſo entirely engroſſed by what related to the more remote parts of their dominions, as to render them neglectful of what was ſtill more important, the reformation of domeſtic errors and defects in policy. Fully ſenſible of the cauſes to which the declenſion of Spain, from her former proſperity, ought to be imputed, they have made it a great object of their policy, to revive a ſpirit of induſtry among their ſubjects, and to give ſuch extent and perfection to their manufactures, as may enable them to ſupply the demands of America from their own ſtock, and to exclude fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners from a branch of commerce which has been ſo fatal to the kingdom. This they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to accompliſh, by a variety of edicts iſſued ſince the peace of Utrecht. They have granted bounties for the encouragement of ſome branches of induſtry; they have lowered the taxes on others; they have either entirely prohibited, or have loaded with additional duties, ſuch foreign manufactures as come in competition with their own; they have inſtituted ſocieties for the improvement of trade and agriculture; they have planted colonies of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen in ſome uncultivated diſtricts of Spain, and divided among them the waſte fields; they have had recourſe to every expedient, deviſed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial wiſdom, or commercial jealouſy, for reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own induſtry, and diſcountenancing that of other nations. Theſe, however, it is not my

province to explain, or to enquire into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and effects. There is no effort of legiſlation more arduous, no experiment in policy more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, than an attempt to revive the ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry where it has declined, or to introduce it where it is unknown. Nations already poſſeſſed of extenſive commerce, enter into competition with ſuch advantages, derived from the large capitals and extenſive credit of their merchants, the dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their manufactures, the alertneſs acquired by habit in every department of buſineſs, that the ſtate which aims at rivalling, or ſupplanting them, muſt expect to ſtruggle with many difficulties, and be content to advance ſlowly. If the quantity of productive induſtry, now in Spain, be compared with that of the kingdom under the laſt liſtleſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs of the Auſtrian line, its progreſs muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear conſiderable, and is ſufficient to alarm the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, and to call forth the moſt vigorous efforts, of the nations now in poſſeſſion of the lucrative trade which the Spaniards aim at wreſting from them. One circumſtance may render thoſe exertions of Spain an object of more ſerious attention to the other European powers. They are not to be aſcribed wholly to the influence of the crown and its mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The ſentiments and ſpirit of the people ſeem to ſecond the provident care of their monarchs, and to give it greater effect. The nation has adopted more liberal ideas, not only with reſpect to commerce, but domeſtic policy.

One or two ſhips depart an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from Acapulco, which are permitted to carry out ſilver to the amount of five hundred thouſand peſos<note n="*" place="bottom">Recop. lib. ix. c. 45 l 6.</note>, but they have hardly any thing elſe of value on board; in return for which, they bring back ſpices, drugs, china, and japan wares, callicoes, chintz, mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> reſt of the world. For ſome time the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Peru were admitted to participate in this traine, and might ſend annually a ſhip to Acapulco. to wait the arrival of the veſſels from Manila, and receive a proportional ſhare of the commodities which they imported. At length, the Peruvians were excluded from this trade by moſt rigorous
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:034476_0941_0FFDDDCC00330E50"/>
edicts, and all the commodities from the Eaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſolely for the conſumption of New Spain.</p>
                  <p>IN conſequence of this indulgence, the inhabitants of that country enjoy advantages unknown in the other Spaniſh colonies. The manufactures of the Eaſt are not only more ſuited to a warm climate, and more ſhowy than thoſe of Europe, but can be ſold at a lower price; while, at the ſame time, the profits upon them are ſo conſiderable, as to enrich all thoſe who are employed, either in bringing them from Manila, or vending them in New Spain. As the intereſt both of the buyer and ſeller concurred in favouring this branch of commerce, it has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extend in ſpite of regulations, concerted with the moſt anxious jealouſy to circumſcribe it. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover of what the laws permit to be imported, great quantities of India goods are poured into the markets of New Spain<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE XCVIII.</note>, and when the ſlota arrives at Vera Cruz from Europe, it often finds the wants of the people already ſupplied by cheaper and more acceptable commodities.</p>
                  <p>THERE is not, in the commercial arrangements of Spain, any circumſtance more inexplicable than the permiſſion of this trade between New Spain and the Philippines, or more repugnant to its fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental maxim of holding the colonies in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual dependence on the mother-country, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting any commercial intercourſe that might ſuggeſt to them the idea of receiving a ſupply of their wants from any other quarter. This permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt appear ſtill more extraordinary, from conſidering that Spain herſelf carries on no direct trade with her ſettlements in the Philippines, and grants a privilege to one of her American colonies, which ſhe denies to her ſubjects in Europe. It is
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:034476_0942_0FFDDDCE9C4B6880"/>
probable, that the coloniſts who originally took poſſeſſion of the Philippines, having been ſent out from New Spain, began this intercourſe with a country which they conſidered, in ſome meaſure, as their parent ſtate, before the court of Madrid was aware of its conſequences, or could eſtabliſh regulations in order to prevent it. Many remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances have been preſented againſt this trade, as detrimental to Spain, by diverting into another channel a large portion of that treaſure which ought to flow into the kingdom, as tending to give riſe to a ſpirit of independence in the colonies, and to encourage innumerable frauds, againſt which it is impoſſible to guard, in tranſactions ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the inſpection of government. But as it requires no ſlight effort of political wiſdom and vigour to aboliſh any practice which numbers are intereſted in ſupporting, and to which time has added the ſanction of its authority, the commerce between New Spain and Manila ſeems to be as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as ever, and may be conſidered as one chief cauſe of the elegance and ſplendor conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in this part of the Spaniſh dominions.</p>
                  <p>BUT notwithſtanding this general corruption in the colonies of Spain,<note place="margin">P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ariſes from taxes of various kinds, which may be divided into three capital branches. The firſt contains what is paid to the king, as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, or ſuperior lord of the New World: to this claſs belongs the duty on the gold and ſilver raiſed
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:034476_0943_0FFDDDD138BBBE20"/>
from the mines, and the tribute exacted from the Indians; the former is termed by the Spaniards the <hi>right of ſigniory,</hi> the latter is the <hi>duty of vaſulage.</hi> The ſecond branch comprehends the numerous du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon commerce, which accompany and oppreſs it in every ſtep of its progreſs, from the greateſt tranſactions of the wholeſale merchant, to the petty traffic of the vendor by retail. The third includes what accrues to the king, as head of the church, and adminiſtrator of eccleſiaſtical funds in the New World. In conſequence of this he receives the firſt fruits, annates, ſpoils, and other ſpiritual revenues, levied by the apoſtolic chamber in Europe; and is entitled, likewiſe, to the profit ariſing from the ſale of the bull of Cruzado. This bull, which is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed every two years, contains, an abſolution from paſt offences by the pope, and, among other immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, a permiſſion to eat ſeveral kinds of prohibited food, during Lent, and on m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The monks employed in diſperſing thoſe bulls, extol their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with all the fervour of intereſted eloquence; the people, ignorant and credulous, liſten with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit aſſent; and every perſon in the Spaniſh colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, of European, Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHAT may be the amount of thoſe various funds,<note place="margin">Its amount.</note> it is almoſt impoſſible to determine with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The extent of the Spaniſh dominions in America, the jealouſy of government, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them inacceſſible to foreigners, the myſterious ſilence which the Spaniards are accuſtomed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve with reſpect to the interior ſtate of their colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, combine in covering this ſubject with a veil, which it is not eaſy to remove. But an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:034476_0944_0FFDDDD3D8DDBCE8"/>
apparently no leſs accurate than it is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, has lately been publiſhed of the royal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in New Spain, from which we may form ſome idea with reſpect to what is collected in the other provinces. According to that account, the crown does not receive from all the departments of taxation in New Spain above a million of our money, from which one half muſt be deducted as the expence of the provincial eſtabliſhment<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE C.</note>. Peru, it is probable, yields a ſum not inferior to this; and if we ſuppoſe that all the other regions of America, including the iſlands, furniſh a third ſhare of equal value, we ſhall not perhaps be far wide from the truth, if we conclude, that the net public revenue of Spain, raiſed in America, does not exceed a million and a half ſterling. This falls far ſhort of the immenſe ſums to which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, founded upon conjecture, have raiſed the Spaniſh revenue in America<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE CI.</note>. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, however, upon one account. Spain and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal are the only European powers, who derive a direct revenue from their colonies. All the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that accrues to other nations, from their American dominions, ariſes from the excluſive en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of their trade; but beſide this, Spain has brought her colonies to contribute towards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the power of the ſtate; and in return for protection, to bear a proportional ſhare of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon burden.</p>
                  <p>ACCORDINGLY, the ſum which I have computed to be the amount, of the Spaniſh revenue from America, ariſes wholly from the taxes collected there, and is far from being the whole of what accrues to the king from his dominions in the New World. The heavy duties impoſed on the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:034476_0945_0FFDDDD56AF12230"/>
exported from Spain to America<note n="*" place="bottom">See NOTE CII.</note>, as well as what is paid by thoſe which ſhe ſends home in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; the tax upon the negro-ſlaves, with which Africa ſupplies the New World, together with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſmaller branches of finance, bring large ſums into the treaſury, the preciſe extent of which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pretend to aſcertain.</p>
                  <p>BUT if the revenue which Spain draws from America be great,<note place="margin">

                     </note> the expence of adminiſtration in her colonies bears proportion to it. In every department, even of her domeſtic police and finances, Spain has adopted a ſyſtem more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex, and more encumbered with a variety of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, and a multitude of officers, than that of any European nation, in which the ſovereign poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes ſuch extenſive power. From the jealous ſpirit with which Spain watches over her American ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and her endeavours to guard againſt fraud in provinces ſo remote from inſpection; boards and officers have been multiplied there with ſtill more anxious attention. In a country where the expence of living is great, the ſalaries allotted to every perſon in public office muſt be high, and muſt load the revenue with an immenſe burden. The parade of government greatly augments the weight of it. The viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and the New Kingdom of Granada, as repreſentatives of the king's perſon, among people fond of often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, maintain all the ſtate and dignity of royalty. Their courts are formed upon the model of that at Madrid, with horſe and foot guards, a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold regularly eſtabliſhed numerous attendants, and enſigns of power, diſplaying ſuch pomp, as hardly retains the appearance of a delegated autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. All the expence incurred by ſupporting the
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:034476_0946_0FFDDDD94E064178"/>
external and permanent order of government is defrayed by the crown. The viceroys have beſides peculiar appointments ſuited to their exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſalaries fixed by law are indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely moderate; that of the viceroy of Peru is only thirty thouſand ducats; and that of the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of Mexico, twenty thouſand ducats<note n="*" place="bottom">Recop. lib. iii. tit. iii. c. 72.</note>. Of late they have been raiſed to forty thouſand.</p>
                  <p>THESE ſalaries, however, conſtitute but a ſmall part of the revenue enjoyed by the viceroys. The exerciſe of an abſolute authority extending to every department or government, and the power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of many lucrative offices, afford them many opportunities of accumulating wealth. To theſe, which may be conſidered as legal and allowed emoluments, large ſums are often added by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, which in countries ſo far removed from the ſeat of government, it is not eaſy to diſcover, and impoſſible to reſtrain. By monopolizing ſome branches of commerce, by a lucrative concern in others, by conniving at the frauds of merchants, a viceroy may raiſe ſuch an annual revenue, as no ſubject of any European monarch enjoys<note n="†" place="bottom">See NOTE CIII.</note>. From the ſingle article of preſents made to him on the anniverſary of his <hi>Name-day</hi> (which is always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved as an high feſtival), I am informed that a viceroy has been known to receive ſixty thouſand peſos. According to a Spaniſh ſaving, the legal revenues of a viceroy are known, his real profits depend upon his opportunities and his conſcience. Senſible of this, the kings of Spain, as I have formerly obſerved, grant a commiſſion to their viceroys only for a few years. This circumſtance, however, renders them often more rapacious, and
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:034476_0947_0FFDDDDADDEB06F0"/>
adds to the ingenuity and ardour wherewith they labour to improve every moment of power which they know is haſtening faſt to a period; and ſhort as its duration is, it uſually affords ſufficient time for repairing a ſhattered fortune, or for creating a new one. But even in ſituations ſo trying to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailty, there are inſtances of virtue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains unſeduced. In the year 1772, the Marquis de Croix finiſhed the term of his viceroyalty in New Spain with unſuſpected integrity; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of bringing home exorbitant wealth, returned with the admiration and applauſe of a grateful people, whom his government had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>OUR knowledge of the events which happened in the conqueſt of New Spain, is derived from ſources of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation more original and authentic than that of any tranſaction in the hiſtory of America. The letters of Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are an hiſtorical monument, not only firſt in order of time, but of the greateſt authenticit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE firſt of his diſpatches has never been made public. It was ſent from Vera-Cruz, July 16th, 1519. As I imagined that it might not reach the Emperor until he arrived in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, for which he ſet out early in the year 1520, in order to receive the Imperial crown; I made diligent ſearch for a copy of this diſpatch, both in Spain and in Germany, but without ſucceſs This, however, is of leſs conſequence, as it could not contain any thing very material, being written ſo ſoon after Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes arrived in New Spain. But in ſearching for the letter from Cortes, a copy of one from the colony of Vera-Cruz to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror has been diſcovered in the Imperial library at Vienna. Of this I have ſubjoined ſome account at the cloſe of the Notes to the ſecond volume. The ſecond diſpatch, dated October 30th, 1520, was publiſhed at Seville, A. D. 1522, and the third and fourth ſoon after they were received. A Latin tranſlation of them appeared in Germany, A. D. 1532. Ramuſio ſoon after made them more generally known by inſerting them in his valuable col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. They contain a regular and minute hiſtory of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition,
<pb n="444" facs="unknown:034476_0949_0FFDDDE147D9A0D8"/>
with many curious particulars concerning the policy and manners of the Mexicans The work does honour to Cortes; the ſtyle is ſimple and perſpicuous; but as it was manifeſtly his intereſt to repreſent his own actions in the faireſt light, his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are probably exaggerated, his loſſes diminiſhed, and his acts of rigour and violence ſoftened.</p>
                     <p>THE next in order is the Cronica de la Nueva Eſpagna, by Franciſco Lopez de Gomara, publiſhed A. D. 1554 Gomara's hiſtorical merit is conſiderable His mode of narration is clear, flowing, always agreeable, and ſometimes elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate and credulous; and as he was the domeſtic chaplain of Cortes after his return from New Spain and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly compoſed his work at his deſire, it is manifeſt that he labours to magnify the merit of his hero<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to conceal or extenuate ſuch tranſactions as were unfavourable to his character. Of this Herrera accuſes him in one inſtance, Dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 2 and it is not once only that this is conſpicuous. He writes, however, with ſo much freedom concerning ſeveral meaſures of the Spaniſh court, that the copies both of his Hiſtoria de las Indias, and of his Cronica, were called in by a decree of the counci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del Caſtillo to compoſe his Hiſtoria Verdadera de la Conquiſta de la Nueva Eſpagna. He had been an adventurer in each of the expeditions to New Spain, and was the companion of Cortes in all his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and perils. When he found that neither he himſelf, nor many of his fellow-ſoldiers, were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their exploits was aſcribed to Cortes; the gallant veteran laid hold of his pen with indignation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his true hiſtory. It contains a prolix, minute, confuſed narrative of all Cortes's operations, in ſuch a rude vu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>gar ſtyle as might be expected from an illiterate ſoldier. But as he relates tranſactions of which he was witneſs, and in which he performed a conſiderable part, his account bears al the marks of authenticity, and is accompanied with ſuch a pleaſant <hi>naivete,</hi> with ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting details, with ſuch amuſing vanity, and yet ſo pardonable in an old ſoldier who had been (as he boaſts) in a hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen battles, as renders his book one of the moſt ſingular that is to be found in any language.</p>
                     <p>PET. Martyr ab Angleria, in a treatiſe de Inſulis nuper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventis, added to his Decades de Rebus Oceanicis and Novo Orbe, gives ſome account of Cortes's expedition. But he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds no farther than to relate what happened after his firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This work, which is brief and ſlight, ſeems to contain the

                     <p>BUT the book to which the greater part of modern hiſtorians have had recourſe for information concerning the conqueſt of New Spain, is Hiſtoria de la Conquiſta de Mexico, por D. Antonio de So is, firſt publiſhed A D. 1684. I know no author in any language whoſe literary fame has riſen ſo far beyond his real merit. De Solis is reckoned by his countrymen one of the pureſt writers in the Caſtilian tongue; and if a foreigner may venture to give his opinion concerning a matter of which Spaniards alone are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to judge, he is entitled to that praiſe.

Deſtitute of that patient induſtry in reſearch, which conducts to the knowledge of truth; a ſtranger to that impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality which weighs evidence with cool attention; and ever eager to eſtabliſh his favourite ſyſtem of exalting the character of Cortes into that of a perfect hero, exempt from error, and adorned with every virtue; he is leſs ſolicitous to diſcover what was true, than to relate what might appear ſplendid. When he attempts any critical diſcuſſion, his reaſonings are ſallacious, and founded upon an imperfect view of facts. Though he ſometimes quotes the <hi>diſpatches</hi> of Cortes, he ſeems not to have conſulted them; and though he ſets out with ſome cenſure on Gomara, he frequently prefers his authority, the moſt doubtful of any, to that of the other contemporary hiſtorians.</p>
                     <p>BUT of all the Spaniſh writers, Herrera furniſhes the fulleſt and moſt accurate information concerning the conqueſt of Mexico, as well as every other tranſaction of America. The induſtry and attention with which he conſulted not only the books, but the original papers and public records, which tended to throw any light upon the ſubject of his inquiries, were ſo great, and he uſually judges of the evidence before him with ſo much impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and candour, that his decads may be ranked among the moſt judicious and uſeful hiſtorical collections. If by attempting to relate the various occurrences in the New World in a ſtrict chronological order, the arrangement of events in his work had not been rendered ſo perplexed, diſconnected, and obſcure, that it is an unpleaſant taſk to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As the war with the republic of Tlaſcala, though of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was one of the moſt conſiderable which the Spaniards waged in America, the account given of the Tlaſcalan armies merits ſome attention. The only authentic information concerning this is derived from three authors.

For it was only by the merit of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſervices, that he could hope to atone for his irregular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in aſſuming an independent command. Bern.

The degree of cultivation in Tlaſcala does not ſeem to have been ſo great, as to have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a vaſt army with proviſions.

Relac. de la Deſtruyc. p. 17, &amp;c. But the zeal of Las Caſas often leads him to exaggerate. In oppoſition to him, Bern. Diaz, c. 83, aſſerts, that the firſt miſſionaries ſent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial enquiry into this tranſaction; and having examined the prieſts and elders of Cholula, found that there was a real conſpiracy to cut off the Spaniards, and that the account given by Cortes was exactly true. As it was the object of Cortes at that time, and manifeſtly his intereſt, to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that he ſhould have taken a ſtep which tended ſo viſibly to alienate him from the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to be neceſſary for his own preſervation. At the ſame time, the Spaniards who ſerved in America had ſuch contempt for the natives, and thought them ſo little entitled to the common rights of men, that Cortes might hold the Cholulans to be guilty upon ſlight and imperfect evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                     <p>B. DIAS del Caſtillo gives us ſome idea of the fatigue and hardſhips they underwent in performing this, and other parts of duty. During the nine months that they remained in Mexico, every man, without any diſtinction between officers and ſoldiers, ſlept on his arms in his quilted jacket and gorget. They lay on mats, or ſtraw ſpread on the floor, and each was obliged to
<pb n="451" facs="unknown:034476_0956_0FFDDDF34DFD0248"/>
hold himſelf as alert as if he had been on guard. "This, adds he, became ſo habitual to me, that even now in my advanced age, I always ſleep in my clothes, and never in any bed. When I viſit my <hi>Encomienda,</hi> I reckon it ſuitable to my rank, to have a bed carried with my other baggage, but I never go into it; but, according to cuſtom, I lie in my clothes, and walk frequently during the night into the open air, to view the ſtars as I was wont when in ſervice."

                     <p>CORTES himſelf, in his ſecond diſpatch to the emperor, does not explain the motives which induced him either to condemn Qualpopoca to the flames, or to put Montezuma in irons.

But as Montezuma was his priſoner, and abſolutely in his power, he had no reaſon to dread him, and the inſult offered to that monarch could have no effect but to irritate him unneceſſarily. Gomara ſuppoſes, that Cortes had no other object than to occupy Montezuma with his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and ſufferings, that he might give leſs attention to what befel Qualpopoca Cron. c. 89. Herrera adopts the ſame opinion. Dec. ii. lib. viii. c. 9. But it ſeems an odd expedient, in order to make a perſon bear one injury, to load him with another that is greater. De Solis imagines, that Cortes had nothing elſe in view than to intimidate Montezuma, ſo that he might make no attempt to reſcue the victims from their fate; but the ſpirit of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was ſo ſubmiſſive, and he had ſo tamely given up the priſoners to the diſpoſal of Cortes, that he had no cauſe to apprehend any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from him. If the explanation which I have attempted to give of Cortes's proceedings on this occaſion be not admitted, it appears to me, that they muſt be reckoned among the wanton and barbarous acts of oppreſſion which occur too often in the hiſtory of the conqueſt of America.</p>

                     <p>HERRERA and de Solis ſuppoſe, that Velaſquez was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to equip this armament againſt Cortes, by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which he received from Spain concerning the reception of the agents ſent by the colony of Vera Cruz, and the warmth with which Fonſeca biſhop of Burgos had eſpouſed his intereſt, and condemned the proceedings of Cortes. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18. De Solis, lib. iv c. 5. But the chronological order of events refutes this ſuppoſition. Portocarrero and Montejo ſailed from Vera Cruz July 26, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. They landed at St. Lucar in October, according to Herrera, ibid. But P Martyr, who attended the court at that time, and communicated every occurrence of moment to his correſpondents day by day, mentions the arrival of theſe agents for the firſt time, in December, and ſpeaks of it as a recent event. Epiſt. 650. All the hiſtopians agree, that the agents of Cortes had their firſt audience of the Emperor at Tordeſillas, when he went to that town to viſit his mother in his way to St. Jago de Compoſtella. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c 4. De Solis, lib. iv. c. 5. But the emperor ſet out from Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under Narvaez ſailed from Cuba in April 1520. It is manifeſt then, that Velaſquez could not receive any account of what paſſed in this interview at Tordeſillas, previous to his hoſtile preparations againſt Cortes. His real motives ſeem to be thoſe which I have mentioned. The patent appointing him <hi>Adelantado</hi> of New Spain, with ſuch extenſive powers, bears date November 13, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 11. He might receive it about the beginning of January.

                     <p>DE Solis contends, that as Narvaez had no interpreters, he could hold no intercourſe with the people of the provinces, nor converſe with them in any way but by ſigns, and that it was equally impoſſible for him to carry on any communication with Montezuma. Lib. iv. c. 7. But it is upon the authority of Cortes himſelf that I relate all the particulars of Narvaez's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence both with Montezuma and with his ſubjects in the maritime provinces. Relat. Ramuſ. iii. 244, A. C. Cortes

affirms, that there was a mode of intercourſe between Narvaez and the Mexicans, but does not explain how it was carried on. Bernal Diaz ſupplies this defect, and informs us, that the three deſerters who joined Narvaez as interpreters, having acquired a competent knowledge of the language, c. 110. With his uſual minuteneſs, he mentions their names and characters, and relates, in chapter 122, how they were puniſhed for their perfidy. The Spaniards had now reſided above a year among the Mexicans; and it is not ſurpriſing, that ſeveral among them ſhould have made ſome proficiency in ſpeaking their language. This ſeems to have been the caſe. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. 1. Both B. Diaz, who was preſent, and Herrera, the moſt accurate and beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of all the Spaniſh writers, agree with Cortes in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſecret correſpondence carried on with Montezuma. Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18, 19. De Solis ſeems to conſider it as a diſcredit to Cortes, his hero, that Montezuma ſhould have been ready to engage in a correſpondence with Narvaez. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that monarch to have contracted ſuch a wonderful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Spaniards, that he was not ſolicitous to be delivered from them. After the indignity with which he had been treated, ſuch an affection is incredible; and even De Solis is obliged to acknowledge, that it muſt be looked upon as one of the miracles which God had wrought to facilitate the conqueſt, lib. iv. c. 7. The truth is, Montezuma, however much overawed by his dread of the Spaniards, was extremely impatient to recover his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

                     <p>THE contemporary hiſtorians differ conſiderably with reſpect to the loſs of the Spaniards on this occaſion. Cortes, in his ſecond diſpatch to the emperor, makes the number only 150, Relat. ap. Ramuſ. iii. p. 249, A. But it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly

his intereſt, at that juncture, to conceal from the court of Spain the full extent of the loſs which he had ſuſtained. De Solis, always ſtudious to diminiſh every misfortune that beſel his countrymen, rates their loſs at about two hundred men. Lib. iv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> c. 19. B. Diaz affirms, that they loſt 870 men, and that only 440 eſcaped from Mexico, c. 128. p. 108, B. Palafox, biſhop of Loſs Angeles, who ſeems to have enquired into the carry tranſactions of his countrymen in New Spain, with great attention, confirms the account of B. Diaz, with reſpect to the extent of their loſs. Virtudes del Indio, p. 22. Gomara ſtates their loſs at 450 men. Cron. c. 109. Some months afterwards, when Cortes had received ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcements, he muſtered his troops, and found them to be only 590. Relat. ap. Ramuſ. iii. p. 255, E. Now, as Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaez brought 880 men into New Spain, and about 450 of Cortes's ſoldiers were then a ive, it is evident, that his loſs, in the retreat from Mexico, muſt have been much more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than what he mentions. B. Diaz, ſolicitous to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the dangers and ſufferings to which he and his fellow-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors were expoſed, may have exaggerated their loſs; but, in my opinion, it cannot well be eſtimated at leſs than 600 men.</p>

                     <p>THE ſtation of Alvarado on the cauſeway of Tacuba was the neareſt to the city.

Like a man whoſe courage was ſo clear as to be above ſuſpicion, he deſcribes with his uſual ſimplicity, the impreſſion which this ſpectacle made upon him.

with high ſpirit. But from that time I never advanced to fight the Mexicans without a ſecret horror and anxiety; my heart trembled at the thoughts of the death which I had ſeen them ſuffer." He takes care to add, that as ſoon as the combat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his terror went off; and, indeed, his adventurous bravery on every occaſion is full evidence of this. B.

                     <p>ONE circumſtance in this ſiege merits particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.—The account which the Spaniſh writers give of the numerous armies employed in the attack or defence of Mexico, ſeems to be incredible According to Cortes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he had at one time 150,000 auxiliary Indians in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Relat. Ramus, iii. 275. E. Gomara aſſerts, that they were above 200,000. Cron. c. 136 Herrera, an author of higher authority, ſays, they were about 200,000. Dec. iii. lib. i. c. 19. None of the contemporary writers aſcertain explicitly the number of perſons in Mexico during the ſiege. But Cortes on ſeveral occaſions mentions the number of Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans who were ſlain, or who periſhed for want of food; and, if we may rely on thoſe circumſtances, it is probable that above two hundred thouſand muſt have been ſhut up in the town. But the quantity of proviſions neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of ſuch vaſt multitudes aſſembled in one place during three months, is ſo great, and it requires ſo much foreſight and arrangement to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect theſe, and lay them in magazines, ſo as to be certain of a regular ſupply, that one can hardly believe that this could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in a country where agriculture was ſo imperfect as in the Mexican empire, where there were no t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Cortes on one occaſion mentions ſlightly the ſubſiſtence of his army; and after acknowledging that they were often in great want, adds that they received ſupplies from the people of the country, of fiſh, and of ſome fruit, which he calls the cherries of the country.

means of ſubſiſtence more than the Spaniards. They fed upon the bodies of the Mexicans whom they killed in battle. Cortes Relat. 176, C. B. Diaz confirms his relation, and adds, that when the Indians returned from Mexico to their own country, they carried with them large quantities of the fleſh of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſalted or dried, as a moſt acceptable preſent to their friends, that they might have the pleaſure of feeding upon the bodies of their enemies in their feſtivals, p. 157. De Solis, who ſeems to conſider it as an imputation of diſcredit to his countrymen, that they ſhould act in concert with auxiliaries who fed upon human fleſh, is ſolicitous to prove, that the Spaniards endeavoured to prevent their aſſociates from eating the bodies of the Mexicans, lib. v. c. 24. But he has no authority for this from the original hiſtorians. Neither Cortes himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor B. Diaz, ſeem to have had any ſuch ſcruple; and, on many occaſions, mentions the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian repaſts, which were become familiar to them, without any mark of abhorrence. Even with this additional ſtock of food for the Indians, it was hardly poſſible to procure ſubſiſtence for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies amounting to ſuch numbers as we find in the Spaniſh writers. Perhaps the beſt ſolution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of B. Diaz del Caſtillo, the moſt artleſs of all the <hi>Hiſtoriadores primitivos.</hi> "When Gomara (ſays he) on ſome occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that there were ſo many thouſand Indians our auxiliaries, and others, that there were ſo many thouſand houſes in this or that town, no regard is to be paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the numbers not being in reality the fifth of what he relates. If we add together the different numbers which he mentions, that country would contain more millions than there are in Caſtile." C. 129. But though ſome conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction ſhould certainly be made from the Spaniſh accounts of the Mexican forces, they muſt have been very numerous; for nothing but an immenſe ſuperiority in number could have enabled them to withſtand a body of nine hundred Spaniards, conducted by a leader of ſuch abilities as Cortes.</p>

Dec. iii. lib. v. c. 7. But this is contrary to the teſtimony of the original hiſtorians, particularly of Gomara, whom it appears he had conſulted, as he adopts ſeveral of his expreſſions in this paſſage. The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Guatimozin is related by the moſt authentic of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh writers.

Mon. Indiana, i. 575. According to the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can account, Cortes had ſcarcely a ſhadow of evidence to juſtify ſuch a wanton act of cruelty. B.

                     <p>THE motive for undertaking this expedition was, to puniſh Chriſtoval de Olid, one of his officers, who had revolted againſt him, and aimed at eſtabliſhing an independent juriſdiction. Cortes regarded this inſurrection as of ſuch dangerous example, and dreaded ſo much the abilities and popularity of its author, that in perſon he led the body of troops deſtined to ſuppreſs it. He marched, according to Gomara, three thouſand miles, through a country abounding with thick foreſts, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and cultivated only in a few places. What he ſuffered from famine, from the hoſtility of the natives, from the climate, and from hardſhips of every ſpecies, has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in hiſtory parallel to it, but what occurs in the adventures of the other diſcoverers and conquerors of the New World.

                     <p>IN tracing the progreſs of the Spaniſh arms in New Spain, we have followed Cortes himſelf as our moſt certain guide. His diſpatches to the emperor contain a minute account of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But the unlettered conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his own exploits. Our information with reſpect to them, and other tranſactions in Peru, is derived however from contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and reſpectable authors.</p>
                     <p>THE moſt early account of Pizarro's tranſactions in Peru, was publiſhed by Franciſo de Xerez, his ſecretary. It is a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unadorned narrative, carried down no farther than the death of Atahualpa in 1533; for the author returned to Spain in 1534, and ſoon after he landed, printed at Seville his ſhort Hiſtory of the Conqueſt of Peru, addreſſed to the emperor.</p>
                     <p>DON PEDRO SANCHO, an officer who ſerved under Pizarro, drew up an account of his expedition, which was tranſlated into Italian by Ramuſio, and inſerted in his valuable collection, but has never been publiſhed in its original language. Sancho re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Spain at the ſame time with Xerez. Great credit is
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:034476_0965_0FFDDE0C002CD878"/>
due to what both theſe authors relate concerning the progreſs and operations of Pizarro; but the reſidence of the Spaniards in Peru had been ſo ſhort, at the time w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THE next contemporary hiſtorian is Pedro Cieza de Leon, who publiſhed his Cronica del Peru, at Seville, in 1553. If he had finiſhed all that he propoſes in the general diviſion of his work, it would have been the moſt complete hiſtory which had been publiſhed of any region in the New World. He was well qualified to execute it, having ſerved during ſeventeen years in America, and having viſited in perſon moſt of the provinces concerning which he had occaſion to write. But only the firſt part of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hronicle has been printed. It contains a deſcription of Peru, and ſeveral of the adjacent provinces, with an account of the inſtitutions and cuſtoms of the natives, and is written with ſo little art, and ſuch an apparent regard for truth, that one muſt regret the loſs of the other parts of his work.</p>
                     <p>THIS loſs is amply ſupplied by Don Auguſtine Zarate, who publiſhed, in 1555, his Hiſtoria del Deſcubrimiento y Conqueſta de la Provincia del Peru. Zarate was a man of rank and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and employed in Peru as comptroller-general of the public revenue. His hiſtory, whether we attend to its matter or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is a book of conſiderable merit; as he had an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to be well informed, and ſeems to have been inquiſitive with reſpect to the manners and tranſactions of the Peruvians, great credit is due to his teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>DON DIEGO FERNANDEZ publiſhed his Hiſtoria del Peru, in 1571. His ſole object is to relate the diſſenſions and civil wars of the Spaniards in that empire. As he ſerved in a public ſtation in Peru, and was well acquainted both with the country, and with the principal actors in thoſe ſingular ſcenes which he deſcribes, as he poſſeſſed ſound underſtanding and great impartiality, his work may be ranked among thoſe of the hiſtorians moſt diſtinguiſhed for their induſtry in reſearch, or their capacity in judging with reſpect to the events which they relate.</p>

For though the firſt part of his work, intitled, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarios Reales del Origen de los Incas Reoies del Peru,</hi> was not publiſhed ſooner than the year 1609, ſeventy-ſix years after the death of Atahualpa the laſt emperor, yet as he was born in Peru, and was the ſon of an officer of diſtinction among the Spaniſh conquerors, by a <hi>Coya,</hi> or lady of the royal race, on account of which he always took the name of <hi>Inca;</hi> as he was maſter of the language ſpoken by the Incas, and acquainted
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:034476_0966_0FFDDE0FC20D8340"/>
with the traditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very high, and often placed above that of all the other hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. His work, however, is little more than a commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spaniſh writers of the Peruvian ſtory, and compoſed of quotations taken from the authors whom I have mentioned. This is the idea which he himſelf gives of it, Lib. i. c. 10. Nor is it in the account of facts only that he follows them ſervilely. Even in explaining the inſtitutions and rites of his anceſtors, his information ſeems not to be more perfect than theirs. His explanation of the Quipos is almoſt the ſame with that of Acoſta. He produces no ſpecimen of Peruvian poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but that wretched one which he borrows from Blas Valera, an early miſſionary, whoſe memoirs have never been publiſhed. Lib. ii. c. 15. As for compoſition, arrangement, or a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of diſtinguiſhing between what is fabulous, what is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and what is true, one ſearches for them in vain in the commentaries of the Inca. His work, however notwithſtand-its great defects, is not altogether deſtitute of uſe. Some tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which he received from his countrymen are preſerved in it His knowledge of the Peruvian language has enabled him to correct ſome errors of the Spaniſh writers, and he has inſerted in it ſome curious facts, taken from authors whoſe works were never publiſhed, and are now loſt.</p>

                     <p>THIS extravagant and unſeaſonable diſcourſe of Valverde has been cenſured by all hiſtorians, and with juſtice. But though he ſeems to have been an illiterate and bigotted monk, no wiſe reſembling the good Olmedo, who accompanied Cortes; the abſurdity of his addreſs to Atahualpa, muſt not be charged wholly upon him. His harangue is evidently a tranſlation or paraphraſe of that form, concerted by a junto of Spaniſh divines and lawyers in the year 1509, for explaining the right of their king to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the New World, and for directing the officers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in America how they ſhould take poſſeſſion of any new country. See Vol. i. Note xxiii. The ſentiments contained in Valverde's harangue muſt not then be imputed to the bigotted imbecility of a particular man, but to that of the age. But Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara and Benzoni relate one circumſtance concerning Valverde,

which, if authentic, renders him an object, not of contempt only, but of horror.

                     <p>TWO different ſyſtems have been formed concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Atahualpa. The Spaniſh writers, in order to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the violence of their countrymen, contend, that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca's profeſſions of friendſhip were feigned; and that his intention in agreeing to an interview with Pizarro at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers at one blow; that for this purpoſe he advanced with ſuch a numerous body of attendants, who had arms concealed under their garments to execute this ſcheme. This is the account given by Xeres and Zarate, and adopted by Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca to deſtroy the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he would have permitted them to march unmoleſted through the deſert of Motupe, or have neglected to defend the paſſes in the mountains, where they might have been attacked with ſo much advantage. If the Peruvians marched to Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable, that of ſo great a body of men, prepared for action, not one ſhould attempt to make reſiſtance, but all tamely ſuffered themſelves to be butchered by an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Atahualpa's mode of advancing to the interview, has the aſpect of a peaceable proceſſion, not of a military enterpriſe. He himſelf and his followers were, in their habits of ceremony, preceded, as on days of ſolemnity, by unarmed harbingers. Though rude nations are frequently cunning and falſe, yet, if a ſcheme of deception and treachery muſt be imputed either to a monarch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had no great reaſon to be alarmed at a viſit from ſtrangers who ſolicited admiſſion into his preſence as friends, or to an adventurer ſo daring, and ſo little ſcrupulous as Pizarro, one cannot heſitate in determining where to fix the preſumption of guilt. Even amidſt the endeavour of the Spaniſh writers to palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the proceedings of Pizarro, one plainly perceives, that it was his intention, as well as his intereſt, to ſeize the Inca, and that he had taken meaſures for that purpoſe previous to any ſuſpicion of that monarch's deſigns.</p>

                        <pb n="464" facs="unknown:034476_0969_0FFDDE17C62ADB80"/>GARCILASSO DE LA VEGA, extremely ſolicitous to vindicate his countrymen, the Peruvians, from the crime of having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the deſtruction of Pizarro and his followers, and no leſs afraid to charge the Spaniards with improper conduct towards the Inca, has framed another ſyſtem. He relates, that a man of majeſtic form, with a long beard, and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in a viſion to Viracocha, the eighth Inca, and declared, that he was a child of the Sun, that monarch built a temple in honour of this perſon, and erected an image of him, reſembling as nearly as poſſible the ſingular form in which he had exhibited himſelf to his view. In this temple, divine honours were paid to him, by the name of Viracocha. P. i. lib. iv. c. 21. lib. v. c. 22. When the Spaniards firſt appeared in Peru, the length of their beards, and the dreſs they wore, ſtruck every perſon ſo much with their likeneſs to the image of Viraco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha, that they ſuppoſed them to be children of the Sun, who had deſcended from heaven to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the Peruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne would be occupied by new poſſeſſors. Atahualpa himſelf, conſidering the Spaniards as meſſengers from heaven, was ſo far from entertaining any thoughts of reſiſting them, that he determined to yield implicit obedience to their commands. From thoſe ſentiments flowed his profeſſions of love and reſpect. To thoſe were owing the cordial reception of Soto and Ferdinand Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro in his camp, and the ſubmiſſive reverence with which he himſelf advanced to viſit the Spaniſh general in his quarters; but from the groſs ignorance or Philipillo, the interpreter, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Spaniards, and his anſwer to it, were ſo ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that by their mutual inability to comprehend each other's intentions, the fatal rencounter at Caxamalca, with all its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences, was occaſioned.</p>
                     <p>IT is remarkable, that no traces of this ſuperſtitious veneration of the Peruvians for the Spaniards are to be found either in Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, or Sancho, or Zarate, previous to the interview at Caxamalca; and yet the two former ſerved under Pizarro at that time, and the latter viſited Peru ſoon after the conqueſt. If either the Inca himſelf, or his meſſenger, had addreſſed the Spaniards in the words which Garci aſſo puts in their mouths, they muſt have been ſtruck with ſuch ſubmiſſive declarations; and they would certainly have availed themſelves of them to accompliſh their own deſigns with greater facility. Garcilaſſo himſelf, though his narrative of the intercourſe between the Inca and Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, preceding the rencounter at Caxamalca, is founded on the ſuppoſition of his believing them to be Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Peruvians did not recollect the reſemblance between them and the god Viracocha, until the fatal diſaſters ſubſequent to the defeat at Caxamalca, and then only began to call them Viracochas. P. i. lib. v. c. 21. This is confirmed by Herrera, dec. 5. lib. ii. c. 12. In many different parts of America, if we may believe the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh writers, their countrymen were conſidered as divine beings who had deſcended from Heaven. But in this inſtance, as in many which occur in the intercourſe between nations whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in refinement is very unequa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, the ideas of thoſe who uſed the expreſſion were different from the ideas of thoſe who heard it. For ſuch is the idiom of the Indian languages, or ſuch is the ſimplicity of thoſe who ſpeak them, that when they ſee any thing with which they were formerly unacquainted, and of which they do not know the origin—they ſay, that it came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Nugnez. Ram. iii. 327, C.</p>
                     <p>THE account which I have given of the ſentiments and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Peruvians, appears to be more natural and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent than either of the two preceding, and is better ſupported by the facts related by the contemporary hiſtorians.</p>
                     <p>ACCORDING to Xerez, p. 200, two thouſand Peruvians were killed. Sancho makes the number of the ſlain ſix or ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Ram. iii. 274, D. By Garcilaſſo's account, five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were maſſacred. P. ii. lib. i. c. 25. The number which I have mentioned, being the medium between the extremes, may probably be neareſt the truth.</p>

                     <p>THE Peruvians not only imitated the military arts of the Spaniards, but had recourſe to devices of their own. As the cavalry were the chief object of their terror, they endeavoured to render them incapable of acting, by means of a long thong with a ſtone faſtened to each end. This when thrown by a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand, twiſted about the horſe and its rider, and entangled them ſo as to obſtruct their motions, Herrera mentions this as an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own. Dec. 5. lib. viii. c 4. But as I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, vol. ii. p. 176, this weapon is common among ſeveral bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous tribes towards the extremity of South America; and it is more probable, that the Peruvians had obſerved the dexterity with which they uſed it in hunting, and on this occaſion adopted it themſelves The Spaniards were conſiderably annoyed by it, Herrera, ibid. Another inſtance of the ingenuity of the Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians deſerves mention. By turning a river out of its channel, they overflowed a valley, in which a body of the enemy was poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo ſuddenly, that it was with the utmoſt difficulty the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards made their eſcape.

It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably taken from the journal of Orellana himſelf. But the dates are not diſtinctly marked.

                     <p>IN my inquiries concerning the manners and policy of the Mexicans, I have received much information from a large manuſcript of Don Alonſo de Corita, one of the judges in the Court of Audience of Mexico. In the year 1553, Philip II. in order to diſcover the mode of levying tribute from his Indian ſubjects, that would be moſt beneficial to the crown, and leaſt oppreſſive to them, addreſſed a mandate to all the Courts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in America, enjoining them to anſwer certain queries which he propoſed to them, concerning the ancient form of government eſtabliſhed among the various nations of Indians, and the mode in which they had been accuſtomed to pay taxes to their kings or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate, Corita, who had reſided nineteen years in America, fourteen of which he paſſed in New Spain, compoſed the work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his ſovereign, that he had made it an object during his reſidence in America, and in all its provinces which he had viſited, to inquire diligently into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:034476_0975_0FFDDE2953172948"/>
and cuſtoms of the natives, that he had converſed for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with many aged and intelligent Indians, and conſulted ſeveral of the Spaniſh eccleſiaſtics, who underſtood the Indian languages moſt perfectly, particularly ſome of thoſe who landed in New Spain ſoon after the conqueſt. Corita appears to be a man of ſome learning, and to have carried on his inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to which he pretends. Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er credit is due to his teſtimony from one circumſtance. His work was not compoſed with a view to publication, or in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any particular theory, but contains ſimple, though full anſwers to queries propoſed to him officially. Though Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera does not mention him among the authors whom he had followed as guides in his hiſtory, I ſhould ſuppoſe, from ſeveral facts of which he takes notice, as well as from ſeveral expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which he uſes, that this memorial of Corita was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him.</p>

                     <p>THE early Spaniſh writers were ſo haſty and inaccurate in eſtimating the numbers of people in the provinces and towns of America, that it is impoſſible to aſcertain that of Mexico itſelf with any degree of preciſion. Cortes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the extent and populouſneſs of Mexico in general terms, which imply that it was not inferior to the greateſt cities in Europe. Gomara is more explicit, and affirms, that there were 60,000 houſes or families in Mexico. Cron. c. 78. Herre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ra adopts his opinion, Dec. 2. lib. vii. c. 13; and the gen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerality of writers follow them implicitly without inquity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Torquemada, with his uſual propenſity to the marvellous, aſſerts, that there were a hundred and twenty thouſand houſes or families in Mexico, and conſequently about ſix hundred thouſand inhabitants. Lib. iii. c. 23. But in a very judicious account of the Mexican empire, by one of Cortes's officers, the population is fixed at 60,000 people. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſio, iii. 309. A.

                     <p>FROM comparing ſeveral paſſages in Corita and Herrera, we may collect, with ſome degree of accuracy, the various modes in which the Mexicans contributed towards the ſupport of government. Some perſons of the firſt order ſeem to have been exempted from the payment of any tribute, and as their only duty to the public, were bound to perſonal ſervice in war, and to follow the banner of their ſovereign with their vaſſals. 2. The imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate vaſſals of the crown were bound not only to perſonal mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſervice, but paid a certain proportion of the produce of their lands in kind. 3. Thoſe who held offices of honour or truſt, paid a certain ſhare of what they received in conſequence of holding theſe. 4. Each <hi>Capullae,</hi> or aſſociation, cultivated ſome part of the common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the crown, and depoſited the produce in the royal granaries. 5. Some part of whatever was brought to the public markets, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruits of the earth, or the various productions of their artiſts and manufacturers, was demanded for the public uſe, and the merchants who paid this were exempted from every other tax. 6.

                     <p>CORTES, who ſeems to have been as much aſtoniſhed with this, as with any inſtance of Mexican ingenuity, gives a particular deſcription of it. Along one of the cauſeways, ſays he, by which they enter the city, are conducted two conduits, compoſed of clay tempered with mortar, about two paces in breadth, and raiſed about ſix feet. In one of them is conveyed a ſtream of excellent water, as large as the body of a man, into the centre of the city, and it ſupplies all the inhabitants plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. The other is empty, that when it is neceſſary to clean, or repair the former, the ſtream of water may be turned into it. As this conduit paſſes along two of the bridge, where there are breaches in the cauſeway, through which the ſalt water of the lake flows, it is conveyed over them in pipes as large as the body of an ox, then carried from the conduit to the remote quarters of the city, in canoes, and ſold to the inhabitants.

                     <p>IN the armoury of the royal palace of Madrid, are ſhewn ſuits of armour, which are called Montezuma's. They are compoſed of thin lacquered copper-plates. In the opinion of very intelligent judges, they are evidently eaſtern. The forms of the ſilver ornaments upon them, repreſenting dragons, &amp;c. may be conſidered as a confirmation of this.

                     <p>THE ſecond ſpecimen of Mexican picture-writing, was publiſhed by Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in two copperplates. The firſt is a map or repreſentation of the progreſs of the ancient Mexicans on their firſt arrival in the country, and of the various ſtations in which they ſettled, before they founded the capital of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the lake of Mexico. The ſecond is a Chronological Wheel, or Circle, repreſenting the manner in which they computed and marked their cycle of fifty-two years. He received both from Don Carlos de Siguenza y Congorra, a diligent collector of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mexican documents. But as it ſeems now to be a received opinion (founded, as far as I know on no good evidence) that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reri was never out of Italy, and that his famous <hi>Giro del Mundo</hi> is an account of a fictitious voyage, I have not mentioned theſe paintings in the text. They have, however, manifeſtly the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of being Mexican productions and are allowed to be ſo by Boturini, who was well qualified to determine whether they were genuine or ſuppoſitious. M. Clavigero, likewiſe, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits them to be genuine paintings of the ancient Mexicans. To me they always appeared to be ſo, though, from my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to reſt no part of my narrative upon queſtionable autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, I did not refer to them. The ſtyle of painting in the former is conſiderably more perfect than any other ſpecimen of Mexican deſign; but as the original is ſaid to have been much defaced by time, I ſuſpect that it has been improved by ſome touches from the hand of an European artiſt.

                     <p>THE third ſpecimen of Mexican painting was diſcovered by another Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci ſet out for New Spain, and was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He perſiſted nine years in his reſearches, with the enthuſiaſm of a projector, and the patience of an antiquary. In 1746, he publiſhed at Madrid. <hi>Idea de una Nueva Hiſtoria General de la America Septentrianal,</hi> containing an account of the
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:034476_0980_0FFDDE3704E0B7E0"/>
reſult of his inquiries; and he added to it a catalogue of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Hiſtorical Muſeum, arranged under thirty ſix different heads. His idea of a New Hiſtory appears to me the work of a whimſical credulous man. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings, tributerols, calendars, &amp;c. is much larger than one could have expected. Unfortunately a ſhip, in which he had ſent a conſiderable part of them to Europe, was taken by an Engliſh privateer during the war between Great Britain and Spain which commenced in the year 1739; and it is probable that they periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by falling into the hands of ignorant captors Boturini himſelf incurred the diſpleaſure of the Spaniſh court, and died in an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital at Madrid. The hiſtory, of which the <hi>Idea,</hi> &amp;c. was only a <hi>proſpectus,</hi> was never publiſhed. The remainder of his Muſeum ſeems to have been diſperſed. Some part of it came into the poſſeſſion of the preſent archbiſhop of Toledo, when he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of New Spain, and he publiſhed from it that curious tribute-roll which I have mentioned.</p>
                     <p>THE only other collection of Mexican paintings, as far as I can learn, is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order of their Imperial Majeſties, I have obtained ſuch a ſpecimen of theſe as I deſired, in eight paintings, made with ſo much fidelity, that I am informed the copies could hardly be diſtinguiſhed from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals. According to a note in this <hi>Codex Mexicanus,</hi> it appears to have been a preſent from Emmanuel King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died A. D. 1533. After paſſing through the hands of ſeveral illuſtrious proprietors, it fell into thoſe of the cardinal of Saxe-Eifenach, who preſented it to the emperor Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold. Theſe paintings are manifeſtly Mexican, but they are in a ſtyle very different from any of the former. An engraving has been made of one of them, in order to gratify ſuch of my readers as may deem this an object worthy their attention. Were it an object of ſufficient importance, it might, perhaps, be poſſible, by recourſe to the plates of Purchas, and the archbiſhop of Toledo, as a key, to form plauſible conjectures concerning the meaning of this picture. Many of the figures are evidently ſimilar. A. A. are targets and darts, almoſt in the ſame form with thoſe publiſhed by Purchas, p. 1070, 1071, &amp;c. B. B. are figures of temples, nearly reſembling thoſe in Purchas, p. 1109 and 1113. and in Lorenzana, Plate II. C. is a bale of mantles, or cotton cloths, the figure of which occurs in almoſt every Plate of Purchas and Lorenzana. E. E. E. ſeems to be Mexican captains in their war dreſs, the fantaſtic ornaments of which reſemble the figures in Purchas, p. 1110, 1111, 2113. I ſhould ſuppoſe this picture to be a tribute-roll, as their mode of noting numbers occurs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. D. D. D. &amp;c. According to Boturini, the mode of computation by the number of knots, was known to the Mexicans
<pb n="476" facs="unknown:034476_0981_0FFDDE38BA704FD8"/>
as well as to the Peruvians, p. 85. and the manner in which the number of units is repreſented in the Mexican paintings in my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, ſeems to confirm this opinion. They plainly reſemble a ſtring of knots on a cord or ſlender rope.</p>
                     <p>SINCE I publiſhed the former Edition, Mr. Waddilove, who is ſtill pleaſed to continue his friendly attention to procure me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, has diſcovered, in the Library of the Eſcurial, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume in folio, conſiſting of forty ſheets of a kind of paſteboard, each the ſize of a common ſheet of writing paper, with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of uncouth and whimſical figures of Mexican painting, in very freſh colours, and with an explanation in Spaniſh to moſt of them. The firſt twenty-two ſheets are the ſigns of the months, days, &amp;c. About the middle of each ſheet are two or more large, figures for the month, ſurrounded by the ſigns of the days. The laſt eighteen ſheets are not ſo filled with figures. They ſeem to be ſigns of Deities, and images of various objects. According to this Calendar in the Eſcurial, the Mexican year contained 286 days, divided into 22 months of 13 days. Each day is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by a different ſign, taken from ſome natural object, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, a dog, a lizard, a reed, a houſe, &amp;c. The ſigns of the days in the Calendar of the Eſcurial are preciſely the ſame with thoſe mentioned by Boturini, Idea, &amp;c. p. 45. But, if we may give credit to that Author, the Mexican year contained 360 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days. The order of days in every month was computed, according to him, firſt by what he calls a <hi>tridecennary</hi> progreſſion of days from one to thirteen, in the ſame manner as in the Calendar of the Eſcurial, and then by a <hi>ſepte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> progreſſion of days from one to ſeven, making in all twenty. In this Calendar, not only the ſigns which diſtinguiſh each day, but the qualities ſuppoſed to be peculiar to each month, are marked. There are certain weakneſſes which ſeem to accompany the human mind through every ſtage of its progreſs in obſervation and ſcience. Slender as was the knowledge of the Mexicans in Aſtronomy, it appears to have been already connected with judicial Aſtrology. The fortune and character of perſons born in each month, are ſuppoſed to be decided by ſome ſuperior influence predominant at the time of nativity. Hence it is foretold in the Calendar, that all who are born in one month will be rich, in another warlike, in a third luxurious, &amp;c. The paſteboard or whatever ſubſtance it may be on which the Calendar in the Eſcurial is painted, ſeems, by Mr. Waddilove's deſcription of it, to reſemble nearly that in the Imperial Library at Vienna. In ſeveral particulars, the figures bear ſome likeneſs to thoſe in the plate which I have publiſhed. The figures marked D. which induced me to conjecture, that this painting might be a tribute-roll ſimilar to theſe publiſhed by Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas and the Archbiſhop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove ſuppoſes to
<pb n="477" facs="unknown:034476_0982_0FFDDE3C64D7ABD0"/>
be ſigns of days; and I have ſuch confidence in the accuracy of his obſervations, as to conclude his opinion to be well founded. It appears from the characters in which the explanations of the figures are written, that this curious monument of Mexican art has been obtained, ſoon after the conqueſt of the empire. It is ſingular that it ſhould never have been mentioned by any Spaniſh Author.</p>

                     <p>THE Temple of Cholula, which was deemed more holy than any in New Spain, was likewiſe the moſt conſiderable. But it was nothing more than a mount of ſolid earth.

                     <p>THE exaggeration of the Spaniſh hiſtorians, with reſpect to the number of human victims ſacrificed in Mexico, appears to be very great. According to Gomara, there was no year in which twenty thouſand human victims were not offered to the Mexican Divinities, and in ſome years they amounted to fifty thouſand. Cron. c. 229. The ſkulls of thoſe unhappy perſons were ranged in order in a building erected for that purpoſe, and two of Cortes's officers, who had counted them, informed Gomara that their number was an hundred and thirty-ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. Ibid. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>2. Herrera's account is ſtill more incredible, that the number of victims was ſo great, that five thouſand have been ſacrificed in one day, nay, on ſome occaſions, no leſs than twenty thouſand. Dec. iii. lib. ii. c. 16. Torquemada goes beyond both in extravagance, for he aſſerts, that twenty thouſand children, excluſive of other victims, were ſlaughtered annually. Mon. Ind. lib. 21, ii. c. 16. The moſt reſpectable authority in favour of ſuch high numbers is that of Zumuriaga, the firſt biſhop of Mexico, who in a letter to the chapter general of his order, A. D. 1631, aſſerts that the Mexicans ſacrificed annually twenty thouſand victims. Davila Teatro Eccleſ. 126. In oppoſition to all theſe accounts, B. de las Caſas obſerves, that if there had been ſuch an annual waſte of the human ſpecies, the country could never have arrived at that degree of populouſneſs, for which it was remarkable when the Spaniards firſt landed there. This reaſoning is juſt. If the number of victims in all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of New Spain had been ſo great, not only muſt population have been prevented from increaſing, but the human race muſt have been exterminated in a ſhort time. For beſides the waſte
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:034476_0985_0FFDDE4452509D28"/>
of the ſpecies by ſuch numerous ſacrifices, it is obſervable that wherever the fate of captives taken in war is either certain death or perpetual ſlavery, as men can gain nothing by ſubmitting ſpeedily to an enemy, they always reſiſt to the uttermoſt, and war becomes bloody and deſtructive to the laſt degree. Las Caſas poſitively aſſerts, that the Mexicans never ſacrificed more than fifty or a hundred perſons in a year. See his diſpute with Sepulveda, ſubjoined to his Breviſſima Relacion, p. 105. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes does not ſpecify what number of victims was ſacrificed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, but B. Diaz del Caſtello relates, that an inquiry hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been made, with reſpect to this, by the Franciſcan Monks, who were ſent into New Spain immediately after the conqueſt, it was found that about two thouſand five hundred were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed every year in Mexico.

                     <p>IT is hardly neceſſary to obſerve, that the Peruvian Chronology is not only obſcure, but repugnant to concluſion deduced from the moſt accurate and extenſive obſervations, concerning the time that elapſes during each reign, in any given ſucceſſion of princes. The medium has been found not to exceed twenty years. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Acoſta and Garcilaſſo de la Vega, Huana Capac, who died about the year 1527, was the twelfth Inca. According to this rule of computing, the duration of the Peruvian monarchy ought not to have been reckoned above two hundred and forty years; but they affirm that it had ſubſiſted four hundred years. Acoſta lib. vi. c. 19. Vega, lib. i. c. 9. By this account each reign is extended at a medium to thirty-three years, inſtead of twenty, the number aſcertained by Sir Iſaac Newton's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but ſo imperfect were the Peruvian traditions, that though the total is boldly marked, the number of years in each reign is unknown.</p>

circumſtance is, the imperfection of the Peruvian art, when applied to working in timber.

The Peruvians could not mortize two beams together, or give any degree of union or ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to any work compoſed of timber. As they could not form a centre, they were totally unacquainted with the uſe of arches in building, nor can the Spaniſh authors conceive how they were able to frame a roof for thoſe ample ſtructures which they raiſed.</p>

                     <p>P. Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated ten cauſes of the rapid depopulation of Mexico, to which he gives the name of the Ten Plagues. Many of theſe are not peculiar to that province. 1. The introduction of the ſmall-pox. This d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſcaſe was firſt brought into New Spain in the year 1520, by a negro ſlave who attended Narvaez in his expedition againſt Cortes. Torribio affirms, that one half of the people in the provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces viſited with this diſtemper, died. To this mortality occaſioned by the ſmall-pox, Torquemada adds the deſtructive effects of two contageous diſtempers which raged in the years 1545 and 1576. In the former 800,000, in the latter above two millions periſhed, according to an exact account taken by order of the viceroys. Mon. Ind. i. 642. The ſmall-pox was not introduced into Peru for ſeveral years after the invaſion of the Spaniards, but there too that diſtemper proved very fatal to the natives. Garcia Origen, p. 88. 2. The number who were killed or died of famine in the war with the Spaniards, particularly during the ſiege of Mexico. 3. The great famine that followed after the reduction of Mexico, as all the people engaged, either on one ſide or other, had neglected the cultivation of their lands. Something ſimilar to this happened in all the other countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous taſks impoſed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging to their Repartimientos. 5. The oppreſſive burden of taxes which they were unable to pay, and from which they could hope for no exemption. 6. The numbers employed in collecting the gold, carried down by the torrents from the mountains, who were forced from their own habitations, without any proviſion made for their ſubſiſtence, and ſubjected to all the rigour of cold in thoſe elevated regions. 7. The immenſe labour of rebuilding Mexico, which Cortes urged on with ſuch precipitate ardour, as deſtroyed an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people. 8. The number of people condemned to ſervitude, under various pretexts, and employed in working the ſilver mines. Theſe marked by each proprietor with a hot iron, like his cattle, were driven in herds to the mountains. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the labour to which they were ſubjected there, the noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vapours of the mines, the coldneſs of the climate, and ſcarcity of food, were ſo fatal, that Torribio affirms, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

round ſeveral of thoſe mines, particularly near Guaxago, was covered with dead bodies, the air corrupted with their ſtench, and ſo many vultures, and other voracious birds, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about for their prey, that the ſun was darkened with their flight. 10. The Spaniards, in the different expeditions which they undertook, and by the civil wars which they carried on, deſtroyed many of the natives whom they compelled to ſerve them as <hi>Tamemes,</hi> or carriers of burdens. This laſt mode of oppreſſion was particulary ruinous to the Peruvians. From the number of Indians who periſhed in Gonzalo Pizarro's expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the countries to the eaſt of the Andes, one may form ſome idea of what they ſuffered in ſimilar ſervices, and how faſt they were waſted by them.

                     <p>INNUMERABLE proofs of this might be produced from Spaniſh authors.

                     <p>IT is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of the ſtate of population in thoſe kingdoms of Europe where the police is moſt perfect, and where ſcience has made the greateſt progreſs. In Spaniſh America, where knowledge is ſtill in its infancy, and few men have leiſure to engage in reſearches merely ſpeculative, little attention has been paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 1741, Philip V. enjoined the viceroys and governors of the ſeveral provinces in America, to make an actual ſurvey of the people under their juriſdiction, and to tranſmit a report concerning their number and occupations. In conſequence of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of New Spain, appointed D. Joſ. Antonio de Villa Segnor y Sanchez, to execute that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in New Spain. From the reports of the magiſtrates in the ſeveral diſtricts, as well as from his own obſervations, and
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:034476_0992_0FFDDE58C7A9CAC0"/>
long acquaintance with moſt of the provinces, Villa Segnor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the reſult of his inquiries in his <hi>Teatro Americano.</hi> His report, however, is imperfect. Of the nine dioceſes, into which the Mexican empire has been divided, he has publiſhed an account of five only, viz. the archbiſhopric of Mexico, the biſhoprics of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebla de los Angeles, Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nova Galicia. The biſhoprics of Yucatan, Verapaz, Chiapa, and Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though the two latter comprehend countries in which the Indian race is more numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his ſurvey of the extenſive dioceſe of Nova Galicia, the ſituation of the different Indian villages is deſcribed, but he ſpecifies the number of people only in a ſmall part of it. The Indians of that extenſive province, in which the Spaniſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is imperfectly eſtabliſhed, are not regiſtered with the ſame accuracy as in other parts of New Spain. According to Villa Segnor, the actual ſtate of population in the five dioceſes above mentioned is of Spaniſh negroes, mulattoes, and meſtizos, in the dioceſes of <table>

                     <p>THE account of the number of Spaniards, &amp;c. ſeems not to be equally complete. Of many places, Villa Segnor obſerves in general terms, that ſeveral Spaniards, negroes, and people of a
<pb n="488" facs="unknown:034476_0993_0FFDDE5B66374B70"/>
mixed race, reſide there, without ſpecifying their number. If, therefore, we make allowance for theſe, and for all who reſide in the four dioceſes omitted, the number of Spaniards, and of thoſe of a mixed race, may probably amount to a million and a half. In ſome places, Villa Segnor diſtinguiſhes between Spaniards and the three inferior races of negroes, mulattoes, and meſtizos, and marks their number ſeparately. But he generally blends them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But from the proportion obſervable in thoſe places, where the number ot each is marked, as well as from the account of the ſtate of population in New Spain by other authors, it is manifeſt that the number of negroes and perſons of a mixed race far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds that of Spaniards. Perhaps the latter ought not to be reckoned above 500,000 to a million of the former.</p>
                     <p>DEFECTIVE as this account may be, I have not been able to procure ſuch intelligence concerning the number of people in Peru, as might enable me to form any con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ecture equally ſatisfying with reſpect to the degree of its population. I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that in the year 1761, the protectors of the Indians in the viceroyalty of Peru computed that 612,780 paid tribute to the king. As all females, and perſons under age, are exempted from this tax in Peru, the total number of Indians ought by that account, to be 2,449,120. MS. <hi>penes me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I SHALL mention another mode, by which one may compute, or at leaſt form a gueſs, concerning the ſtate of population in New Spain and Peru. According to an account which I have reaſon to conſider as accurate, the number or copies of the bull of Cruzada, exported to Peru on each new publication, is 1,171,953; to New Spain 2,649,326. I am informed, that but few Indians purchaſe bulls, and that they are ſold chiefly to the Spaniſh inhabitants, and thoſe of mixed race, ſo that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Spaniards, and people of a mixed race, will amount by this mode of computation, to at leaſt three million.</p>
                     <p>THE number of inhabitants in many of the towns in Spaniſh America, may give us ſome idea of the extent of population, and correct the inaccurate, but popular notion entertained in Great Britain, concerning the weak and deſolate ſtate of their colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The city of Mexico contains at leaſt 150,000 people It is remarkable that Torquemada, who wrote his <hi>Monarquia Indiana</hi> about the year 1612, reckons the inhabitants of Mexico at that time to be only 7000 Spaniards, and 8000 Indians. Lib. iii. c. 26. Pueblade los Angeles contains above 60,000 Spaniards, and people of a mixed race. Villa Segnor, p. 247. Guadalaxara contains above 30,000, excluſive of Indians, Id. ii. 206.

                     <p>SUCH are the detached accounts of the number of people in ſeveral towns, which I found ſcattered in authors whom I thought worthy of credit. But I have obtained an enumeration of the inhabitants of the towns in the province of Quito, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of which I can rely; and I communicate it to the Public, both to gratify curioſity, and to rectify the miſtaken notion which I have mentioned. St. Franciſco de Quito contains between 50 and 60,000 people of all the different races. Beſides the city, there are in the <hi>Corregimiento</hi> 29 <hi>curas</hi> or pariſhes eſtabliſhed in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal villages, each of which has ſmaller hamlets depending upon it. The inhabitants of theſe are moſtly Indians and Meſtizos. St. Juan de Paſto has between 6 and 8000 inhabitants, beſides 27 dependent villages. St. Miguel de Ibarra 7000 citizens, and ten villages. The diſtrict of Havala between 18 and 20,000 people. The diſtrict of Tacunna between 10 and 12,000. The diſtrict of Ambato between 8 and 10,000, beſides 16 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending villages. The city of Riobamba between 16 and 20,000 inhabitants, and 9 depending villages. The diſtrict of Chimbo between 6 and 8000. The city of Guyaquil from 6 to 20,000 inhabitants, and 14 depending villages. The diſtrict of Atuaſi between 5 and 6000, and 4 depending villages. The city of Cuenza between 25 and 30,000 inhabitants, and 9 populous depending villages. The town of Laxa from 8 to 10,000 inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and 14 depending villages. This degree or population, though ſlender, if we conſider the vaſt extent of the country, is far beyond what is commonly ſuppoſed. I have omitted to mention, in its proper place, that Quito is the only province in Spaniſh America that can be denominated a manufacturing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; hats, cotton ſtuffs, and coarſe woollen cloths, are made there in ſuch quantities, as to be ſufficient not only for the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the province, but to furniſh a conſiderable article for exportation into other parts of Spaniſh America. I know not whether the uncommon induſtry of this province ſhould be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the cauſe or the effect of its populouſneſs. But among the oſtentatious inhabitants of the New World, the paſſion for every thing Out comes from Europe is ſo violent, that I am infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the manufactures of Quito are ſo much undervalued, as to be on the decline.</p>

                     <p>THERE is no law that excludes Creoles from offices either civil or eccleſiaſtic. On the contrary, there are many <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulas</hi> which recommend the conferring places of truſt indiſcrimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on the natives of Spain and America. Betancurt y Figueroa Derecho, &amp;c. p. 5, 6. But notwithſtanding ſuch repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations, preferment in almoſt every line is conferred on native Spaniards. A remarkable proof of this is produced by the author laſt quoted. From the diſcovery of America to the year 1637, three hundred and ſixty-nine biſhops, or archbiſhops, have been appointed to the different dioceſes in that country, and of all that number only twelve were Creoles, p. 40. This predilection for Europeans ſeems ſtill to continue. By a royal mandate, iſſued in 1776, the chapter of the cathedral of Mexico is directed to nominate European eccleſiaſtics of known merit and abilities, that the king may appoint them to ſupply vacant benefices.

                     <p>D. ANT. ULLOA contends, that working in mines is not noxious, and as a proof of this informs us, that many Meſtizos and Indians, who do not belong to any Repartimiento,

voluntarily hire themſelves as miners; and ſeveral of the Indians, when the legal term of their ſervice expires, continue to work in the mines of choice. <hi>Entreten.</hi> p. 265. But his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the wholeſomeneſs of this occupation is contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of all ages; and wherever men are allured by high wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, they will engage in any ſpecies of labour, however fatiguing or pernicious it may be. D. Hern. Carillo Altemirano relates a curious fact incompatible with this opinion. Wherever mines are wrought, ſays he, the number of Indians decreaſes; but in the province of Campeachy, where there are no mines, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Indians has increaſed more than a third ſince the conqueſt of America, though neither the ſoil nor climate be ſo favourable as in Peru or Mexico.

Many mines are ſituated in parts of the country, ſo barren, and ſo diſtant from the ordinary habitations of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the neceſſity of procuring labourers to work there, has obliged the Spaniſh monarchs to diſpenſe with their own regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſeveral inſtances, and to permit the viceroys to compel the people of more remote provinces to reſort to thoſe mines.

Frezier, an intelligent obſerver, and zealous for his own religion, paints the diſſolute manners of the Spaniſh eccleſiaſtics in Peru, particularly the regulars, in ſtronger colours than I have employed. Voy. p. 51. 215, &amp;c. M. Gentil confirms this account, Voy. i. 34. Correal concurs with both, and adds many remarkable circumſtances. Voy. i. 61.155.161. I have good reaſon to believe, that the manners of the regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are ſtill extremely indecent. Acoſta himſelf acknowledges that great corruption of manners had been the conſequence of permitting monks to forſake the retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline of the cloiſter, and to mingle again with the world by undertaking the charge of the Indian pariſhes. De procur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv. c. 13, &amp;c. He mentions parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe vices, of which I have taken notice, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

the temptations to them as ſo formidable, that he leans to the opinion of thoſe who hold that the regular clergy ſhould not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as pariſh prieſts. Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for the regulars admit, that many and great enormities abounded among the monks of different orders, when ſet free from the reſtraint of monaſtic diſcipline; and from the tone of their defence, one may conclude that the charge brought againſt them was not deſtitute of truth. In the French colonies, the ſtate of the regular clergy is nearly the ſame as in the Spaniſh ſettlements, and the ſame conſequences have followed. M. Biet, ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the ſecular prieſts in Cayenne, inquires with no leſs appearance of piety than of candour, into the cauſes of this corruption, and imputes it chiefly to the exemption of regulars from the juriſdiction and cenſures of their dioceſans, to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to which they are expoſed; and to their engaging in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. Voy. p. 320. It is remarkable that all the authors, who cenſure the licentiouſneſs of the Spaniſh regulars with the greateſt ſeverity, concur in vindicating the conduct of the Jeſuits. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med under a diſcipline more perfect than that of the other monaſtic orders, or animated by that concern for the honour of the ſociety, which takes ſuch full poſſeſſion of every member of the order, the Jeſuits, both in Mexico and Peru, it is allowed, maintained a moſt irreproachable decency of manners. Frezier, 223. Gentil, i. 34. The ſame praiſe is likewiſe due to the biſhops and moſt of the dignified clergy. Frez. ibid.</p>
                     <p>A VOLUME of the Gazette de Mexico for the years 1728, 1729 1730, having been communicated to me, I find there a ſtriking confirmation of what I have advanced concerning the ſpirit of low illiberal ſuperſtition prevalent in Spaniſh America. From the newſpapers of any nation, one may learn what are the objects which chiefly engroſs its attention, and which appear to it moſt intereſting. The Gazette of Mexico is filled almoſt entirely with accounts of religious functions, with deſcriptions of proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, conſecrations of churches, beatifications of ſaints, feſtivals, autos de fe, &amp;c. Civil or commercial affairs, and even the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe occupy but a ſmall corner in this magazine of monthly intelligence. From the titles of new books, which are regularly inſerted in this Gazette, it appears that two-thirds of them are treatiſes of ſcholaſtic theology, or of monkiſh devotion.</p>

A ſtriking proof of the alarm excited by the attempt of the Prince d'Eſquilache to exclude the regulars from parochial cures, is contained in the Colbert collection of papers.

                     <p>NOT only the native Indians, but the <hi>Meſtizos,</hi> or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of a Spaniard and Indian, were originally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the prieſthood, and refuſed admiſſion into any religious order. But by a law iſſued September 28th, 1588, Philip II. required the prelates of America to ordain ſuch meſtizos born in lawful wedlock, as they ſhould find to be properly qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any monaſtery where they had gone through a regular noviciate. Recopil. lib. i. tit. vii. l. 7. Some regard ſeem to have been paid to this law in New Spain; but none in Peru. Upon a repreſentation of this to Char. II. in the year 1697, he iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a new edict enforcing the obſervation of it, and profeſſing his deſire to have all his ſubjects, Indians and meſtizos, is well as Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, admitted to the enjoyment of the ſame privileges. Such however, was the averſion of the Spaniards in America to the Indians, and their race, that this ſeems to have produced little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for, in the year 1725, Philip V. was obliged to renew the injunction in a more peremptory tone. But ſo unſummountable are the hatred and contempt of the Indians among the Peruvian Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, that the preſent king has been conſtrained to enforce the former edicts anew by a law, publiſhed September 11, 1774.

I owe it therefore as a duty to the public, as well as to myſelf, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider each of theſe points with care, and to explain the reaſons which induced me to adopt the opinion which I have publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>I KNEW that in the Chriſtian church there is no diſtinction of perſons, but that men of every nation who embrace the religion of Jeſus, are equally entitled to every Chriſtian privilege which they are qualified to receive. I knew, likewiſe, that an opinion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, not only among moſt of the Spaniſh lairy ſettled in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, but among "many eccleſiaſtics, (I uſe the words of Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rera, dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 15.) that the Indians were not perfect or rational men, and were not poſſeſſed of ſuch capacity as qualified them to partake of the ſacrament of the altar, or of any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our religion." It was againſt this opinion that Las Caſas contended with the laudable zeal which I have deſcribed in Books III. and VI. But as the Biſhop of Darien, Doctor Sepulvida, and other reſpectable eccleſiaſtics, vigorouſly ſupported the common opinion concerning the incapacity of the Indians, it became ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, In order to determine the point, that the authority of the Holy See ſhould be interpoſed; and accordingly Paul III. iſſued a ball A. D. 1537, in which, after condemning the opinion of thoſe who held that the Indians, as being on a level with brute beaſts, ſhould be reduced to ſervitude, he declares, that they were really men, and as ſuch were capable of embracing the Chriſtian religion, and participating of all its bleſſings My account of this b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When Torquemada compoſed his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narquia Indiana,</hi> it was almoſt a century after the conqueſt of New Spain; and yet in his time, it was ſtill the general practice to exclude Indians from holy orders. Of this we have the moſt ſatisfying evidence. Torquemada having celebrated the virtues and graces of the Indians at great length, and with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of a miſſionary, he ſtarts as an objection to what he had aſſerted, "If the Indians really poſſeſs al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the excellent qualities which you have deſcribed, why are they not permitted to aſſume the religious habit? Why are they not ordained prieſts and biſhops as the Jewiſh and Gentile converts were in the primitive church, eſpecially as they might be employed with ſuch ſuperior advantage, to other perſons in the inſtruction of their countrymen?" Lib. xvii. c. 13.</p>
                     <p>IN anſwer to this objection, which eſtabliſhes in the moſt unequivocal manner, what was the general practice at that period, Torquemada obſerves, that although by their natural diſpoſition, the Indians are well fitted for a ſubordinate ſituation, they are deſtitute of all the qualities requiſite in any ſtation of dignity and authority; and that they are in general ſo addicted to drunkenneſs, that, upon the ſlighteſt temptation, one cannot promiſe on their behaving with the decency ſuitable to the clerical character. The propriety of excluding them from it, on theſe accounts, was, he obſerved, ſo well juſtified by experience, that when a foreigner of great eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, who came from Spain, condemned the practice of the Mexican church, he was convinced of his miſtake in a public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with the learned and moſt religious Father D. Juan de Gaona, and his retractation is ſtill extant. Torquemada, indeed, acknowledges, as M. Clavigero obſerves, with a degree of exultation, that, in his time, ſome Indians had been admitted into monaſteries; but, with the art of a diſputant, he forgets to mention that Torquemada ſpecifies only two examples of this, and takes notice that in both inſtances thoſe Indians had been admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by miſtake. Relying upon the authority of Torquemada, with regard to New Spain, and of Ulloa with regard to Peru, and conſidering the humiliating depreſſion of the Indians in all the Spaniſh ſettlements, I concluded that they were not admitted into the eccleſiaſtical order, which is held in the higheſt veneration all over the New World.</p>
                     <p>BUT when M. Clavigero, upon his own knowledge, aſſerted facts
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:034476_1004_0FFDDE7939D688A8"/>
ſo repugnant to the concluſion I had formed, I began to diſtruſt it, and to wiſh for further information. In order to obtain this, I applied to a Spaniſh nobleman, high in office, and eminent for his abilities, who, on different occaſions, has permitted me to have the honour and benefit of correſponding with him. I have been favoured with the following anſwer: "What you have written concerning the admiſſion of Indians into holy orders, or into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, in Book VIII. eſpecially as it is explained and limited in Note LXXXVIII. of the quarto edition, is in general accurate, and conformable to the authorities which you quote. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the congregation of the council reſolved and declared, Feb. 13, A. D. 1682, that the circumſtance or being an Indian, a mulatto, or meſtizo, did not diſqualify any perſon from being admitted into holy orders, if he was poſſeſſed of what is required by the canons to entitle him to that privilege; this only proves ſuch ordinations to be legal and valid, (of which Solorzano, and the Spaniſh lawyers and hiſtorians quoted by him, Pol. Ind. lib. ii. c. 29, were perſuaded) but it neither proves the propriety of admitting Indians into holy orders, nor what was then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice with reſpect to this; but, on the contrary, it ſhews that there was ſome doubt concerning the ordaining of Indians, and ſome repugnance to it.</p>
                     <p>"SINCE that time, there have been ſome examples of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Indians into holy orders. We have now at Madrid an aged prieſt, a native of Tlaſcala, His name is D. Juan Cerilo de Cſtilla Aquihual catehutle, deſcended of a Cazique converted to Chriſtianity ſoon after the conqueſt. He ſtudied the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſciences in a ſeminary of Puebla de los Angeles. He was a candidate, nevertheleſs for ten years, and it required much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt before Biſhop Abren would conſent to ordain him. This eccleſiaſtic is a man of unexceptionable character, modeſt, ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and with a competent knowledge of what relates to his clerical functions. He came to Madrid above thirty-four years ago, with the ſole view of ſoliciting admiſſion for the Indians into the colleges and ſeminaries in New Spain, that if, after being well inſtructed and tried, they ſhould find an inclination to enter into the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, they might embrace it, and perform its functions with the greateſt benefit to their countrymen, whom they could addreſs in their native tongue. He has obtained va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious regulations favourable to his ſcheme, particularly that the firſt college which became vacant in conſequence of the excluſion of the Jeſuits, ſhould be ſet apart for this purpoſe. But neither theſe regulations, nor any ſimilar ones inſerted in the laws of the Indies, has produced any effect, on account of objections and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations from the greater part of perſons of chief conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion employed in New Spain. Whether their oppoſition be well
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:034476_1005_0FFDDEDEB16BE6B8"/>
founded or not, is a problem difficult to reſolve, and towards the ſolution of which, ſeveral diſtinctions and modifications are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</p>
                     <p>"ACCORDING to the accounts of this eccleſiaſtic, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of other perſons who have reſided in the Spaniſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in America, you may reſt aſſured that in the kingdom of Tierra Firme no ſuch thing is known as either an Indian ſecular prieſt or monk; and that in New Spain there are very few eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtics of Indian race. In Peru perhaps, the number may be greater, as in that country there are more Indians who poſſeſs the means of acquiring ſuch a learned education as is neceſſary for perſons who aſpire to the clerical character."</p>

                     <p>WHEN the mines of Potoſi were diſcovered in the year 1545, the veins were ſo near the ſurface, that the ore was eaſily extracted, and ſo rich that it was refined with little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and at a ſmall expence, merely by the action of fire. This ſimple mode of refining by fuſion alone continued until the year 1574, when the uſe of mercury in refining ſilver, as well as gold, was diſcovered. Thoſe mines having been wrought without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption for two centuries, the veins are now ſunk ſo deep, that the expence of extracting the ore is greatly increaſed.

                     <p>MANY remarkable proofs occur of the advanced ſtate of induſtry in Spain, at the beginning of the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. The number of cities in Spain was conſiderable, and they were peopled far beyond the proportion that was common in other parts of Europe. The cauſes of this I have explained, Hiſt. of Cha. V. i. 158. Wherever cities are populous, that ſpecies of induſtry which is peculiar to them increaſes, artificers and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturers abound. The effect of the American trade in giving activity to theſe is manifeſt, from a ſingular fact. In the year 1545, while Spain continued to depend on its own induſtry, for the ſupply of its colonies, ſo much work was beſpoke from the manufacturers, that it was ſuppoſed they could hardly finiſh it in leſs than ſix years. Campom. i. 406. Such a demand muſt have put much induſtry in motion, and have excited extraordinary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. Accordingly, we are informed, that in the beginning of Philip II.'s reign, the city of Seville alone, where the trade with America centered, gave employment to no fewer than 16,000 looms in ſilk or woolen work, and that above 130,000 perſons had occupation in carrying on theſe manufactures. Campom. ii. 472. But ſo rapid and pernicious was the operation of the cauſes which I ſhall enumerate, that before Philip III. ended his reign, the looms in Seville were reduced to 400.

Bernardo Ward, of the Junta de Comercio at Madrid, in his <hi>Proyecto Economico,</hi> Part. ii. c. i. "Under the reigns of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les V. and Philip II." ſays he, "the manufactures of Spain and of the Low Countries ſubject to her dominion, were in a moſt flouriſhing ſtate. Thoſe of France and England were in their infancy. The republic of the U. Provinces did not then exiſt. No European power but Spain, had colonies of any value in the New World. Spain could ſupply her ſettlements there with the productions of her own ſoil, the fabrics wrought by the hands of her own artizans, and all ſhe received in return for theſe belonged to herſelf alone. Then the excluſion of foreign manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures was proper, becauſe it might be rendered effectual. Then Spain might lay heavy duties upon goods exported to America, or imported from it, and might impoſe what reſtraint ſhe deemed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per upon a commerce entirely in her own hands. But when time and ſucceſſive revolutions had occaſioned an alteration in all thoſe circumſtances, when the manufactures of Spain began to decline, and the demands of America were ſupplied by foreign fabrics, the original maxims and regulations of Spain ſhould have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the change in her ſituation.

                     <p>NO bale of goods is ever opened, no cheſt of treaſure is exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Both are received on the credit of the perſons to whom they belong; and only one inſtance of fraud is recorded, during the long period trade was carried on with this liberal confidence. All the coined ſilver which was brought from Peru to Porto-bello in the year 1654, was found to be adulterated, and to be mingled with a fifth part of baſe metal. The Spaniſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, with ſentiments ſuitable to their uſual integrity, ſuſtained the whole loſs, and indemnified the foreigners by whom they were employed. The fraud was detected, and the treaſurer of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue in Peru, the author of it, was publicly burnt. B. Ulloa Retabliſ. de Manuf. &amp;c. liv. ii. p. 102.</p>

                     <p>MANY ſtriking proofs occur of the ſcarcity of money in Spain. Of all the immenſe ſums, which have been imported from America, the amount of which I ſhall afterwards

have occaſion to mention, Moncada aſſerts that there did not remain in Spain, in 1619, above two hundred millions of <hi>peſos,</hi> one half in coined money, the other in plate and jewels. Reſtaur. de Eſpagna, Diſc. iii. c. 1. Uztariz, who publiſhed his valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble work in 1724, contends, that in money, plate, and jewels, there did not remain an hundred million. Theor. &amp;c. c. 3. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomanes, on the authority of a remonſtrance from the community of merchants in Toledo to Philip III. relates as a certain proof how ſcarce caſh had become, that perſons who lent money, received a third part of the ſum which they advanced as intereſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium.

                     <p>THE account of the mode in which the factors of the South Sea company conducted the trade in the fair of Porto-bello, which was opened to them by the Aſſiento, I have taken from Don Dion. Alcedo y Herrera, preſident of the court of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in Quito, and governor of that province. Don Dionyſio was a perſon of ſuch reſpectable character for probity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, that his teſtimony, in any point would be of much weight; but greater credit is due to it in this caſe, as he was an eye-witneſs of the tranſactions which he relates, and was often employed in detecting and authenticating the frauds which he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes. It is probable, however, that his repreſentation, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at the commencement or the war which broke out between Great Britain and Spain, in the year 1739, may, in ſome inſtances, diſcover a portion of the acrimonious ſpirit, natural at that junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. His detail of facts is curious; and even Engliſh authors confirm it in ſome degree, by admitting both that various frauds were practiſed in the tranſactions of the annual ſhip, and that the contraband trade from Jamaica, and other Britiſh colonies, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enormouſly great. But for the credit of the Engliſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it may be obſerved, that thoſe fraudulent operations are not to be conſidered as deeds of the company, but as the diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arts of their factors and agents. The company itſelf ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a conſiderable loſs by the Aſſiento trade. Many of its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants acquired immenſe fortunes.

                     <p>SEVERAL facts with reſpect to the inſtitution, the progreſs, and the effects, of this company, are curious, and but little known to Engliſh readers. Though the province of Venezuela,
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:034476_1009_0FFDDE819BE6B728"/>
or Caraccas, extends four hundred miles along the coaſt, and is one of the moſt fertile in America; it was ſo much neglected by the Spaniards, that during the twenty years prior to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the company, only five ſhips ſailed from Spain to that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and during 16 years, from 1706 to 1722, not a ſingle ſhip arrived from the Caraccas in Spain. Noticias de Real Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania de Caraccas, p. 28. During this period Spain muſt have been ſupplied almoſt entirely with the large quantity of cacao, which it conſumes, by foreigners. Before the erection of the company, neither tobacco nor hides were imported from Carac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas into Spain. Id. p. 117. Since the commercial operations of the company began in the year 1731, the importation of cacao into Spain has increaſed amazingly. During thirty years ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to 1701, the number of <hi>Fanegas</hi> of cacao (each a hundred and ten pounds) imported from Caraccas, was 643,215. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eighteen years ſubſequent to 1731, the number of <hi>Fanegas</hi> imported was 869,247; and if we ſuppoſe the importation to be continued in the ſame proportion during the remainder of thirty years, it will amount to 1,448,746 <hi>Fanegas,</hi> which is an increaſe of 805,531 <hi>Fanegas.</hi> Id. p. 148. During eight years ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to 1756, there has been imported into Spain by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, 88,482 <hi>arrolas</hi> (each twenty-five pounds) of tobacco; and hides to the number of 177,354. Id. 161. Since the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Noticias de Campania, in 1765, its trade ſeems to be on the increaſe. During five years ſubſequent to 1769, it has imported 179,156 <hi>Fanegas</hi> of cacao into Spain, 36,208 arrolas of tobacco, 75,496 hides, and 221,432 peſos in ſpecie. Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomanes, ii. 162. The laſt article is a proof of the growing wealth of the colony. It receives caſh from Mexico in return for the cacao, with which it ſupplies that province, and this it remits to Spain, or lays out in purchaſing European goods. But, beſides this, the moſt explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of cacao raiſed in the province is double to what it yielded in 1731; the number of its live ſtock is more than treble, and its inhabitants much augmented. The revenue of the biſhop, which ariſes wholly from tithes, has increaſed from eight to twenty thouſand peſos. Notic. p. 69. In conſequence of the augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quantity of cacao imported into Spain, its price has decreaſed from eighty peſos for the <hi>Fanega</hi> to forty. Id. 61. Since the publication of the firſt edition, I have learned that Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yana, including all the extenſive provinces ſituated on the banks of the Orinoco, the iſlands of Trinidad and Margarita are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the countries with which the company of Caraccas had liberty of trade by their former charters.

                     <p>THIS firſt experiment made by Spain of opening a free trade with any of her colonies, has produced effects ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as to merit ſome farther illuſtration The towns to which this liberty has been granted, are Cadiz and Seville, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Andaluſia; Alicant and Carthagena, for Valencia and Murcia; Barcelona, for Catalonia and Arragon; Santander, for Caſtile; Corugna, for Galicia; and Gijon, for Aſturias. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, ii. a la Educ. Popul. p. 41. Theſe are either the ports of chief trade in their reſpective diſtricts, or thoſe moſt conveniently ſituated for the exportation of their reſpective productions. The following facts give a view of the increaſe of trade in the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which the new regulations extend. Prior to the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of free trade, the duties collected in the cuſtom-houſe at the Havannah were computed to be 104,208 peſos annually. During the five years preceding 1774, they roſe at a medium to 308,000 peſos a year. In Yucatan, the duties have ariſen from 8,000 to 15,000. In Hiſpaniola, from 2,500 to 5,600. In Porto-Rico, from 1,200 to 7,000. The total value of goods imported from Cuba into Spain, was reckoned, in 1774, to be 1,500,000 peſos. Educ. Popul. i. 450, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>THE price paid for the bull varies according to the rank of different perſons.

Theat. Mex. vol. i. p. 38, &amp;c. According to Villa Segnor, the total produce of the Mexican mines amounts at a medium to eight millions of peſos in ſilver annually, and to 5,912 marks of gold. Ib. p. 44. Several branches of the revenue have been explained in the courſe of the hiſtory; ſome which there was no occaſion of mentioning, require a particular illuſtration. The right to the <hi>rithes</hi> in the New World, is veſted in the crown of Spain, by a bull of Alexander VI. Charles V. appointed them to be applied in the following manner: One fourth is allotted to the biſhop of the dioceſe, another fourth to the dean and chapter, and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the cathedral. The remaining half is divided into nine equal parts. Two of theſe, under the denomination of <hi>los dos Novenos reales,</hi> are paid to the crown, and conſtitute a branch of the royal revenue. The other ſeven parts are applied to the maintenance of the parochial clergy, the building and ſupport of churches, and other pious uſes. Recopil. lib. i. tit. xvi. Ley 23, &amp;c Avendano Theſaur.

                     <p>THE <hi>Alcavala</hi> is a duty levied by an exciſe on the ſale of goods. In Spain it amounts to ten per cent. In America, to four per cent. Solorzano Polit. Indiana, lib vi. c. 8. Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dano, vol. i. 186.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Almajorifaſgo,</hi> or cuſtom paid in America on goods imported and exported, may amount on an average to fifteen per cent. Recopil lib. viii. tit. xiv. Ley. 1. Avendano, vol. i. 188.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Averia,</hi> or tax paid on account of convoys to guard the ſhips ſailing to and from America, was firſt impoſed when Sir Francis Drake filled the New World with terror by his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the South Sea.

                     <p>AN author, long converſant in commercial ſpeculation, has computed, that from the mines of New Spain alone, the king receives annually, as his fifth, the ſum of two millions of our money.
