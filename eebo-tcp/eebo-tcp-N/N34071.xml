                  <note>Not dated, but the line, "And bring ... the first happy New-Year ..." suggests that this was the first carriers' address issued by the American Mercury. The American Mercury was established in 1784 by Joel Barlow and Elisha Babcock; the verses were presumably printed late in 1784 for distribution on or about Jan. 1, 1785.</note>

            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Carrier of the AMERICAN MERCURY Wishes his Customers a HAPPY NEW-YEAR, And presents the following.</head>
            <l>IN the days when old Jupiter held the prime station,</l>
            <l>Stood scaleman for empires and weigh'd the creation,</l>
            <l>Rais'd whirlwinds and earthquakes, to make the world wonder,</l>
            <l>And issued his mandates as well as his thunder,</l>
            <l>Swift Merc'ry, his post-boy attended his nod,</l>
            <l>And drove thro' the nations in style of a god.</l>
            <l>Where e'er he allighted, by sea or by land,</l>
            <l>All the word gaz'd around at the wave of his wand;</l>
            <l>While by nations rever'd and by monarchs ador'd</l>
            <l>And treated with all that each clime could afford,</l>
            <l>On business or pleasure he rambled so free,</l>
            <l>That no monarch on earth was so mighty as he.</l>
            <l>But now since the regions, below and above,</l>
            <l>No longer submit to the sceptre of Jove,</l>
            <l>His messenger too finds his power so decay'd,</l>
            <l>He can hardly find means to continue his trade;</l>
            <l>For, depriv'd of his wings and quite useless his feet,</l>
            <l>He now without help could ne'er get thro' the street;</l>
            <l>While I thro' all weathers am fated to plod,</l>
            <l>And bear round the bulk of this narrative god;</l>
            <l>Yet the task, tho' severe, I've most cheerfully done.</l>
            <l>I return with the week and keep pace with the sun.</l>
            <l>And bring you this morn with my wonderful ditty,</l>
            <l>The first happy new-year that graced your new city.</l>
            <l>Nor think I (ye learned with reverence I speak)</l>
            <l>This AMERICAN MERCURY worse than the Greek:</l>
            <l>What tho' in his message he tells you no lies,</l>
            <l>That he came from above; or that gods leave the skies,</l>
            <l>Yet a stranger event he is bold to declare,</l>
            <l>How the fortunate Frenchmen have found the way there.</l>
            <l>I hope for the future he'll greet your fond ear,</l>
            <l>With the glorious events that await the glad year;</l>
            <l>That cash may return and our commerce encrease,</l>
            <l>And virtue still triumph with plenty and peace,</l>
            <l>But since, my kind Reader, my errand is done,</l>
            <l>With your leave and your bounty I'll set off and run.</l>
