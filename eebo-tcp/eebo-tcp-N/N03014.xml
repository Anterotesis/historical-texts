            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Luſts of Men the Cauſe of Wars.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>James IV. I.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your Luſts that war in your Members?</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THERE is no one Subject that has taken up ſo much Room in the many Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the World in general, or of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in particular, as the Wars and Fightings that have been either among themſelves, or againſt one another. Nor has there any thing given Occaſion for ſo many Men to ſignalize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their Conduct and Valour, and tranſmit their Names with Honour to future Generations, and even to the lateſt Poſterity, as their remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Atchievements in Military Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>But now in order to regulate our Apprehenſions of war in general, and to judge when and how far it is lawful or unlawful; in order alſo to adjuſt our Ideas of thoſe <hi>Men of War,</hi> whoſe Names ſound great in Hiſtory, for their martial Genius and mighty Conqueſts; and to diſtinguiſh between thoſe who have been famous for a generous Zeal, and an heroick Courage in maintaining and defending their juſt Rights againſt their invading Foes, and thoſe who have been no leſs infamous for their Oppreſſion and Violence, Tyranny and Cruelty:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003623_0004_10023536CF9F8AD0"/>
And laſtly, in order to our underſtanding with what Views any ſhould be ſeeking Military Skill, and with what Spirit they ſhould enter upon and go forth to War; it is highly requiſite to trace the Subject up to its Fountain Head, and conſider the Origin of all the Wars and Fightings that are or have been in the World.</p>
            <p>And here we ſhall find that the World in its primitive Innocency and Perfection knew no ſuch Thing. For the wiſe Creator of the Univerſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed every thing into ſuch wonderful Order and exact Harmony, that there was not the leaſt Jar or Schiſm, nor the leaſt Oppoſition or Diſcord in the natural or moral World.</p>
            <p>And therefore it muſt needs be our falling from the original Rectitude of our Nature, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sin and Luſt to enter into our Hearts, that has given Birth to all the Contentions and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the Wars and Bloodſheds that have been among the Children of Men. And this is what the inſpired Author of this Epiſtle gives us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or at leaſt leads us into the Apprehenſion of. <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Luſts that war in your Members?</hi> This Epiſtle as you may ſee by the firſt Verſe of it, was directed to the Twelve Tribes that were ſcattered abroad. And ſuch was the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs of of the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation, that as they (thro their Pride by reaſon of their diſtinguiſhing Privileges) deſpiſed all other People; ſo they were generally hated of thoſe among whom they came: and ſeldom lived peaceably with them, or indeed one with another; but were continually at Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance among themſelves, or quarrelling with their Nei'bours. And theſe Contentions and Quarrels being, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Whitby in loc.</note> 
               <hi>Joſephus</hi> obſerves, not only in <hi>Judea,</hi> but

in <hi>Alexandria, Syria,</hi> and many other Places, were doubtleſs the Cauſe of ſetting the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire againſt them, to ſuch a degree as brought on the dreadful Deſtruction of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, which is ſuppoſed to have come upon them ſeven or eight Years after this Epiſtle was written.</p>
            <p>But then if we conſider this Epiſtle as directed to the Chriſtian <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they even after their Converſion retained too much of their old Temper, which threw them into many Conteſts and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels about Matters of Religion, as well as thoſe of a civil Nature. And the Author of this Epiſtle obſerving with Grief and great Concern of Soul, the unchriſtian Heats and Tumults which theſe Profeſſors of Chriſtianity did ſo frequently fall into, is for leading them up to the Source and Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of them, as the moſt powerful Argument to diſcourage and diſſwade them from ſuch Broils and Quarrels for the future. <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Luſts?</hi> He don't put theſe things by way of Interrogation, as if he was at a loſs or uncertain whether they took their Original from hence or no, but we are to look upon it as an oratorical artful way of ſpeaking, that he might perſwade them into the ſame Apprehenſion with himſelf, that all the Wars and Fightings that were among them aroſe from their Luſts, or <hi>their<note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p>There are ſpiritual and fleſhly Luſts, and they all war in our Members, they militate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all of them againſt the Faculties of our Souls and the Members of our Bodies. And theſe Luſts that are thus at war within, the Apoſtle tells us are the Cauſe of all the Wars and Fightings that are without. Accordingly theſe are the two Points in the Text that I propoſe to ſpeak briefly to. <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There are Luſts that war within us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That theſe Luſts are the Cauſe of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then I intend to improve and apply the Truths, by which you will ſee that my Text coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances the Deſigns and Purpoſes of this Day, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than at firſt View ſome of you may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There are Luſts that war within us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Luſts</hi> we are to underſtand irregular Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inordinate Appetites or Deſires. <hi>Luſts</hi> are not any new Affections or Deſires that differ in Nature from thoſe that were originally planted in our Conſtitution. But when Men's natural Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Appetites are fixed upon improper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or carried out to an inordinate Degree, and the Gratification purſued in an irregular Manner, then they become LUSTS.</p>
            <p>And by the Indulgence of one ſuch Luſt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Deſire in our firſt Parents, their Souls were betrayed, and a multitude of them brake in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and got poſſeſſion of their Nature; and ſo intimately united with their Conſtitutions, as to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003623_0007_10023524B50A79D8"/>
become natural to them, and ſo by natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are tranſmitted to their Offspring; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that there are now within us Luſts of every kind, according to the ſeveral Faculties and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul, Senſations and Appetites of the Body, which are diſtinguiſhed into ſpiritual and fleſhly and worldly Luſts; which ſeveral kinds of Luſts, are comprized and diſtinguiſhed by the Apoſtle, into <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16. Now all theſe Luſts war in our Members: they keep up a perpetual Conteſt and Struggle within us.</p>
            <p>Here let me ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Theſe Luſts are at war one with another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Luſts of Men, altho' they have a likeneſs in ſome reſpects, yet are far from having any real Harmony or Agreement among themſelves. For as they have all one common Nature, which conſiſts in irregular Motions and Deſires of the Fleſh and Spirit, ſo the natural Tendency of them muſt needs be to jar and joſtle one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have all different Views and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, and are purſuing different Deſigns; and what will be the natural Effect hereof, but the thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and oppoſing each other continually? The Luſts of the Fleſh interfering with thoſe of the Spirit, in ſeeking after their ſeveral Gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and worldly Luſts oppoſing them both; Pride, Luxury and Intemperance, being all oppoſed by Covetouſneſs or an inordinate Deſire after an hoard of earthly Riches. But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Luſts do all war in our Members, even againſt our Souls and Bodies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Altho' they are at continual Variance among themſelves; yet as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, in the midſt of their civil Diſcords and Diviſions, when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was beſieged, would unite their Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003623_0008_100201EA95C614D8"/>
their common Enemy, ſo theſe diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Luſts all unite againſt <hi>us</hi> as their common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Theſe wicked and unreaſonable Luſts, have entered into a Confederacy, rather a Conſpiracy againſt us, and are offering the utmoſt Violence to our Natures. They have uſurped the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and gotten the Poſſeſſion of our Souls and Bodies, ſo as to weaken and deprave the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the one, and to make uſe of the Members of the other, as <hi>the Inſtruments of Unrighteouſneſs unto Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe rebellious Luſts have turned Reaſon off the Throne, and Conſcience from the Judgment-Seat: and as for the Will and Affections, they have ſo conquered and corrupted them, that they have in a great meaſure, if not entirely, brought them over to their Side. But now, the noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellective Powers of the Soul, are far from being eaſy while their Rights are thus invaded, and their Prerogatives thus encroached upon; and by the Means and Helps that God affords them, in his Word and by his Spirit, they are for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their original Dignity and Authority. And hence ariſes a perpetual Struggle in the Man, the Fleſh luſting againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Fleſh, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
            <p>Thus every Man becomes the Seat of War and the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>But oh! what Calamities! what Deſolations! what Deſtruction and Miſery! has this inteſtine War bro't upon us! what Tumult, what Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion does it keep us in perpetually! How do theſe violent and impetuous Luſts, either by ſetting themſelves in Battle-array, bear down all the Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of Reaſon, Revelation and Conſcience, and even force us to yield to their ſinful Demands!
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003623_0009_1002353E055A73F0"/>
or how by the ſecret and ſudden Sallies of ſome particular Luſts, beſt acquainted with our Tempers and Circumſtances, take us at unawares, and carry us away <hi>captive at their Will?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Oh! how baſe and cruel are theſe uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tyrants, when they have gotten us into their Hands!</p>
            <p>How do they profane and proſtitute our Bodies (deſigned for the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, and that God has curiouſly wrought in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er parts of the Earth, and made in ſuch a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and wonderful Manner as we now behold them) to all our baſe and filthy Deſires! and inſtead of having any regard to our Health, and the preſervation of our Conſtitution, every Member is made a Slave to ſome baſe Luſt or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and rather than deny themſelves any Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, they will abuſe our Bodies to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to bring on Weakneſs and Pains, Diſeaſes and Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>And then again, theſe inſulting Luſts are no leſs abuſive to our Souls. For inſtead of paying a proper regard to the dignity of their ſuperiour Nature, and a due defference to the Dictates of their nobler Powers, which carry a Majeſty with them, they will vent their utmoſt Fury at them, as being their moſt potent Adverſaries, and that give the greateſt diſturbance to their ſinful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences. Theſe therefore they bend all their Force againſt, that if poſſible they might prevail over them, to ſuch a degree, as to go on in the Pleaſures of Sin without any Check or controul from them. And the uncircumciſed Philiſtins never dealt more baſely with <hi>Sampſon</hi> their great Enemy, than theſe Luſts do with our Souls. <hi>They put out the Eyes</hi> of our Underſtandings, and make us <hi>grind</hi> unto them: improving our Skill and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003623_0010_1002352766EDE588"/>
Knowledge in projecting and contriving for their further gratification. And how do they abuſe an Underſtanding thus blinded as to Spiritual Things, calling for it upon every Occaſion, to find ſome way or other to pleaſe and <hi>make Sport</hi> for them?</p>
            <p>In Short, there are no inſults too groſs for theſe Luſts to offer to the Soul. They care not how they wrong and wound it; and rather than deny a Luſt they will degrade and defile the Soul, and make us more vile than the Beaſts that periſh. To pleaſe a Luſt, they will put the Soul upon the Rack, and by reaſon of guilty Fears fill it with the utmoſt Horrours and Diſtreſs; nay they will kill and deſtroy it forever, if it be not reſcued out of their Hands by the Almighty Grace of God.</p>
            <p>Thus theſe wicked and unreaſonable Luſts war in our Members, even againſt all the Members of our Bodies and the Faculties of our Souls.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the Second general Head,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe Luſts that thus war in our Members, are the Cauſe of all the Wars and Fightings that are among the Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings among you? come they not hence even of your Luſts?</hi> The Luſts of Men don't confine their malign Influence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very Perſons they have gotten the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, but being inſatiable in their Deſires as well as unreaſonable in their Demands thoſe Men that are under the Government of them, naturally fall into Broils and Conteſts one with another. For as different Luſts in the ſame Subject are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually jarring with each other, ſo not only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Luſts, but even the ſame Luſts in different Subjects, will naturally ſet them at Variance, and be a means of their breaking forth into Quarrels, and oftentimes at length into Wars and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003623_0011_100201E526E71758"/>
Theſe are they that <hi>have turned the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down</hi> where-ever they have prevailed, and kept it in Wars and Confuſions in ſome part or other, from the firſt entrance of Sin and Luſt into the World to this Day. Luſt had no ſooner entered our firſt Parents, but <hi>Adam</hi> was for accuſing his Wife<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 3. 12.</note>, and doubtleſs a Quarrel immediately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. And the two firſt Sons that were born to them, were no ſooner grown up, but the Spirit that luſteth to Envy, prevailed in one to ſuch a degree that he ſlew his Brother<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 4. 8.</note> And oh! what Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Strifes, Wars and Fightings have, there been in the World ever ſince!</p>
            <p>The Luſts that are in the World, and that are in a peculiar manner litigious and contentious are ſuch as theſe, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Pride, Envy, Malice, Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Emulation, Wrath, Jealouſy, Deceit, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and the like. And now if we trace up the Quarrels that are in Families and among Friends and Neighbours, the civil Diſcords. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Animoſities in particular Nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Princes and their Subjects, and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Controverſies in the Church, which have been generally carried on with as great Fierceneſs and Rage as any; and laſtly, if we were able to traverſe all the Wars that have been among the Nations and Kingdoms of the Earth, we ſhall find the Origin of them in ſome or other of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Luſts. How came it to paſs that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been at War againſt Nation, and Kingdom againſt Kingdom, in the ſeveral Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the World; ſo that there has ſcarce ever been a univerſal Peace, but from Men's Luſts, at leaſt on one ſide, and moſt commonly on both?
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003623_0012_1002354DD259B160"/>
Indeed the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhut the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> the third time, in Token of a univerſal Peace, when Chriſt the Prince of Peace made his entrance into the World; but whether it reached any further than the Roman Empire is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>What is it that has brought ſuch mighty Armies into the Field, that has covered the Face there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with humaine Blood, that has ravaged ſo many Countries, and laid ſo many rich and beautiful Cities waſte, but the unſufferable Pride of Princes, and the inſatiable Avarice, Cruelty and Blood-thirſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of their Officers and Soldiers? Whence was it that the mighty Monarch of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> and Emperors of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent their vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Armies to all Kingdoms Countries and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces within their Knowledge, to ſubdue and conquer them, but from their (I had almoſt ſaid) infinite Pride, graſping at an univerſal Monarchy, and from their Cruelty, Tyranny and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which have born down all regard to the Laws of Nations, or the natural Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of Men? And what are we to think of many of thoſe mighty and renowned Heroes, but as ſo many lawleſs Tyrants, who when they led their Captives in Triumph thro' their capital Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were themſelves in a much more inglorious Manner led in Triumph by their own Luſts?</p>
            <p>And then if we look into the Chriſtian World, and among the Nations that profeſs Subjection to the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and to be governed by the <hi>Goſpel of Peace,</hi> we ſhall find they have been as often at War as other Nations, and their Wars to have taken their Riſe from as baſe a Cauſe. What has been the Cauſe of all the dreadful Wars in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> but the Pride of Princes, aiming at a greater Dominion than was their Right; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

their Covetouſneſs, wickedly deſiring to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by the Spoils of their Nei'bours; or from a jealous and envious Spirit, not bearing to ſee others grow greater than themſelves; or from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Reſentment and cruel Revenge, raging in the breaſts of haughty Princes to ſuch a degree, that nothing but the Blood and Deſtruction of thoſe againſt whom they are incenſed can ſatisfy? And how often have the moſt publick Treaties of Peace, Leagues and Alliances that have been entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and in the moſt ſolemn Manner ratified and confirmed, been violated and broken in upon by theſe deceitful Luſts? So that we muſt all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with the Apoſtle, <hi>That Wars and Fightings come from hence, even from Men's Luſts.</hi> They are begun by Men's Luſts on one Side, and too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly carried on by them on the other. I don't ſay it is always ſo; for altho' it is hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how a War ſhould begin but from ſome Luſt or other; yet we can ſee how it may be proſecuted on the other ſide without. For there is no doubt, but when the juſt Rights of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or People are invaded and incroached upon by a Foreign Power, they may oppoſe and reſiſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto Blood; yea, and may proſecute the War ſo far againſt them as to recover their Rights, and take Satisfaction for the Damages ſuſtained by the Invaſions of their Enemies; provided that Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be not offered, and cannot be obtained in a more gentle Way. Yea, and I ſee not why they may not proceed to weaken the Power of the Aggreſſor, that has often proved falſe and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo far as ſhall diſcourage from making any further Aſſaults upon them. But how ſeldom does a Nation act meerly upon ſuch Principles, and proſecute a War with ſuch Limitations as theſe? But inſtead hereof, have we not reaſon to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003623_0014_1002352A3B2C9328"/>
think, that even thoſe Nations who have engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a lawful War, would carry it on to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Length and Degree, even to the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their Enemies, or at leaſt to the tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of all Government from them, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a Province of their own, if God in his wiſe and gracious Providence did not interpoſe? How would Nations and Countries and Kingdoms be ſacrificed to the Revenge of each other, and how would the leſſer and weaker Kingdoms be ſwallowed up and devoured by thoſe of ſuperiour Strength and Numbers, if it was not for the Lord to whom the Kingdoms of the World belong, and <hi>who is the Governour among the Nations,</hi> who <hi>cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Wrath of Man to praiſe him,</hi> by accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing his Purpoſes and Deſigns upon a Perſon or People, and then <hi>reſtrains the remainder of it,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the inſulting and invading Powers of the Earth, as in <hi>Job.</hi> 38. 11. <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come, but no further, and here ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtayed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to make ſome Improvement and Application of theſe Things. And in the</p>
            <p>1ſt. place, <hi>What we have heard, diſcovers ſome of the evil Effects and Conſequences of our firſt Parents ſuffering Sin and Luſt to enter into their Hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as the Luſts which entered into their Hearts took Poſſeſſion of the human Nature, and have been propogated to all the natural Deſcendants of <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo they have been the unhappy Parents of all the Miſeries and Calamities that are or have been in the World. Luſt had no ſooner entered the Heart of Man, but it conceived and bro't forth Sin, and a Train of innumerable Evils with it. It bro'c Curſe on the Earth, and in a great meaſure, put the whole Frame of Nature here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003623_0015_100235502B788658"/>
out of Courſe: But in a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner has it diſordered the human Nature, and put thoſe Faculties among which there was a perfect Harmony, at the utmoſt Variance, and ſet every Man at war with himſelf. But theſe are not all the unhappy Effects of Men's Luſts; for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Seeds of Diſcord that are ſown among Brethren, and the Cauſe of all the Wars and the Calamities which the World, by reaſon hereof, have laboured under from the beginning to this Day. Little did our firſt Parents think of the Diſorder Confuſion and Miſery, which they entailed upon their Poſterity, when they hearkened to the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Satan, and gave way to an irregular Deſire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We learn what may be expected and look'd for in a World that is full of Sin and Luſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Wars and Rumours of Wars continually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are but the natural Effects of Pride, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Jealouſy, Malice, Covetouſneſs, and the like; And when we ſee theſe Luſts continuing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in our ſelves and among Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, what can we expect but Tumults in our own Breaſts, Jars in Families, Diſcords among Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Quarrels among Nei'bours, Diviſions in the Church, Contentions in the State, and Wars and Fightings among the Nations? Theſe things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follow upon Men's Luſts; and we may as well expect that Cauſes will ceaſe to produce their Effects, as that theſe things ſhould diſcontinue, while Men are inſlaved to their Luſts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The only way to ſolid and laſting Peace, is to curb and conquer Men's Luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no way ſo effectual to procure and ſettle Peace upon a ſure Foundation, as to ſtrike at the Root of all Contentions; and what is that but the Luſts of Men? Let them be but once deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003623_0016_100201E842A575B0"/>
and there is nothing remains to diſturb within, or to ſtir up Wars without. Take away the Cauſe and the Effect ceaſeth. Take away the Luſts that are in the World, and Wars would come to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual End, and our Peace will be as a River, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and never failing. Then a People would be at Peace among themſelves, and their Ways being ſuch as pleaſe the Lord, their Enemies would alſo be at Peace with them.</p>
            <p>And this leads me to infer,</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The Excellency of the Goſpel, and the happy Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of its Doctrines and Precepts, to procure and eſtabliſh Peace among Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Deſign of the Goſpel is to ſubdue Men's Luſts, to cleanſe us from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit: <hi>The Grace of God,</hi> the Goſpel, <hi>that bringeth Salvation, and that hath appeared unto us, teacheth us to deny Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts;</hi> yea, and all ſpiritual and fleſhly Luſts. And if once the Goſpel had taken ſuch powerful and univerſal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to root out theſe Luſts, then would there be, as was ſung by the heavenly Hoſt, at the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and firſt ſetting up the Goſpel Kingdom, <hi>Peace on Earth, and good will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men,</hi> as well as <hi>Glory to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is only becauſe the Goſpel does not reign ſo powerfully and univerſally in the Hearts of Men, as it ought, that thoſe Prophecies of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Peace and Tranquility to be in Goſpel-Times, are not as yet accompliſhed. Let Men but live up to the Principles and Precepts of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Diſpenſation, and ſee if it would not then be as the Prophet foretold, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>They ſhall beat their Swords into Plow ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks, Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003623_0017_10023551BA6D8500"/>
5. <hi>We learn, that Heaven muſt needs be a Place of perfect Peace and Quietneſs forever, becauſe entirely freed from Sin and Luſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heaven is a high and holy Place, into which nothing enters that defiles; and every Inhabitant being made perfect in Holineſs, there can't be the leaſt Diſcord or Difference among them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thoſe litigious Luſts of Pride and Envy did once invade thoſe pure and peaceful Regions, when a number of Angels revolted, and a dreadful War commenced upon it; but thoſe apoſtate Spirits being over-born by a ſuperiour Power, were immediately baniſhed thoſe blisful Abodes, as Diſturbers of their Peace, and Interrupters of their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>And now none can enter there, but ſuch as are intirely cleanſed from all their Luſts, and made perfect in Holineſs. No Pride, no Envy, no Diſcontent can come within the Gates of this coeleſtial City, but every one that has an entrance miniſtred to him into this everlaſting Kingdom, being thus perfectly freed from theſe diſturbing Luſts, there muſt needs be an inviolable Peace and perpetual Harmony among them. <q>Inſtead of looking with a contemptuous or envious Eye upon one another, they will by a ſublimated Charity, delight in each others Happineſs, and all rejoice in God, the Centre of their Bliſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to ſome Inferrences that are more immediately to the Purpoſes and Deſigns of the preſent Day.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>What we have heard, may help us to judge, in a good meaſure, as to the Lawfulneſs or Unlawfulneſs of a War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this we may lay down as a general Rule, That a War raiſed and proſecuted meerly by Men's Luſts, muſt needs be unlawful on the ſide of the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003623_0018_1002352162DE1A08"/>
Aggreſſor: But then the ſame War becomes law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and very neceſſary on the ſide of the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</p>
            <p>When a Prince thro' Pride, Envy or Avarice, makes unreaſonable Demands upon his Nei'bour Princes, and upon their refuſing to comply, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in a hoſtile Manner to force them to it, it muſt needs be unlawful, contrary to the Law of God, of Nature, and the profeſſed Rules of all civilized Nations. For the ſuperiour Strength of one Nation gives them no more Right to invade the Properties and Priviledges of another, than one Man's being ſtronger than another, gives him a right to injure and abuſe him. And for one Nation to encroach upon the Rights and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Nei'bour Nation, by Force and Arms, is only a more open Violence, Robbery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But then as there is no way for ſuch a People to ſuppreſs, reſiſt, or get Satisfaction for the Violence and Injuries offered them, but by the like Force and warlike Proceedings; ſo this muſt needs be very juſt and lawful, yea, and the Duty of ſuch an injured People, provided that reaſonable Terms of Peace and Satisfaction have been propoſed, and a Compliance therewith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by their Adverſaries. For, for one Nation to ſubmit to be injured, invaded and run upon by another, without reſiſting and oppoſing them with their utmoſt Power, (when Terms of Peace have been unreaſonably rejected) would argue ſuch a Cowardice and Meaneſs of Spirit, that the Goſpel, as much as it preaches up Peace, would reprove ſuch a people for. For however it may direct private Chriſtians to ſuffer injuries rather than revenge themſelves, yet it does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid them from bringing ſuch Offenders before the civil Magiſtrate to be corrected for their Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003623_0019_100235534BFE5FA0"/>
who is declared to be the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. And much more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is it to ſtop the Violence, and take Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Injuries offered to a whole Nation. But as this can't be done by the civil Magiſtrate, becauſe their Power is confined within their own Government, therefore there is no other Way for a Nation, as ſuch, to defend or recover their juſt Rights, but by entering into a War againſt their Enemies, which muſt needs be lawful, and the Duty of an injured People, when all Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons prove in vain.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, a War is lawful, when it is entered into, not for the gratifying our own Luſts, but for the oppoſing the Luſts of others that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to us. A War is lawful, when it is for the neceſſary Defence or recovering of our juſt Rights. It is lawful alſo to enter into a War, when our Help is deſired, for the neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Relief of a People whom we ſee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and in Danger of being ſwallowed up by their Enemies, who have without Cauſe riſen up againſt them. And I don't ſee why a War may not be lawful, for the oppoſing and ſuppreſſing the growing Power and Tyranny of any Nation, whom we behold advancing themſelves, by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and unjuſt Encroachments upon their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to ſuch a degree of Power, as would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance all the Force that we could make againſt them. Now in theſe and ſuch like Caſes, (for I don't pretend to have mentioned every thing that will juſtify a warlike Proceeding) a People may make War, and go forth in a humble Dependance upon Almighty God to protect them, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their juſt Arms againſt their Enemies. For a War entered into upon ſuch Accounts as theſe,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003623_0020_100235568EEA9A80"/>
is the Cauſe of Juſtice and Mercy, and that is the Cauſe of God, and He will be on our Side, and if He be for us, we need not fear who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>
            <p>But here I muſt obſerve, That it is not ſo much the Buſineſs of the Soldier to enquire into the Merits of the Cauſe, and judge whether the War be lawful or unlawful, for that is an Affair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Prince and Councils of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Soldier is to preſume that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment have good Reaſons to juſtify their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming and engaging in a War: And his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be ſtrong and couragious, and to fight manfully under his Commander, in the ſeveral Poſts of Difficulty and Danger that may be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, without puzling his Mind with ſcrupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Enquiries, whether the War be lawfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into or not.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>What we have heard, teaches us after what Manner, and with what Views and Temper of Mind, Men ſhould go forth to War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt not be to gratify any Luſt of our own, but for the reſiſting and oppoſing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Luſts of others. It muſt not be to injure and oppreſs others, or to invade any of their juſt Rights, but from a generous Concern for the Defence and Safety of our own: Not meerly to hurt and deſtroy them, from any cruel and ſavage Diſpoſition whithin us, but for own Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, the Glory of God, the Intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Safety of his People, muſt lie neareſt the Soldier's Heart; and a Zeal for theſe Things muſt fill the Chriſtian Soldier with hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Courage and Fortitude of Mind, ready to ſacrifice his Life and Fortunes for the publick Safety, if called to it. Then, and only then, can
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003623_0021_1002353C74A3C0F8"/>
he on good Ground expect that God will be a Shield and Buckler to him. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>What we have heard, highly recommends Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Skill and Courage as abſolutely neceſſary, under God, for the Defence and Safety of a People.</hi>

            <p>For conſidering our own Luſts, and the Luſts of others, we muſt look for Wars and Fightings. Our own Luſts are ſuch as may provoke God to ſtir up our Enemies againſt us. We are alſo in danger by our Luſts of abuſing and injuring our Nei'bouring Tribes and Nations, and thereby of ſtirring up their Corruptions to come in a way of Revenge upon us: Or if we ſhould by our juſt and honeſt Dealings with them, eſcape the Guilt of bringing a War upon our ſelves; yet their Luſts without any Provocation of ours, may break out againſt us. So that conſidering the Luſts of Men, it is impoſſible for us to be aſſured of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Peace.</p>
            <p>And therefore it muſt needs be the Wiſdom of every People to be ſo aware of the various Luſts of Men, and the Manner of their Oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to put and always keep themſelves in proper Poſtures of Defence; not only by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Forts and Caſtles, and ſuch like Strong Holds in good Repair, but by having a ſuitable Number of ſkilful and valiant Soldiers, Men that underſtand the Art of War, and have Courage to appear in the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>Altho' Men's Luſts are the Cauſe of War, yet military Skill and Courage are from a nobler Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and are not only conſiſtent with, but are very much improved and heightened by true Grace. And my Text, altho' it diſparages War in general, conſidering its Original, yet by Conſequence it countenances a warlike Genius: For conſidering the Tendency of Men's Luſts, there muſt needs
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003623_0022_10023540596CD9A0"/>
be Wars and Fightings; and what is the natural Conſequence of this, but that the Art of War is highly uſeful and neceſſary, to defend us againſt the Violence of Men's Luſts?</p>
            <p>Here therefore let me addreſs my ſelf to the <hi>Honourable Company of the ARTILLERT,</hi> and ſay, That your Deſigns and Endeavours to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly skill'd in the Art of War, is very Laudable and Praiſe worthy. For conſidering the Luſts and Corruptions of Men prevail after ſuch a manner, it is become as neceſſary an Art as any: And it is the Wiſdom and Duty of a People to cultivate and improve it.</p>
            <p>It ſhows what a proper Tho't and Apprehenſion of theſe Things our Fore Fathers had, when they eſtabliſhed ſuch a Company as this, and encouraged it with certain Privileges and Immunities. It ſhow'd that they were well aware of the Luſts of Men, and apprehenſive in Conſequence hereof, what frequent Occaſions there would be for Men expert in War.</p>
            <p>And it is with Pleaſure that we now behold this Company increaſing, and more of a military Spirit diſcovering it ſelf, by the very conſiderable Additions which have been made of late to this Seminary or School for the martial Art. And what is further to be deſired is, that this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Company might ſtill advance in Reputation, and be of more extenſive Benefit, by the coming in of thoſe that ſuſtain the higher Commiſſions in the military Order, ſuch as the Field-Officers in the ſeveral Regiments, who by attending theſe ſtated Exerciſes a few Times in a Year, would be able to propagate this uſeful Art to their Subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and they to their ſeveral Companies; and ſo the whole Militia of the Land might be gloried of,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003623_0023_1002352C944FA178"/>
as thoſe of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in I <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 30, 33. That <hi>were Men of Valour, expert in War, that could keep Rank, and were not of a double Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God! We have not had Occaſion for ſuch diſciplined Soldiers as theſe of late, by reaſon of the happy Peace we have had for ſeveral Years, and do ſtill enjoy. But we may not expect a long and uninterrupted Series of it; for we may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear that either our own Luſts, or the Luſts of others, will break forth and diſturb our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tranquility. It is neceſſary therefore that we ſhould be always ready, even for a ſudden Attack: Improve your opportunities therefore in gaining all the Skill, Courage and Conduct that is needfull; for you know not how ſoon there may be Occaſion for you to go forth and employ the ſame, in the Service of God and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>We know not what Deſigns are forming againſt us. That we are hated by ſome, and envied by others for our growing greatneſs, is not to be doubted. And how ſoon their Luſts may riſe to ſuch a Head, as to break out againſt us in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen War, and how ſoon God ſhall ſee cauſe to correct us with ſuch a Judgment, is known only to Him. And as for the reviving military Skill, if it ſhould forebode the Approach of War; yet it affords a happy Omen that we ſhall not be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en as a prey to our Enemies: but rather by theſe Means God will defend us from our Enemies, and make uſe of our Skill to defeat their Deſigns, and cauſe them to turn back aſhamed.</p>
            <p>But alaſs! to what Purpoſe is it to have Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Soldiers expert it War, and valiant in Battle, and at the ſame Time to have our Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Batteries, our Forts and Garriſons, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ſuffered to fall to the Ground? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003623_0024_10023542ADFB7430"/>
upon theſe Accounts we are in a very defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Poſture, and too much reſemble <hi>a City with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gates and Bars,</hi> yea, a <hi>City broken down, and without Walls.</hi> The decaying State of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, looks as if we were not aware of the Luſts of Men, and thought all Danger of their breaking out againſt us was over, and as if the glorious Times were come, when the Nations would learn War no more. But how groundleſs are ſuch Expectations? The Luſts of Men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail as much as ever, and our growing greatneſs naturally excites their Jealouſies and their Envy, and our growing wickedneſs as certainly ſtirs up the fierce Wrath of the Almighty, that gives us reaſon to fear He will withdraw His Reſtraints from them. And what a miſerable Defence ſhould we be able to make againſt a Foreign Invaſion, under our preſent Circumſtances! I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tax the Government in any Branch of it; but would only obſerve how unhappy it is, that they can't unite in Meaſures for their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Defence. For how can we expect the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Protection, when we can't agree upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods proper for our own Safety? It is only when a People's ways pleaſe the Lord, and they are united among themſelves, and take all prudent Methods for their own Security, that they may expect God to be their <hi>Fortreſs and their Munition of Rocks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Conclude,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilſt we, thro' the Favour of God, enjoy an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace, let us not be inſenſible of that dreadful War that is within, ſtirred up by our Luſts, that are warring in our Members.</hi> And now let us manage this War with our Luſts, and all our Spiritual Enemies, with the Skill, Reſolution and Courage, that becomes wiſe and good Soldiers under Jeſus
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003623_0025_100235392AA9C0C0"/>
Chriſt, the great <hi>Commander of his People, and Captain of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no Diſpute about the Lawfulneſs of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this War: For it is abſolutely neceſſary, and our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable Duty. There can never be a Peace made with theſe Enemies but a very inglorious one: Nay, by the leaſt Conceſſions, or ſo much as Capitulations with them, we forfeit our Honour.</p>
            <p>Whatever Poſſeſſion they have gotten of us, it is by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and Uſurpation, and none of theſe wicked Luſts have a right to live in us: We muſt therefore fight 'till we are the Death of every one of them. It is not enough to weaken and deſtroy the Power of ſome, for they are ſo interwoven and united together; and ſuch is their myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Nature, that if one Luſt be left alive and let alone, it will quickly give Life again to all the reſt, and they will riſe up againſt us an exceeding great Army. The Temper therefore of theſe Enemies is ſuch as wont allow us to give Quarter, or ſhew any Mercy; for Mercy to them is Cruelty and Death to our ſelves. There muſt be no Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, no Truces or Ceſſation of Arms, for the leaſt Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence granted to them, will only give them an Advantage againſt us. We muſt therefore be always upon our Watch and Guard; nay, we muſt be actually reſiſting and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them with all our Might, and then we ſhall find that we don't fight as thoſe that beat the Air. For we ſhall after many a violent Struggle and ſharp Conflict, at length gain the Victory, and come off Conquerers, yea, more than Conquerers thro' Chriſt that has loved us, and given himſelf for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus overcome <hi>thro' the Blood of the Lamb,</hi> we ſhall with Him and holy Angels that have been attending on Him, make our triumphant Progreſs to the Coeleſtial City, and being welcomed with loud Hoſannas, ſhall be crown'd as Victors with immortal Honours. And having thus end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Toils and Fatigues of War, we ſhall in everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace ſit down with Chriſt on his Throne, <hi>even as he has overcome, and is ſet down with his Father on his Throne.</hi>
