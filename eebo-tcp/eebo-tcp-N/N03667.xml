            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Great Article of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, The Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion From the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Coronthians</hi> were ſome People, that had ſo Indulged themſelves in their Abominable
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004487_0003_100D56C1B8DE8C48"/>Senſualities, that they had exceedingly Extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Profitable Apprehenſions, about <hi>unſeen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Things.</hi> They had wonderfully Stupified their Conſciences, by Gratifying their Senſual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; and were become in a manner meer <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Creatures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY had ſunk almoſt below the Exerciſe of Reaſon: So that they laid aſide all ſuitable Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about <hi>Natural Religion:</hi> Therefore, No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if they Suppreſſed all Thoughts about <hi>Revealed Religion.</hi> They would ſay, <hi>Let us Eat and Drink, for tomorrow we ſhall Die.</hi> As if they had ſaid, <hi>This Life is the only time, for us, to take our Pleaſure in. After this Life, there will be nothing for us, to Enjoy. And we know not how ſoon this Life will end, therefore let us take as much Pleaſure, as we can, while we Live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THENCE, It is no wonder, if there were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Diſorders among them: And abundance of Pernicious Practices with Erroneous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens.</p>
            <p>AMONG other things, the Doctrine of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the Dead</hi> was not only Doubted or Scrupled, but was Denied and Renounced by ſome of them: Some ſaid, <hi>There is no Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEREFORE the Apoſtle ſpends the greateſt part of a long Chapter, to prove the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead:</hi> And one of his chief Arguments to prove it, is, <hi>The Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And of this he could Produce the cleareſt
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004487_0003_100D56C1B8DE8C48"/>and fulleſt &amp; moſt inconteſtible Evidences. For He was ſeen not only by one or two, but by all the eleven Apoſtles, and by five hundred People at once, &amp; a great part of them were Living then, to Declare what they had ſeen. Yea, He himſelf could ſay, that he had ſeen the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And therefore it was Undeniable that <hi>He was Riſen from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT inaſmuch as the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was Riſen from the Dead, and had ſent His Miniſters to Preach, that He was Riſen from the Dead, and that People ſhould Believe in Him for Eternal Salvation, and for Deliverance from the power of the Grave, it was therefore unreaſonable, to Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether there would be a <hi>Reſurrection from the Dead:</hi> unleſs all their Preaching were Vain.</p>
            <p>BUT having Proved, that there would be a Reſurrection from the Dead, and a Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein there would be a Reward given to all according to their Works, He Improves, in our Text, what he had Proved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THEREFORE,</hi> That is, for as much as, there will be as Reſurrection of the Dead; and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, a time of Retribution for all the Godly; They ſhall be Graciouſly and Gloriouſly Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BE Stedfaſt;</hi> That is, be fully ſettled in the Belief of the Truth of the Goſpel, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in the Doctrine of the Reſurrection, which is a Principal Article of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004487_0004_100D56C3D10BD0B8"/>
               <hi>BE immoveable,</hi> That is, be firmly fixed againſt all Oppoſition, from any of the Cavils and Aſſaults, that may be endeavoured by Wicked Sinners, to ſhake your Faith, in this great Doctrine of Religion.</p>
            <p>THEN it Follows,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BE always Abounding in the Work of the Lord,</hi> That is, conſtantly ſtrive to do &amp; to grow better &amp; better. And be more and more Diligent about the Work Preſcribed and Accepted by the Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>FOR as much as ye know that your labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> That is, the Lord will Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Graciouſly and Gloriouſly Reward all your Sincere endeavours, about His Work, at the Great and the Laſt Day. For ſo far will the Saints of God be, from finding that they have Laboured in Vain, while they have been about the Work of God, that they that have Laboured Abundantly ſhall be Rewarded Abundantly. The Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of their Endeavours will be Wonderful as well as Eternal. The Lord will take Effectual Care that they ſhall not loſe their Labour.</p>
            <p>WE need only further conſider, that the things in this Epiſtle are Directed unto all Chriſtians; For ſo is the Epiſtle Directed in Chap. 1. Ver. 2. —<hi>To all that in every Place, call upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND then the Doctrine to be Conſidered by us all, muſt be this,</p>

                  <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> IT is the Duty of all Chriſtians always to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</head>
               <p>NO doubt, but all of us would be Accounted Chriſtians. God knows what all of us are.</p>
               <p>THIS Doctrine tells what is our Duty, if we be Real Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>THE Doctrine muſt be Explained, that our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be underſtood. Our Duty muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that it may be Practiſed, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Practice without ſuitable Knowledge.

               </p>
               <p>NO Chriſtian may Live without ſome Work. It is a great Wickedneſs for any perſon to Live in Idleneſs. For <hi>Idleneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are altogether Inconſiſtent. It you ſay, <hi>An Idle Chriſtian,</hi> you ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Contradiction. Idle Perſons are no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Whatever they think, about themſelves, and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004487_0005_100D56C75BA8E308"/>whatever others may think about them, God will not own them for Chriſtians, if they don't Repent of their Idleneſs, and beg Pardon of God. for that, as well as for all their other Wickedneſs, for the Sake of Chriſt, who always Pleaſed God, went about doing Good and was never idle.</p>
               <p>IF Perſons are Born to great Eſtates and ſpend their Time, in Idleneſs and waſt away their Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, they will have a dreadful Account to give: They will not be found among Chriſtians at the Laſt Day, unleſs they Repent.</p>
               <p>IF Perſons Live upon the Labours of others, and ſpend their Time in Idleneſs, without any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, for the Benefit of others, they cannot be numbred among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>YEA, If Perſons Labour, to get great Eſtates, with this deſign, chiefly, that they and theirs may live in Idleneſs: They cannot be Acknowledged for Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>BE ſure then, they that uſe Ungodly Methods, to get Riches, that they might Live in Idleneſs muſt for ever be Excluded from the Number of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>THEIR Conſciences, if Enlightned, muſt fly in their Faces, while they Pretend to Chriſtianity, but Deſire to Live in Idleneſs.</p>
               <p>FOR all Chriſtians have ſome Work Incumbent on them. And this work may be juſtly called, <hi>The Work of the Lord,</hi> Becauſe it is Required by the Lord, and it will be Rewarded by the Lord. But ſhould it be Inquited,</p>

               <p>ALL Duties of Piety, and Religion toward God, All Duties of Charity and Righteouſneſs toward Man, all Duties of our General Calling, or ſuch as are Common to all Chriſtians, belonging to them as Chriſtians, all Duties of our Perſonal Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or ſuch as are Special to Chriſtians, in their ſeveral Orders and Stations in the World; theſe belong to the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>THEY are Sum'd up, in the Old Teſtament, in Micah 6.8. <hi>The Lord hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good, what doth the Lord Require of thee, but to do Juſtly, to love Mercy and to walk Humbly with thy God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY are Sum'd up, in the New Teſtament, in 2 Tim. 1.13. <hi>Hold faſt the Form of ſound words in Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BRIEFLY, The Great work of all Chriſtians, it is, To maintain ſuch a Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, as to receive conſtant Supplies of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004487_0006_100D56C8F4B01D08"/>Grace from Him, continualy to bear a Teſtimony for the Truths &amp; Ways of God, before the World, for the Glory of God, in this World, and to make Preparation for Glory with God in the Heavenly World, for ever.</p>
               <p>THIS is the Work of the Lord; a Work Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Lord, a Work Well pleaſing to the Lord.</p>
               <p>BUT more Particularly,</p>
               <p n="1">[I.] <hi>BELIEVING on Chriſt,</hi> With a firm Faith, for Eternal Salvation, Living by Faith on the Son of God, is the Work of the Lord. So are we told, in John 6.29. <hi>This is the Work of God, that you Believe on Him whom He hath ſent.</hi> That is, on Jeſus Chriſt, the only Saviour of Sinners. (1 John 3.23.)</p>
               <p>THEREFORE muſt we be ſo ſenſible of our Sinfulneſs and Miſery, as to be made willing, to Repair to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the Salvation of our Souls Commiting and Reſigning our ſelves to Him, as the Author of Eternal Salvation to all, that Obey Him; And Applying our ſelves to Him, as our Prophet, for Inſtruction, as our Prieſt, for Attonement, as our King, for Government; Rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on His Righteouſneſs, for Juſtification, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with His Spirit for Sanctification; Truſting in Him, to work, in us, all that is Well pleaſing in His Sight; Waiting on Him, to fit us for, &amp; bring
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004487_0006_100D56C8F4B01D08"/>us to Eternal Glory, by His Rich and Free Grace, and His Sovereign Almighty Power.</p>
               <p>SO to Believe in the Eternal Redeemer, is the Work of God. And if we do nothing about this Work, our Souls muſt be, for ever Undone. We muſt lie down in Eternal Sorrow, if we Neglect this Work of Faith. We ſhall do nothing well, about any other Work, until we begin to Believe in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>BUT if we attend this Work of God, to Believe on the Name of His Son Jeſus Chriſt, with all our Hearts, then ſhall we be Prepared, for other things, belonging to the Work of God.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE muſt we be perſwaded, to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that Invitation of our Lord, in Mat. 11.28. Where He ſays, <hi>Come to me all ye, that Labour and are Heavy Laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> Reſt not without coming to Chriſt, but come to Chriſt, and He will give Reſt. Reſt from Sin, Reſt, from Grief, and Reſt from Fear: But not Reſt from Work. There will be more Work ſtill. For ſays our Lord, <hi>Take</hi>] <hi>my Yoke upon you, Learn of me.</hi> So, True Believers on Chriſt have Work, to do, after they have Believed. They are, to draw in the Yoke of Chriſt, and therein, to attend the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>INDEED, at Death will the Saints of God Reſt from their Labours, according to what we Read in, Rev. 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the Dead, who Die in the Lord, they Reſt from their Labours, and their Works follow
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004487_0007_100D56CAA859C5E0"/>them.</hi> Yet they do not Reſt from the Work of Praiſing the Lord. For we Read in Rev. 4.8. With Reference to the Saints, in the Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, as well as, in the Church Militant, <hi>They Reſt, not Night nor Day, from ſaying, Holy, Holy. Holy Lord God Almighty, which was and is, and is to come.</hi> The Saints of God, in Heaven will be Praiſing the Lord, their Creator &amp; Redeemer &amp; Sanctifier, for ever. But, be ſure, in this World, they muſt not ceaſe from Work, as long as they Live in this World. Tho' they have Believed, their Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Chriſt will not Releaſe them from other Parts of the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>AND, to mention ſome other parts of that Work, we may now go on, to Affirm,</p>
               <p n="2">[II.] <hi>REPENTING of Sin,</hi> With Unfeigned Repentance and Maintaining the Life of ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance belongs to the Work of the Lord. So are we told in Act. 17.30. <hi>God Commandeth all men every where, to Repent.</hi> Repentance of Sin is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to God, and may be reckoned part of the Work of the Lord, the Work, which the Lord hath Obliged His People to attend, while they Live in this World. They muſt be ſo Convinced of their Sinfulneſs by Nature and Practice, their Sinfulneſs of Soul and Life, their Sins of Omiſſion and Commiſſion, their Sins againſt the Law, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004487_0007_100D56CAA859C5E0"/>againſt the Goſpel, as to be Humbled before the Lord for all their Deviations from, and Violations of the Rules, that He hath ſet before them, and Confeſs and Bewail them all, with Grief &amp; Shame, and Beg Pardon for them all, for the ſake of Chriſt, with Sincere Deſires, and Serious Purpoſes, and Earneſt Endeavours, to Turn from all Sin, to God in Jeſus Chriſt, and to Live more and more Exactly according to the Rules of the Goſpel, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Day.</p>
               <p>SUCH a Repentance belongs to the work of the Lord. Therefore muſt we be Perſwaded to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with that Propoſal in Prov. 28.13. <hi>He that Confeſſeth and Forſaketh His ſin, ſhall have mercy.</hi> There will be the mercy of Pardon of Sin, the mercy of Power over &amp; againſt Sin, the mercy of Peace and Reconciliation with God, the mercy of Quietneſs and Eaſineſs of Conſcience, to them that Heartily Confeſs and Forſake their Sins, with Sorrow for Sin, with Hatred to Sin, with Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the Grace of God, in Chriſt Jeſus, to live more according to the Doctrines of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>AND this work of Repentance muſt be continued all our Days, we muſt Never leave off the work of Repentance, while we live in this world. They that Pretend they have Repented enough, Declare, they have not Repented at all. They ſhew a certain Token that they know not what belongs to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They have not ſo much as begun to Repent, if they think they may leave off to Repent, If they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004487_0008_100D56CD06BC0790"/>think, they are ſo Perfect and Righteous, that they need no Repentance, it is very ſure, that they have lived impenitently ever ſince they lived. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they mock &amp; ſcoff at <hi>maintaining of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Warfare, During Life.</hi> It is very ſure they muſt loſe their Souls forever unleſs they change their minds about their State, &amp; ſee their Need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, &amp; begin the Work of Unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They muſt Repent &amp; Turn from all their Tranſgreſſions, &amp; from their Falſe &amp; Vain Opinions, or their Iniquities will be their Ruin.</p>
               <p>YEA, Chriſtians muſt not only Repent every Day, for their Daily Sins, but they muſt alſo ſtrive, to be more Sorry, for their former Sins. For many times God may Chaſtize and Afflict His Children, after their Believing in Chriſt, for their former Sins, that they committed before their Converſion, as well as, for their falls into Sin, after their Converſion becauſe they have not been ſo ſorry, as they ſhould have been for their former Sins. He may let them fall ſo, as, to open their former Wounds, to make them Bleed afreſh, that they may Repent, with a more bitter Sorrow, for their former Sins.</p>
               <p>BUT they that have ſpent or loſt, the moſt of their Time in their Unregenracy, &amp; have not begun the work of Repentance, until their Old Age, muſt be very Diligent, about this Work of the Lord; To call their Sins to Remembrance; To Confeſs &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail them; To Lament their Condition, before the Lord, ſo as to be Quickned, yet more Fervently to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004487_0008_100D56CD06BC0790"/>Beg for the ſenſe of the Pardon of them. They ſhould be more concerned, about ſuch things, than moſt People are Accuſtomed to be, or things will Appear to be very ſad with their Souls.</p>
               <p>AND, be ſure, the work of Repentance muſt be Continued by Repenting Sinners, until they are Perfectly Delivered from Sin, upon the Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Spirits from their Bodies, by Death. Repentance muſt Live, until we Die. And we muſt Attend the Work of Repentance, all the time, that we Live, in this World of Sin. We muſt Live Repenting; yea, we muſt Die Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; And looking to the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for Life Eternal.</p>
               <p>AND if this Work of the Lord he well Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then we ſhall Attend another Exerciſe, in that Work.</p>
               <p n="3">[III.] FOLLOWING and Perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God, all the Day long, and all their Life long, belongs to the Work of the Lord, that is Incumbent on all Chriſtians. For ſo are we Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, in 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Let us cleanſe or ſelves from all Filthineſs of Fleſh and of Spirit, Perfecting Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE ſhould be daily conſidering what our Sinful Defilements are, and upon the ſight of any Sinful Pollution, Appearing on our Souls, Immediately Repair unto the Fountain opened for Sin and for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004487_0009_100D56CFC1528428"/>Uncleaneſs. We muſt Apply our ſelves unto the Purifying Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that our Souls may be more and more Purified from all our Sinful Impurities. And we ſhould not be willing to Sleep, as long as we Apprehend our Souls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſpot or ſtain of Sin, for the Removal of which, we have not Expreſly Addreſſed our ſelves unto the Pardoning, Purging Blood of Je-Chriſt.</p>
               <p>WE are to Pray for Purity, in Heart, in Lip, and in Life, and Labour for Holineſs, in all manner of Converſation; Striving to be Holy, as He that hath called us, is Holy, And Improve all Merciful things with which God is Favouring us, and all Sorrowful things, with which God is Chaſtening us that we may thereby be made more Partakers of an Holineſs Reſembling the Holineſs of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Holy God.</p>
               <p>AND whereas we may all find Abundance want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to Perfection of Holineſs, we may find Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to be done by us all in following of Holineſs, we muſt take abundance of Pains, to be more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And therefore muſt we ſtrive, to have our Faith every Day Exerciſed on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for the Deriving of Grace from Him, our Faith muſt go forth unto Him, to fetch in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Supplies of New Grace, from that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Grace; to be Advancing in Holineſs: That our Hearts being Purified by Faith, our ways may be daily growing more and more Pure, ſo
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004487_0009_100D56CFC1528428"/>that we may be continually making our ſelves more and more meet, to be partakers of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light, and fitting for the Bleſſed-making Viſion of the Lord.</p>
               <p>WE know, from Heb. 12.14. <hi>Without Holineſs, none ſhall ſee the Lord;</hi> And from Mat. 5.8. <hi>The Pure in Heart ſhall be Bleſſed with ſeeing of God.</hi> Therefore Endeavours, to Attain Perfection of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, belong to the Work of the Lord, Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>BUT neither be theſe all the things, Belonging to that Work; For,</p>
               <p n="4">[IV.] PREPARING for, and Improving of, all the Holy Ordinances of God, for their Growth in Grace, and their Advancement in Holineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Work of the Lord, Incumbent on all Chriſtians. For we Read about certain Perſons, that were attending the Work of the Lord, in Luk. 1.6. <hi>They were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord, blameleſs.</hi> When it is ſaid, <hi>They were both Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments of the Lord.</hi> It implies, that if, they had not Regarded all the Commandments &amp; Ordinances of the Lord, they could not have been Accounted <hi>Righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> nor Blameleſs: Therefore if Chriſtians will Attend all the Work of the Lord Incumbent on them, they muſt have a Regard unto all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004487_0010_100D56D2284952F0"/>of God, all the Inſtitutions of Chriſt, in His Eccleſiaſtical Kingdorn in this World.</p>
               <p>AND among the Ordinances, to be Regarded by Chriſtians, that would Attend all the Work of the Lord, there is, not only Praying to God, in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, in Private and in Publick; on Ordinary and Extraordinary occaſions: All Chriſtians muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend theſe Kinds of Prayer, in their Seaſons, if they will attend all the Work of the Lord, or indeed any Part of that Work, well; Not only Reading and Hearing the World of God; Chriſtians, Be ſure, muſt attend this, or they will Neglect ſome part of the Work of the Lord and are in the way, to Neglect all the Reſt, that they ſhould attend; If they will not Heart what the Lord ſays unto them, in the Publick Diſpenſation of his Word, by the Miniſtry of His Ambaſſadors, it is no wonder that other things be Neglected: But there be alſo the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace, Baptiſm and the Supper of the Lord, that are to be Attended and Improved.</p>
               <p>ALL Chriſtians, that are Able, Truly to ſay, that they Deſire and Labour, to Believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for Eternal Salvation, ſhould ſeek for Baptiſm, for Themſelves, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if they have not been Baptized. But if any Profeſſing of Chriſtianity, are not willing to Repent of their Sins, Confeſſing them, and Profeſſing a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to Forſake them, and look to Chriſt, for the Pardon of them, that they may be Baptized, it
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004487_0010_100D56D2284952F0"/>is very ſure, that they Neglect ſome part of the Work of the Lord, that they ſhould Attend. For the Lord has commanded His Miniſters, in Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go, Teach all Nations, Baptizing them, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, Teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have Commanded you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN they that would be Acknowledged for the Diſciples of Chriſt, are to fit, and ſeek for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; Nor may they expect to Enjoy it, until they do, by ſome way or other diſcover a willingneſs, to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, if they are Up grown. For that Ordinance of God is called the Baptiſm of Repentance; and therefore no Apparently Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinner may be Baptized. <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt would Baptize none, that Appeared unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to manifeſt Repentance. Perſons, that have not been Baptized, ſhould Repent of their Sins, and manifeſt, by all proper ways, that they have truly Repented, that they may be Baptized. And being Baptized, they ſhould Labour, to Improve their Baptiſm, to Promote their Holineſs, if they would attend all the Work of the Lord. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Repenting Sinner, it may be Adviſed as, in Act. 22.16. <hi>Ariſe, and be Baptized, and waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy Sins, calling on the Name of the Lord.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, there would ſome of the Work of the Lord be Neglected.</p>
               <p>AND then, thoſe up grown Chriſtians, that are capable of Examining themſelves, concerning their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004487_0011_100D56D46D795798"/>Knowledge, to Diſcern the Lords Body; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Faith, to Feed upon Him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Love to God and Chriſt, and the Saints, becauſe of their Holineſs; and to all their Neighbours to Deſire their Benefit; and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Unfeigned Repentance; and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires &amp; Labours about their New Obedience; They ſhould Repair to the Table of the Lord; And they ſhould Improve the Supper of the Lord, to Excite and Aſſiſt their Holy, Humble, Thankful, Delightful, Believing and Penitent Remembrance of their Lord, and of His Love to their Souls, that they may Grow in their Grace, Joy, Comfort and Preparation for the Injoyment of their Lord, in His Heavenly Glories. This they muſt do, if they would attend all the Work of the Lord. For ſo is it expreſly Commanded, in 1 Cor. 11.28. <hi>Let a man Examine himſelf, &amp; Eat of that Bread, &amp; Drink of that Cup.</hi> And about Eating and Drinking the Sacramental Bread and Wine, our Lord ſays to His Diſciples, <hi>This do, in Remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT Chriſtians may not content themſelves in the Injoyment of theſe Ordinances of God, but they muſt be careful, to Improve them, for the ends, for which God hath Appointed them; to Promote their Faith, Repentance, Holineſs and Meetneſs for Heaven. For it is not the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Improvement of Privileges, that will do Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:004487_0011_100D56D46D795798"/>
NOR may Perſons pretend, that they would Improve the Ordinances of God, if they might Injoy them, while they are not Prepared for them. If they are unfit for the Holy Ordinances of God, they cannot ſafely Attend them. It would be a Dangerous thing for Perſons to Attend the Sealing Ordinances of God, while they Know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be in the gall of Bitterneſs and in the bond of Wickedneſs; or under the Power of any Reigning Sin.</p>
               <p>FOR if Perſons are Baptized, while they know themſelves to be Reſolved Sinners, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if their Baptiſm Seal them up under their Impiety, forever: No wonder, if, like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> they are given over to Ungodlineſs, and are more Ungodly after their Baptiſm than ever they were before.</p>
               <p>AND then, be ſure, if Perſons Venture unto the Table of the Lord, while they Know themſelves to be Reſolved Sinners, It is no wonder, if they are, by that Ordinance, Confirmed in their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. No wonder, if Satan do Enter into them, as into <hi>Judas,</hi> after he had Received the Sop, that might be offered to him, after the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Paſſover. Wonder not, if ſuch Woful Sinners become ſuch Hardened Sinners, that they cannot Repent, They will not Repent; They will never be Renewed again to Repentance.</p>
               <p>THE Miniſters of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt may not Adminiſter theſe Holy Ordinances to any
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004487_0012_100D56D693D3C288"/>that appear to be Wicked Sinners and continue Impenitent in their Wickedneſs; This would be a Prophanation of thoſe Holy Ordinances. But they muſt not be Prophanely Proſtituted unto the Ungodly Luſts of wicked Sinners. This would be highly Diſpleaſing to the Holy Lord.</p>
               <p>THESE things are not mentioned for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of any Serious Pious Perſons, that may be Weak in Grace and may be under Doubts and Fears: For ſuch will deſire to attend the Work of the Lord with ſuitable Preparation: They will endeavour that their Hopes may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Fears. And are willing to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Hope, that they are Prepared for theſe Holy Ordinances.</p>
               <p>AND if Perſons Hope, they are Prepared for the Sealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace, they ſhould beware leſt they become chargeable with that Crime charged on ſome, in Mal. 3.7. <hi>Ye are gone away from mine Ordinances, ſaith the Lord.</hi> For if they are Guilty of ſuch a Crime, they muſt Repent of it, with bitter Humiliation, before the Lord, and before the World, if they would attend all the work of the Lord. For Preparing our ſelves to Improve all the Ordinances of the Houſe of the Lord, belongs to the Work of the Lord which Chriſtians muſt not willingly Neglect, if they would keep clear from Rebellion againſt the Lord, who hath Commanded that Work for all Chriſtians.</p>

               <p n="5">[V.] PROMOTING and Furthering the beſt Good of all about them, and eſpecially of thoſe that are any way Related to them, and peculiarly of thoſe, that are under their Care and Charge, belongs to the Work of the Lord, that is Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent on all Chriſtians.

Theſe are of the Houſhold of Faith; and to theſe (and to others) we muſt do Good, not only, by our Prayers and by our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and by our Giving to them, if they Need, and by our Forgiving of them, if they Offend, but alſo By ſetting before them, the Example of a Good Converſation, that they may ſee our Good Works, and Glorify our Heavenly Father.

                  <hi>AND</hi> Godly Children muſt Honour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Obey them and ſtrive to Pleaſe them
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004487_0013_100D56D84D5E1A98"/>and Comfort and Rejoice them, and make their Souls Glad, by letting them ſee, that they Love to Walk in the Truth, if they Attend the Work of the Lord as it ſhould be attended.</p>
               <p>AND all Superious have Duties Incumbent on them, toward their Inferiours, that muſt be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by them that will do the Work of the Lord. And,</p>
               <p n="6">[VI.] DILIGENCE and Faithfulneſs in their Particular Calling, belong to the Work of the Lord that is Incumbent on all Chriſtians. For ſo are they Adviſed, in 1 Theſ. 4.11. <hi>Study to be Quiet and to do your own Buſineſs, Working with your Hands, that you may Walk Honeſtly toward them, that are without, and that ye may have need of nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is plain, that they do not Walk Honeſtly, that have no Buſineſs of their own to mind. Then they do not mind the Work of the Lord. Therefore Chriſtians muſt have ſome Buſineſs of their own to mind. Their Bones, or their Brains, or both muſt be Imployed in ſome Good Buſineſs, whereby their Neighbours may be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged, in their Souls, or Bodies, or Eſtates, or ſome of their Deſireable Intereſts; otherwiſe, they will not mind the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtle Adviſeth in Tit. 3.8. <hi>I will that thou constantly Affirm, that they who Profeſs to have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004487_0014_100D56DAC19C1818"/>Believed in God, be careful to maintain Good Works.</hi> Part of the meaning is this; Profeſſors of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity muſt have ſome Honeſt Imployment, that may be Good, Uſeful and Profitable, not only to themſelves, but alſo to others: For elſe they do not attend all the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>YEA, Chriſtians muſt be Diligent in their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, they muſt not think to Live without ſome Work, of ſome ſort, or other. They are ſorty Chriſtians if they Deſerve the Name of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who would attend no Buſineſs if they had wherewithal to Live in the World, without any Buſineſs. They that have no Work of their own, to mind, he ſure, they do not mind the Work of the Lord. Perſons may be Diligent about their Buſineſs, without being real Chriſtians, but they cannot be Real Chriſtians, that have no care about their Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>HAVE not ſome of us known thoſe, that would Pretend, that if they had leſs Buſineſs about their Callings, they would Spend more Time in the Exerciſes of Religion? But what Exerciſes of Religion have ſome ſuch People At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, when they have had leſs, to do, or have done leſs, than they uſed to do, about their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings! Their Drinking, or Gaming, or Smoaking away of their Precious Time, hath not been to ſpend their Time in the Work of the Lord. Spending their Time in Vain Talk, in Backbiting &amp; Reviling, it Cenſuring &amp; Slandering
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004487_0014_100D56DAC19C1818"/>of their Neighbours hath not been to Spend it in the Work of the Lord. Nor hath it been the Work of the Lord, which thoſe People have Attended, who have ſpent Abundance of Time, in Labouring, to Entice and Seduce their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours from the Means of Grace, or to Prejndice their Minds againſt the Ordinances of God, or the Ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and ſo to Harden their Hearts in the Ways of Ungodlineſs. Theſe have not been the Works of the Lord. But ſome Sinners have Attended ſuch Works. But when will they Repent and give Glory to God, by giving any Evidence of their Unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for their Wicked Works! Oh! That they would conſider, whoſe Works theſe be, and what will be the Wages for ſuch Works! And would be Excited unto Works Meet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>BUT ſtill, they that would Attend the Work of the Lord, muſt be Diligent about the Works of their Particular Callings, &amp; Faithful in them, as well as Diligent.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANS muſt be Faithful in their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Callings, by doing all in Obedience to God, with Dependance on Chriſt, for Aſſiſtance and Acceptance, in all that they do; with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign for the Glory of God, Relying on Him for Grace, to do all in ſuch Order and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, after ſuch manner, as may beſt Promore the great End of their Being.</p>

NOR have we yet mentioned all: But to Sum up all in one Article more, we may now ſay,</p>
               <p n="7">[VII.] CONTINUANCE and Perſeverance about the Work of their Souls, To work out their Salvation, to make ſure of their Salvation, belong to the Work of the Lord, Incumbent on all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

               <p>INDEED Theſe are not the Common Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Generality of Chriſtians: But all Chriſtians, are obliged to be concerned for ſuch Deſireable Attainments.</p>
               <p>FOR tho' the Work of the Holy Spirit of God, in Sealing the Souls of Believers on Chriſt, and giving to them a certain Aſſurance, that they are the Children of God, be an Arbitrary Operation of that Almighty and Eternal Spirit; He hath not bound Himſelf to attend our Endeavours; yet ſeeing we may not Expect the Impreſſions of the Holy Spirit by His Power on our Souls, without our ſerious Endeavours, Therefore ſhould we be Diligent, in the uſe of all Means, that we may uſe, to come to know, that we are the Children of God; that we are born again, that we have paſſed from Death unto Life: And that we have Believed in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; And that we are in the Favour of God, and have our Sins Pardoned, and are daily Advancing in our meetneſs to partake of the Heavenly Inheritance, and that we ſhall ſafely Arrive, at laſt, in the Kingdom of Glory, to be ever with the Lord.</p>

Queſt. <hi>BY what Motives, are we to be Excited, to Abound in the Work of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We might Anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> COMPREHENDING the Motive in our Text.</p>
               <p n="1">I. THE Glorious GOD, who is FATHER, SON and HOLY SPIRIT, hath done Abundance, and is doing Abundance, and will do Abundance, for all Chriſtians; and therefore ſhould They all do Abundance in the Work of the Lord. And here, we might Conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHAT hath the Glorious GOD done for all Chriſtians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. GOD the FATHER hath Freely Loved them, from Everlaſting &amp; Choſen them, from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, to be Objects of His Everlaſting Love; and hath given them to His Eternally Beloved Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the Eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption; to Save them with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation, to bring them to Eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>FOR unto every Sincere Chriſtian may the Almighty God ſay, as in Jer. 31.3. <hi>I have Loved thee with an Everlaſting Love, therefore with loving Kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND about all Real Chriſtians might our Lord Jeſus Chriſt own, before His Eternal Father, as in Joh. 17.6. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto them that
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004487_0017_100D56E286F69F90"/>thou gaveſt me out of the World: Thine they were and thou gavest them unto me, end they have kept thy Words.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD the Father hath had Eternal Purpoſes of Grace about His Choſen, whom He hath Given to His Son Jeſus Chriſt, in the Eternal Covenant, wherein He hath Engaged, to bring them unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>EVEN, before the Foundation of the World, in the Days of Eternity, the Eternal God intended Good things for His Choſen. He Promiſed theſe Good things unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.) And He Created the World, and Brought them into the World, and Ordered the Means of Grace, for their Benefit, that they might be brought unto Salvation by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For He hath ſo Loved the World, that He hath ſent His only Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Son into the World, that whoſoever Believeth in Him ſhould not Periſh, but have Everlaſting Life. And</p>
               <p n="2">2. GOD the SAVIOUR hath Loved the Choſen of God, ſo as to Accept of the Offer of them, by God the Father, in the Covenant of Redemption, He hath undertaken for their Salvation. He Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, To come into the World, To become a Man, To be made under the Law, To Die and Suffer for the Sins of His People, To Satisfy the Juſtice of God and to Deliver the Choſen of God from that Eternal Wrath, which they deſerved by Sin. He
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004487_0017_100D56E286F69F90"/>Promiſed, To bring them our of their Miſery and to bring them to Glory for Ever. And according to His Promiſe, He did, in the Fulneſs of time, at the Time appointed, come into the World to Save them, and to Die for them, that He might Save them. Anſwering all the Demands of the Law, He Obeyed all the Commands of the Law for them, and He hath Engaged that, He will not leave them, until He hath brought them unto His Glory.</p>
               <p>HIS Deſign is declared, in 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a Faithful ſaying and worthy of all Acceptation, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners</hi> (And in <hi>John</hi> 6.37, 38.9.40.)</p>
               <p>HIS Deſire is Declared in John 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they, whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory, which thou haſt given me, for thou haſt Loved me before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World.</hi> (And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.)</p>
               <p>HE is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that Obey Him. He hath provided Eternal Bleſſedneſs for them, He hath bought them out of the Hands of Divine Juſtice, with His own moſt Precious Blood, and brought them out of the Kingdom of Satan, from under his Bondage, by His own Almighty Power, that they might be His willing Servants, To be improved for His Glory. And He hath Bought Heaven for their Eternal Poſſeſſion. He had a Right unto Heaven, as He was the Eternal Son of God. But by His Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, His Father, He Purchaſed a Right
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:004487_0018_100D56E41955FE10"/>unto Heaven, for all the Children of God. And He makes over this Right unto them, that they may have it for their Everlaſting Inheritance. Having Spent His Life, He ſhed His Blood for them, He Died for them, and Roſe again from the Dead for them, and Aſcended up into Heaven, to Take &amp; Keep Poſſeſſion of Heaven for them, until He brings them into the Poſſeſſion of Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. GOD the HOLY SPIRIT hath brought home the Benefits of Redemption, to all that are indeed Chriſtians, who begin to Injoy the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is Purpoſed, by God the Father for them and Purchaſed for them, by God their Saviour.</p>
               <p>THE Eternal Spirit of God Awakens them, Inlightens them, Convinces them; and makes them Concerned, about their Eternal Affairs. And Excites and Quickens them, to mind the Things, of their Souls; He Inclineth and Aſſiſteth them to Receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for their Prophet, their Prieſt and their King, with all that Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs and Holineſs and Redemption, that He hath Procured for them: And He Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them, to Accept and Embrace the Son of God for their Eternal Saviour, as He is offered in the Goſpel. And He Comforts them, and Supports them and Strengthens them, and carries them through all Duties and Tryals, to the Glory of God.</p>

               <p>YEA, that God, who is Father, Son and Spirit, ſendeth His Holy Angels to Attend, to Defend, to Aſſiſt and to Comfort His Holy People, as long as they live in this World. And to receive their Spirits, at their Death and to convey them ſafely into the Regions of Glory. [As, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.22.]</p>
               <p>YEA, All the Providences of God, as well as all His Ordinances, are intended and managed for the Benefit of the Faithful Children of God. The whole World being made for the Glorious Meſſiah, it is Preſerved in its Being and in ſome Order, for His Glory, and for the Benefit of thoſe, whom God the Father hath given to Him. And God will keep all things, in the whole World in ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all His Elect ſhall have Time, to be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Admiſſion into His Kingdom of Glory.</p>
               <p>THENCE it comes to paſs, that ſometimes Great Nations and Kingdoms, tho' very Sinful, are Preſerved, for ſeveral Generations, for the ſake of ſome of the Choſen of God, that are to be Born among thoſe Nations, under thoſe Kingdoms.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004487_0019_100D56E666019570"/>
                  <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot is an Inſtance of ſuch a Thing. Several Nations and Kingdoms, notwithſtanding all their Wickedneſs were Preſerve for ſeveral Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Years, until ſhe was Born, brought up and come to Years of Underſtanding ſo as to have the offer of Salvation, that ſhe might Believe and be Saved.</p>
               <p>AND ſometimes, the God of heaven puts mighty Empires into Terrible Confuſions, for the ſake of ſome few of His Choſen, that Reſide in thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, that they may be brought unto the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way of Salvation. Was nothing like this Effected by the Taxing ordered at the time of the Birth of our Saviour?</p>
               <p>YEA, the Goſpel may be Preached a long time, in divers Places without very much Apparent Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, unto the People, that now Live in thoſe Places. But God may have deſigns of Planting and Setling His Goſpel there, for the Benefit of great Numbers of Souls, in after Generations.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, certain it is, that all the great things, that are Performed, by the Alwiſe God, in the World, from time to time, are Deſigned and Ordered, for His Glory, in the Eternal Salvation of His Choſen.</p>
               <p>THEN, be ſure, as God hath done, ſo He is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abundance for all Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>HE looks after them all their Life, Day and Night, continually. He gives His Holy Angels Chang concerning them. He keeps the Celeſtial
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:004487_0019_100D56E666019570"/>Bodies, from Age to Age, in their Places and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for their Benefit. He Orders the Seaſons of the Year for their Good. He Manages every thing upon the Earth, ſo as will, at laſt, be for their Welfare. And they will ſee and have cauſe, to own, the moſt High hath Performed all things well for them.</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY then He hath done Abundance for them, and is doing Abundance for them; Therefore ſhould they Abound in the Work of the Lord. They are under Everlaſting Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to do ſo. If there were no more done for them, than what God hath already done for them and is doing daily for them, while they Live in this World.</p>
               <p>BUT beſides all that God hath done for them and is doing for them, all the time, that they Live here, there is more, Abundance more, that God will do for them, to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>FOR the Eternal God hath Reſerved the chief Recompences of Chriſtians, for the Heavenly World. There He will ſhow what He can do, to make them Inexpreſſibly Bleſſed, Inconceiveably Happy: To Fill and Pleaſe their Souls with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Satisfaction, ſo that they ſhall Deſire no more, than they Enjoy.</p>
               <p>ALL that God is doing for His People, here in this World, though it be Abundance, yet it is nothing to be Compared, with what God will do for His People in the World to come.</p>

               <p>EYE hath not ſeen, Ear hath not Heard, nor hath it Entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, what God Will Do for His People hereafter, in the World of Eternal Glory.</p>
               <p>HE will not only Receive their Spirits into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable Glories, in the Heavenly Paradiſe, to Dwell in His Preſence before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, until the Reſurrection, But Then, He will Raiſe their Bodies, and make them Glorious, like the Body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and will ſet them on Thrones, and ſet Crowns on them, and make them higher than ever were any of the Kings of the Earth, in this World. And He will Honour them, in the great Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before all the World: And when that Day is finiſhed, He will Receive them, both Body and Soul, into the Glories of His Heavenly Kingdom, where they ſhall be, For ever Beholding His Face in Righteouſneſs and Satisfied with His Likeneſs; Drinking of Rivers of Delights and Swimming in an Eternal Ocean of Admirable, Spiritual and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>THEY ſhall be continually Praiſing, Honouring, and Glorifying their Ever Glorious Creator and Redeemer and Sanctifier, before the Holy Angels of God: And Perpetually accompanying of thoſe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:004487_0020_100D30D32173EB48"/>Bleſſed Spirits, in ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing and Honour and Glory and Power be unto Him that Sittethon the Throne and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEY will be for ever with Joyful Wonders, Contemplating on the Glorious and Excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Eternal GOD. They will ſee His Wonderful Power and Wiſdom and Goodneſs, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the Works of Creation; They will ſee further Diſplays of theſe Attributes, in the Works of Providence, wherein they will ſee alſo the Righteouſneſs and Holineſs and Faithfulneſs of God manifeſted. And further Manifeſtations of all theſe Eternal Excellencies will appear in the Works of Redemption, wherein likewiſe they will ſee Glorious Appearances of the Grace, and Mercy and Compaſſion of God, in the Exerciſes of His Loving Kindneſs toward Unworthy Miſerable Sinners, for their Salvation by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And theſe Contemplations will Excite them unto Everlaſting Hallelujahs. They will never be weary of Praiſing the Lord. But will ſay, Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath Loved us from Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and given us to His own Son, to Save us; And Bleſſed be the Lamb of God, that hath Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us and Waſhed us from our Sins, with his own Blood; And Bleſſed be the Holy and Eternal Spirit of God, for His Applying to us all the Benefits of Redemption, and bringing us unto the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Happineſs, purpoſed for us by God

               <p>AND they will find themſelves Compaſſed with, and Confirmed in the Love of God Eternally. And will be ſo Satisfyed as to wiſh for no more.</p>
               <p>BUT all Words are dark things, to Deſcribe or Declare the Happineſs of the Saints of God in Heaven, or to ſhew what God will do for all real Chriſtians, in the Heavenly World.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER, this we may ſay; none of their Labours in the Work of the Lord will be in Vain, they will be Abundantly Recompenced, with a far more exceeding and Eternal Weight of Glory.</p>
               <p>THIS is part of what the Apoſtle intends, when he ſays, <hi>Your Labour ſhall not be invain in the Lord.</hi> And, by ſuch Conſiderations he would have Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to be Excited, to Abound in the Work of the Lord. And we ſhould be all moved, to Abound in the Work of the Lord, by conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, about what God hath done, is doing and will do Abundantly for His People. He is Able, to do Exceeding Abundantly, above all that we can Ask or Think. And He will Glorify His Power in doing Abundantly for all that Love and Fear Him.</p>
               <p>THE Apoſtle conſidering this, would Labour more Abundantly than others, and would have Chriſtians to conſider, what God hath done, in Shedding the Holy Spirit Abundantly on them
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:004487_0021_100D56EA9A3175A8"/>that they may be Quickened to Good Works. And He conſiders the Exceeding Abundant Grace of the Lord Jeſus unto Him, and thinks, if Grace hath much more Abounded, where Sin hath A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, and God hath Pardoned Abundantly, where Sinners have Sinned Abundantly, then they ſhould ſtrive to Abound in the Work of the Lord. They that are Forgiven much are to Love much, and to do much for God, and never grow weary of well doing. But,</p>
               <p n="2">II. WICKED Sinners do Abound in Bad Works. And Commit abundance of Wickedneſs in Sinning againſt the Lord: Therefore ſhould the Children of God ſhew their Love unto their Heavenly Father, by their Abounding in Good Works, doing Abundance for the Glory of God.</p>
               <p>THE. Days Foretold in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſeem to be coming Apace, when, <hi>The Wicked will do Wickedly.</hi> There is no Help for it. There is no Hindering of it.</p>
               <p>YOUNG People Reſolve to keep their Courſe, in the Ways of Ungodlineſs, though-the Word of God and His Judgments leſſer and greater warn them, and they ſee their Companions going into Eternity, leaving them under Awful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions about them; And though Parents warn them, they will not hearken to their Counſels. And though Plagues come and God pours out
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004487_0022_100D56EC4C63B508"/>the Vials of His Indignation, yet Sinners will go on in the ways of Wickedneſs. And is there not Danger that the World will ſtill grow more Wicked and more Woful than ever ſince the Days of <hi>Noah!</hi> Don't the Sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> Abound? Is there not Abundance of Idleneſs? If ſo, Then Abundance of other Wickedneſs will be. No wonder, If there be Abundance of Uncleaneſs, Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Extortion, Impiety, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanity; and if all manner of Iniquity Abound.</p>
               <p>BUT the more Sinners do againſt God, the more ſhould Chriſtians do for God. They ſhould be Studious to be Able to give a good Anſwer, to that Demand, Mat. 5.47. <hi>What do you more than others?</hi> They ſhould ſtrive to Excel in Goodneſs; to be Exceeding Good; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to do Abundance of Good Remembring what our Lord ſays, in Joh. 15.8. <hi>Herein is my Father Glorified, that you bear much Fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III HAVE not we our ſelves done Abundance againſt God? The Saints of God would own as, in Tit. 3.3. <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes Diſobedient, ſerving divers Luſts and Pleaſures.</hi> And this conſideration is mentioned, to Excite them to be ready to every good Work. Then ſhould we be Quickened, to Abound in the Work of the Lord, by conſidering we have done Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance againſt the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:004487_0022_100D56EC4C63B508"/>
PROP. III. IT is the Duty of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Abound <hi>Always</hi> in the Work of the Lord. Not only while they are Young, but alſo when they are Old: And therefore they ſhould begin betimes to do Abundance of Good, and continue to bring forth Fruit, in Old Age. Not only in times of Proſperity, but alſo in times of Adverſity, they ſhould Abound in the Work of the Lord. As God is Always at Work for them, ſo they ſhould be always at Work for God.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>BY what Methods are we to be Aſſisted in Abounding Always in the Work of the Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. I</hi> LAY a good Foundation, for well doing, by getting a Good Principle in your Souls. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. GET a good Knowledge of the Truths of God, in your Souls. It is not good, that the Soul be without Knowledge. This might <hi>Solomon</hi> Learn of his Father <hi>David,</hi> who Charged him, in 1. Chron. 28.9. <hi>To know the God of His Father, and ſerve Him, with a Perfect Heart and a Willing Mind.</hi> There can be no right Service of God without good Knowledge. But if we Know the Truths of God, then Happy are we if we do them. What Goodneſs without Know ledge? Therefore ſhould we Labour, to Know
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004487_0023_100D56F00899E780"/>the Truths of God; That there is a Glorious God; That there are Three Perſons in the God head, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit: That God Made and Rules the World; That Man was Made Holy; but by Sin, Fell in to a Miſerable Condition, from whence he could not, by any Strength or Worth of his own, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himſelf; That the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God, becoming a Man, ſo being God and Man, in two Diſtinct Natures, in one Perſon for ever; is the only Saviour of Sinners; That He is a Prophet, a Prieſt and a King. for their Salvation; That He is Able and Willing to Save them, that come to Him; that there is no Salvation without Faith in Chriſt; That this Faith is the Gift of God; That God Gives it, in Anſwer to Prayer, to them that uſe the Means Appointed, to be Attended, by them, that will Enjoy the Influences of the Holy Spirit, for the Working of Faith in their Souls; That Saving Faith will be Accompanied with, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced by, Good Works; That there is an Heaven for the Godly and an Hell for the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; That our Souls are Immortal, and there will be a Reſurrection of our Bodies and a Day of Judgment, wherein all muſt be Ordered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Eternal State; That our Life Time is the only Time of Probation, for us, to make Preparation for Eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:004487_0023_100D56F00899E780"/>
2. FIRMLY Believe theſe Truths of God. <hi>He that cometh to God muſt Believe that He is, and that He is a Rewarder of them that Seek Him Diligently.</hi> And ſo muſt he that Worketh the Work of the Lord. Be not Satisfied, that you ſeem, to Aſſent to the Truths of God. But ſee, that you ſo Firmly Believe them, that you can Venture your Lives and your Souls upon the Truths of God, which you Profeſs to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve And then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. MAKE ſure about a real Union with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Believe in Him, with a true Faith. For nothing will be well done, about the Work of the Lord, until you begin about, the Work of Faith in the Lord. He ſays, Joh. 15.5. <hi>Without me, you can do nothing.</hi> There will be no Abounding in the Work of the Lord, by them that are out of Chriſt. Therefore get into Chriſt: And Exerciſe Faith in Him, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Strength from Him, to do the Work of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. PENITENTLY Beg the Pardon of all Sin, for the Sake of Chriſt. The Guilt of Sin, like a Chain, Binds the Soul, and like a Weight, Clogs the Soul, ſo as, to hinder it from Good. If the Soul be Overwhelmed with Guilt, how can it run the Ways of the Commandments of God? Or Abound in the Work of the Lord? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cry to God, that, for the Sake of Chriſt, He would Pardon all Sin, both Original and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004487_0024_100D56F1E464F0B8"/>Actual, as well of Omiſſion, as of Commiſſion, againſt the Law and againſt the Goſpel, Secret as well as Open. Confeſs and Bewail every Sin, that you can Remember. Leave it, Loath it and Loath your ſelf for it, and ſay as Rom. 7.24. <hi>O Wretched one that I am, who ſhall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LAY your Foundation Deep, in Penitential Humiliation for Sin paſt and for Indwelling Corruption, while you are Endeavouring, to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Work of the Lord. You muſt ceaſe to do Evil, and Beg Pardon for doing Evil, that you may begin to learn to do well, or you will never Perſevere in doing well. And be ſure to look to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for the Forgiveneſs of Sin. They that think, to Satisfy for their Bad Works, by doing of Good Works, will not Abound in the Work of the Lord. You muſt get Pardon for ill doing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will do well.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE Exerciſe Repentance and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence Repentance. Let it be ſeen, that you do Repent. This indeed is part of the Work of the Lord, but ſuch a Part, that it muſt be done, or no part of that Work will be well done. The Life of a Chriſtian Abounding in the Work of the Lord, muſt be a Life of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Work of Grace muſt be wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of God; or there will be
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004487_0024_100D56F1E464F0B8"/>no Abounding in the Work of the Lord. For in, Eph. 2.10. We are told, that <hi>We are His Workmarſhip Created in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works, which God hath before Ordained, that we ſhould Walk in them.</hi> Until a good Work of Grace be wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of God, there will be no good Work done by the Soul. God muſt ſay to the Soul Live; or it will not Work any good Work; and then be ſure it will nor Abound in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>THEREFORE muſt there be Prayer to God, for the Regenerating influences of the Spirit of God, before we ſhall begin, to do Well. People may not Indulge themſelves, in Sloth and ſay we muſt wait, until God will pleaſe to Change our Hearts, and make us willing to do well: But they muſt Pray, to God, to work, in them, to will and to do that they may do well.</p>
               <p>REGENERATION, by which the Soul paſſeth out of a ſtate of Spiritual Death, into a ſtate of Spiritual Life, is Abſolutely Neceſſary, for Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Abounding in the Work of the Lord: And Supplication to the Lord is to be Attended by them, that would Experience a work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>WHILE Souls are in the Kingdom and under the Power of Satan, they will not do the Work of the Lord: Therefore muſt People Pray to God, that being Delivered out of the Hands of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and from the Power of Darkneſs, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004487_0025_100D56F401F15080"/>Tranſlated into the Kingdom of Chriſt, and having a New Heart put into them and the Spirit of Life given to them, they may Serve the Lord, and <hi>Abound in the Work of the Lord,</hi> without any Sinful Fear, in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs before Him, all the Days of their Life.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> TAKE heed of Miſtaking, about the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of your Souls. Be not Deceived, in Thinking that you are in a Good State, if you are not really turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Satan to God, and have not Received the Forgiveneſs of Sin, through Faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>IF you don't lay a good Foundation, upon the Rock, Jeſus Chriſt, by a True Faith in a Sound Repentance, with a Good Knowledge of, and a Firm Aſſent to the Truths of God, you may ſeem to do Well for a while, and <hi>Abound</hi> in Good things, But there is Danger, that you will Decay and your Leaves may Wither and Fall. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Search &amp; Try, that you may Know Yourſelves. It is Adviſed, in 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine Yourſelves.</hi> Thouſands Periſh by Preſumption. They Think that things are well with their Souls. And they Hope, that they are well. But they will not Examine themſelves, to Know certainly how things are: And ſo they are Undone for ever. They hope that they have Believed and Repented and are in a ſafe State: But are not willing to be at the Pains for an Impartial, Penetrating Self.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004487_0025_100D56F401F15080"/>Examination, ſo as to Know thorowly the State of their Souls, and ſo they Spend their Days under the Influence of their Vain Hopes, until they lye down in Eternal Sorrow. Therefore be wiſe, to make a thorow Tryal: And be not Satisfied until you are Certified that Chriſt is yours and you are His. And if you be really in Chriſt, then He will Strengthen you with Strength in your Soul to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> SET about the Work of God now; in this preſent time: Seek firſt the Kingdom of God. Make haſte, without delay, to keep the Commandments of the Lord. Young People ſhould begin Preſently: Now while they are Young, to do the Work of God. And all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be Careful, to Improve the Preſent time, or they will not as they ſhould Abound in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>IV.</hi> BE Sincere in all you Endeavours about Religion. Hypocrites Frequently turn Apoſtates. Pray to God, that your Hearts may be Sound in the Statutes of the Lord, and Right in the Sight of God. If you'l Abound in His Work. Be not Careleſs about the Secret Duties of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. Let the Holy Angels of God ſee that you Fray in Secret unto God, as your Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father conſtantly every Day. Be not
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004487_0026_100D56F5AB9D5050"/>Satisfied with a Name, to Live, nor with a Form of Godlineſs. But be thorowly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> THINK often, how Dreadful, to miſs of Happineſs, at laſt, by leaving the Work of God. And Remember, how it hath been with others. The Inhabitants of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> they did not as thoſe of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> riſe up, and thruſt Chriſt out of their City, nor like the <hi>Gadarenes</hi> deſire Him, to be gone out of their Coaſts: But they Heard Him, every Sabbath Day, and ſeemed, to Delight in Hearing Him: And yet ſays He to them, in Mat. 11.25. <hi>Thou Capernaum, which art Exalted to Heaven, ſhalt be brought down to Hell.</hi> It is not enough, to Attend Sermons, to Commend Sermons, but you muſt Practice them, or they will Condemn you. Be Doers of the Word and not Hearers only, Deceiving your own ſelves. And Reallize to your ſelves, that Perſons may do much, and go far, and yet after all fall ſhort of Heaven, becauſe they have not the Root of the Matter in them, and ſo they grow weary of the Work of God and will not Abound in that Work, but turn aſide unto Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ways and are led forth with the Workers of Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> DREAD being Ruined by the Trinity of this World; The Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt

They that are engaged in purſuing the Pleaſures, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and the Honours of this World, will not Abound in the Work of the Lord. Therefore is it Adviſed, in 1 Pet. 2.12. <hi>Abstain from Fleſhly Luſts, that war againſt the Soul.</hi> And in 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>Love not the World, neither the things in the World. If any Man Love the World, the Love of the Father is not in him.</hi> And in Joh. 5.44. <hi>How can you Believe, that Receive Honour, one of another, and Seek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> By theſe Admonitions it plainly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that Senſuality, Covetouſneſs and Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be Abandoned by them that will A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> BEGIN Well and Conclude Well, every Day and every Week and every particular Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; if you would Abound in the Work of the Lord. Therefore,</p>
               <p>LET ſome of your firſt Thoughts in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſome of your laſt Thoughts in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, be about God and Chriſt and your Souls and Heavenly and Eternal Things.

And, how ſhall I Spend this Day for the Glory of God and the Salvation of my own Soul and the Souls of thoſe, for whoſe Welfare, I ſhould be Concerned? And if it ſhould be my laſt Day, how would I have it Spent? Wiſh and Pray
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004487_0027_100D56F9039C1E38"/>that you may Spend the Day Well, ſo as to be Able to give a Good Account before God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your Improving of the Day. And in the Evening think, what have I done this Day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the great Work of my Life? And Beg Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for the Sake of Chriſt, for all that hath been Amiſs, before you Venture to lye down to Sleep. And try to Sleep in the Love of God. An Heathen would Condemn the Chriſtian, that ſhould Neglect all this Work of an Evening Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Examination.</p>
               <p>BUT all the Lords Day ſhould be Spent in the Secret, Private and Publick Duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, except what the Works of Neceſſity and Compaſſion Require: And they ſhould be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch Holy Frames of Souls that we may be going toward Heaven, while we are At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thoſe Works. And the little Spaces of Time, that bye between the Stated Exerciſes of Religion ſhould be filled with Uſeful Thoughts, about Spiritual and Eternal Things, that we may be in the Spirit all the Lords Day and Finiſh the Day with God.</p>
               <p>AND upon every Particular and Remarkable Undertaking, we ſhould Think, will this be for the Glory of God? And how may it be beſt Managed for His Glory? And when it is Finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and we Review our Managements of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, we ſhould Beg Pardon of God for all that Appears Faulty in our Managements.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004487_0027_100D56F9039C1E38"/>This might Help, to do Better for time to come.</p>
               <p>AND if Chriſtians did at the Concluſion of the Week, look over the Affairs of the Week paſt, and Ask Forgiveneſs from God, for what hath been Irregular, and Ask for Grace to Walk more Agreeably to Rule, in the next Week, it would Help them, to Abound in the Work of the Lord.</p>

                  <hi>VIII.</hi> ALWAYS Repair to, and Rely on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for Conſtant Supplies of New Grace, for every Exerciſe. Venture upon nothing, without looking to Chriſt, for New Grace to Help through all.</p>
               <p>NEVER Imagine that you can do any thing without the Grace of Chriſt Helping. Strive to be Able to ſay as He could in Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things, through Chriſt Enabling me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN a Duty is to be Performed, look to Chriſt for Grace, to Perform the Duty, when a Mercy is to be Improved, look to Chriſt, for Grace to Improve the Mercy.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Trial is to be Endured, look to Chriſt for Grace to Endure it well.</p>

               <p>ACKNOWLEDGE that all Grace muſt come from the Everlaſting Love of God the Father, as Purchaſed, by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt and Applied by the Holy Spirit, unto your Souls, moſt freely; both Inherent Grace and Aſſiſting Grace; Directing Grace and Exciting Grace; Preventing, Upholding and Accepting Grace.</p>
               <p>WHILE you Preſerve your Union with Chriſt, by a Living Faith, Maintain your Communion with Chriſt, by a Working Faith, Deriving Grace from Chriſt, to Live to God and Work for God. So Live by Faith on the Son of God: Then will you Abound in the Work of the Lord, and be coming nearer and nearer unto the Happineſs of always Abounding in that Deſire-able Work. But,</p>

               <p>PRAYER is a great part of our Work, and it muſt be Attended, or no part of our Work will be well Attended: But there is other Work to be Attended beſides Prayer: Therefore when we are Adviſed, to be Praying always (and to

               <p>AND Watching muſt be joined with our Praying. We muſt Watch before Duty, Watch in Duty and Watch after Duty.

               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:004487_0029_100D56FDF7E63610"/>
YEA, Natural Self muſt be Denied <hi>Conditionally,</hi> ſo that we muſt be willing to part with Eaſe, Health and Life, rather than to Neglect the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>BUT then, Be ſure all, Unneceſſary, Unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Familiarity with Ungodly Company muſt be Abandoned, by them that would Abound in the Work of the Lord: They that will keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, muſt ſay, Depart from me, ye workers of Iniquity. They muſt deny themſelves of the Company not only of Prophane Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, but alſo of Formal Profeſſors; for both will hinder from Always Abounding in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>AND they muſt take up their Croſs, in their Expectation of Trouble and in their Preparation for Trouble, before it comes, and in their Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Patient Suſtentation of Trouble, when God brings Trouble upon them; yea, though the Trouble may come, on Account of their doing well, and becauſe they Abound in the Work of God.</p>
               <p>SO muſt they Follow the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, both by Obedience to Him, and by Imitation of Him and they muſt Imitate Him in His Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Lowlineſs, Humility and Patience. And let Patience have her Perfect Work, that they may be Perfect and Intire wanting nothing.</p>
               <p>THEN after all theſe things, they that would always Abound in the Work of the Lord, muſt
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004487_0030_100D5700EC7B5FF8"/>Renounce all Apprehenſions or Imaginations, that they have Deſerved any thing of Good, at the Hands of God, by any of the Good Works that they have done, though they have been a long time, Striving, every Day, to do Abundance for God and for His Glory. For that is Part of the Leſſon, that they muſt always Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in Luk. 17.10. <hi>When ye ſhall have done all thoſe things, which are Commanded you, ſay, we are Unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</hi> We Deſerve nothing, but have reaſon to be Thankful to God, that He will Accept and Improve us in His Service. It is a great Favour, an high Honour, that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Eternal King of the World, will give us Leave, to do any Work for Him, and will give Grace to us, to do His Work ſo, that we may be Accepted, for the Sake of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>AND therefore, though we may have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto the Recompence of the Reward, in the Heavenly World for the Encouragement of our Souls in the Work of God, yet we muſt not think, that we Deſerve any of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by any of our Works, though we Abound never ſo much in Good Works. But after all our Abounding in the Work of God, we muſt look for Mercy. And the Reward muſt be Freely Beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the Free Grace of God.</p>
               <p>AND though we ſeem, to Labour in Vain, and Spend our Strength for Nought and in Vain,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004487_0030_100D5700EC7B5FF8"/>as to any Succeſs of our moſt Conſcientious and Laborious Endeavours to do Good, in our work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for God, all our Days: And our Day may ſeem dark, like the Night, and we may ſay, We have been Toiling all the Night and have taken nothing yet we muſt not think, that God is deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hardly with us, in His Denying of Succeſs unto our Endeavours. But we muſt for ever Juſtify the Lord, and ſay, He is Righteous in all His Ways and Holy in all His Works.</p>
               <p>THE Lord is not Indebted unto Us, by our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in His Work, but we are Indebted unto His free Grace, for Aſſiſting us in His Work. And therefore we muſt not Murmur, nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at any of His Diſpenſations about us. But be willing, Humbly to deny our ſelves, and own that we deſerve nothing of Good, by all that we have done, how much and how well ſoever we have done; But have reaſon to Lament and be Aſhamed, that we have done no more nor better, and be Contented, whatever God will do with us, and ſubmit unto His Sovereign Will in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>MOSES</hi> may take many Thouſands of weary Steps, towards the Promiſed Land, with Hopes, at length, to arrive there; And yet after all muſt be contented without ever ſetting his Foot on the Deſired Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ISAIAH</hi> may Preach a long Time to an hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hearted People, and may deliver Thouſands of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004487_0031_100D5702B82BCE78"/>Sermons in their Audience, and yet after all, may ſee the Generality of an whole Generation of Sinners, Periſhing in their impenitence, without ever getting any good, by his Preaching; but he muſt be ſatisfied with the Sovereignty of the moſt High God.</p>
               <p>SO muſt the Servants of God be willing to Deny themſelves, that they may always be Abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Work of the Lord.</p>
               <p>THESE are ſome Rules to help Chriſtians to be always Abounding in that Work, wherein they ſhall find at laſt, that they have not Laboured in Vain.</p>
               <p>BUT if it be Demanded, <hi>Who can Attend all theſe Rules?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It might be readily Replied, <hi>None but Real Chriſtians will follow the Rules that have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE the Concluſion of all, muſt be, with Two Advices.</p>
               <p>FOR it may be ſuppoſed, that, as in moſt Congregations, where the Goſpel hath been Preached Faithfully for any conſiderable Time, ſo in this Congregation, there be two ſorts of People to whom the Preceeding things have been Propoſed. And both ſorts muſt be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and Exhorted, to Accept of, Comply with and Conform to, the Propoſals.</p>
               <p>MAY it not he feared that there be thoſe, that have Lived all their Days, in their Miſerable
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004487_0031_100D5702B82BCE78"/>Unregenracy, and are ſtill going aſtray in the Greatneſs of their Folly, and ſo have not begun to ſtrike one ſtroke, about the Work of the Lord, and are far from Abounding in that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> They Abound in the Work of Sin, but not in the Work of God. They are the Companions of Fools, that muſt be deſtroyed, if they don't Repent, they ſhew their Ungodlineſs by chuſing the Company of the Ungodly. And of theſe commonly is the biggeſt Number of moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. But,</p>
               <p>MAY it not be Hoped, that there be ſome, at leaſt, a ſmall number, that are Converted unto God in Chriſt, and ſhew their Godlineſs, by chaſing them that Fear God, for their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Both ſorts muſt be Addreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> LET them that Fear, that they are not become Real Chriſtians, and ſo have not ſo much as begun the Work of the Lord, now become real Chriſtians and begin that Work Immediately without any longer Delay.</p>
               <p>DON'T Reject the Advice, with ſaying, We can't Convert our ſelves and therefore muſt lye ſtill until God will Pleaſe to Convert us.</p>
               <p>BUT O Mourn, that all your Days have Roll'd away under the Anger of God, and you have loſt all your Time hitherto, and are in continual Danger of dropping down into Everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe of your Unfruitfulneſs under the

               <p>YOU are not Urged to do any Part of the Work of God, by your own Strength, but to Pray to God for His Grace and look, to Chriſt, for Strength, to Help you to Turn to God and to Believe in Chriſt, that you may do the Work of the Lord, and Abound always in that Work. The Lord Graciouſly Help you to do ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> LET them that Hope, that they are become Real Chriſtians, and have begun the Work of God, go on with that Work as Becometh
