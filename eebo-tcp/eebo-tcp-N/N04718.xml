            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>HAVING had the Opportunity of peruſing the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, I do with pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to the World, as found, ſeaſonable, and ſolid Compoſures. They appear to me to contain, the <hi>Words of Truth and Soberneſs;</hi> and to be well adapted to <hi>correct the Errors</hi> of the preſent Day, as well as to <hi>promote</hi> vital and practical <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>—The Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in them are pious, pertinent, and inſtructive; and ſo well ſuited to the Times we live in, that they are like <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi> The Stile is eaſy and natural,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005885_0003_10275F59EAD1CAC0"/>
and the practical Inferences, affectionate and poignant, equally fitted to alarm Sinners, and comfort the Saints of God amidſt the various Miſeries that attend their preſent <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> thro' this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Tears,</hi> this uncertain and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult State of Probation. In a Word, I am humbly of Opinion, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes aforeſaid, are grave and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uline; that they indicate a ſober, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, well-informed Mind, and a warm Heart. I therefore earneſtly beſeech the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to bleſs them to thoſe noble Ends for which they are ſpecially adapted, for the Sake of his dear Son!</p>
            <p>Upon hearing the Reverend Author of the aforeſaid Diſcourſes, preach fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in this <hi>

to the <hi>Doctrinal Articles</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and our <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> between which there is the ſweeteſt Harmony.—</p>
            <p>It was likewiſe peculiarly agreeable to me, to hear the aforeſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man openly and boldly declare in his publick Diſcourſes, againſt that deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and dangerous Error of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians,</hi> viz. <hi>That Perſons are actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified before Faith;</hi> which is the <hi>proton pſeudos,</hi> or firſt Riſe of all their Abominations.—</p>
            <p>And I think it my Duty, having this Opportunity, to inform the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, that the Author of the following Diſcourſes, has declared <hi>his Sentiments</hi> in this City, againſt that perilous <hi>ignis fatuus, Enthuſiaſm,</hi> (particularly in his laſt agreeable Viſit) with equal Zeal; the Quinteſſence of which, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, conſiſts in following <hi>Impulſes,</hi> or our own <hi>Fancy,</hi> as a Rule of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, without the written Word, while
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:005885_0005_10275F5E57E93358"/>
the ſober Uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> is rejected; This, the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD has expreſly oppoſed and declar'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.—There are ſome Things in this faithful Servant of Chriſt, which I cannot but admire as very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>viz.</hi> His continued <hi>burning Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt for ſo many Years, with but little Interruption comparatively: His <hi>indefatigable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> for God, eſpecially in preaching the everlaſting Goſpel daily, for ſo long a Space of Time: The <hi>Preſervation</hi> of his <hi>weak Conſtitution,</hi> from being entirely <hi>ruin'd</hi> by ſuch an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Courſe of vehement <hi>Labours</hi> and fatiguing <hi>Travel:</hi> The <hi>Preſervation</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> from being either quite lifted up, and carried away with <hi>Pride,</hi> in the midſt of ſo much Popularity and Applauſe, or at times quite <hi>ſunk</hi> in melancholly <hi>Deſpondency,</hi> under the <hi>Withdrawings</hi> of God's <hi>comfortable Preſence,</hi> the <hi>Jealouſies</hi> and Deſertions
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:005885_0006_10275F6415198CE0"/>
of dear <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Enemies,</hi> whereby his <hi>Character</hi> has been with Art and Elegance, exceedingly and unjuſtly blackened; tho'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> by <hi>ſome,</hi> at leaſt in all Probability, with an honeſt Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Add to theſe Sources of Grief, the Apoſtacies of divers promiſing <hi>Profeſſors;</hi> ſome from the <hi>ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi> of Religion, and ſome from Truth and practical Godlineſs both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; with the <hi>fiery Darts</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Temptations,</hi> ſuited to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Circumſtances of Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I may add to theſe, his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Succeſs</hi> in winning poor Sinners to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and building up Saints in Knowledge, Faith, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Comfort!</p>

                  </gap>is Labours</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>-Miniſtry than many others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my <hi>Travels</hi> in <hi>America;</hi> I can freely and ſafely declare, that I have met with many who have given a
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:005885_0007_10275F6703FFD1A8"/>
rational and ſcriptural Account of their Converſion by <hi>his</hi> Miniſtry, and do crown their Narrative by a holy Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I heartily wiſh that ſome ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Gentlemen of Figure and Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who have wrote againſt him, and have poſſibly been influenced thereto in a Meaſure, by a wrong Information reſpecting ſome Particulars in his Preaching and Conduct, had but the Opportunity of hearing him preach frequently, and pray, not only in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, but in private, as well as of free Converſation with him about the Things they object; I cannot but think that they would then alter their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments concerning him. Surely their Jealouſies would be removed, and their preſent apparent Averſion, turned into Wonder and Love. For my own Part, I muſt ſpeak honourably of him, for God's Sake, and for Truth's Sake, ſhould it coſt me never ſo dear.—He comes out ſo clearly, ſo boldly and
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:005885_0008_10275F688B366838"/>
prudently, for the ſweet, ſweet, ſweet <hi>Truths</hi> of the <hi>ever-bleſſed</hi> LORD JESUS, that it charms my Heart into Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Love. If he doth not preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, in my humble Opinion, it is not in the Bible. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in my Heart, and I think, with ſufficient Reaſon, that his Deſigns in travelling are pious and honourable, <hi>viz.</hi> To bring poor Sinners to Chriſt, and to build them up in him. And he is for the general, uncommonly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened and aſſiſted in his bleſſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Service. He preaches the great Doctrines of the Reformed Churches, <hi>viz. Original Sin, Juſtification by Faith alone, Man's Impotency to do ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Good, Regeneration, Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance.</hi>—Theſe impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Points he mainly inſiſts upon, and that with Clearneſs, Pungency, and Pathos.</p>
            <p>Moreover, he is <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>patient</hi> in <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and treats his Oppoſers
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:005885_0009_10275F6CC6698A60"/>
with Temper and <hi>Kindneſs.</hi>—In a Word, his whole Life evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be devoted to Jehovah, and is filled with Acts of Piety towards God, and Mercy towards Mens Souls and Bodies.</p>
            <p>Yea, ſuch is the Vehemence of his Deſires to do extenſive and manifold Service to the Church of God, that he is in Danger of loſing his Life in the Cauſe, by a Series of extraordinary Labours (to all Appearance quite diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned to his bodily Strength.) Now what greater Evidence can we have of the Sincerity of any Man than theſe? Eſpecially if we add thereto, his peaceable, healing Diſpoſition in reſpect of the Church of God, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Schiſms and Diviſions. What tho' there have been ſome exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unguarded Expreſſions, in ſome of his former Writings? Is this to be wonder'd at, conſidering his <hi>young Years, ſtrong Paſſions, Education</hi> in
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:005885_0010_10275F6FA4A38058"/>
               <hi>Arminian Principles,</hi> and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>Hurry</hi> of his Labours in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, writing Letters, and Diſcourſing with People in the Places where he <hi>travell'd</hi> having withal but little Time for Study and Reflection?</p>
            <p>Shou'd not that <hi>Charity, that hopes all Things</hi> that are good, as far as there is any Reaſon for it, induce us to put a favourable Conſtruction on them, at leaſt on his Deſigns; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that his after Writings ſet many Things in a better Light?</p>
            <p>If every doubtful Expreſſion in the Writings of <hi>Luther,</hi> and many other good and great Men, were put upon the Rack by ingenious Pens, and not compared with other Paſſages in the ſame, or other of their Performances, their Principles would appear in a ſable Dreſs, and might be eaſily burleſqued.</p>
            <p>I deſign to offend no Man by this Preface—I deſire to entertain charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sentiments of all, as far as I have
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:005885_0011_10275F770AB11750"/>
Scripture and Reaſon for it; and I doubt not, but divers who have oppoſed both the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD and my ſelf, have had a pious and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Intention in ſo doing.—I only beg leave to expreſs my own Opinion, with all due Deference to ſuch as are otherwiſe minded.</p>
            <p>But I muſt haſten to the Concluſion, and therefore beſeech the Reader to peruſe, without Prejudice, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſes; and to conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the Truths contained in them, as well as to apply in particular his own Portion.—In this Way, he will glorify God, and probably receive ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Benefit to himſelf. I add no more, but imploring the Bleſſings of Heaven upon thy Endeavours, remain thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for Chriſt's Sake.</p>

what is a Friend? Why "there is a Friend that is nearer than a Brother," nay, as near as one's <hi>own Soul</hi>—And <hi>thy Friend,</hi> ſays God in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy, which is as thy own Soul.</hi>—Kind and endearing Appellations theſe, that undoubtedly beſpeak a very near and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effably intimate Union between the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and the true living Members to his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body! But, methinks, the Words of our Text point out to us a Relation, which not only comprehends, but in reſpect to Near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Dearneſs, exceeds all other Relations whatſoever—I mean that of a <hi>Huſband—For thy Maker is thy Huſband—The Lord of Hoſts is his Name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Theſe Words were originally ſpoken to the People of the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſidered collectively as a peculiar People, whom our Lord had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth'd and married to himſelf; and they ſeem to be ſpoken when Religion was upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline among their Churches; when they had, in a great Meaſure, loſt that Life and Power, which they once experienced; and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies began to inſult them with a <hi>Where is now your God?</hi> Such a State of Things muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be very afflicting to the true Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Zion;</hi> and, no doubt, put them upon crying unto the Lord, in this their deep Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs—He hears their Prayer—His Bowels

yearn towards them; and, in the preceding Verſe, he aſſures them, that tho' the Enemy had broken in upon them like a Flood, yet their Extremity ſhould be his Opportunity to lift up a Standard againſt him—<hi>Fear not,</hi> ſays the great Head and King of his Church, <hi>for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed,</hi> that is, <hi>finally</hi> or <hi>totally; neither be thou confounded, i. e.</hi> diſſipated, or dejected, giving up all for gone, as though thou never ſhouldſt ſee better Days, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revival of Religion; <hi>for thou ſhalt not</hi> entirely <hi>be put to Shame,</hi> tho' for a while, for thy Humiliation, and the greater Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Adverſaries, I ſuffer them to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over thee: <hi>For,</hi> ſays the Lord, <hi>thou ſhalt forget the Shame of thy Youth, and ſhalt not remember the Reproach of thy Widow-hood any more; i. e.</hi> I will vouchſafe you ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glorious Gale of my bleſſed Spirit, that you ſhall quite forget your former troubled Widow-ſtate, and give your Enemies no more Occaſion to inſult you, on Account of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church is <hi>his Spouſe—For,</hi> ſays he, in the Words juſt now read to you, <hi>thy Maker is thy Husband, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of</hi> Iſrael; and therefore he loves thee too

well, to let thy Enemies always trample thee under Foot—<hi>The Lord of Hoſts is his Name, the God of the whole Earth ſhall he be called;</hi> and therefore he is armed with ſufficient Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to relieve his oppreſſed People, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and avenge himſelf of all their haughty and inſulting Foes.—</p>
            <p>This ſeems to be the prime and genuine Interpretation of the Text and Context, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we add, that they may have a further View to the latter-day Glory, and that bleſſed State of the Church, which the People of God have been looking for in all Ages, and the ſpeedy Approach of which, we undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly pray for, when we put up that Petition of our Lord's, <hi>viz. Thy Kingdom come.</hi>—</p>
            <p>But, tho' the Words were originally ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they are undoubtedly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all Believers in all Ages, and, when inlarged on in a proper Manner, will afford us ſuitable Matter of Diſcourſe both for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and for Saints; for ſuch as know God, as well as ſuch who know him not; and likewiſe for thoſe, who once walked in the Light of his bleſſed Countenance, but are now backſlidden from him; have their Harps hung upon the Willows, and are afraid that their Beloved is gone, and will return to their Souls no more.—Accordingly, without prefacing this Diſcourſe any farther, as I ſuppoſe a mix'd Multitude of Saints, unconverted Sinners, and

            <p>But, before I proceed to this, it may not be improper to obſerve, that if any of you, amongſt whom I am now preaching the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, are Enemies to inward Religion,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005885_0019_10275F8D78596E28"/>
and explode the Doctrine of inward Feelings, as Enthuſiaſm, Cant and Nonſenſe, I ſhall not be ſurprized, if your Hearts riſe againſt me whilſt I am preaching, for I am about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on true vital and internal Piety; and an inſpired Apoſtle hath told us, <hi>that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man diſcerneth not the Things of the Spirit, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>—But, however, be noble as the <hi>Bereans</hi> were; ſearch the Scriptures as they did: lay aſide Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice; hear like <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> with a true <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>I would further obſerve, that if any here expect fine Preaching from me this Day, they will, in all probability, go away diſappointed—For I came not here to ſhoot over Peoples Heads; but, if the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to bleſs me, to reach their Hearts. Accordingly I ſhall endeavour to cloath my Ideas in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Now, that we may Diſcourſe more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and intelligibly upon this Point, it may not be amiſs, under this Head, to conſider, what is neceſſary to be done, before a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between two Parties amongſt our ſelves, can be ſaid to be valid in the Sight of God and Man—And that will lead us in a familiar Way, to ſhew, what muſt be done, or what muſt paſs between us and Jeſus Chriſt, before we can ſay, <hi>our Maker is our Huſband.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> In all lawful Marriages, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, that the Parties to be joined together in that holy and honourable Eſtate, are actually and legally freed from all Pre-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements whatſoever.—<hi>A Woman is bound to her Huſband,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo long as her Huſband liveth.</hi> The ſame Law holds good in reſpect to the Man. And ſo likewiſe, if either Party be betrothed and promiſed, tho' not actually married to another, the Marriage is not lawful, till that Pre-engagement and Promiſe be fairly and mutually diſſolved.—Now, it is juſt thus between us and the Lord Jeſus—For, we are all by Nature born under, and wedded to the Law, as a Covenant of Works.—Hence it is, that we are ſo fond of, and artfully go about, in order to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs of our own—It is as natural for us to do this, as it is to breathe—Our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> even after the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace was revealed to them in that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005885_0021_10275F98D4599458"/>
Promiſe, <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpent's Head,</hi> reached out their Hands, and would again have taken hold of the Tree of Life, which they had now forfeited, had not God drove them out of Paradiſe, and compell'd them, as it were, to be ſaved by Grace—And thus all their Deſcendants natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally run to the Tree of Life, and want to be ſaved, partly at leaſt, if not wholly, by their Works. And even gracious Souls, who are inwardly renewed, ſo far as the Old Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in them, find a ſtrong Propenſity this way.—Hence it is, that natural Men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo fond of <hi>Arminian</hi> Principles.—<hi>Do and live,</hi> is the native Language of a proud, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Heart.—But before we can ſay, <hi>our Maker is our Huſband,</hi> we muſt be divorced from our old Huſband, the Law; <hi>i. e.</hi> we muſt renounce our own Righteouſneſs, our own Doings and Performances, in Point of Dependence, either in Whole or Part, as Dung and Droſs, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.—For thus ſpeaks the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap vii. 4. <hi>Ye alſo are become dead to the Law (i. e.</hi> as a Covenant of Works) <hi>by the Body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be married to another, even to him, who is raiſed from the Dead.</hi>—As he alſo ſpeaketh in another Place, <hi>I have eſpouſed you, as a chaſte Virgin to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This was the Apoſtle's own Caſe—
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005885_0022_10275F9A6B0D8BA0"/>
Whilſt he depended on his being <hi>a Hebrew of the Hebrews,</hi> and thought himſelf ſecure, becauſe, as to the outward Obſervation of the Law, <hi>he was blameleſs;</hi> he was an entire Stranger to the divine Life: But when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to experience the Power of Jeſus Chriſt's Reſurrection, we find him, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> abſolutely renouncing all his external Priviledges, and all his <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Righteouſneſs; <hi>Yea,</hi> ſays he, <hi>doubtleſs, and I count all Things but Loſs, nay but Dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that which is through the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> And thus it muſt be with us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'re we can ſay <hi>our Maker is our Huſband.</hi>—Tho' we may not be wrought upon in that extraordinary Way in which the Apoſtle was, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et we muſt be dead to the Law, we muſt be eſpouſed as chaſte Virgins, to Jeſus Chriſt, and count all external Priviledges, and our moſt ſplendid Performances (as was before obſerved) only as Dung and Droſs, <hi>for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But further, before a Marriage among us an ſtand good in Law, both Parties muſt not only be freed from all Pre-engagements, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>thing, or Eſpouſing, a Thing previous to the Solemnity of Marriage.—Thus we find, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is ſaid to be eſpouſed to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> before they actually came together, <hi>Mat.</hi> i. 18. And thus it is among us—Both Parties are previouſly agreed, and as it were, eſpouſed to each other, before we publiſh, what we call, the Banns of Marriage concerning them. And ſo it will be in the ſpiritual Marriage, between Jeſus Chriſt and our Souls—Before we are actually married or united to him by Faith; or, to keep to the Terms of the Text, before we aſſuredly can ſay, that <hi>our Maker is our Huſband,</hi> we muſt be made willing People in the Day of God's Power, we muſt be ſweetly and effectually perſuaded by the Holy Spirit of God, that the glorious <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> is willing to accept of us, juſt as we are, and alſo that we are willing to accept of him upon his own Terms, yea, upon any Terms.—And when once it comes to this, the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Marriage goes on apace, and there is but one Thing lacking to make it compleat.—And what is that? An actual Union.</p>
            <p>This is abſolutely neceſſary in every lawful Marriage among Men.—There muſt be a Joining of Hands before Witneſſes, e're they can be deemed lawfully joined together.—Some Men indeed of corrupt Minds, are apt to look upon this as a needleſs Ceremony
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005885_0024_10275FA46F56E198"/>
and think it ſufficient to be married, as they term it, in the Sight of God.—But whence Men get ſuch Divinity, I know not.—I am poſitive, not from the Bible; for we there read that even at the firſt Marriage in Paradiſe, there was ſomething of outward Solemnity; God himſelf (if I may ſo ſpeak) being there the Prieſt.—For we are told, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii. 22. that, after God had made the Woman, <hi>be brought her unto the Man.</hi>—And indeed, to lay aſide all Manner of outward Ceremony in Marriage, would be to turn the World into a Den of brute Beaſts—Men would then take, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, as many Wives as they pleaſed, and we ſhould ſoon ſink into as bad and brutal State, as thoſe Nations are now in, amongſt whom ſuch Practices are allowed of, and who are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtitute of the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.—Whoever has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the Power of his Reſurrection, I am perſuaded will never plead for ſuch a licentious Practice—For the Terms made uſe of in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to repreſent he myſtical Union between Chriſt and his Church, ſuch as, our being <hi>joined to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>married to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are all metaphorical Expreſſions, taken from ſome analagous Practices amongſt Men.—And as Perſons when married, tho' before twain, are now one Fleſh; ſo thoſe that are joined to the Lord, and can truly ſay, <hi>our Maker is our Husband,</hi> in the Apoſtle's Language, are
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005885_0025_10275FA60FDA5598"/>
one Spirit.—This was typiſied in the original Marriage of our firſt Parents.—When God brought <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam,</hi> he received her with Joy at his Hands, and ſaid, <hi>this is Bone of my Bone, and Fleſh of my Fleſh.</hi>—They had there, primarily, but one Name—For thus ſpeaks the ſacred Hiſtorian, <hi>Gen.</hi> v. 1, 2.—<hi>In the Day that God created Man, he bleſſed them, and called</hi> their <hi>Name</hi> Adam.—And why? becauſe they were <hi>one Fleſh,</hi> and were to have but <hi>one Heart.</hi>—The ſelf-ſame Terms are made uſe of in Scripture, to expreſs the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's Union with Jeſus Chriſt—We are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> after Chriſt's Name, becauſe made Partakers of Chriſt's Nature.—Out of his Fulneſs, Believers receive Grace for Grace—And therefore, the marriage State, eſpecially by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> is frequently made uſe of, to figure out to us the real, vital Union, between Jeſus Chriſt and regenerate Souls.—This is termed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 32. <hi>A great Myſtery.</hi>—But great as it is, we muſt all experience it, before we can ſay aſſuredly, that <hi>our Maker is our Husband.</hi>—For what ſays our Lord, in that Prayer he put up to his Father before his bitter Paſſion? <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſt given me, ſhall be where I am, that they may be one with thee, even as thou, O Father, and I are one, I in them, and they in me, that we all may be made perfect in One.</hi>—Oh infinite Condeſcenſion!
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005885_0026_10275FAAE0E88F80"/>
Oh ineffable Union! Hence it is, that Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are ſaid to be Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones—Hence it is, that the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of himſelf, ſays, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> What an Expreſſion is <hi>that?</hi> How much does it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend? And, that we might not think this was ſomething peculiar to himſelf, he puts this cloſe Queſtion to the <hi>Corinthians; Know ye not, that Chriſt is in you, unleſs you be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates?</hi> Agreeable to what he ſays in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ought Believers, whether Men or Women, to be ſubject to Jeſus Chriſt—For he is the Head of the Church—He has bought her by his Blood—Believers therefore are not their own; but are under the higheſt Obligations to glorify and obey Jeſus Chriſt, in their Bodies, and their Souls, which are his—Add to this, that his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as it is admirably expreſſed in one of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, is perfect Freedom—His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, holy, juſt, and good—And therefore, it is your higheſt Priviledge, O Believers, to ſubmit to, and obey them—Earthly Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands may be ſo mean, as to impoſe ſome Things upon their Wives, merely to ſhew their Authority; but it is not ſo with Jeſus Chriſt—He can and does impoſe nothing, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Again, <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> in the marriage State, is ſtrictly enjoined, in the Scriptures of Truth—<hi>Marriage,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled—But Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Adulterers, God will judge</hi>—Nay, Adultery is an Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Earthly Judges; it diſſolves the marriage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—<hi>For the Man has not Power over his own Body, but the Woman; neither has the Woman Power over her own Body, but the Man</hi>—The Heathens themſelves have been taught this by the Light of Nature; and Adultery, among ſome of them, is puniſhed with imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Death—And ought married Perſons to be thus careful, to keep the Marriage-Bed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, how carefully then ought Believers to keep their Souls chaſte, pure and undefiled, now they are eſpouſed to Jeſus Chriſt? For there is ſuch a Thing as ſpiritual Adultery—<hi>O ye Adulterers, and Adultereſſes,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James</hi>—And God frequently complains of his People's playing the Harlot—Hence it is, that St. <hi>John,</hi> in the moſt endearing Manner, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Believers to keep themſelves from Idols—For the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and Pride of Life, are always ready to ſteal away our Hearts from Jeſus Chriſt.

Once more—Perſons that are married take one another for <hi>better or for worſe,</hi> for richer or for poorer, to love and to cheriſh each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Sickneſs and in Health.—And if we are married to Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wear his <hi>Croſs,</hi> as well as bear his <hi>Crown—If any Man,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>will come after me, let him deny himſelf, take up his Croſs and follow me.</hi>—Neither will they be compelled to do this, as <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was, but they will be Voluntiers in his Service, they will cry out, <hi>Crown him, Crown him,</hi> when others are crying out, <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him.</hi>—They will never leave or forſake him, but willingly follow the Captain of their Salvation, tho' it be thro' a Sea of Blood.—</p>

            <p>VARIOUS are the Pleas and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which Men of corrupt Minds frequently urge againſt yielding Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the juſt and holy Commands of God—But perhaps, one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objections that they make is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Lord's Commands are not practicable, becauſe contrary to Fleſh and Blood; and conſequently, that he is an hard Maſter, <hi>reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he has not ſown, and gathering where he has not ſtrawed</hi>—Theſe we find were the Sentiments that were entertained by that wicked and ſlothful Servant mentioned in the 25th of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> and are undoubtedly the ſame with many which obtain in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent wicked and adulterous Generation—The Holy Ghoſt foreſeeing this, hath taken care

to inſpire holy Men of Old, to record the Examples of many holy Men and Women; who, even under the Old Teſtament Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, were enabled chearfully to take Chriſt's Yoak upon them, and counted his Service perfect Freedom.—The large Catalogue of Saints, Confeſſors, and Martyrs, drawn up in the 11th Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> abundantly evidences the Truth of this Obſervation—What a great Cloud of Witneſſes have we there preſented to our View?

<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005885_0113_10275E9094EE94E0"/>
I mean, <hi>Walking with God—And Enoch wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with God</hi>—If ſo much as this can be truly ſaid of you and me after our Deceaſe, we ſhall not have any Reaſon to complain, that we have lived in vain.—</p>
            <p>In handling my intended Subject, I ſhall, <hi>Firſt,</hi> endeavour to ſhew, what is implied in theſe Words, <hi>Walked with God—Secondly,</hi> I ſhall preſcribe ſome Means, upon the due Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of which, Believers may keep up and maintain their <hi>Walk with God</hi>—And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Offer ſome Motives to ſtir us up, if we never walked with God before, to come and walk with God now—The Whole ſhall be cloſed with a Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or two of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.—</p>

            <p>And, <hi>Firſt, Walking with God,</hi> implies, that the prevailing Power of the Enmity of a Perſon's Heart, be taken away by the bleſſed Spirit of God.—Perhaps it may ſeem a hard Saying to ſome, but our own Experience daily proves what the Scriptures in many Places aſſert, that the carnal Mind, the Mind of the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, natural Man, nay, the Mind of the Regenerate, ſo far as any Part of him remains

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Believers keep up and maintain their Walk with God by ſecret Prayer—The Spirit of Grace is always accompanied with the Spirit of Supplication—It is the very Breath of the New-Creature, the Fan of the divine Life, whereby the Spark of holy Fire kindled in the Soul by God, is not only kept in, but raiſed into a Flame—A Neglect of ſecret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, has been frequently an Inlet to many ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Diſeaſes, and has been attended with fatal Conſequences.—<hi>Origen</hi> obſerved, <q>That the Day he offered Incenſe to an Idol, he went out of his Cloſet without making uſe of ſecret Prayer</q>—It is one of the Moſt noble Parts of the Believer's ſpiritual Armour—<hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>with all Manner of Supplication—And watch and pray,</hi> ſays our Lord, <hi>that ye enter not into Temptation</hi>—And he ſpake a Parable, that his Diſciples ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

have us always upon our Knees, or in our Cloſets, to the Neglect of our other relative Duties—But he means that our Souls ſhould be kept in a Praying-Frame, ſo that we might be able to ſay, as a good Man in <hi>Scotland</hi> once ſaid to his Friends on a Death-bed, <q>Could theſe Curtains, or could theſe Walls ſpeak, they would tell you what ſweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have had with my God here.</q>—Oh Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Prayer! It brings and keeps God and Man toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—It raiſes Man up to God, and brings God down to Man.—If you wou'd therefore, O Believers, keep up your Walk with God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pray, Pray without ceaſing—Be much in ſecret, ſet Prayer—And when you are about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Buſineſs of Life, be much in ejaculatory Prayer, and ſend, from time to time, ſhort Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters poſt to Heaven upon the Wings of Faith—They will reach the very Heart of God, and return to you again loaded with ſpiritual Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>Holy and frequent Meditation is another bleſſed Means of keeping up a Believer's Walk with God—<q>Prayer, Reading, Temptation, and Meditation, ſays <hi>Luther,</hi> make a Miniſter</q>—And they alſo make, and keep a Chriſtian—Meditation to the Soul, is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:005885_0124_1026E4D32FB74560"/>
the Fields to meditate in the Evening; or as it is in the Margin to pray—For Meditation is a Kind of ſilent Prayer, whereby the Soul is frequently, as it were, carried out of it ſelf to God, and in a Degree made like unto thoſe bleſſed Spirits, who by a Kind of immediate Intuition always behold the Face of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father—None but thoſe happy Souls that have been accuſtomed to this divine Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, can tell what a bleſſed Promoter of the divine Life Meditation is—<hi>Whilſt I was Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> ſays <hi>David; the Fire kindled</hi>—And whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Believers keep up their Walk with God, by watching and noting his providential Dealings with them—If we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we muſt believe what our Lord hath declared therein, <hi>viz.

               </gap> Idols:" If Proſperous, he does as it were by a ſmall, ſtill Voice, ſay, "My Son, give me thy Heart"—If Believers therefore wou'd keep up their Walk with God, they muſt from time to time hear what the Lord has to ſay concerning them in the Voice of his Providence—Thus we find <hi>Abraham'</hi>s Servant, when he went to fetch a Wife for his Maſter <hi>Iſaac,</hi> eyed and watched the Providence of God, and by that Means found out the Perſon that was deſign'd for his Maſter's Wife—"For a little Hint from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence," ſays pious Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> 
               <q>is enough for Faith to feed upon.</q>—And as I believe it will be one Part of our Happineſs in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to take a View of, and look back upon, the various Links of the Golden-Chain which drew us there; ſo thoſe that enjoy moſt of Heaven below, I believe will be moſt minute in remarking God's various Dealings with them, in reſpect to his providential Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations here on Earth.—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In order to walk cloſely with God, his Children muſt not only watch the Motions
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005885_0126_10275EA9C6A72BB8"/>
of God's Providence without them, but the Motions alſo of his bleſſed Spirit in their Hearts—As many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God, and give up themſelves to be guided by the Holy Ghoſt, as a little Child gives its Hand to be led by a Nurſe or Parent. It is no doubt in this Senſe, that we are to be converted, and become like <hi>little Children</hi>—And tho' it is the Quinteſcence of Enthuſiaſm, to pretend to be guided by the Spirit without the written Word; yet it is every Chriſtian's bounden Duty to be guided by the Spirit, in Conjunction with the written Word of God—Watch therefore, I pray you, O Believers, the Motions of God's bleſſed Spirit in your Souls, and always try the Suggeſtions or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that you may at any time feel, by the unerring Rule of God's moſt holy Word—And if they are not found to be agreeable to that, reject them as diabolical and deluſive—By ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this Caution, you will ſteer a middle Courſe between the two dangerous Extremes many of this Generation are in Danger of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into; I mean, Enthuſiaſm, on the one Hand, and Deiſm, and downright Infidelity, on the other.—</p>

of our own Times, I believe we ſhall find, that as the Power of God prevails, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies, and Fellowſhip Meetings, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail proportionably—And as one decays, the other has inſenſibly decayed and dwindled away at the ſame Time—So neceſſary is it for thoſe that wou'd Walk with God, and keep up the Life of Religion, to meet together as they have Opportunity, in order to provoke one another to Love and good Works.—</p>
            <p>Proceed we now to the <hi>third</hi> general Thing propoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To offer ſome Motives to excite all to come and <hi>walk with God.</hi>—</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Walking with God is a very honourable Thing—This generally is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Motive to Perſons of all Ranks, to ſtir them up to any important Undertaking—Oh that it may have its due Weight and Influence with you, in reſpect to the Matter now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us!

Think ye it a ſmall Thing, Sirs, to have the Secret of the Lord of Lords with you, and to be called the Friends of God? And ſuch Honour have all God's Saints: <hi>The Secret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> and <hi>Henceforth,</hi> ſays the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus, <hi>call I you no longer Servants, but Friends; for the Servant knoweth not the Will of his Maſter.</hi>—Whatever you may

think of it, holy <hi>David</hi> was ſo ſenſible of the Honour attending a Walk with God, that he declares he <hi>had rather be a Door-keeper in his Houſe, than to dwell even in the Tents of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs</hi>—Oh that all were like-minded with him!—</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> As it is an honourable, ſo it is a pleaſing Thing to walk with God—The wiſeſt of Men has told us, that <hi>Wiſdom's Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and all her Paths P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hould or could have enjoyed in the Ways of Sin, tho' I had continued to have went on in them for Thouſands of Years—And may I not appeal to all you that fear and walk with God, for the Truth of this? Has not one Day in the Lord's Courts, been better than a Thouſand? In keeping God's Commandments, Have you not found a Preſent and very great Reward? Has not his Word been ſweeter to you than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or the Honey-comb? Oh what have
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005885_0131_10275EB8AADE9048"/>
you felt, when <hi>Jacob</hi>-like you have been wreſtling with your God? Has not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus often met you when meditating in the Fields, and been made known to you over and over again in Breaking of Bread? Has not the Holy Ghoſt frequently ſhed the divine Love abroad in your Hearts abundantly, and filled you with Joy unſpeakable, even Joy that is full of Glory? I know you will anſwer all theſe Queſtions in the Affirmative, and freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the <hi>Yoak</hi> of Chriſt to be <hi>eaſy,</hi> and <hi>his Burden light;</hi> or (to uſe the Words of one of our Collects) <q>That his Service is perfect Freedom</q>—And what need we then any further Motive to excite us to walk with God?</p>
            <p>But, methinks, I hear ſome among you ſay, <q>How can theſe Things be? For, if Walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, as you ſay, is ſuch an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and pleaſant Thing, whence is it, that the Name of the People of this Way is caſt out as Evil, and every where ſpoken againſt? How comes it to paſs that they are frequently afflicted, tempted, deſtitute, and tormented? Is this the Honour, this the Pleaſure that you ſpeak of?</q> I Anſwer, Yes. Stop a while, be not over-haſty, Judge not according to Appearance, but Judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment, and all will be well—It is true, we acknowledge the People of this Way, as you and <hi>Paul</hi> before you, when a Perſecutor called them, have their Names eaſt out as

Evil, and are a Sect every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt—But by whom? Even by the Enemies of the moſt High God—And do you think it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Diſgrace to be ſpoken Evil of then by them? Bleſſed be God we have not ſo learnt Chriſt—Our Royal Maſter has pronounced thoſe <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> who are <hi>Perſecuted, and have all Manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>here be a greater Honour put upon a Creature, than to be conformed to the ever-bleſſed Son of God? And further, it is equally true, that the People of this Way are frequently afflicted, tempted, deſtitute and tormented. But what of all this? Does this deſtroy the Pleaſure of Walking with God? No, in no wiſe—For thoſe that walk with God, are enabled, thro' Chriſt ſtrengthening them, to joy even in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation, and to rejoice when they fall into divers Temptations.—And I believe I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Experience of all true and cloſe Walkers with God, Whether or not their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Times, have not frequently been their ſweeteſt Times, and they enjoyed moſt of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when moſt caſt out and deſpiſed by Men? This we find was the Caſe of Chriſt's primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Servants, when threatened by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>

<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005885_0133_10275EBEA82BAD18"/>
in the Name of Jeſus, they rejoiced, that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer Shame for the Sake of Jeſus—<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang Praiſes even in a Dungeon—And the Face of <hi>Stephen,</hi> that glorious Proto-Martyr of the Chriſtian Church, ſhone like the Face of an Angel—And Jeſus is the ſame now, as he was then, and takes care ſo to ſweeten Sufferings and Afflictions with his Love, that his Diſciples find, by happy Experience, that as Afflictions abound, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations do much more abound.—And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Objections, in ſtead of deſtroying, do only more enforce the Motives before urged to excite you to walk with God.—</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing the Objections were juſt, and Walkers with God were as deſpicable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as you would repreſent them to be; yet I have a third Motive to offer, which, if weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, will over-weigh all Objections, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Heaven at the End of this Walk—For to uſe the Words of pious Biſhop <hi>Beveridge,</hi> 
               <q>Tho' the Way be narrow, yet it is not long; and tho' the Gate be ſtrait, yet it opens into everlaſting Life</q>—<hi>Enoch</hi> found it ſo—He walked with God on Earth, and God took him to ſit down with him for ever in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—Not that we are to expect to be taken away as he was—No—I ſuppoſe we ſhall all die the common Death of all Men—But after Death, the Spirits of thoſe that have walked

            <p>The Evangeliſt in the firſt Verſe, makes mention of the Sickneſs of <hi>Lazarus—Now,</hi> ſays he, <hi>a certain Man was ſick, named Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus of Bethany, the Town of Mary, and her Siſter Martha.</hi> Some think theſe Siſters were very wealthy, ſo as to own good Part of the Town; or as the original Word ſeems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the Village—But then it is probable the Evangeliſt wou'd have ſaid the Town of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> Eſtates uſually deſcending, as with us, in the Male Line: It means therefore no more, than that <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> lived in <hi>Bethany</hi>—The Holy Ghoſt pointing out to us hereby,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005885_0142_10275ED989298908"/>
that nothing makes a Town ſo worthy of gracious Soul's Remark or Eſteem, as its hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of God's dear Children for its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants!—<hi>Bethany,</hi> tho' a little Place, is more famous becauſe it was the Town of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> than if <hi>Alexander</hi> had fought in it one of his greateſt Battles—Both theſe Women loved Jeſus in Sincerity, and were as good as they were great—But <hi>Mary,</hi> tho the younger Siſter, ſeems to be moſt eminent—The Evangeliſt in the ſecond Verſe, ſpeaks of her in a very diſtinguiſhing Manner—<hi>It was that Mary,</hi> that never-to-be-forgotten <hi>Mary, which anointed the Lord with Ointment</hi> (expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as it was) and wiped his Feet, after ſhe had waſhed them with Tears of Love, <hi>with her Hair,</hi> even the Hair of her Head—What Notice is taken of this Action!

And with what a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Confidence may we pray to, and intercede with the holy Jeſus, when we have Reaſon to hope, that thoſe we pray and intercede for, are Lovers of, and are beloved of <hi>Him!</hi> For his Eyes are in a peculiar Manner over the Righteous, and his Ears always open to their Prayers—This was their Meſſage, and it ſoon reached Jeſus Chriſt—And how does he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it? We are told, Verſe 4. <hi>For when Jeſus heard that, viz.</hi> That he whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was ſick, <hi>He ſaid this Sickneſs is not unto Death, but unto the Glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby</hi>—To whom theſe Words were ſpoken is not certain—In all Probability Jeſus ſpake them to the Perſons that deliver'd <hi>Martha'</hi>s and <hi>Mary'</hi>s Meſſage—And if ſo, it was no Doubt a comfortable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the preſent, tho' it muſt afterwards puzzle them as well as the Diſciples how to explain it, when they found that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was actually dead. <hi>This Sickneſs is not unto Death, i. e.</hi> Not unto an <hi>abiding</hi> Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he intended to raiſe him again, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Deceaſe—It is like that other Expreſſion of our Lord in St. <hi>Mark, The Damſel is not

But ſurely if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus loves this dear little Family, the next News one wou'd think we ſhou'd hear, would be, that he went immediatly and healed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus;</hi> or at leaſt, cured him at a Diſtance—But inſtead of that, we are told, Verſe 6. <hi>When he had heard that he was ſick, he abode two Days ſtill in the ſame Place where he was</hi>—A ſtrange Way this, in the Eye of natural Reaſon, of expreſſing Love; but not ſo ſtrange in the Eye of Faith—For the Lord Jeſus very often ſheweth his Love, by defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to give immediate Anſwers to our Prayers—For hereby he tries our Faith and Patience, and exerciſes all our paſſive Graces—We have a Proof of this in the <hi>Syrophenician</hi> Woman, upon whom the bleſſed Jeſus frowned, and ſpake roughly too at firſt, only that he might afterwards turn unto her and ſay, <hi>O Woman, great is thy Faith</hi>—Let not thoſe then that

God—No one can come to Jeſus unleſs the Father draw him—And therefore, that I may draw near the Cloſe of this Diſcourſe, let me ſhut up all with a Word of Exhortation.—Come then, ye dead, Chriſtleſs, unconverted Sinners, come and ſee the Place where they laid the Body of deceaſed <hi>Lazarus</hi>—Behold him dead and laid out, bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths, lock'd up and ſtinking in a dark Cave, with a great Stone placed on the Top of it!—View him again and again—Go nearer to him—Be not afraid—Smell him, and ſee how he ſtinketh—Stop there now, and pauſe a while; and whilſt thou art gazing, O Man, upon the Corpſe of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> give me leave to tell thee with great Plainneſs, but greater Love, that this dead, bound, entombed, ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carcaſe, is but a faint Repreſentation of thy poor Soul in its natural State—For whether thou believeſt it or not, thy Spirit which thou beareſt about with thee, ſepulchred in Fleſh and Blood, is as literally dead to God, and as truly dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, as the Body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in the Cave—Was he bound Hand and Foot with Grave-cloaths? So art thou bound Hand and Foot with thy Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—And as a Stone was laid on the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, ſo is there a Stone of Unbelief laid upon thy ſtupid Heart—Perhaps thou haſt lain in this State, not only four Days, but many Years, ſtinking in God's Noſtrils!—And what

is ſtill more affecting, thou art juſt as unable to raiſe thy ſelf out of this loathſome, dead State, to a Life of Righteouſneſs and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as ever <hi>Lazarus</hi> was to raiſe himſelf from the Cave in which he lay ſo long—Thou mayeſt try the Power of thy own boaſted Free-Will, and the Force and Energy of Moral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion and rational Arguments (which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Doubt, have their proper Place in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) but all thy Efforts, exerted with never ſo much Vigour, will prove quite fruitleſs and abortive, till that ſame Jeſus who ſaid, <hi>take away the Stone,</hi> and cried, <hi>Lazarns come forth,</hi> comes by his mighty Power, removes the Stone of Unbelief, ſpeaks Life into thy dead Soul, looſes thee from the Fetters of thy Sins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and by the Influences of his bleſſed Spirit, enables thee to go and walk in the Way of his holy <hi>Commandments</hi>—And Oh that he wou'd now rend the Heavens, and come down amongſt you! Oh that there may be a Stirring among the dry Bones this Day! Oh that whilſt I am ſpeaking and ſaying, <hi>dead Sinners, come forth,</hi> a Power, even an Almighty Power, might accompany the Word, and cauſe you to emerge and awaken into new Life! And if the Lord ſhou'd vouchſafe me ſuch a Mercy, and but one ſingle Soul in this great Congregation, ſhould ariſe and ſhake himſelf from the Duſt of his natural State, I think, according to the preſent Frame of
