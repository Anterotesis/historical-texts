            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ALTHO' the following Account of what GOD has done for my Soul, will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, be differently judged of, by different People; yet, as, I truſt, a ſingle Eye to</hi> GOD'S <hi>Glory moved me to write, and as I find myſelf much preſſed in Spirit to publiſh it, I am not in the leaſt ſolicitous about the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it will meet with in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Benefit I have received from Reading the Lives of good Men; the Examples we have in Scripture of the Sacred Authors compoſing their own Hiſtories; and, more eſpecially the Aſſiſtances I have received from the</hi> Holy Spirit, <hi>in bringing many Things to my Remembrance, which otherwiſe I ſhould have forgotten, ſeemed to me Reaſons ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to juſtify my Conduct, in the Sight of GOD and all good Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further, As GOD has been pleaſed of late to call me to a</hi> Publick Work, <hi>I thought his Children would be glad to know how I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

my Death, or wrote by ſome other Perſon; yet, I thought it would be more beneficial, and be better credited, if wrote with my own Hand, and publiſhed whilſt I was yet alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Accounts of good Men, which I have read, I have obſerved, that the Writers of them have been partial: They have given us the</hi> bright, <hi>but not the</hi> black <hi>Side of their Characters. This, I think, proceeds from carnal Reaſoning, leſt mentioning the Perſon's Faults ſhould encourage others in Sin. It cannot, I am ſure, proceed from that Wiſdom which cometh from above. The ſacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters give an Account of their Failings, as well as their Virtues:</hi> Peter <hi>is not aſhamed to confeſs, that with Oaths and Curſes he thrice denied his Maſter; nor do the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts make any Scruple of telling, that out of</hi> Mary Magdalen JESUS CHRIST <hi>caſt ſeven Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I fearing, therefore, leſt my ſurviving Friends ſhould not be thus impartial in giving an Account of me, was reſolved (among other Reaſons) to give the following Account of myſelf, that thoſe who now have my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too much in Admiration, ſeeing what once I was, may learn not to think more highly of me than they ought to think: That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> WAS born in <hi>Glouceſter</hi> in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> 1714. My Father and Mother kept the <hi>Bell-Inn:</hi> The former died when I was two Years old, the latter is now alive; and has often told me, how ſhe endured fourteen Weeks Sickneſs after ſhe brought me into the World; but was uſed to ſay, even when I was an Infant, that ſhe expected more Comfort from me than any other of her Children. This, with the Circumſtance of my being born in an Inn, has been often of Service to me, in exciting me to make good my Mother's
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004626_0006_100D867D64CE39D8"/>
Expectations; and to follow the Example of my dear Saviour, who was born in a Stable, and laid in a Manger belonging to an Inn.</p>
               <p>My very infant Years muſt neceſſarily not be mentioned: Yet I can remember ſuch early Stirrings of Corruption in my Heart, as abundantly convince me, that <hi>I was conceived and born in Sin;</hi> that in me dwelleth no good Thing by Nature; and, that if GOD had not freely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me by his Grace, I muſt have been forever baniſhed from his divine Preſence.</p>
               <p>I can truly ſay, I was froward from my Mother's Womb: I was ſo brutiſh as to hate Inſtruction, and uſed purpoſely to ſhun all Opportunities of receiving it. I can date ſome very early Acts of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I ſoon gave pregnant Proofs of an impudent Temper. Lying, filthy Talking, and fooliſh Jeſting, I was much addicted to, even when very young. Sometimes I uſed to Curſe, if not Swear. Stealing from my Mother I thought no Theft at all, and therefore uſed to make no Scruple of Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money out of her Pocket before ſhe was up; and have more than once ſpent Money I took in the Houſe in buying Fruits, Tarts, &amp;c. to ſatisfy my ſenſual Appetite. I was never much given to Fighting; but that, I fear, rather proceeded
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004626_0007_100D86822CC79F80"/>
from Cowardice, than a Principle of Meekneſs, or a good Temper. Numbers of <hi>Sabbaths</hi> have I broken; and generally uſed to behave myſelf very irreverently in GOD's <hi>Sanctuaries.</hi> Much Money have I ſpent in Plays, and in the common En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of the Age. Cards, and Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Romances were my Heart's Delight. Often have I joined with others in Playing roguiſh Tricks; but was generally, if not always, happily detected; for which I have often ſince, and do now, praiſe GOD.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to recount the Sins and Offences of my younger Days; they are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head; my Heart would fail me at the Remembrance of them, was I not aſſured that my Redeemer liveth ever to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for me. However the young Man in the Goſpel might boaſt, that he had <hi>kept,</hi> yet (with Shame and Confuſion of Face) I confeſs, that all GOD's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments I have <hi>broken</hi> from my Youth. Whatever foreſeen Fitneſs others may boaſt of for Salvation (if I trace myſelf from my Cradle to my Manhood) I can ſee nothing in me but a Fitneſs to be damned. And, if GOD had not quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me by his Free Spirit when dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, and irreſiſtibly worked upon my Soul, I had now either been ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

                  </gap> Torments.</p>
               <p>But, ſuch was the Free Grace of GOD to me, that tho' Corruption worked ſo ſtrongly in my Soul, and produced ſuch early and bitter Fruits; yet, I can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect very early Movings of the Bleſſed Spirit upon my Heart, ſufficient to ſatisfy me that GOD loved me with an everlaſting Love, and ſeparated me (even from my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Womb) for the Work to which he afterwards was pleaſed to call me.</p>
               <p>I had early ſome Convictions of Sin; and once, I remember, when Perſons (as they frequently did) made it their Buſineſs to tantalize me, I immediately retired to my Room and kneeled down, and with many Tears, prayed over that Pſalm wherein <hi>David</hi> ſo often repeats theſe Words, <hi>But in the Name of the LORD will I deſtroy them.</hi> I was always fond of being a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman; I uſed frequently to imitate the Miniſter's Reading Prayers, and to make little Sermons in little Books about as long as my Finger. Part of the Money I uſed to ſteal from my Parents, I gave to the Poor, and ſome Books I privately took from others (for which I have ſince returned Four-fold) I remember were Books of Devotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004626_0009_100D8688687E7868"/>
My Mother was very careful of my Education, put me out to two different Schools to board, and always kept me in my tender Years (for which I can never ſufficiently thank her) from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling in the leaſt with publick Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>About the tenth Year of my Age, it pleaſed GOD to permit my Mother to marry a ſecond Time. It proved what the World would call an unhappy Match, as to temporal Things; but GOD over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it for Good. It ſet many of my Brethren upon thinking more than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have done, and made an uncommon Impreſſion upon my own Heart in particular.</p>
               <p>When I was about Twelve, I was placed at a School called <hi>St. Mary de Cryps,</hi> in <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the laſt G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> School I ever went to. Having a good Elocution and Memory, I was remark'd for my making Speeches before the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration at their annual Viſitations: But I cannot ſay I felt any Drawings of GOD upon my Soul, for a Year or two, ſaving, that I laid out ſome of the Money, that was given me on one of the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Occaſions, in Buying <hi>Ken's Manual for Wincheſter Scholars,</hi> a Book that had much affected me, when my Brother uſed

Before I was Fifteen, having, as I thought, made a ſufficient Progreſs in the Claſſicks, and ſecretly longing to be ſet at Liberty from the Confinement of a School, I one Day told my Mother, ſince her Circumſtances would not permit to give me an Univerſity Education, more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I thought, would ſpoil me for a Tradeſman; and therefore I judg'd it beſt, not to learn Latin any longer. She at firſt refuſed to conſent; but my Corruption ſoon got the better of her good Nature. Hereupon, for ſome Time, I went to learn to write only. But my Mother's Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being much on the Decline, and I being tractable that Way, I from Time to Time, began to aſſiſt her occaſionally in the Publick Houſe, till at length, I put on my blue Apron and my Snuffers, waſh'd Mops, clean'd Rooms, and, in one Word, became a profeſſed and common Drawer for near a Year and an half.</p>
               <p>But he, who was with <hi>David</hi> when he was following the Sheep big with young, was with me even here. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I was thus employed in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Inn, and had ſometimes the Care of the whole Houſe upon my Hands; yet I compoſed two or three Sermons, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004626_0012_100D86936B787AA0"/>
I was much preſſed to Self-Examination, and found myſelf very unwilling, at firſt, to look into my Heart. And when a dear Youth (now with GOD) would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten come intreating me, when ſerving at the Bar, to go to <hi>Oxon;</hi> my general An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>I wiſh I could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And He, that has promiſed to fulfil the Deſires of them that fear him, was pleaſed to fulfil this Deſire his holy Spirit had put into my Heart.</p>
               <p>When I had been employed above a Year in this ſervile Manner, my Mother was obliged to leave the Inn. My Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who had been bred up for the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, married. All was made over to him. I being accuſtom'd to the Houſe, it was agreed on all Hands, that I ſhould continue there as an Aſſiſtant. But GOD's Thoughts were not as our Thoughts; by his good Providence it happened, that my Siſter-in-Law and I could by no Means agree; and at length the Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment grew to ſuch an Height, that my proud Heart would ſcarce ſuffer me to ſpeak to her for three Weeks together: But, notwithſtanding I was much to blame, yet I uſed to retire and weep, as <hi>Hagar</hi> did before the LORD, little think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that GOD, by this Means, was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me out of the Publick-Buſineſs, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004626_0013_100D86958A965B90"/>
calling me from drawing Wine for Drunkards, to draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation, for the Refreſhment of his ſpiritual <hi>Iſrael.</hi> After continuing a long Time under this Burden of Mind, I at length reſolved, thinking my Abſence would make all Things eaſy, to go away: Accordingly, by the Advice of my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Conſent of my Mother, I went to ſee my elder Brother, then ſettled at <hi>Briſtol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here GOD was pleaſed to give me great Foretaſtes of his Love, and filled me with ſuch unſpeakable Raptures in <hi>St. John'</hi>s Church, that I was carried out even beyond myſelf. I felt great Hungrings and Thirſtings after the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wrote many pious Letters to my Mother, telling her, I would never go into the publick Employ again. <hi>Kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis</hi> was my great Delight, and I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways impatient, till the Bell rung to call me to tread the Courts of the LORD'S Houſe: But, in the Midſt of theſe Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, ſomething ſecretly whiſper'd, this would not laſt.</p>
               <p>And indeed ſo it happened: For (Oh that I could write it in Tears of Blood!) when I left <hi>Briſtol</hi> (as I did in about two Months) and returned to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> I changed my Devotion with my Place.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004626_0014_100D869A82235148"/>
Alas, all my Fervour went off! I had no Inclination to go to Church or draw nigh unto GOD. In ſhort, my Heart (tho' I had ſo lately taſted of his Love) was far from him.</p>
               <p>However, I had ſo much Religion left, as to perſiſt in my Reſolution not to live in the Inn: And therefore my Mother gave me leave, tho' ſhe had but a little Income, to have a Bed upon the Ground, and live at her Houſe, till Providence ſhould point out a Place for me.</p>
               <p>Having now, as I thought, Nothing to do, it was a proper Seaſon for Satan to tempt me. Much of my Time I ſpent in reading Plays, and in ſaunt'ring from Place to Place. I was careful to adorn my Body, but took little Pains to deck and beautify my Soul. Evil Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, with my old School-Fellows, ſoon corrupted my good Manners. By ſeeing their evil Practices, a Senſe of the divine Preſence and paſt Convictions inſenſibly wore off my Mind; and I at length fell ſecretly into a Sin, for which <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Grace.</hi> He ſaw me, with Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, when lying in my Blood. He paſſed by me; He ſaid unto me, LIVE; and even then gave me ſome Foreſight of his Providing for me.</p>
               <p>One Morning, as I was reading a Play to my Siſter, ſaid I, <hi>Siſter, I believe GOD intends Something for me, which we know not of. As I have been diligent in Buſineſs, I believe many would gladly have me for an Apprentice; but every Way ſeems to be barr'd up, ſo that GOD, I think, will provide for me ſome Way or other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How I came to ſay theſe Words, I know not. GOD afterwards ſhewed me they came from him; for, having lived thus with my Mother for a conſiderable time, a young Student, who was once a School-Fellow, and then a Servitor of <hi>Pembroke-College, Oxon,</hi> came to pay my Mother a Viſit. Among other Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he told her, how he had diſcharged all College Expences that Quarter, and received a Penny. Upon this, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately cried out, <hi>That will do for me.</hi> Then turning to me, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Will you go to</hi> Oxford, George? <hi>Yes,</hi> I replied, <hi>with all my Heart.</hi> Whereupon, having the ſame Friends as this Student had, my Mother, without Delay, waited upon them. They promiſed their Intereſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004626_0016_100D86A383139518"/>
to get me a Servitor's Place in the ſame College. She then applied to my old Maſter, who much approv'd of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to School again.</p>
               <p>In about a Week I went and re-enter'd myſelf, and being grown pretty much in Stature, my Maſter addreſſed me thus, <hi>I ſee</hi> George, <hi>you are advanced in Stature, but your better Part muſt needs have gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> This made me bluſh. He ſet me a proper Theme to tranſlate into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; and tho' I had made no Application to my Claſſicks for ſo long a Time, yet I had but one inconſiderable Fault in my Exerciſe. This, I believe, ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized my Maſter, and has afforded me Matter of Praiſe and Thanks ever ſince.</p>
               <p>Being re-ſettled at School, I ſpared no Pains to go forward in my Book. GOD was pleaſed to give me his Bleſſing; and I learnt much faſter than ever I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>All this while I continued in ſecret Sin; and at length got acquainted with a Set of ſuch debauched, abandoned, atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Youths, that if GOD, by his free, unmerited, diſtinguiſhing Grace, had not delivered me out of their Hands, I ſhould, long ſince, have ſat in the Scorner's Chair, My Thoughts of Religion, inſenſibly grew more and more lax. I went to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004626_0017_100D86A60AB3DE40"/>
publick Service only to make Game and walk about. I took Pleaſure in their lewd Converſation. I began to reaſon, as they did; and to aſk, Why GOD had given me Paſſions, and not permitted me to gratify them? Not conſidering, that GOD did not, originally, give us theſe corrupt Paſſions; and that he had promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Help to withſtand them, if we would aſk it of him. In ſhort, I ſoon made a great Proficiency in the School of the Devil. I affected to look rakiſh, and was in a fair Way of being as infamous as the worſt of them.</p>
               <p>But (Oh ſtupendous Love!) GOD even here ſtopped me, when running on in a full Career to Hell. For, juſt as I was upon the Brink of Ruin, he gave me ſuch a Diſtaſte of their Principles and Practices, that I diſcovered them to my Maſter, who ſoon put a Stop to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>Being thus delivered out of the Snares of the Devil, I began to be more and more ſerious; and felt GOD convicting and working upon my Soul in ſome ſmall Degree. One Day, as I was coming down Stairs, and overheard my Friends ſpeaking well of me, GOD ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed me of my Hypocriſy, that tho' I had formed frequent, but ineffectual Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions

               <p>Being now near the Seventeenth Year of my Age, I was reſolved to prepare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the Holy Sacrament; which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on Chriſtmas-Day. I began now to be more and more watchful over my Thoughts, Words and Actions: I kept the following Lent, Faſting <hi>Wedneſdays</hi> and <hi>Fridays,</hi> thirty ſix Hours together. My Evenings (when I had done waiting upon my Mother) were generally ſpent in Acts of Devotion, reading <hi>Drelincourt</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Death, and other practical Books; and I conſtantly went to publick Worſhip twice a Day.

                  <hi>abſolute</hi> Unlawfulneſs of Playing Cards, Reading and Seeing Plays; tho' I begun to have ſome Scruples about them.</p>
               <p>Near this Time I dream'd, That <hi>I was to ſee</hi> GOD <hi>on Mount</hi> Sinai; <hi>but was afraid to meet him.</hi> This made a great Impreſſion upon me: A Gentlewoman to whom I told it, ſaid, George <hi>this is a Call from</hi> GOD.</p>
               <p>Still I grew more ſerious after this Dream; but yet Hypocriſy crept into every Action. As once I affected to look more Rakiſh, I now ſtrove to appear more Grave than really I was. However, an uncommon Concern and Alteration were viſible in my Behaviour. I often uſed to find fault with the Lightneſs of others, and ſometimes took upon me to reprove my elder Brethren.</p>
               <p>Not long after, as I was going one Night on an Errand for my Mother, an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, but very ſtrong Impreſſion was made upon my Heart, that I ſhould <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>print</hi> quickly. When I came home I innocently told my Mother what had befallen me: But ſhe (like <hi>Joſeph'</hi>s Parents, when he told them his Dream) turning ſhort upon me, cried out, <hi>What does the Boy mean?

For a Twelve-Month I went on in a Round of Duties, receiving the Sacrament monthly, Faſting frequently, attending conſtantly on publick Worſhip, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often more than twice a Day in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. One of my Brothers uſed to tell me, he fear'd this would not hold long, and that I would forget all when I came to <hi>Oxford.</hi> This Caution did me much Service; it fet me upon Praying to GOD for Perſeverance: And, under GOD, the Preparation I made in the Country was an excellent Preſervative againſt thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Temptations which beſet me at my firſt coming to that Seat of Learning.</p>
               <p>Being near Eighteen, it was judged a proper Time for my going to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. GOD had ſweetly prepared my Way. The Friends before applied to, recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to the Maſter of <hi>Pembroke-College;</hi> another Friend took up <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> upon Bond (which I have ſince paid) to defray the firſt Expences of Entering; and the Maſter (contrary to all Expectations) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me Servitor immediately.</p>
               <p>Soon after my Admiſſion, I went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide (and found my being) at a Publick Houſe was of Service to me: For, all the Servitors being ſick at my firſt coming up, by my diligent and ſpeedy Attendance, I ingratiated myſelf into the Gentlemens
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004626_0021_100D86B46FDDEBE8"/>
Favour ſo far, that many, who had it in their own Power, choſe me to be their Servitor. This much leſſen'd my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: And, indeed, GOD was ſo good to me, that with the Profits of my Place, and ſome little Preſents made me by my kind Tutor, for almoſt the Three firſt Years, I did not put all my Relations together to above <hi>Eight Pounds</hi> Expence <hi>per Ann.</hi> And it has often grieved my Soul, to ſee ſo many young Men ſpending their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in extravagant Living, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by entirely unfitting themſelves for the Proſecution of their Studies.</p>
               <p>I had not been long here, before I found the Benefit of the Foundation I had laid in the Country for a Holy Life. I was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſolicited to join with ſeveral, who lay in the ſame Room, in their Exceſs of Riot. GOD, in anſwer to my Prayers, gave me Grace to withſtand them; and, once in particular, it being cold, my Thighs were ſo benumb'd by Sitting alone in my Study, becauſe I would not go out amongſt them, that I could ſcarce ſleep all Night. But I ſoon found the Benefit of not Yielding: For, when they perceived they could not prevail, they let me alone for a ſingular, comical Fellow.</p>
               <p>All this while I was not fully ſatisfied of the Sin of Playing at Cards, and Reading of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004626_0022_100D883C5CBD8758"/>
Plays, 'til GOD, upon a Faſt-Day, was pleaſed to convince me: For taking the Play called <hi>George Barnwell,</hi> to read a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of it to a Friend, GOD ſtruck my Heart with ſuch Power, that I was obliged to lay it down; and, bleſſed be his Name, I have never read any ſuch Book ſince.</p>
               <p>Before I went to the Univerſity, I met with Mr. Law's <hi>Serious Call to a devout Life;</hi> but had not then Money enough to purchaſe it. Soon after my coming up to the Univerſity, I ſeeing a ſmall Edition of it in a Friend's Hand, ſoon procured it. GOD worked powerfully upon my Soul, as he has ſince upon many others, by that and his other Treatiſe upon Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for which I deſire to bleſs his Holy Name.</p>

               <p>My Tutor, being a moderate Man, did not oppoſe me much; but thought, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that I went a little too far.

               </p>
               <p>Theſe, tho' little, were uſeful Tryals. They inured me to Contempt, leſſen'd Self-Love, and taught me to die daily. My inward Sufferings were of a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Nature. Satan ſeemed to have deſired me in particular, to ſift me as Wheat. GOD permitted him; for what Reaſon, I have ſeen already, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> That his future Bleſſings might not prove my Ruin.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince my firſt Awakenings to the divine Light, I felt a particular Hungring and Thirſting after the Humility of JESUS CHRIST. Night and Day I prayed to be Partaker of that Grace; imagining the Habit of Humility would be inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly infus'd into my Soul. But as <hi>Gideon</hi> taught the Men of <hi>Succoth</hi> by Thorns, ſo GOD (if I am yet in any Meaſure bleſſed with true Poverty of Spirit) taught it me by ſtrong Temptations.</p>
               <p>I obſerved before, how I uſed to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd with ſenſible Devotions. Thoſe Comforts were ſoon withdrawn, and an horrible Fearfulneſs and Dread permitted to overwhelm my Soul. One Morning, in particular, riſing from my Bed, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> an unuſual Oppreſſion and Weight upon my Breaſt, attended with inward Darkneſs.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004626_0033_100D885DA3D468B8"/>
I applied to my Friend Mr. <hi>Charles Weſley.</hi> He adviſed me to keep upon my Watch, and referr'd me to a Chapter in <hi>Kempis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſhort Time I perceived this Load gradually increaſed, till it almoſt weighed me down; and as fully convinced me, that Satan had as real a Poſſeſſion given him of my Body, as he had over <hi>Job'</hi>s. All Power of Meditating, or even Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was taken from me. My Memory quite fail'd me. My whole Soul was bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and dry; and I could fancy myſelf to be like Nothing, ſo much as a Man lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in Iron Armour.</p>
               <p>Whenever I kneeled down, I felt great Heavings in my Body; and have often prayed under the Weight of them, till the Sweat came through me. At theſe Times Satan uſed to terrify me much, and threatned to puniſh me if I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Wiles. It being my Buſineſs, as Servitor, in my Turn, to knock at the Gentlemen's Rooms by Ten at Night, to ſee who were in their Rooms, I thought the Devil would appear to me every Stair I went up; and he ſo troubled me when Play down to reſt, that for ſome Months I ſcarce ſlept above three Hours in a Night.</p>
               <p>GOD only knows how many Evenings I have lain upon my Bed, groaning under the Weight I felt, and bidding Satan

depart from me, in the Name of JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Whole Days and Weeks have I ſpent in lying proſtrate on the Ground, and begging for Freedom from thoſe proud helliſh Thoughts, which uſed to croud in upon and diſtract my Soul. But GOD made Satan drive out Satan. For theſe Thoughts and Suggeſtions raiſed ſuch a Self-Abhorrence within me, that I never ceaſed wreſtling with GOD, till he bleſſed me with a Victory over them. Self-Love, Self Will, Pride and Envy, ſo buffeted me in their Turns, that I was reſolved either to die or conquer. I wanted to ſee Sin as it was; but feared, at the ſame Time, leſt the Sight of it ſhould terrify me to Death.</p>
               <p>Whilſt my <hi>inward</hi> Man was thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, my <hi>outward</hi> Man was not unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd. I ſoon found what a Slave I had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>His main Drift now, was to lead me into a State of <hi>Quietiſm.</hi> He generally plowed with GOD'S Heifer; and when the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> put into my Heart good Thoughts or Convictions, he always drove them to Extremes. For Inſtance, being check'd, for having, out of Pride, put down in my Diary what I gave away, Satan tempted me to lay my Diary quite aſide. When <hi>Caſtaniza</hi> adviſed to talk but little, Satan ſaid I muſt not talk at all: So that I, who uſed to be moſt forward in exhorting my Companions, have ſat whole Nights without ſpeaking ſcarce any Thing. Again, when <hi>Caſtaniza</hi> told me about keeping up a ſilent Recollection to GOD, Satan told me, I muſt leave off all Forms, and not uſe my Voice in Prayer at all. The Time would fail me, was I to recount all the Inſtances, of this Kind, in which he has deceived me. But when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

being come (which is the Day the Students give up their Compoſitions) Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan (but, as I thought, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi>) told me I muſt go down in the Hall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I could not make a Theme, and ſo publickly ſuffer for my Maſter's Sake. When the Bell rung to call us, I went to open the Door to go down Stairs; but feeling ſomething give me a violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Check, I retired into my Study, and continued inſtant in Prayer, waiting the Event. My Tutor fined me Half a Crown. The next Week Satan ſerved me ſo again. But having now got more Strength, and perceiving no inward Check, I went into the Hall. My Name being called, I ſtood up, and told my Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor I could not make a Theme. I think he fined me a ſecond Time; but, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I would not wilfully neglect my Exerciſe, he afterwards called me into the common Room, and kindly inquired whether any Misfortune had befallen me, or what was the Reaſon I could not make a Theme.

               <p>Further, as I daily got Strength by continued, tho' almoſt ſilent Prayer, in my Study, my Temptations grew ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, particularly for two or three Days before Deliverance came. Near five or ſix Weeks had I now ſpent in my Study, except when I was obliged to go out. During this Time, I was battling with my Corruptions, and did little elſe beſides <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Satan began now to ſuggeſt to me that JESUS CHRIST went among the wild Beaſts when he was tempted, and that I ought to follow his Example. Whereupon, being willing to copy after JESUS CHRIST, after Supper I went into <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> walk'd near our College, and continued in ſilent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, under one of the Trees, for near two Hours ſometimes lying flat upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It being a very bluſterous, ſtormy Night, it gave me awful Thoughts of the Day of Judgment. I continued, I think, till <hi>Great Tom</hi> called me Home. And finding ſome Reluctance in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man againſt ſtaying ſo long in the Cold, when I roſe off my Knees, I fell a Rubbing my Hands, and haſted to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, ſaying theſe Words, <hi>I am but a freſh Water Soldier.</hi>

Nothing remained for me to leave (unleſs I forſook Publick Worſhip, which I believe I ſhould have done ſhortly) but my religious Friends.

               <p>During this, and all other Seaſons of Temptations, my Soul was inwardly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with great Courage and Reſolution from above.

To proceed, I had now taken up my <hi>Externals</hi> again. And tho' Satan, for ſome Weeks, had been bruiſing my Heel, GOD ſoon ſhewed me that I ſhould bruiſe his Head. A few Days after, as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along, I met a poor Woman, whoſe Huſband was then in Bocardo, <hi>Oxford</hi> Town Goal, which I conſtantly viſited. Seeing her much diſcompos'd, I enquired the Cauſe: She told me, not being able to bear the Cries of her Children, ready to periſh for Hunger, and ſhe having nothing to relieve them, ſhe had been to drown her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but was mercifully prevented; and ſaid, ſhe was coming to my Room to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me of it.

On Sunday Morning I roſe early, and prayed over St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> particularly that Precept, <hi>

                     </gap>.</hi> When I went up to the Altar, I could think of Nothing but <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtanding before the LORD with a linnen Ephod. When the Biſhop laid his Hands upon my Head, my Heart was melted down, and I offer'd up my whole Spirit, Soul and Body to the Service of GOD's Sanctuary. I read the Goſpel, at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Command, with <hi>Power;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſealed the good Confeſſion I had made before many Witneſſes, with CHRIST's moſt bleſſed Body.</p>
               <p>Being reſtrained, as was before obſerved, I could not, tho' ſollicited thereto, preach in the Afternoon; but I read Prayers to the poor Priſoners, being willing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The next Morning, waiting upon GOD in Prayer, to know what he would have me to do, theſe Words, <hi>Speak out Paul,</hi> came with great Power upon my Heart. Immediately my Heart was enlarged: GOD ſpake to me by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Freedom as tho' I had been a Preacher for ſome Years.</p>
               <p>Oh the unſpeakable Benefit of Reading to the Poor, and exerciſing our Talents while Students at the Univerſity! Such previous Acts create excellent Habits, and make young Miniſters not aukward, but apt to teach. It is remarkable our LORD ſent out his Apoſtles on ſhort Miſſions, before they were ſo ſolemnly authorized at the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt.</hi> Would Tutors of our Univerſities follow his Example, and ſend out their Pupils to viſit the Sick and the Priſoners, to pray with, and read practical Books of Piety to the Poor, they would find ſuch Exerciſes of more Service to their Pupils and the Church of GOD, than all their private and publick Lectures put together.</p>
               <p>But to come to a Concluſion. Thus GOD dealt with my Soul: And at the ſame Time he was not forgetful of my Body; for he inclined the Biſhop's Heart to give me <hi>Five</hi> Guineas more; and by this Time; Quarter's Allowance way due to me from Sir <hi>John Philips,</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Theſe Changes from a <hi>Servitor</hi> to a <hi>Batchelor of Arts,</hi> from a common <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> to a <hi>Clergyman,</hi> were great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to think more highly of myſelf than I ought to think. Some were jealous over me, as I truſt they always will be, with a godly Jealouſy. Hereby GOD, who is rich in Mercy, forwarned me of my Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſtirred up my Heart to pray againſt ſpiritual Pride, and kept me, as I hope he will unto the End, in ſome Meaſure hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Thus did GOD, through a Variety of unforeſeen Acts of <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> train me up for, and at length introduced me into the Service of his Church. What has happened to me ſince that Time, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for theſe two laſt Years paſt, is too notorious to need a Repetition. However, as I find Freedom in myſelf, and Leiſure from my miniſterial Employ, hereafter (GOD willing) I ſhall relate ſome Dealings of GOD with my Soul, and how he led me (without any Foreſight of my own) into my preſent Way of Acting.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, <hi>My dear Reader,</hi> whoever thou art, I pray GOD what I have now written may not prove a Savour of <hi>Death unto Death,</hi> but a Savour of <hi>Life</hi>
