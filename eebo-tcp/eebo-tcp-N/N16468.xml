            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

If no ſigns of life ſhould then appear, let the body be kept warm ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours longer, with hot bricks, or veſſels of hot water, applied to the palms of the hands, and ſoles of the feet, and this for a longer or ſhorter time, as the circumſtances of the caſe may dictate.</p>

            <head>THE INSTITUTION OF THE Humane Society OF THE Commonwealth of <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FROM a variety of faithful experiments, and inconteſtible facts, it is now conſidered as an eſtabliſhed truth, that the total ſuſpenſion of the vital functions in the animal body is by no means incompatible with life; and conſequently, the marks of apparent death may ſubſiſt without any neceſſary implication of an abſolute extinction of the animating principle.</p>
            <p>The boundary line between life and death, or the diſtinguiſhing ſigns of the latter, are objects to which the utmoſt efforts of the human capacity have never yet attained. Nor can we, with any degree of certainty, pronounce, that an animal is dead, until the moſt unequivocal proofs of putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction have been furniſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:021157_0004_0FB24CA579FA4130"/>From theſe facts it might reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that, were proper meaſures to be adopted, eſpecially in caſes peculiarly doubtful, we might frequently be enabled to reſtore to full life, and the enjoyment of it, a beloved friend, or a valuable member of ſociety. And indeed, numerous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful inſtances might be adduced in the caſes of perſons, who would in a few hours have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to an untimely grave; and perhaps have ſuffered all the horrors of inevitable death, attended with a conſciouſneſs of their own terrible ſituation.</p>
            <p>It is not, however, to be underſtood, that any proceſs, directed to the above-mentioned purpoſe, can be equally applicable to all caſes. For as the attempt muſt preſuppoſe an entire ſtate of the vital organs, it is obvious that thoſe apparent deaths, which are conſequent upon diſeaſe, afford, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, little or no encouragement for ſuch attempts. But in moſt caſes of ſudden death, the vital organs appear to have ſuſtained but a very ſlight injury, and only require a ſeaſonable excitement of the heart to renew their action.</p>
            <p>The exquiſite feelings attendant on the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected reſtoration of an affectionate friend, or an indulgent parent, a dutiful child, or an intimate companion of our boſoms, after having been ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly torn from us, and in imagination numbered with the dead, may be more eaſily conceived than deſcribed. Nor is the acquiſition of one deſerving member of ſociety an object unworthy the public attention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021157_0005_0FB24CAC2D052580"/>Upon theſe conſiderations, ſocieties have been formed in various parts of Europe for promoting attempts to recover perſons from apparent death, eſpecially in caſes of ſuffocation and drowning. The Humane Society eſtabliſhed in Great-Britain, in 1774. has been very ſucceſsful. Within ten years from its inſtitution, out of 1300 perſons apparently dead from drowning, 790 have been reſtored to their friends and country. Many of them, no doubt, uſeful and valuable men.</p>
            <p>For an inſtitution of this nature a conſiderable fund is neceſſary. And many occaſional expences will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably occur. The cauſe of humanity, however, deſerves every encouragement. And to promote that cauſe, it is to be hoped the benevolent will liberally ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>A Society is now formed for theſe ſalutary purpoſes in this Commonwealth: And the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plan and arrangements are ſubmitted to the inſpection of the publick.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>THOUGH the following Methods are chiefly adapted to caſes of apparent death from <hi>drowning,</hi> yet the Society think it proper to obſerve, that moſt of the means of reſtoration herein recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended are applicable to a conſiderable variety of other caſes, ſuch as hanging, convulſion fits, ſuffocation by damps, or noxious vapours, the confined air of wells, ciſterns, caves, or the muſt of fermenting liquors.—The Society have in ſome of the more eſſential articles of treatment, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the recommendations of foreign Societies of a ſimilar nature; they have however endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render them more conformable to the particular circumſtances of this country.</p>
               </argument>
               <head>METHODS of Treatment to be uſed with Perſons apparently dead from drowning.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE unfortunate perſon is to be conveyed carefully to the neareſt houſe: For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the head is to be raiſed a little, as in bed, and the body ſhould be carried in a natural and eaſy poſture.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Subject is to be immediately ſtripped, and laid on a warm bed, and the <hi>ſkin</hi> well dried with heated flannels, the mud and froth to be removed from the mouth and noſtrils; if the body was naked at the time of the accident, it is then to be ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as expeditiouſly as poſſible with a hot blanket, and thoroughly dried with coarſe cloths or flannels.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The ſmoke of tobacco thrown up the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ranked among the earlieſt applications: If a <hi>fumigator</hi> ſhould not be at hand, the common

pipe<note n="*" place="bottom">When the common Pipe is uſed, the ſmoke is to be blown with the mouth from the bowl, through the ſtem, into the fundament, covering the bowl with a handkerchief, or thin piece of linen.</note> will anſwer the purpoſe of applying this vapour to the bowels. So eaſy and important an operation ſhould be repeatedly performed, as the good effects of tobacco ſmoke have been proved in many caſes.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The ſkin is to be gently rubbed with warm woollen cloths, and a warming pan heated (the body being ſurrounded with flannel) may lightly be moved up and down the back for a conſiderable time. Wooden bottles filled with hot water, &amp;c. or <hi>heated bricks,</hi> covered with flannel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly applied to the ſoles of the feet, palms of the hands, and other parts of the body.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If a child has been drowned, its body ſhould be wiped perfectly dry, and immediately placed in bed between two perſons of good conſtitution; the ſalutary effects of the natural vital warmth have been clearly proved in a variety of ſucceſsful caſes.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. The body is to be rubbed with flannels, ſprinkled with ſpirits, and fomentations of hot rum are to be applied to the breaſt, &amp;c. and often renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The noſtrils may be every now and then tickled with a feather; <hi>ſnuff</hi> and <hi>volatiles</hi> ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally made uſe of, to excite ſneezing if poſſible. The various means of recovery ſhould be made uſe of by the <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> for ſeveral hours, the body is to be gently ſhaken every ten minutes, in order to render the proceſs more certainly ſucceſsful; and the bodies of <hi>Children</hi> in particular are to be agitated, by taking hold of their arms and legs frequently, and for a continuance of time.

agitation, in conjunction with the methods laid down, has forwarded the recovery of boys who had been drowned, and continued for a conſiderable time apparently dead.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If there be any ſigns of returning life, ſuch as ſighing, gaſping, convulſive motions, pulſation or a natural warmth, a ſponful of any warm liquid may be adminiſtered; and if it proves that the power of ſwallowing is returned, then a cordial draught may be given in ſmall quantities, but not without the direction of a Phyſician.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. When the air is very <hi>cold</hi> or <hi>moiſt,</hi> the various methods of treatment are to be made uſe of <hi>near a large fire,</hi> or in a <hi>heated</hi> apartment. On the other hand, if the weather is <hi>warm,</hi> or <hi>ſultry</hi> (as in the ſummer ſeaſon) the windows and doors of the room ſhould be opened; and in every other poſſible way a cool refreſhing air obtained; as it is of the greateſt importance in bringing forward the latent ſpark of life, or in reſtoring natural breathing.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. No perſons are to be admitted into the room, but thoſe who are actually employed in exerting their utmoſt endeavours for the recovery of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; ſix perſons are therefore the greateſt number that can ever prove uſeful on ſuch occaſions; and thoſe who are by-ſtanders for the ſake of curioſity ſhould be requeſted to withdraw, as their preſence may retard or totally prevent the reſtoration.</p>

                  <hi>CASES</hi> Wherein Perſons apparently dead have been recovered.</head>
               <p>AN ingenious and very uſeful Communication on the ſubject of <hi>Reſtoration from apparent Death,</hi> has been received from Mr. Jonathan Williams of Boſton, from which, as an encouragement for exertion in ſimilar caſes, the following facts are extracted.— A child of Mr. Williams, at that time in Nantz, at about the age of 12 days was taken ill, and on the 13th to appearance died.—Mr. Wiilliams immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to try an experiment on his child, and by gentle friction with ſoft flannel near a fire, in about fifteen minutes reſtored it to life; though being very weak from a premature birth, it lived only 20 hours longer.—Mr. Williams himſelf at the age of nine years, fell into the mill-creek—it is uncertain how long he continued under water—he was at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and taken up breathleſs; the body was placed between hot blankets and rubbed on every part with hot cloths, hot bricks were applied to the ſoles of his feet, and all the other uſual methods were employed, till every one except his mother was diſcouraged, and deſiſted from the uſe of means; ſhe alone, however, indefatigably perſevered, and was rewarded, though not until the end of four hours, with the exquiſite pleaſure of reſtoring him to life.</p>
               <p>Doctor Franklin communicated to Mr. Williams the caſe of a gentleman, who laboured under a diſeaſe which he himſelf ſuppoſed would prove mortal: When he approached the laſt agonies, his faithful ſervant was weeping by his ſide—he ordered the ſervant to watch him, and when he had breathed his laſt, to get naked into his bed, and as far as poſſible encompaſs the body; then to breathe forcibly into his mouth, and continue this act till he ſhould recover, or become cold.—He punctually obeyed; the gentleman recovered, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> the ſtory many years after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:021157_0016_0FB24CDA9FA8D008"/>Another well known inſtance is produced of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia gentleman in France, who about five years ſince was ſuppoſed to have died, and three days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was about to be buried, when a Phyſician pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent happening to look into the coffin, was induced, from the appearance of the countenance, to delay the funeral; he immediately made uſe of the common methods; the gentleman revived, and is now alive and well in Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The following caſe is extracted from a letter from Dr. Blodget, viz. That on the 4th or June 1757<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was called to the ſon of Mr. Nathaniel Gunn, jun. of Montague, who had been taken out of a Well, and was ſuppoſed to be dead. When he arrived at the houſe, he found him laid on a bed covered with a blanket, without the leaſt appearance of life either from pulſation or reſpiration. The Doctor opened a vein in the arm but could not obtain any blood; his next attempt to reſtore life was by friction, with warm flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; by perſiſting in this plan for about 15 minutes, the Boy began to grow warm, and motion was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at the pit of the ſtomach, and ſoon after a ſigh followed and a ſpoonful of water ran out of his mouth; his pulſe began to beat and reſpiration took place, and in about an hour he was able to ſit up in the bed.</p>
               <p>Thus without any other means, excepting ſome trifling cordials, he was reſtored to life and health.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gunn, upon being informed of the accident, went down the Well, perceiving the water perfectly ſtill, did not expect to find the Boy there; but plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arm into the water, which was near three feet deep, he found him laying at the bottom, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately carried him into the houſe, ſtrip'd him, and laid him on the bed as the Doctor found him.</p>
               <p>The Doctor obſerves. that "though it is impoſſible to determine how long the Boy was in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity, breathleſs, and to appearance dead; yet if we allow fifteen minutes for the Boy to be under water,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021157_0017_0FB24CDB84BCD078"/>
(and I am of opinion it was much longer) and twenty five minutes for the meſſenger to come to me, to the diſtance of four miles; and twenty five minutes for me to go to Mr. Gunns, and fifteen minutes after I got there before life appeared in the Boy, we can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for one hour and one quarter.</p>
               <p>The following communication, with which we have been favored by Mr. James Sumner, farther proves the utility of perſeverance in caſes which at firſt may appear entirely deſperate. A Lad of the name of Greene, had fallen into the mill-pond, in this town; he had been under water about 20 minutes, when he was found and brought on ſhore apparently dead.—The body was agitated by rolling gently on a barrel, and a conſiderable quantity of water diſcharged from the mouth thereby; after this he was conveyed to the houſe of Mr. Sumner's father: Mr. Sumner immediately heated a blanket very hot and wrapp'd up in it the body of the lad, which he then placed before a pretty large fire, turning it ſo as to expoſe every part to the fire; during this time the body was conſtantly rubb'd with fine ſalt, but for the ſpace of an hour and an half no ſign of life whatever appeared: After this Mr. Sumner ſtill perſevering, he thought he felt a ſmall degree of fluttering motion in the belly; he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, applying his hands to various parts of the body, but would have been diſcouraged from perſevering had he not heard that ſuch attempts, though for a long time ſeemingly fruitleſs, had finally, ſometimes, been crowned with ſucceſs; from this conſideration the meaſures were continued 'till at length a pulſation was felt, firſt in the temples, and ſoon after in the wriſt; not long after this an effort was made to breathe, with a kind of ſnorting noiſe in drawing in the air; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others ſucceeded, at firſt more ſlowly, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually in quicker ſucceſſion, 'till he began to breathe free and eaſy; and nothing having been poured into the mouth, he at length appeared to be perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; when Mr. Sumner led him home in health to his parents.</p>

               <head>The following Inſtances may ſerve to convey ſome Idea of the Succeſs with which the Inſtitution has been attended.</head>
               <p>A Child of Mr. Samuel Daſhwood, jun. painter, in Boſton, of two years of age, in the month of October, 1787, fell into a Ciſtern of water, 7 feet deep, and was taken out by a gentleman of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and was apparently dead: Fortunately this gentleman was acquainted with the methods recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the HUMANE SOCIETY, and immediately began to put them into practice.</p>
               <p>The ſubject was undreſſed and wiped as dry as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; hot blankets were wrapped round the body, and as one became cool, another was applied,—with theſe friction was uſed to every part of the body; after a few minutes (between four and ſeven) they had the unexpected ſatisfaction, to diſcover ſigns of returning life,—the firſt ſymptom of recovery, was a convulſive motion of the cheſt, attended with a forcible effort to diſtend the lungs: A Phyſician arriving at this time, the pulſe was examined, and though perceptible, it was extremely languid and irregular:—Fumigation of tobacco, was vigorouſly applied, and on the firſt injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the bowels, it inſtantly produced a full inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſucceeded by a loud and laborious roat—and an evident increaſe of the action of the heart;—On ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the uſe of this remedy, for a minute, the vigor of the pulſe was ſenſibly abated, and on returning to it again, the effects were as before, together with a ſmall diſcharge of indigeſted matter from the ſtomach; in about 25 minutes from the child's being taken out of the water, the pulſe began to beat with ſome degree of regularity, and the breathing to be performed with leſs labour and interruption, though he was ſtill to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in conſiderable diſtreſs: At this period he was placed in a hot bed, with a perſon, who was directed to continue the friction; hot bricks were applied to the feet, and a warming-pan of coals directed to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly moved over the bed cloaths. In three or four hours he appeared to be perfectly recovered, and is now a healthy and promiſing child.</p>
