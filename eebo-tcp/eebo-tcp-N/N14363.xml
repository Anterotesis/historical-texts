            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>DEUT. xxvi. 19.</bibl>
               <q>And to make thee high above all nations, which he hath made in praiſe, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayeſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>TAUGHT by the omniſcient Deity, Moſes fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw and predicted the capital events relative to Iſrael, through the ſucceſſive changes of depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and glory, until their final elevation to the firſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and eminence among the empires of the world. Theſe events have been ſo ordered as to become a diſplay of <hi>retribution</hi> and <hi>ſovereignty;</hi> for while the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> hitherto felt by this people, have been diſpenced in the way of exact national retribution, their ultimate glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor will be of the divine ſovereignty, with a <hi>not for your ſakes, do I this, ſaith the Lord, be it known unto you—but for mine holy names ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However it may be doubted, whether political Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities are rewarded and puniſhed in this world only; and whether the proſperity and decline of other Empires have correſponded with their moral ſtate, as to virtue and vice: yet the hiſtory of the hebrew theocracy ſhews, that the ſecular welfare of God's antient people depended upon
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018198_0005_0FA5BF0921C52FF8"/>
their virtue, their religion, their obſervance of that holy covenant, which Iſrael entered into with God, on the plains at the foot of Nebo on the other ſide Jordan. Here Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the man of God aſſembled three million of people, the number of the united ſtates, recapitulated and gave them a ſecond publication of the ſacred jural inſtitute, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty-eight years before, with the moſt awful ſolemnity at mount Sinai. A Law dictated with ſovereign autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the Moſt High to a people, a world, a univerſe, becomes of invincible force and obligation without any reference to the conſent of the governed:—it is obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for three reaſons, <abbr>viz.</abbr> its <hi>original juſtice</hi> and unerring equity, the <hi>omnipotent Authority</hi> by which it is enforced, and the ſanctions of <hi>rewards and puniſhments.</hi> But in the caſe of Iſrael, he condeſcended to a mutual covenant; and by the hand of Moſes lead his people to avouch the Lord Jehovah to be their God, and in the moſt public and explicit manner voluntarily to engage and covenant with God to keep and obey his Law. Thereupon this great prophet, whom God had raiſed up for ſo ſolemn a tranſaction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the name of the Lord, that the Moſt High avouched, acknowledged and took them for a peculiar people to himſelf; promiſing to be their God and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and upon their obedience, to make them proſperous and happy. Deut. xxix. 10 &amp; 14. C. xxx. 9 &amp; 19. He foreſaw indeed their rejection of God, and predicted the judicial chaſtiſement of apoſtacy; a chaſtiſement involving the righteous with the wicked. But as well to comfort and ſupport the righteous in every age and under every cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as to make his power known among all nations, God determined that a remnant ſhould be ſaved. Whence Moſes and the Prophets, by divine direction inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed their writings with promiſes, that, when the ends of God's moral government ſhould be anſwered in a ſeries of national puniſhments, inflicted for a ſucceſſion of ages, he would by his irreſiſtible power and ſovereign grace, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due the hearts of his people to a free, willing, joyful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; <hi>turn</hi> their <hi>captivity;</hi>—recover and <hi>gather</hi> them <hi>from
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018198_0006_0FA5BF0A4F214698"/>
all the nations whither the Lord had ſcattered them in his fierce anger—bring</hi> them <hi>into the land which their fathers poſſeſſed—and multiply</hi> them <hi>above</hi> their <hi>fathers—and rejoice over</hi> them <hi>for good, as he rejoiced over</hi> their fathers. Deut. xxx. 3. Then the words of Moſes, hitherto accompliſhed but in part, will be literally fulfilled; when this branch of the poſterity of Abraham ſhall be nationally collected, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very diſtinguiſhed and glorious people, under the great Meſſiah the Prince of Peace. He will then <hi>make</hi> them <hi>high above all nations which he hath made in praiſe, and in name, and in honor,</hi> and they ſhall become <hi>a holy people unto the Lord</hi> their <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall enlarge no further upon the primary ſenſe and literal accompliſhment of this and numerous other prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reſpecting both Jews and Gentiles, in the latter day glory of the church. For I have aſſumed the text, only as introductory to a diſcourſe upon the political welfare of God's American Iſrael; and as alluſively prophetic of the future proſperity and ſplendor of the United States. We may then conſider</p>
            <p>I. What reaſon we have to expect that, by the bleſſing of God, theſe States may proſper and flouriſh into a great American Republic; and aſcend into high and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed honor among the nations of the earth. <hi>To make thee high above all nations, which he hath made in praiſe, and in name, and in honor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. That our ſyſtem of dominion and CIVIL POLITY would be imperfect, without the true RELIGION; or, that from the diffuſion of virtue among the people of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, would ariſe their greateſt ſecular happineſs: which will terminate in this concluſion, that Holineſs ought to be the end of all civil government. <hi>That thou mayeſt be an holy people unto the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. The firſt of theſe propoſitions will divide itſelf into two branches, and lead us to ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherein conſiſts the true political welfare and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018198_0007_0FA5BF0A777EB210"/>
and what the civil adminiſtration neceſſary for the elevation and advancement, of a people to the higheſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The reaſons rendering it probable that the United States will, by the ordering of heaven, eventually become this people. But I ſhall combine theſe together as I go along.</p>
            <p>Dominion is founded in property; and reſides where that is, whether in the hands of the few or many. The Dominion founded in the feudal tenure of eſtate, is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold a conquered country in ſubjection, but is not adapted to the circumſtances of free citizens. Large ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial property veſted in individuals is pernicious to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Civilians, in contemplating the principles of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have judged ſuperior and inferior partition of property neceſſary in order to preſerve the ſubordination of ſociety, and eſtabliſh a permanent ſyſtem of dominion. This makes the public defence the intereſt of a few land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders only.</p>
            <p>A free tenure of lands, an equable diſtribution of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, enters into the foundation of a happy State: ſo far I mean, as that the body of the people may have it in their power, by induſtry, to become poſſeſſed of real freehold fee-ſimple eſtate. For connected with this will be a general ſpirit and principle of ſelf-defence—defence of our <hi>property, liberty, country.</hi> This has been ſingularly verified in New-England; where we have realized the capital ideas of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington's Oceana.</p>
            <p>But numerous <hi>population,</hi> as well as <hi>induſtry,</hi> is neceſſary towards giving value to land, to judiciouſly partitioned territory. The public weal requires the encouragement of both. A very inconſiderable value aroſe from the ſparſe thin ſettlement of the American aboriginals; of whom there are not fifty thouſand ſouls on this ſide the Miſſiſippi. The proteſtant Europeans have generally bought the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive right of ſoil, as far as they have ſettled, and paid the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018198_0008_0FA5BF0B6FCC3C90"/>
value ten fold; and are daily increaſing the value of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Indian territory a thouſand fold: and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we are a conſtant increaſing revenue to the Sachems and original Lords of the Soil. How much muſt the value of lands, reſerved to the natives of North and South-America, be increaſed to remaining Indians, by the inhabitation of two or three hundred millions of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans?</p>
            <p>Heaven hath provided this country, not indeed <hi>derelict,</hi> but only <hi>partially ſettled,</hi> and conſequently open, for the reception of a new enlargement of <hi>Japhet.</hi> Europe was ſettled by Japhet; America is ſettling from Europe: and perhaps this ſecond enlargement bids fair to ſurpaſs the firſt: for we are to conſider all the european ſettlements of America collectively as ſpringing from, and transfuſed with the blood of Japhet. Already for ages has Europe arrived to a plenary, if not declining population of 100 millions: in two or three hundred years this ſecond enlargement may cover America with three times that number, if the preſent ratio of increaſe continues with the enterpriſing ſpirit of Americans for colonization and removing out into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and ſettling new countries: and if Spain and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal ſhould adopt that wiſe regulation reſpecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the ſexes, which would give a ſpring to popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within the tropics, equal to that without. There may now be <hi>three or four millions of Whites.</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Europeans, in North and South-America: of which one half are in rapid increaſe, and the reſt ſcarcely keeping their number good without ſupplies from the parent ſtates. The number of French, Spaniards, Dutch and Portugueſe, may be one million ſouls in all America; altho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their blood into twice the number of Indians. The United States may be two million ſouls Whites, which have been an increaſe upon perhaps fewer than twenty or thirty thouſand families from Europe. Can we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate their preſent, and anticipate their future increaſe, and not be ſtruck with aſtoniſhment to find ourſelves in the midſt of the fulfilment of the prophecy of Noah? May we
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018198_0009_0FA5BF0C1F6110D8"/>
not ſee that we are the object which the holy ghoſt had in view four thouſand years ago, when he inſpired the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Patriarch with the viſions reſpecting his poſterity? How wonderful the accompliſhments in diſtant and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected ages! While the principal increaſe was firſt in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, weſtward from <hi>Scythia,</hi> the reſidence of the family of Japhet, a branch of the original enlargement extending eaſtward into Aſia, and ſpreading round to the ſouthward of the <hi>Caſpian,</hi> became the ancient kingdoms of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi>

The portrait painter Mr. Smibert, who accompanied Dr. Berkeley, then Dean of Derry and afterward Biſhop of Cloyne, from Italy to America in 1728, was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the grand Duke of Tuſcany, while at Florence, to

Moravian Indians from <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>South-America,</hi> have met thoſe in our latitude at Bethlehem, and have been clearly perceived to be the ſame people.

            <p>Indians are numerous in the tropical regions, not ſo elſewhere. Baronla <hi>Hontan</hi> the laſt century, and Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo lately as 1776 and 1777, travelled north-weſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſources of the miſſiſippi. From their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it appears that the ratio of indian population in the very heart of the continent, is ſimilar to that on this ſide of the miſſiſippi. By an accurate numeration made in 1766, and returned into the plantation office in London, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that there were not <hi>forty</hi> thouſand ſouls, Indians, from the Miſſiſippi to the Atlantic, and from Florida to the Pole. According to Mr. Carver, there are about thirty,<note n="§" place="bottom">Carver's trav. p. 415.</note> and certainly not forty Indian tribes, weſt of the Senecas, and ſix nation confederacy, and from the Miſſiſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi and Ohio northward to Hudſon's bay, and from Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra to the Lake of the Woods. The chiefs of all theſe ſpeak the Chipeway language. And perhaps all the remaining territory north of New Spain, and even on this ſide the northern tropic, and north-weſtward to aſia, will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit five times that number at higheſt.</p>
            <p>Partly by actual numeration, and partly by eſtimate, the Indians in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> dominions in America are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a million ſouls in New Spain, and a million and half in Peru, or two or three million ſouls in the whole. And perhaps this would fully comprehend thoſe of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guay and the Portugueſe provinces. In my opinion, great defalcation muſt be made from theſe numbers. The abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals have been injudiciouſly eſtimated at twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions: but I believe they never exceeded two or three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſouls in all North and South-America ſince the days of <hi>Columbus.</hi>

            <p>But to return; the population of this land will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly become very great; and <hi>Japhet</hi> become more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous millions in <hi>America,</hi> than in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi> and the two or three millions of the United States may equal the population of the oriental empires, which far ſurpaſſes that of Europe.

                  <p>To elucidate the Chineſe population it may be conſidered, that "in the reign of KANG-HI who died A.

So the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of men in the empire above ſixty millions, implying 250 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of ſouls.

Europeans conſider this the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſouls and not of adult males. All the brothers and ſiſters while they live conſtitute one family, according to the cuſtom in China, whether the anceſtor be living or dead.

Hatton in his geography eſtimates the total of the ſouls 24 millions. Very different are the eſtimates. There is an intricacy and want of elucidation in theſe Chineſe numera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I rather conſider the total of the empire 250 millions of ſouls. Among other reaſons, the number of principal mandarins, army and literati correſpond to an higher population than 60 million ſouls, which is the general eſtimate.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018198_0014_0FA5BF0FCA245BF8"/>
been reſerved in Providence to be realized in America. Moſt of the ſtates of all ages, in their originals, both as to <hi>policy,</hi> and <hi>property</hi> have been founded in rapacity, uſurpation and injuſtice: ſo that in the conteſts recorded in hiſtory, the <hi>public right</hi> is a dubious queſtion; it being rather certain that it belongs to neither of the contending parties: the military hiſtory of all nations, being but a deſcription of the wars and invaſions of the mutual robbers and devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of the human race. The invaſion of the lawleſs <hi>Macedonian</hi> who effected the diſſolution of the <hi>medo-perſian</hi> empire, the wide ſpread <hi>roman-conqueſts,</hi> the inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> the deſcents of the <hi>Tartars</hi> on <hi>China,</hi> the triumphs of <hi>Tamerlane, Ulugh-beg,</hi> and <hi>Aurengzebe,</hi> and the wide ſpread domination of the impoſtor of <hi>Mecca,</hi> with his ſucceſſors the <hi>Caliphs</hi> and <hi>Mameluhs</hi> down to <hi>Kouli-Kan,</hi> who dethroned his prince and plundered India of 200 mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions ſterling:—theſe, I ſay, with the new diſtribution of property and new erected policies, were all founded in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, and tyrannical uſurpation. The real inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of mankind and the public good has been generally overlooked. It has really been very indifferent to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018198_0015_0FA5BF13D94C68F0"/>

Theſe things have led ſome very enlightened as well as ſerious minds to a fixt concluſion and judgment againſt the right and legality of all wars. In the ſimplicity of my judgment, I have for years been of this opinion, except as to the <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> wars of Iſrael, and <hi>defenſive</hi> war of America. War in ſome inſtances, eſpecially defenſive, has been authorized by heaven. The bleſſing given by <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon his return from the ſlaughter of <hi>Chelderlaomer</hi> and the kings of the eaſt, juſtified that holy patriarch. The war with <hi>Amelek,</hi> and the extirpation of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> by <hi>Joſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> were of God. The location of the reſpective territories to the firſt nations, was ſo of God, as to give them a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right defenſively to reſiſt the <hi>Nimrods</hi> and <hi>Ninus'</hi>s, the firſt invading tyrants of the antient ages. The originally free and glorious republics of Greece, had a right from God, to withſtand the haughty claims of the Aſſyrian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which they ſucceſsfully reſiſted for ages, till the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man power aroſe behind them, and at length proſtrated their liberties.</p>
            <p>But after the ſpirit of conqueſt had changed the firſt governments, all the ſucceeding ones have, in general prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one continued ſeries of injuſtice, which has reigned in all countries for almoſt 4000 years. Theſe have ſo chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed property, laws, rights and liberties, that it has become impoſſible for the moſt ſagacious <hi>civilians</hi> to decide whoſe is the abſtract political right in national controverſies—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We can only ſay that there ſtill remains in the body of the people at large, the body of mankind of any and every generation, a POWER with which they are inveſted by the author of their being, to wreſt government out of the hands of reigning tyrants, and originate NEW POLICIES, adapted to the conſervation

But a DEMOCRATICAL polity for mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, ſtanding upon the broad baſis of the people at large, amply charged with property, has not hitherto been exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited.</p>
            <p>Republics are <hi>democratical, ariſtocratical,</hi> or <hi>monarchial.</hi> Each of theſe forms admit of modifications both as to <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> from abſolute government up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty. Monarchy might be ſo limited, one would think, as to be a happy form, eſpecially if <hi>elective:</hi> but both monarchy and ariſtocracy, when they become hereditary, terminate in the proſtration of liberty.

            <p>Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaid, that monarchy had a platform in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and in truth monarchical ideas reign through the univerſe. A monarchy conducted with <hi>infinite wiſdom</hi> and <hi>infinite benevolence,</hi> is the moſt perfect of all poſſible go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. The Moſt High hath delegated power and authority to ſubordinate monarchies or ſole ruling powers, in limited diſtricts, throughout the celeſtial hierarchy, and through the immenſity of the intellectual world; but at the ſame time he hath delegated and imparted to them, wiſdom and goodneſs adequate to the purpoſes of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thence the government is, as it ought to be, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. But in a world, or region of the univerſe, where God has imparted to none either this ſuperior power or ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate wiſdom, beyond what falls to the common ſhare of humanity, it is abſurd to look for ſuch qualities in one man; not even in the man <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſhared the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Iſrael with the Senate of Seventy. Therefore, there is no foundation for monarchical government, from ſuppoſed hereditary ſuperiority in knowledge. If it be ſaid, that monarchs always have a <hi>council of ſtate,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wiſeſt perſonages, of whoſe wiſdom they avail themſelves in the government of empires; not to obſerve

that this is a conceſſion indicating a deficiency of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Princes, it may be aſked, why not then, conſign and repoſe government into the hands of the national coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, where always reſides the ſuperiority of wiſdom? The ſuppoſed advantage of having <hi>one Public Head</hi> for all to look up to, and to concenter the attention, obedience, and affection of ſubjects, and to conſolidate the empire, will not counter-balance the evils of arbitrary deſpotiſm, and the uſual want of wiſdom in the ſovereigns and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the earth. For the hereditary ſucceſſions in the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſties of kings in the effeminate families of the great, ſeem to be marked and accurſed by providence, with deficient wiſdom. And where is the wiſdom of conſigning govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into ſuch hands? Why not much better, ſince we for once have our option or choice, to commit the direction of the republic to a <hi>Wittena-gemot,</hi> or an ariſtocratical council of wiſe men? Should we call forth and dignify ſome family, either from foreign nations or from among ourſelves, and create a monarch, whether an hereditary Prince or Protector for life, and ſeat him in Supremacy at the head of Congreſs; ſoon, with inſidious dexterity, would he intrigue and ſecure a venal majority, even of new and annual members; and by diffuſing a complicated and variouſly modified influence, purſue an accretion of power till he became abſolute.</p>
            <p>The celebrated hiſtorian Mrs. CATHARINE MACAULAY, that ornament of the republic of letters, and the female LIVY of the age, obſerves, "The man who holds ſupreme power for life, will have a great number of friends and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, who are attached by intereſt to his intereſt, and who will wiſh for continuance of power in the ſame family. This creates the worſt of factions, a <hi>government faction</hi> in the ſtate. The deſire of ſecuring to ourſelves a particular, unſhared privilege, is the rankeſt vice which infeſts huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and a Protector for life, inſtead of devoting his time and underſtanding to the great cares of government, will, be ſcheming and plotting to ſecure the power after his death to his children, if he has any, if not to the neareſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018198_0019_0FA5BF175A492BF8"/>
of his kin. This principle in government has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of ſuch bloodſhed and oppreſſion, that it has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined politicians to give the preference to hereditary rather than elective monarchies; and as the leſſer evil to conſign the government of ſociety to the encreaſing and at length unlimited ſway of one family, whether the individuals of it ſhould be idiots or madmen. It is an uncontroverted fact, that ſupreme power never can continue long in one family, without becoming unlimited."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mrs. MACAULAY'S letter to the author, 1771</note>

            <p>We ſtand a better chance with ARISTOCRACY, whether <hi>hereditary</hi> or <hi>elective,</hi> than with <hi>monarchy.</hi> An unſyſtema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical democracy, and an abſolute monarchy, are equally deteſtable, equally a <hi>magormiſſabib,</hi> the terror to all around them. An elective ariſtocracy is preferable for America, as it is rather to be a <hi>council of nations</hi> (agreeable to the humane, liberal, and grand ideas of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot <hi>Sully</hi>) than a body in which reſides <hi>authoritative ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty;</hi> for there is no real ceſſion of dominion, no ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendery or transfer of ſovereignty, to the national council, as each ſtate in the confederacy is an independent ſovereignty.</p>
            <p>In juſtice to human ſociety, it may perhaps be ſaid of almoſt all the polities and civil inſtitutions in the world, however imperfect, that they have been founded in and carried on with very conſiderable wiſdom. They muſt have been generally well adminiſtered; I ſay <hi>generally,</hi> otherwiſe government could not proceed. This may be ſaid even of thoſe governments, which carry great defects, and the ſeeds of ſelf-deſtruction and ruin in their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—for even an <hi>Ottoman</hi> or an <hi>Aurengzebe,</hi> muſt eſtabliſh and preſcribe to himſelf a national conſtitution, a ſyſtem of general laws and dominion. But the abſtract rationale of perfect civil government, remains ſtill hidden among the deſiderata of politics, having hitherto baffled the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt writers on government, the ableſt politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and the ſageſt civilians. A well ordered DEMOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICAL

ARISTOCRACY, ſtanding upon the annual elections of the people, and revocable at pleaſure, is the polity which combines the UNITED STATES: and from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and the compariſon of ages, I believe it will approve itſelf the moſt equitable, liberal, and perfect.</p>
            <p>With the people, eſpecially a people ſeized of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, reſides the aggregate of original power. They cannot however aſſemble from the territory of an empire, and muſt therefore, if they have any ſhare in government, repreſent themſelves by delegation. This conſtitutes one order in legiſlature and ſovereignty. It is a queſtion whether there ſhould be any other. To reſolve which it may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that each of theſe delegates or repreſentatives, will be faithful conſervators of local intereſts, but have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in attending extenſively to the public, further than where all particular local intereſts are affected in common with that which one delegate repreſents in particular.</p>
            <p>It ſhould ſeem then that the nature of ſociety dictates another, a higher Branch, whoſe ſuperiority ariſes from its being the intereſted and natural <hi>conſervator of the univerſal intereſt.</hi> This will be a ſenatorial order, ſtanding, not on local, but a general election of the whole body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Let a bill, or law, be read in the one branch or the other: every one inſtantly thinks how it will affect his conſtituents. If his conſtituents are thoſe of one ſmall diſtrict only, they will be his firſt care; if the people at large, their general or univerſal intereſt will be his firſt care, the firſt object of his faithful attention. If a ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as in Delaware, ſtands on the election of only the ſame diſtrict as a deputy, the upper-houſe is only a repetition of the lower:—if on the election of ſeveral counties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, as in Virginia, each member of the upper-houſe ſtands and feels himſelf charged with a greater and more extenſive care, than a member of the houſe of burgeſſes: not but that it is the duty of each deputy to attend to the general intereſt. Georgia, Pennſylvania, and Jerſey, have each a ſenate or legiſlature of one order only; for although
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018198_0021_0FA5BF18F1D8C1E8"/>
in Jerſey it ſeemeth otherwiſe, yet that intereſt which will determine a vote in one, will determine it in both houſes. The ſame is true of the two Carolinas.</p>
            <p>The conſtitutions of Maryland and New-York, are founded in higher wiſdom. The polity of Maſſachuſetts is excellent and truly grand. It retains indeed ſome of the ſhadows of royalty, which may give dignity, but never operate an eſſential miſchief, in the hands of a chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who is annually elective by the people at large. But Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland have originally realized the moſt perfect polity as to a legiſlature: any emendations and improvements may be made by the aſſembly with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the eſtabliſhment of the law courts, and a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional privy council, which in all future time will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to attend the chief magiſtrate in the ordinary civil adminiſtration. Theſe things are remedied in Virginia, whoſe conſtitution ſeems to be imperfect in but one thing—its twenty-four ſenators, though elected from local diſtricts, ſhould be elected by the people at large, being men of ſuch public eminence, and of merit ſo illuſtrious, as to be known not to a few only, but to all the tribes throughout the ſtate. It eſtabliſhes judges <hi>quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi> It provides perfectly for <hi>legiſlation</hi> and <hi>law courts,</hi> for the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia,</hi> and for that continual adminiſtration of government in abſence of aſſemblies, and while the judiciary tribunals are ſitting, which muſt reſide in and be uninterruptedly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed at the head of ſovereignty in every civil polity.</p>
            <p>It gives me pleaſure to find, that public LIBERTY is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſecured, in each and all the policies of the United States, though ſomewhat differently modelled. Not only the polity or exterior ſyſtem of government, but the laws and interior regulations of each ſtate, are already excellent, ſurpaſſing the inſtitutions of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> or <hi>Plato;</hi> and by the annual appeals to the public, a power is reſerved to the people, to remedy any corruptions or errors in government. And if even the people ſhould ſometimes err, yet each aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the ſtates, and the body of the people, always emboſom wiſdom ſufficient to correct themſelves: ſo that
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018198_0022_0FA5BF1991E106C0"/>
a political miſchief cannot be durable. Herein we far ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs any ſtates on earth. We can correct ourſelves if in the wrong. The Belgic ſtates in their foederal capacity, are united by a perfect ſyſtem, conſtituted by that great prince WILLIAM of Naſſau, and the compatriots of that age: but they left the interior government of the jural tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals, cities, and provinces, as depotic and arbitrary as they found them. So the elective monarchical republic of Poland, is an excellent conſtitution for the nobles, but leaves deſpotiſm and tyranny, the portion and hard fate of the plebeians, beyond what is to be found in any part of Europe. Not ſo the American ſtates: their interior as well as exterior civil and jural polities are ſo nearly perfect, that the rights of individuals, even to numerous millions, are guarded and ſecured.</p>
            <p>The crown and glory of our confederacy is the <hi>amphict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonic council</hi> of the GENERAL CONGRESS, ſtanding on the annual election of the united reſpective ſtates, and revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at pleaſure. This lays the foundation of a permanent union in the American Republic, which may at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world, that of all the policies to be found on earth, not excepting the very excellent one of the Chineſe Empire, the moſt perfect one has been invented and realized in America.</p>
            <p>If in the multitude of devices for improving and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our policy to greater perfection, and a more permanent and efficacious government, if, I ſay, ſome elevated geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſſes ſhould go into the ideas of monarchy, whether here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary or elective; and others think of a partition of the united ſtates into three or four ſeparate independent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies; perhaps upon diſcuſſing the ſubject calmly and thoroughly, and finding that the policy which will at laſt take place, muſt ſtand on <hi>plebeian election;</hi> they may at length be ſatisfied, that the die is already caſt, and <hi>the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy has taken its complexion for ages</hi> to come.

            <p>But I paſs on to another ſubject in which the welfare of a community is deeply concerned, I mean the public RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENUES.

But this is a moſt difficult ſubject; and what the happieſt method of raiſing it, is uncertain. One thing is certain, that however in moſt kingdoms and empires the people are taxed at the will of the prince yet in America the people tax themſelves, and therefore cannot tax themſelves beyond their abilities.

entered into the ſyſtem of Revenue and Finance in almoſt all nations, <abbr>viz.</abbr> reſtricting the collection to money. Two or three millions can more eaſily be raiſed in produce, than one million in money. This collected and depoſited in ſtores and magazines, would by bills drawn upon theſe ſtores, anſwer all the expenditures of war and peace. The little imperfect experiment lately made here, ſhould not diſcourage us. In one country it has been tried with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs for ages, I mean in China, the wiſeſt empire the ſun hath ever ſhined upon. And here, if I recollect aright, not a tenth of the Imperial revenues hath been collected in money. In rice, wheat and millet only are collected 40 million of ſacks, one hundred and twenty each; equal to 80 million buſhels: in raw and wrought ſilk one million pounds. The reſt is taken in ſalt, wines, cotton, and other fruits of labor and induſtry at a certain ratio, <hi>per cent.</hi> and depoſited in ſtores over all the empire. The periſhable commodities are immediately ſold, and the <hi>mandarins</hi> and <hi>army</hi> are paid by bills on theſe magazines. In no part of the world are the inhabitants leſs oppreſſed, than there. England has eleven hundred millions property, real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal and commercial, and five million ſouls. Their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary revenue has for many years been ten or twelve mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; and during this war the national expenditures have been annually twenty millions. A great part is raiſed by exciſe; by the land tax, not above a fifth or ſixth, altho' the annual rental of England is really ſixty millions. The funded debt has ariſen from 123 millions A. D. 1775, to 230 millions in 1783, and can never be paid. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled in the annals of empires, that ſix or ſeven milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people ever diſcharged ſo heavy a burden. The Roman Imperial debt was once in the times of the Caeſars 300 millions ſterling, when the empire conſiſted of thirty million of people. One emperor at his acceſſion wiped out twenty millions, and the <hi>Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> ſettled the reſt, to the ruin of thouſands. May God preſerve theſe States from being ſo involved. The preſent war being over, the future increaſe of population and property will in time enable us, with convenience to diſcharge the heavy debt we
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018198_0026_0FA5BF22BA8ADCB8"/>
have incurred in the defence of our rights and liberties. The United States have now two hundred and fifty millions of property, pretty equally ſhared by two or three million people. And our national debt<note n="*" place="bottom">42 millions of dollars at the peace.</note> is not ten million ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: which is to the whole collectively, as it would be for one man, poſſeſſing an eſtate of £. 250 in land and ſtock, to oblige himſelf to pay ten pounds. The intereſt only of the Britiſh national debt, upon ſix or ſeven million people, is above ten millions ſterling annually, that is, greater than the whole national debt of the United States, upon half that number. Our population will ſoon overſpread the vaſt territory from the Atlantic to the Miſſiſippi, which in two generations will become a property ſuperior to that of Britain. Thus poſterity may help to pay for the war, which we have been obliged to fight out for them in our day. It will not, however, be wiſe to conſign to poſterity ſo heavy a debt; leaſt they ſhould be tempted to learn, like other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the practice of public injuſtice, and broken nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faith.</p>
            <p>Another object of great attention in America, will be <hi>Commerce.</hi> In order to form ſome ideas reſpecting it, in the united ſtates, we may take a ſummary view of it, while we were in connexion with Britain; and thence judge what it may be, after we ſhall have recovered from the ſhock of this war.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh merchants repreſented that they received ſome profit indeed from <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> as well as the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> but as for the reſt of this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, they were conſtant looſers in trade.

A commerce of 26 mil. exports, and only 13 mil. imports, is ſelf-annihilated and impoſſible. The returns from the Weſt-Indies comprehended a great part of the continental remittances. The American merchants, by a circuitous trade from this continent, and from Africa, remitted to London and Britain, by way of the Weſt-Indies, in bills of exchange drawn on ſugars, the balance of what they ſeem to fall ſhort, in direct remittances on the cuſtom-houſe books.</p>
            <p>The whole American commerce, monopolized by Great-Britain, muſt be conſidered collectively; and was to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land only in the above account 41 million exports, and 49 million imports.

Well might the Britiſh merchants ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a loſs in American bankruptcies of a million a year (though probably at an average not five or ten thouſand) in ſo lucrative a trade. An idea of the mercantile debt may be thus conceived. There is a diſtrict within the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtates, upon which the ſtate of European trade, at the commencement of hoſtilities, was thus; being chiefly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by foreign factorages, a mode of commerce which the Britiſh merchants intended to have been univerſal. In the courſe of a ſyſtematical trade, had at length ariſen a ſtanding debt of a million ſterling among about a quarter of a million of people: to feed this the Britiſh merchants ſent over one quarter of a million ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erling annually; for which and collected debts, they received in actual remittance half a million ſterling within the ſame year, i. e. a quarter of a million returned half a million, and fed or kept up a debt

of one million, paying to Britain an annual lawful intereſt; the ſecurity of all which complicated ſyſtem ſtood upon american mortgages. This is true mercantile ſecret hiſtory.</p>
            <p>If this ſpecimen applied to all the ſtates (and God be thanked it does not) it would ſhew, not only the greatneſs and momentous importance of our trade to Europe, but the neceſſity of legiſlative regulations in commerce, to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate future foreign mortgages, and yet ſupport credit by the enforcement of punctual ſpeedy and certain payments, whether with profit or loſs. Without this no permanent commerce can be ſupported. I obſerved that the above ſpecimen may aſſiſt us. It is not neceſſary for every pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to come to great exactneſs in capital eſtimates. The total exterior commerce of Great-Britain with all the world, is about twelve millions annually; of which five millions, or near half, was of American connexion, and four millions of this directly American, as Mr. Glover aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; and the real profits of the American trade was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to Britain equal to nearly half the benefit of her total exterior commerce to the whole world. The total of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh exports to all the world, A. D. 1704, was only ſix millions and an half ſterling. The American Britiſh trade in its connexion, returns, and profits, nearly equalled this, A. D. 1774. We were better to Britain, than all the world was to her 70 years before. Deſpiſed as our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce was, it is evident, that had the union continued, our increaſing millions would ſoon have made remittances, for more than the fewer millions of Britain could have manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured for exportation. For the greater part of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of every country muſt be for domeſtic conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A ſpecimen of this we have in the woollen manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. England grows eleven million fleeces a year, worth two million ſterling, manufactured into eight million; of which ſix million is of domeſtic conſumption, and two mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion only for exportation. When it is conſidered that a great part of this went to other countries, how weak muſt be the ſuppoſition that Britain cloathed America; while
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018198_0029_0FA5BF2646DD1868"/>
America, from the beginning in their own domeſtic manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, furniſhed nine-tenths of their apparel.</p>
            <p>Our trade opens to all the world. We ſhall doubtleſs at firſt overtrade ourſelves every where, and be in danger of incurring heavy mortgages unleſs prevented. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not at firſt know how far they may ſafely trade with us. But commerce will find out its own ſyſtem, and regulate itſelf in time. It will be governed on the part of America by the cheapeſt foreign markets; on the part of Europe by our ability and punctuality of remittance. We can ſoon make a remittance of three or four million a year in a circuitous trade, excluſive of the iniquitous African trade. If Europe ſhould indulge us beyond this, our failures and diſappointments might lay the foundation of national animoſities. Great wiſdom is therefore neceſſary to regulate the commerce of America. The caution with which we are to be treated, may occaſion and originate a commercial ſyſtem among the maritime nations, on both ſides of the Atlantic, founded in juſtice and reciprocity of intereſt, which will eſtabliſh the <hi>benevolence</hi> as well as the <hi>opulence</hi> of nations, and advance the progreſs of ſociety to civil perfection.</p>
            <p>It is certainly for the benefit of every community that it be transfuſed with the efficacious motives of <hi>univerſal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</hi> This will take place if every one can enjoy the fruits of his labour and activity unmoleſted. All the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of labour, in a well regulated ſtate, will be ſo ordered and encouraged, as that all will be employed in a juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in agriculture, mechanic arts, commerce, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary profeſſions. It has been a queſtion whether <hi>agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> or <hi>commerce,</hi> needs moſt encouragement in theſe ſtates? But the motives for both ſeem abundantly ſufficient. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did they operate more ſtrongly than at preſent. The whole continent is activity, and in the lively vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of induſtry. Several other things call for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the planting of vineyards, and olive yards, and cotton walks; the raiſing of wool, planting mulberry trees,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018198_0030_0FA5BF270DEACE20"/>
and the culture of ſilk; and I add, eſtabliſhing <hi>manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> This laſt is neceſſary, very neceſſary, far more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary indeed than is thought by many deep politicians. Let us have all the means poſſible of ſubſiſtence and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance among ourſelves, if we would be a flouriſhing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of real independent dignity and glory.</p>
            <p>Another thing tending to the public welfare, is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſes of political animoſities and civil diſſention, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting harmony, and ſtrengthening the union among the ſeveral parts of this extended community. In the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>bellum ſociale</hi> among the Romans, 300,000 of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood, fought 700,000 brethren of the Italian blood: After a loſs of 60,000 in diſputing a trifling point of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional honor, they pacificated the whole by an Amneſty, and giving the city to the Italians.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid.

We ſhould live henceforward in amity, as brothers inſpired with and cultivating a certain <hi>national benevolence,</hi> unitedly glorying in the name of a COLUMBIAN or AMERICAN, and in the diſtinguiſhed honor and aggrandiſement of our country. Like that antient national affection, which we once had for the parent ſtate, while we gloried in being a part of the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh empire; and when our attachment and fidelity grew to an unexampled vigor and ſtrength. This appeared in the tender diſtreſs we felt, at the firſt thoughts of the diſſolution of this antient friendſhip. We once thought Britain our friend, and gloried in her protection. But ſome daemon<note n="†" place="bottom">Bute.</note> whiſpered folly into the preſent reign: And britain forced upon America, the tremendous alternative of the <hi>loſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> or the <hi>laſt appeal</hi>—either of which inſtantly alienated and diſſolved our affection—it was impoſſible to heſitate—and the affection is diſſolved, never, never more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered:—like that between <hi>ſyracuſe</hi> and <hi>athens,</hi> it is loſt forever. A political earthquake through the continent hath ſhook off America from Great Britain. Oh! how

painful and diſtreſſing the ſeparation and diſmemberment!

American empire for the many ages till the millennium—when thy great national glory ſhould have been advanced in then becoming a member of the univerſal empire of the Prince of Peace. And if perchance in ſome future period danger ſhould have ariſen to thee from european ſtates, how have I flewn on the wings of prophecy, with the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous hardy hoſts of thine American ſons, inheriting thine antient principles of <hi>liberty</hi> and <hi>valor,</hi> to reſcue and reinthrone the hoary venerable head of the moſt glorious empire on earth?

            <p>Moreover, as we have ſeen the wiſdom of our anceſtors in inſtituting a militia, ſo it is neceſſary to continue it. The Game Act, in the time of James I, inſidiouſly diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people of England. Let us not be inſidiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed. In all our enlargements in colonization, in all our increaſing millions, let the main body be exerciſed annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to military diſcipline, whether i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> war or peace. This
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018198_0032_0FA5BF287ADED0E8"/>
will defend us againſt ourſelves, and againſt ſurrounding ſtates. Let this be known in Europe, in every future age, and we ſhall never again be invaded from the other ſide of the Atlantic. <q>The militia of this country, ſays general Waſhington, muſt be conſidered as the palladium of our ſecurity, and the firſt effectual reſort in caſe of hoſtility.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing neceſſary, is a vigilance againſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in purchaſing elections, and in deſignations to offices in the legiſlatures and Congreſs; inſtituting ſuch efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſions againſt corruption, as ſhall preclude the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of its riſing to any great height, before it ſhall be controlled and corrected. Although in every political ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration the appointment to offices will ever be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably influenced by the ſiniſter, private, perſonal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives either of intereſt or friendſhip; yet the ſafety of the ſtate requires that this ſhould not go too far. An admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration may indeed proceed tolerably, when the officers of a well arranged ſyſtem are in general ordinary characters, provided there is a pretty good ſprinkling of men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom interſperſed among them. How much more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would it be, if three quarters of the offices of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were filled with men of ability, underſtanding, and patriotiſm? What an animation would it diffuſe through a community, if men of real merit in every branch of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, were ſure of receiving the rewards and honors of the ſtate? That great and wiſe monarch OLAM PODHLA, the <hi>Alfred</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> 1000 years before Chriſt, inſtituted an annual review and examination of all the atchievements and illuſtrious characters in the realm; and being approved by himſelf and the annual aſſembly of the nobles, he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their names and atchievements to be enrolled in a public <hi>regiſter of merit.</hi> This continued 2000 years to the time of that illuſtrious chieftan BRIEN O'BORO<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ME. This had an amazing effect. By this animation, the heroic, military and political virtues, with civilization, and I add, <hi>ſcience</hi> and <hi>literature,</hi> aſcended to an almoſt unexampled and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible perfection in Ireland, ages before they figured in other parts of Europe, not excepting even <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> I have a very great opinion of hibernian merit, literary, as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018198_0033_0FA5BF29451D1118"/>
well as civil and military, even in the ages before St. PATRICK.</p>
            <p>But to return:—The cultivation of LITERATURE will greatly promote the public welfare. In every community, while proviſion is made, that all ſhould be taught to read the ſcriptures and the very uſeful parts of common education, a good proportion ſhould be carried through the higher branches of literature. Effectual meaſures ſhould be taken for preſerving and diffuſing knowledge among a people. The voluntary inſtitution of libraries in different vicinities, will give thoſe, who have not a liberal education, an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of gaining that knowledge, which will qualify them for uſefulneſs. <hi>Travels, biography,</hi> and <hi>hiſtory,</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>policies, jurisprudence,</hi> and ſcientific improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among all nations, antient and modern, will form the civilian, the judge, the ſenator, the patrician, the man of uſeful eminence in ſociety. The colleges have been of ſingular advantage in the preſent day. When Britain withdrew all her wiſdom from America, this revolution found above two thouſand in New-England only, who had been educated in the colleges, intermixed among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and communicating knowledge among them. Almoſt all of them have approved themſelves uſeful; and there have been ſome characters among us of the firſt eminence for literature. It would be for the public emolument ſhould there always be found a ſufficient number of men in the community at large, of vaſt and profound erudition, and perfect acquaintance with the whole ſyſtem of public affairs, to illuminate the public councils, as well to fill the three learned profeſſions with dignity and honor.</p>
            <p>I have thus ſhewn wherein conſiſts the true political wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of a civil community or ſovereignty. The founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid in a judicious diſtribution of property, and in a good ſyſtem of <hi>polity</hi> and <hi>jurisprudence;</hi> on which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, under a truly patriotic, upright, and firm adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the beautiful ſuperſtructure of a well governed and proſperous empire.</p>
            <p>Already does the new conſtellation of the united ſtates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to realize this glory. It has already riſen to an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018198_0034_0FA5BF2A2E83E5E0"/>
ſovereignty among the republics and kingdoms of the world. And we have reaſon to hope, and I believe to expect, that God has ſtill greater bleſſings in ſtore, for this vine which his own right hand hath planted, to make us <hi>high among the nations in praiſe, and in name, and in honor.</hi> The reaſons are very numerous, weighty, and concluſive.</p>
            <p>In our civil conſtitutions, thoſe impediments are removed, which obſtruct the progreſs of ſociety towards perfection: ſuch, for inſtance, as reſpect the tenure of eſtates, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary government. The vaſſalage of dependant tenures, the tokens of ancient conqueſts by Goths and Tartars, ſtill remain all over aſia and europe. In this reſpect, as well as others, the world begins to open its eyes. One grand experiment in particular has lately been made. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent empreſs of <hi>ruſſia,</hi> by granting lands in freehold, in her vaſt wilderneſſes of <hi>volkouſkile,</hi> together with religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, has allured and already draughted from <hi>poland</hi> and <hi>germany</hi> a colonization of ſix hundred thouſand ſouls in ſix years only, from 1762, to 1768.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Marſhal's trav.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Liberty, civil and religious, has ſweet and attractive charms. The enjoyment of this, with property, has fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the engliſh ſettlers in america with a moſt amazing ſpirit, which has operated, and ſtill will operate with great energy. Never before has the experiment been ſo effectually tried, of every man's reaping the fruits of his labor, and feeling his ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re in the aggregate ſyſtem of power. The antient republics did not ſtand on the people at large; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no example or precedent can be taken from them. Even men of arbitrary principles will be obliged, if they would figure in theſe ſtates, to aſſume the patriot ſo long, that they will at length become charmed with the ſweets of liberty.</p>
            <p>Our degree of population is ſuch as to give us reaſon to expect that this will become a great people. It is probable that within a century from our independence the ſun will
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018198_0035_0FA5BF2B23CC5650"/>
ſhine on fifty million of inhabitants in the united ſtates. This will be a great, a very great nation, nearly equal to half europe. Already has our colonization extended down the <hi>ohio</hi> and to <hi>koſkajeah</hi> on the <hi>miſſiſippi.</hi> And if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ratio of increaſe ſhould be rather diminiſhed in ſome of the other ſettlements, yet an accelerated multiplication will attend our general propagation, and overſpread the whole territory weſtward for ages. So that before the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenium, the engliſh ſettlements in america, may become more numerous millions, than that greateſt dominion on earth the chineſe empire. Should this prove a future fact, how applicable would be the text, when the Lord ſhall have made his american Iſrael, <hi>high above all nations which he hath made,</hi> in numbers, <hi>and in praiſe, and in name, and in honor!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſenſible ſome will conſider theſe as viſionary uto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian ideas. And ſo they would have judged, had they lived in the apoſtolic age and been told, that by the time of <hi>conſtantine</hi> the empire would have become chriſtian. As viſionary that the twenty thouſand ſouls which firſt ſettled new-england, ſhould be multiplied to near a million in a century and a half. As viſionary that the ottoman empire muſt fall by the ruſſian. As viſionary to the catholics is the certain downfal of the pontificate. As utopian would it have been to the <hi>loyaliſts,</hi> at the battle of <hi>lexington,</hi> that in leſs than eight years, the independence and ſovereignty of the united ſtates, ſhould be acknowledged by four european ſovereignties, one of which ſhould be <hi>britain</hi> herſelf. How wonderful the revolutions, the events of providence! We live in an age of wonders: we have lived an age in a few years: we have ſeen more wonders accompliſhed in <hi>eight</hi> years, than are uſually unfolded in a century.</p>
            <p>God be thanked, we have lived to ſee peace reſtored to this bleeding land, at leaſt a general ceſſation of hoſtilities among the belligerent powers. And on this occaſion does it not become us to reflect, how wonderful, how gracious, how glorious, has been the good hand of our God upon us, in carrying us thro' ſo tremendous a warfare! We have ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018198_0036_0FA5BF2B812B8B98"/>
a force brought againſt us; which might have made any empire on earth to tremble—and yet our bow has abode in ſtrength; and having obtained help of God, we continue unto this day. Forced unto the laſt <hi>ſolemn appeal,</hi> america watched for the firſt blood: this was ſhed by <hi>britons</hi> on the 19th of April, 1775; which inſtantly ſprung an army of 20,000 into ſpontaneous exiſtence, with the enterprizing and daring, if imprudent, reſolution of entering <hi>boſton,</hi> and forceably diſburdening it of its bloody legions. Every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot trembled till we had proved our armour, till it could be ſeen, whether this haſty concourſe was ſuſceptible of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitual arrangement, and could face the enemy with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They early gave us the decided proof of this, in the memorable battle of <hi>bunker-hill.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">June 17, 1775.</note> We were ſatisfied. This inſtantly convinced us, and for the firſt time convinced <hi>bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> themſelves, that americans both would and could fight with great effect. Whereupon Congreſs put at the head of this ſpirited army, the only man, on whom the eyes of all iſrael were placed. Poſterity, I apprehend, and the world itſelf, inconſiderate and incredulous as they may be of the dominion of heaven, will yet do ſo much juſtice to the divine moral government, as to acknowledge, that this american JOSHUA was raiſed up by God, and <hi>divinely form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by a peculiar influence of the Sovereign of the Univerſe, for the great work of leading the armies of this american Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph (now ſeparated from his brethren), and conducting this people through the ſevere, the arduous conflict, to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and independence. Surprizing was it with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant celerity men aſcended and roſe into generals, and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of every ſubordination; formed chiefly by the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory diſcipline of only the preceding year 1774; when the ardor and ſpirit of military diſcipline was by heaven, and without concert, ſent through the continent like lightning. Surprizing was it, how ſoon the army was organized, took its formation, and roſe into firm ſyſtem and impregnable arrangement.</p>
            <p>To think of withſtanding and encountering britain by land was bold, and much more bold and daring, by ſea:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018198_0037_0FA5BF2C357E1780"/>
yet we immediately began a navy, and built ſhips of war with an unexampled expedition. It is preſumed never was a 35 gun ſhip before built quicker than that well built, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhip the <hi>Raleigh,</hi> which was finiſhed from the keel and equipt for ſea in a few months. Soon had we got, tho' ſmall a very gallant initial navy, which fought gallantly; and wanted nothing but numbers of ſhips, for ſucceſsful operations, againſt that ſuperior naval force before which we fell. We have, however, exhibited proof to poſterity and the world, that a powerful navy may be originated, built and equipped for ſervice, in a much ſhorter period than was before imagined. The britiſh navy has been many centuries growing; and france, holland, the baltic powers, or any of the powers of this age, in twenty years, may build navies of equal magnitude, if neceſſary for dominion, commerce, or ornament.</p>
            <p>A variety of <hi>ſucceſs</hi> and <hi>defeat</hi> hath attended our warfare both by ſea and land. In our loweſt &amp; moſt dangerous eſtate in 1776 and 1777, we ſuſtained ourſelves againſt the britiſh army of <hi>ſixty thouſand</hi> troops commanded by Howe, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, and Clinton, and other the ableſt generals <hi>britain</hi> could procure throughout <hi>europe,</hi> with a naval force of 22,000 ſeamen in above <hi>eighty</hi> britiſh men of war.<note n="§" place="bottom">To loſe america, has coſt britain the loſs of more than an hundred thouſand men, and an hundred and twenty millions ſterling in money. Mr. Thomas Pitt, from authentic documents, lately aſſerted in parliament, that only the firſt five years of this war had coſt britain five millions more, than all the wars of the laſt age, including the ſplendid victories of the duke of Marlbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> Theſe generals we ſent home one after another, conquered, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and convinced of the impoſſibility of ſubduing ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. While oppreſſed by the heavy weight of this combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned force, heaven inſpired us with reſolution to cut the gordian knot; when the die was caſt irrevocable in the glorious act of INDEPENDENCE. This was ſealed and confirmed by God Almighty in the victory of General WASHINGTON at TRENTON, and in the ſurprizing move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and battle of PRINCETON; by which aſtoniſhing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

of generalſhip, general Howe and the whole britiſh army, in elated confidence and in open-mouthed march for <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> was inſtantly ſtopt, remanded back, and cooped up for a ſhivering winter in the little borough of <hi>brunſwick.</hi> Thus God <hi>turned the battle to the gate;</hi> and this gave a <hi>finiſhing to the foundation</hi> of the american re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. This with the <hi>Burgoynade</hi> at <hi>ſaratoga</hi> by general GATES; and the glorious victory over the earl of CORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WALLIS in <hi>virginia,</hi> together with the memorable victory of <hi>eutaw</hi> ſprings, and the triumphant recovery of the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates by general GREENE, are among the moſt heroic acts, and brilliant atchievements, which have decided the fate of america. And who does not ſee the indubitable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition and energetic influence of divine providence in theſe great and illuſtrious events? Who but a Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, inſpired by heaven, could have ſtruck out the great movement and manoeuvre of princeton? To whom but the ruler of the winds ſhall we aſcribe it, that the britiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement, in the ſummer of 1777, was delayed on the ocean three months by contrary winds, until it was too late for the conflagrating general CLINTON to raiſe the ſiege of <hi>ſaratoga?</hi> What but a providential miracle detected the conſpiracy of <hi>Arnold,</hi> even in the critical moment of the execution of that infernal plot, in which the body of the american army, then at weſt-point, with his excellency ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral WASHINGTON himſelf, were to have been rendered into the hands of the enemy!—Doubtleſs inſpired by the Supreme Illuminator of great minds, were the joint coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of a Waſhington and a Rochambeau, in that grand effort of generalſhip, with which they deceived and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a Clinton, and eluded his vigilance in their tranſit by <hi>new-york,</hi> and rapid marches for virginia.

            <p>How rare have been the defections and apoſtacies of our capital characters, though tempted with all the charms of gold, titles, and nobility? Whence is it that ſo few of our army have deſerted to the enemy? Whence that our brave ſailors have choſen the horrors of priſon ſhips and death, rather than to fight againſt their country? Whence that men of every rank have ſo generally felt and ſpoken alike, as if the cords of life ſtruck uniſon through the continent? What but a miracle has preſerved the <hi>union of the ſtates,</hi> the <hi>purity of congreſs,</hi> and the unſhaken <hi>patriotiſm</hi> of every <hi>general aſſembly?</hi> It is God who has raiſed up for us a great and powerful ally, an ally which ſent us a choſen army, and a naval force; who ſent us a ROCHAMBEAU and a CHATELLUX, and other characters of the firſt military me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and eminence, to fight ſide by ſide with a WASHINGTON and a LINCOLN, and the intrepid americans, in the ſiege and battle of <hi>york-town.</hi> It is God, who ſo ordered the ballancing intereſts of nations, as to produce an irreſiſtible motive in the european maritime powers, to take our part. Hence the recognition of our independence by <hi>ſpain</hi> and <hi>holland,</hi> as well as <hi>france.</hi> Britain ought to have foreſeen, that it muſt have given joy to ſurrounding nations, tired and wearied out with the inſolence and haughtineſs of her domineering flag, a flag which ſpreads terror through the oceans of the terraqueous globe, to behold the aera when their forces ſhould have arrived to ſuch maturity and ſtrength, that a junction of national navies, would prod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce an aggregate force, adequate to the humiliation of britain and her gallant and lofty navy. Nor could they reſiſt the operation of this motive, prompting them to aſſiſt in the cutting off of a member, with which the growing aggrand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſement and power of britain were connected; as thus ſhe would be diſarmed of terror, and they ſhould be at reſt. If
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018198_0040_0FA5BF2F59657ED0"/>
britain doth not learn wiſdom by theſe events, and diſclaim the ſovereignty of the ocean, the junction of national na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies will ſettle the point for her, in leſs than half a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury. So wonderfully does divine providence order the time and coincidence of the public national motives, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating in effecting great public events and revolutions.</p>
            <p>But the time would fail me to recount the wonder work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providence of God, in the events of this war. Let theſe ſerve as a ſpecimen; and lead us to hope that God will not forſake this people; for whom he has done ſuch mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous things (whereof we are glad and rejoice this day) having at length brought us to the dawn of Peace. O PEACE! thou welcome gueſt! all hail, thou heavenly vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitant! calm the tumult of nations, and wave thy balmy wing to perpetuity over this region of liberty. Let there be a tranquil period for the unmoleſted accompliſhment of the <hi>magnalia dei,</hi> the great events in God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſigned from eternal ages to be diſplayed in theſe ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>And here I beg leave to <hi>congratulate</hi> my country, upon the termination of this cruel and unnatural war, the ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of hoſtilities, and the proſpect of PEACE. May this great event excite and elevate our firſt our higheſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to the ſovereign monarch of univerſal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the ſupreme diſpoſer and controller of all events; let this our pious, ſincere and devout gratitude aſcend in one general effuſion of heart-felt praiſe and hallelujah, in one united cloud of incenſe, even the incenſe of univerſal joy and thankſgiving to God from the collective body of the united ſtates.</p>
            <p>And while we render our ſupreme honors to the Moſt High, the God of armies; let us recollect, with affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate honor, the bold and brave ſons of freedom, who <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offered themſelves,</hi> and bled in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

and other gallant commanders and brave ſeamen of the American navy, have heroically fought the war by ſea and by land, merit of their once bleeding but now triumphant country, laurels, crowns, rewards, and the higheſt honors.

The ſound of thy fame ſhall go out into all the earth, and extend to diſtant ages. Thou has convinced the world of the BEAUTY OF VIRTUE—for in thee this BEAUTY ſhines with diſtinguiſhed luſtre.

            <p>Great and extenſive will be the happy effects of this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, in which we have been called in providence to fight out, not the liberties of america only, but the liberties of the world itſelf.

Ireland has become gloriouſly independent of england. Nor will the ſpirit reſt, till <hi>ſcotland</hi> becomes independent alſo. It would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier for the three kingdoms, to ſubſiſt with parliaments and national councils independent of one another, although confederated under one monarch. The union of 1707 has produced the loſs and diſmemberment of america. It is juſt poſſible, that within this age, ſome ill-fated counſellor of another connexion, might have ariſen, and prompted majeſty and parliament to ſanguinary meaſures againſt america: but it is more than probable, that their enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have been deferred, or procraſtinated a century hence, or to a period when our accumulated population would have dictated wiſer, milder meaſures, to the britiſh court; and ſo america, by a gentle, fraternal connexion, would have remained cemented to britain for diſtant ages. But a rehoboam counſellor ſtept in, <hi>et actum eſt de republica</hi>—the ten tribes are loſt. Had it not been for the inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and haughty councils of a <hi>Bute</hi> and a <hi>Mansfield,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued with principles incompatible with liberty; with the unwieldly faction of their deſpotic connexions in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, america and ireland had remained united with britain to this day. Chagrined and mortified by the defeat and diſhonor brought upon them by Butean councils and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as well as with their curtailed and unequal weight in parliament, <hi>ſcotland,</hi> emulous of the glory of <hi>ireland,</hi> will wiſh for and obtain a diſſolution of the union, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a ſeparate ſovereignty. It muſt be the <hi>lenity,</hi> the <hi>wiſdom,</hi> the gentle and pacific meaſures of an <hi>auguſtan</hi> age, that can conſerve the remnant of the britiſh empire from this tripartite diviſion.</p>
            <p>Nor will the britiſh iſles alone be relieved into liberty, but more extenſive ſtill will be the <hi>peaceable fruits</hi> of our righteous conflict.

All religious denominations will be independent of one another, as much as the greek and armenian patriarchates in the eaſt: and having, on account of religion, no ſuperiority as to ſecular powers and civil immnities, they will cohabit together in harmony, and I hope, with a moſt generous catholiciſm and benevolence. The example of a friendly cohabitation of all ſects in america, proving that men may be good mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of civil ſociety, and yet differ in religion: this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, I ſay, which has already been intently ſtudied and contemplated for fifteen years paſt by <hi>france, holland,</hi> and <hi>germany,</hi> may have already had an effect in introducing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, lenity, and juſtice, among european ſtates. And who can tell how extenſive a bleſſing this american <hi>Joſeph</hi> may become to the whole human race, although once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by his brethren, exiled and ſold into egypt? How applicable that in Gen. xlix. 22. 26. <hi>Joſeph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whoſe branches run over the wall. The Archers have ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and hated him. But his bow abode in ſtrength, the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the arms of the mighty God of Jacob.—The bleſſings of thy father, have prevailed above the bleſſings of my progenitors, unto the utmoſt bound of the everlaſting hill: they ſhall be on the head of</hi> JOSEPH, <hi>and on the crown of the head of him that was</hi> SEPARATED <hi>from his brethren.</hi>

in 1636. And while europe and aſia may hereafter learn that the moſt liberal principles of law and civil polity are to be found on this ſide the atlantic; they may alſo find the true religion here depurated from the ruſt and corruption of ages, and learn from us to reform and reſtore the church to its primitive purity. It will be long before the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical pride of the ſplendid european hierarchies, can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to learn wiſdom from thoſe, whom they have been inured to look upon with ſovereign contempt. But candid and liberal diſquiſition will ſooner or later have a great effect. Removed from the embarraſſments of corrupt ſyſtems, and the dignities and blinding opulence connected with them, the unfettered mind can think with a noble enlargement, and with an unbounded freedom, go wherever the light of truth directs. Here will be no bloody tribunals, no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals inquiſitors-general, to bend the human mind, force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to control the underſtanding, and put out the light of reaſon, the candle of the Lord, in man; to force an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>galileo</hi> to renounce truths demonſtrable as the light of day. Religion may here receive its laſt, moſt liberal, and impartial examination. Religious liberty is peculiarly friendly to fair and generous diſquiſition. Here deiſm will have its full chance; nor need libertines more to complain of being overcome by any weapons, but the gentle, the powerful ones of <hi>argument</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> Revelation will be found to ſtand the teſt to the ten thouſandth examination.</p>
            <p>There are three coetaneous events to take place, whoſe futurition is certain from prophecy, the annihilation of the pontificate, the reaſſembling of the jews, and the fulneſs of the gentiles. That liberal and candid diſquiſition of chriſtianity, which will moſt aſſuredly take place in ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, will prepare europe for the firſt event, with which the other will be connected, when, eſpecially on the return of the twelve tribes to the holy land, there will burſt forth a degree of evidence hitherto unperceived, and of efficacy to convert a world. More than three quarters of mankind yet remain heathen. Heaven put a ſtop to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chriſtianity, when the church became corrupted
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:018198_0056_0FA5BF3F21619FB0"/>
with the adoration of numerous deities and images, becauſe this would have been only exchanging an old for a new idolatry. Nor is chriſtendom now larger than it was nine centuries ago. The promiſing proſpects of the <hi>propaganda fide</hi> at <hi>rome</hi> are come to nothing; and it may be of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine deſtiny, that all other attempts for goſpelizing the nations of the earth ſhall prove fruitleſs, until the preſent chriſtendom itſelf be recovered to the primitive purity and ſimplicity. At which time, inſtead of the babel confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of contradicting miſſionaries, all will harmoniouſly concur in ſpeaking one language, one holy faith, one apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic religion, to an uncontroverted world. At this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, and in effecting this great event, we have reaſon to think, that the united ſtates may be of no ſmall influence and conſideration.

            <p>When we look forward and ſee this country increaſed to 40 or 50 millions, while we ſee all the religious ſects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into reſpectable bodies, we ſhall doubtleſs find the united body of the <hi>congregational, conſociated</hi> and <hi>preſbyterian</hi> churches, making an equal figure with any of them; or to ſay the leaſt, to be of ſuch magnitude as to number, that it will be to no purpoſe for other ſects to meditate their averſion. This, indeed, is enterprized, but it will end in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:018198_0057_0FA5BF4288DE9970"/>
a ſiſyphean labor. There is the greateſt proſpect that we ſhall become thirty out of forty millions. And while the avenues to civil improvement and public honors, will here be equally open to all ſects, ſo it will be no diſhonor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be a preſbyterian, or of the religious denomination which will probably ever make the moſt diſtinguiſhed figure in this great republic. And hereafter when the world ſhall behold us a reſpectable part of chriſtendom, they may be induced by curioſity, with calmneſs and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to examine, whether ſomething of chriſtianity may not really be found among us. And while we have to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our laodiceaniſm, deficient morals and incidental errors, yet the <hi>collective ſyſtem of evangelical doctrines,</hi> the <hi>inſtituted ordinances,</hi> and the true eccleſiaſtical <hi>polity,</hi> may be found here in a great degree of purity. Europeans and ſome among us, have habituated themſelves to a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible idea of the New-England churches—conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to be only a colluvies of error, fanaticiſm, irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and confuſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Peter's hiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Connecticu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This on the contrary is the truth, that, allowing for offences una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, for imperfections and controverſies, incident to the churches in their moſt regular ſtate, our churches are as completely reformed, and as well modelled according to the ſcripture plan, as can be expected till the millenium. Particularly theſe eſſential things may be found among them upon examination, that the churches or particular congregations are regularly formed, and duely uphold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip every Lord's day, and this ordinarily in a very decent ſolemn manner; that the <hi>preaching</hi> of the word, <hi>baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's ſupper</hi> are regularly and duely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by the paſtors: that the paſtors are orderly and regularly ſet apart to the miniſtry, by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery, or of thoſe who have regularly derived office power, in lineal ſucceſſion, from the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and Jeſus Chriſt. We have no claſſical or ſynodical tribunals: yet we have eceleſiaſtical councils. And our
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018198_0058_0FA5BF4422BABF40"/>
church diſcipline, although not ſufficiently attended to, is ſuch that perſons of evident ſcandal and immorality, and vicious miniſters (of which God be thanked, there have been but few, very few indeed) cannot live long in our churches. With all our humbling imperfections, I know of no amendment neceſſary, as to our general ſyſtem of church polity. Nothing of moment (unleſs it be <hi>grace</hi>) no <hi>doctrine,</hi> no <hi>ordinance</hi> or inſtitution of the primitive churches, but may be found in general reception and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance among us. If we are condemned for having no tribunals or judicatories out of the church, which however is not true, let it be remembred that neither Chriſt nor his apoſtles ever inſtituted any: and that in this reſpect, we are juſt in the ſame ſtate, with regard to eccleſiaſtical poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the 150 churches of the apoſtolic age,<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been computed, that the churches of the apoſtolic age did not exceed 150 or 200 congregations in the whole world.</note> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the ſeven churches of <hi>aſia,</hi> in the time of St. <hi>John.</hi>

            <p>The invalidity of our <hi>ordinations</hi> is objected againſt us, and ſo of conſequence the invalidity of all our official admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. And now that we are upon the matter, give me leave to exhibit a true, though ſummary ſtate of it, as the reſult of a very full, laborious, and thorough inquiry. It was the miſtaken opinion of ſome of our firſt miniſters in new-england (than whom, there never was a more learned collection, for they emboſomed all the theological and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical erudition of all ages), it was, I ſay, their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the power of ordination of all church officers, was in the church, by their elders. They well knew, from eccleſiaſtical and ſcripture antiquity, that the power of election was there; and they judged ordination the leſſer act: but their great reaſon was, that the church might not be controlled by any exterior authority, whether epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal or preſbyterial, and ſo no more be harraſſed by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops courts, or any other ſimilar tribunals. Our fathers held to an elderſhip, for they ſaw it in all antiquity, as well as the bible: and it was their judgment, that elders ſhould be ordained by elders of the ſame church. The moſt of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018198_0059_0FA5BF444F57DB40"/>
the firſt forty churches had ruling elders; a few had not. Theſe few created an early difficulty; on which our fathers early made a miſtaken deciſion, that where there were no elders in the church, ordination might be done by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands of delegated brethren. The introduction of miniſters, already ordained, into the paſtoral charge of a particular church, was at firſt done by lay-brethren; and this was, from the beginning, <hi>improperly</hi> called <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> how often ſoever repeated. A repetition of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or baptiſms, does not nullify the firſt regular admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. All the firſt new-england miniſters were ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. Thus Mr. Wilſon was firſt ordained by a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in england; then 1630 by governor <hi>Winthrop</hi> and others he was ordained <hi>teacher</hi> in <hi>boſton;</hi> he then ordained an elder: and upon the acceſſion of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> 1633, he was, by this elder and governor <hi>Winthrop,</hi> again, a third time, ordained and conſtituted paſtor. So the learned and courtly Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> was ordained by a biſhop, then by the brethren, paſtor of the church in new-haven, in 1639; and 1668, was again ordained, paſtor of the firſt church in <hi>boſton,</hi> by elder <hi>Penn.</hi> Mr. Hooker was ordained a preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a biſhop in england, and then again by the brethren at <hi>Newtown,</hi> 1633, who removed with his church to hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. Mr. Bulkly, of concord, and Mr. Noyes, of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and others, expreſsly adhered to their former ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in england by the biſhops, though not as biſhops, but as preſbyters.<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018198_0060_0FA5BF45656EDED8"/>
of the firſt churches, was performed by lay-brethren, and this was called ordination, but ſhould be conſidered what in reality it was, only induction or inſtalment of thoſe who were veſted with official power. Theſe, as I ſaid, were all ordained before by the biſhops in england. Nor have I ever found, with certainty, more than one inſtance of lay-ordination, of a perſon never before ordained, the laſt century, (and there are few but what I have examined)
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:018198_0061_0FA5BF46E1A32520"/>
and this was done by the advice, and under the inſpection of miniſters ordained by the biſhops in england, one of whom prayed at the ſolemnity of the conſecration, and all gave their approbation and right hand of fellowſhip; which in my opinion, amounts to their performing the ordination themſelves, they being preſent and aſſiſting in the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This was at <hi>woburn,</hi> 1642. I believe there were two or three more ſimilar ordinations of unordained candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, before the miniſters ſaw and corrected their error—which, indeed, was almoſt the only error, of moment, which the miniſters went into the laſt century.</p>
            <p>Immediately upon publiſhing the cambridge platform, 1648, our brethren in england remonſtrated againſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lay-ordination. They alledged, that we had no exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ſcripture of lay-ordination; that the ſacerdotal gift or office-power, was conferred and given <hi>by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">i. Tim. iv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
               </note> and that we had examples of preſbyterian ordination in ſcripture, and not only that it was ſafeſt to proceed in this way, but that it was the only ſcriptural ground. Theſe arguments convinced our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they immediately ſet about to remedy the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which had hitherto, providentially, wrought no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as the body of the paſtors had been ordained by bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. It inſtantly became a cuſtom for ſome of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained miniſters preſent to lay on hands in ordinations, it being for ſome time judged neceſſary, that the delegated brethren ſhould join, in token of ſubjection of the church to the paſtoral care of the miniſter. But at length it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a cuſtom, ſo early as before 1660, that, at the deſire of the church, the ordaining miniſters performed the whole, both conferred office-power on the paſtor elect, by the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, and committed the church to his paſtoral charge; which, with the joint fellowſhip of the paſtors and churches, finiſhed the ordination. Thus ordinations were recovered into their right ſtate and order, the laſt century, and before lay-ordinations had wrought any evil. Thus office-power, by ſcripture preſbyters, continued to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018198_0062_0FA5BF47444A2118"/>
through the clergy. I have reaſon and even aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to believe, that there was no candidate ordained in new-england, before 1746, but whoſe ordination may be traced to the biſhops in england. I have found no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the contrary, although I have ſearched and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined all the ordinations of the firſt half century here, and moſt of them for the firſt hundred years. And as to the wild and enthuſiaſtic period between 1740 and 1750, though it gave birth to perhaps thirty little <hi>ſeparate</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, yet ſome have diſſolved, others become regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and the ten or a dozen now remaining, are more and more convinced of the duty of ſeeking ordination from among the ſtanding miniſters. And it is remarkable, that Mr. <hi>Thomas Denniſon,</hi> now living, aſſiſted, laid on hands, and gave the charge at the firſt ordination, in 1746, and at the three ſucceeding ordinations among the <hi>ſeparates</hi> in new-england, from whence all the ordinations in the churches of that deſcription have proceeded. And although in the firſt, but not in the others, he acted as a brother delegated by the church, and in the others as an elder of another church, yet it is remarkable, I ſay, that he himſelf had been ordained, in 1743, by one, whoſe ordination I have traced to the <hi>Mathers,</hi> and other <hi>boſton</hi> miniſters, and through them up to the biſhop of <hi>cheſter,</hi> and other biſhops in <hi>england.</hi> It is probable the few ſeparate churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, will, in time, become regular, by ſeeking ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among the paſtors of the ſtanding churches, where the ordinations are indubitable.</p>
            <p>For, as I have ſaid, the ordination of our clergy is regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſcriptural, and may be traced, in the line of preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, up to the apoſtolic age: and ſo in general may the ordinations, in this line, through the whole chriſtian world, eſpecially in the great diviſions of <hi>lutherans, calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>church</hi> of <hi>england.</hi> So wonderfully has Chriſt preſerved the ſacerdotal or preſbyterian order in the church, that the ſucceſſion in this line is without a doubt. The firſt <hi>ninety-four</hi> miniſters who came over and ſettled new-england, long-Iſland, and the jerſeys, before 1669, and chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

1640—Theſe, I ſay, were all educated in the eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh univerſities, and were ordained in england. Some of whom, as <hi>Hooker, Davenport, Chauncy, Lee, Bulkley, Noyes, Norton,</hi> were men of univerſal reading in theological lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, and were profoundly verſed in the writings of the greek and latin churches, in the councils and hiſtorians, the fathers, the writers of the middle ages, and the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—eſpecially thoſe miracles of human and divine learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Chauncey</hi> and <hi>Lee.</hi> Of theſe ninety four, one or two on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were ordained by the puritans; as the fourteen, who came over after the ejection of 1662, were ordained by the biſhops, or more probably by the preſbyterians in the protectorate: all the reſt by the biſhops. All theſe were ordained preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters by the biſhops in england: particularly the Rev. Mr. Richard Mather was ordained a preſbyter by Dr. Morton biſhop of cheſter 1618.<note n="§" place="bottom">Life of Dr. Increaſe Mather.</note> The biſhops did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to communicate ordaining powers; but they really intended to convey all the power of a ſcripture-preſbyter; and <hi>by the ſcripture, we find this power conferred by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">i.

            <p>There is not an inſtance in the apoſtolic age, of <hi>biſhops, prieſts,</hi> and <hi>deacons,</hi> being ſtated officers of more than a ſingle congregation.

examined a thouſand times, with different judgments. Every congregation, regularly and fully organized, had them: as appears from <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the areopagite, and St. <hi>Ignatius.</hi> The ſucceſſion of biſhops, who were only the firſt preſbyters, as well as of the other elders, was preſerved by ordinations performed by preſbyters in or out of a church. And though ordinations were uſually performed by three or more, yet if only one preſbyter laid on hands, it was valid. Titus, a ſingle elder, was left thus, to ordain elders in <hi>crete.</hi> The church of alexandria, founded by St. Mark, retained preſbyterian ordination, excluſive, for 300 years, as appears from <hi>Eutychius,</hi> the patriarch there in the ninth century, who wrote the originals of that church in <hi>arabic,</hi> from which I have tranſlated the following extract, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>"The ninth year of <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> while Mark, the evangeliſt, reſided at <hi>alexandria—Hananies</hi> being convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to chriſtianity, <hi>Mark</hi> baptized him, and conſtituted or ordained him chief father at <hi>alexandria;</hi> and he became the firſt patriarch of <hi>alexandria. Mark,</hi> the evangeliſt, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtituted and ordained <hi>twelve</hi> (Caſhiſha<note n="*" place="bottom">The title Caſhies is given to the coptic clergy to this day.</note>) preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with <hi>Hananias;</hi> who ſhould abide with the patriarch; ſo that when there ſhould be a vacancy in the patriarchate, they ſhould elect one of the twelve preſbyters, upon whoſe head the other eleven ſhould impoſe their hands, bleſs him, and create him patriarch; and then elect ſome eminent perſon, and conſtitute him a preſbyter with themſelves, in the room of him who was made a patriarch; ſo that there ſhould always be twelve. Nor did this inſtitution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſbyters, ceaſe at alexandria, that they ſhould create the patriarchs out of the twelve preſbyters, until the times of <hi>Alexander,</hi> patriarch at alexandria, who was of the number of the three hundred and eighteen" (at the council of nice, A.

And he farther decreed, that on a vacancy in the patriarchate, they ſhould elect, either from the twelve preſbyters, or from any other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſome eminent perſon, and create him patriarch. And thus evaniſhed the antient inſtitution, by which the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch had been created by the preſbyters; and there ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in its place his decree concerning the creation of the patriarchs by the biſhops.

Upon the death of <hi>Demetrius, Heraclas</hi> became patriarch, and conſtituted <hi>twenty</hi> biſhops."<note n="*" place="bottom">Enty chij origines eccl. alexand.</note>

            <p>Thus, in this moſt valuable piece or reject of eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical antiquity, we have preſerved and tranſmitted to us a ſpecimen and exemplar of a truly primitive and apoſtolic church. And herein we have a full proof, that while there were fifteen hundred <hi>paſtors</hi> or <hi>Kaſhiſha,</hi> yet there were no biſhops in egypt in the poſterior appropriate ſenſe of the <hi>latin</hi> and <hi>greek</hi> churches, until the fourth century: altho' the chriſtians had by that time become ſo numerous in egypt, that in the moſt ſevere and memorable perſecution under <hi>maximianus,</hi> the predeceſſor of Conſtantine the great, one hundred thouſand chriſtians were put to death there, and ſeven hundred thouſand were ſold for ſlaves! a barbarity which ſatiated and glutted the malice of perſecution, and wrought a conviction in the whole roman empire, of the impoſſibility of ſubduing chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>Correſpondent to this idea of a church and its officers was the form particularly of the church of <hi>epheſus,</hi> and the ſeven churches of <hi>aſia,</hi> in the apoſtolic age; and the churches of new-england; wherein at their primitive inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, were originally two or more elders, beſides the paſtors and teachers, i. e. four preſbyters: although, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving generally, though not univerſally, dropt the ruling elders, they now more nearly reſemble the church of <hi>phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:018198_0066_0FA5BF4A4851BED8"/>
in having, at preſent, only biſhops and deacons. It might, however, be well to reſume the elderſhip as in the days of our anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to this primitive idea of a church, was the church of <hi>ireland</hi> planted and formed, by that great light of chriſtendom St. <hi>Patrick;</hi> who, (as <hi>Titus</hi> travelled <hi>crete,</hi> and ordained elders in every city) himſelf travelled <hi>ireland,</hi> converted it to chriſtianity, and conſtituted 355 churches, and in each ordained a ſett of elders, with a biſhop at their head;<note n="*" place="bottom">Nonnius, ſpeaking of St. Patrick, ſays, "Eccleſias 255 fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit, epiſcopos ordinavit eodem numero, preſbyteros autem uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad tria millia ordinavit."—See Nonnius, and Keating.</note> as did M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this unhallowed part of the univerſe, whether ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would be the happieſt on earth. It would greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to this, if MOSES and AARON, if the MAGISTRACY and PRIESTHOOD, ſhould co-operate, and walk together in union and harmony. The political effort of the preſent day, through moſt of the united ſtates, is to diſunite, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and ſeparate them, through fear, leaſt the united ſtates, like the five vice-royſhips of new ſpain, ſhould be entangled and oppreſſed with the ſpiritual domination of european and aſiatic hierarchies. As if, by the title of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or paſtor, we might not as well be reminded of the miniſters of <hi>holland</hi> and <hi>geneva,</hi> or the mild and peaceable paſtors of the primitive church, as of the domineering pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and other haughty intriguing dignitaries of the <hi>romiſh</hi> church. Hence AARON is ſpurned at a diſtance, and the LEVITES are beheld with ſhy contempt, as a uſeleſs, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, dangerous tribe: and in ſome of the ſtates, for the only ſin of being prieſts of the Moſt High God, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all civil offices, and to a great degree, disfranchiſed of their civil immunities and rights of citizenſhip. I thank my God for this ordering of his holy providence (for I wiſh the clergy never to be veſted with civil power) while I am conſidering the ſpirit and diſpoſition of the public towards the church of God, indicated by ſuch events. A general ſpirit reigns againſt the moſt liberal and generous eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in religion; againſt the civil magiſtrates encouraging or having any thing more to do about religion, than to keep the civil peace among contending ſects: as if this was all that is to be done for religion by the friends of Jeſus. And hence, in deſignating to the magiſtracy and offices of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it begins to be a growing idea that it is mighty indifferent, forſooth, not only whether a man be of this or the other religious ſect, but whether he be of any religion at all: and that truly deiſts, and men of indifferentiſm to all religion, are the moſt ſuîtable perſons for civil office, and moſt proper to hold the reins of government; and that to prevent partiality in governors, and emulation among the ſects, it is wiſe to conſign government over into the hands of thoſe who, <hi>gallio</hi> like, have no religion at all.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018198_0070_0FA5BF50026962C8"/>
This is machiavellian wiſdom and policy! And hence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are frequently adduced, of men diſtinguiſhed truly for <hi>deiſm,</hi> perhaps libidinous morals, and every vice, yet of great abilities, it is ſaid, great civilians, lawyers, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, warriors, governors, patriots, politicians: while as great or greater and more numerous characters, in the ſame departments, a <hi>Thuanus,</hi> a <hi>Grotius,</hi> a <hi>Paul,</hi> of venice, a Sir <hi>Henry Wotton,</hi> a Sir <hi>Peter King,</hi> a <hi>Selden,</hi> a <hi>Newton,</hi> a <hi>Boyle,</hi> thoſe miracles of wiſdom and friends to religion and virtue; are paſſed by with tranſient coolneſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.

            <p>Shall the Moſt High ſend down TRUTH into this world from the world of light and truth, and ſhall the rulers of this world be afraid of it? Shall there be no intrepid DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIELS?—great in magiſtracy, great in religion! How great was that holy man, that learned and pious civilian, when he ſhone in the ſupreme triumvirate, at the head of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of 120 provinces—venerable for political wiſdom, venerable for religion!</p>
            <p>If men, not merely nominally chriſtians, but of real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſincere piety, joined with abilities, were advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and called up to office in every civil department, how would it countenance and recommend virtue? But, alas! is there not too much laodiceaniſm in this land? Is not Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in danger of being wounded in the houſe of his friends? Nay, have we gone already ſuch lengths in declenſion, that if even the Holy Redeemer himſelf, and his apoſtles, were to reappear among us, while unknown to be ſuch, and importune the public government and magiſtracy of theſe ſtates, to become nurſing fathers to the church; is it not to be feared that ſome of the ſtates, through timidity and fearfulneſs of touching religion, would excuſe themſelves, and diſmiſs the holy meſſengers, the heavenly viſitants, with coldneſs and neglect; though importuning the ſpouſe with an, open to me my beloved, my ſiſter, my dove.</p>

But after the preſent period of deiſm and ſceptical indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferentiſm in religion, of timidity and irreſolution in the cauſe of the great <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> perhaps there may ariſe a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of civil magiſtrates, who will not be aſhamed of the croſs of Chriſt, nor of patronizing his holy religion; with a generous catholiciſm and expanded benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all of every denomination, who love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity and truth; patronizing it, I repeat, not with the inſidious views of a <hi>Hutchinſonian</hi> policy, but from a rational and firm belief and love of evangelical truth. Zion's friends will rejoice in Zion's welfare: and the <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> as well as <hi>civil</hi> patriot will ſhine in the faces of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Moſes's</hi> and <hi>Joſhuas</hi> of this land. So ſhone it in the firſt governor WINTHROP, and ſo ſhineth it in a WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. Yea, I glory in believing and knowing, that there are many now in the public magiſtracy of this and the other ſtates, who feel with that illuſtrious and moſt excellent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, upon whom reſted much of the ſpirit of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of <hi>Jehoſaphat, Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah,</hi> I mean <hi>Nehemiah the Tirſhata,</hi> who, with <hi>Moſes,</hi> eſteemed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of egypt, who was of ſo pious, ſo noble, ſo patriotic a ſpirit, ſuch a lover of his country and the true religion, that he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the very <hi>duſt of zion</hi> to the gardens of <hi>perſia,</hi> and the broken walls of <hi>jeruſalem</hi> to the palaces of <hi>ſhuſhan.</hi>

            <p>Whenever religion is erected on the ruins of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and when civil government is built on the ruins of religion, both are ſo far eſſentially wrong.

            <p>The american <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> the opulent and pious Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor WINTHROP I. and the other firſt magiſtrates of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral new-england republics, were men of ſingular wiſdom and exemplary piety. And, God be thanked, the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial <hi>aſſembly</hi> of this happieſt of all the united ſtates, ſtill emboſoms ſo many <hi>Phinehas's</hi> and <hi>Zorobabels,</hi> ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious patriots, the friends of Jeſus and his holy religion: and that the Meſſiah's cauſe is here accompanied with <hi>civil government</hi> and the <hi>prieſthood</hi>—alluſively <hi>the two olive trees upon the right of the candleſtick</hi> (the churches) <hi>and upon the left; the two golden branches, which through the two golden pipes,</hi> Moſes and Aaron, <hi>empty the golden oil out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Zech. iv. 11.</note> and diffuſe their ſalutary influence of order and happineſs through the community.</p>
            <p>As to nominal chriſtianity, I have no doubt but that it will be upheld for ages in theſe ſtates. Through the liberty enjoyed here, all religious ſects will grow up into large and reſpectable bodies. But the congregational and preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian denomination, however hitherto deſpiſed, will, by the bleſſing of heaven, continue to hold the greateſt figure in america; and, notwithſtanding all the fruitleſs labors and exertions to proſelyte us to other communions, become more numerous than the whole collective body of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low proteſtants in europe. The whole proſelytiſm of new-england in particular, for 60 or 70 years paſt, has not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded eight or ten thouſand, while our augment in that term, by natural increaſe, has been half a million. The future difference in our favour will be far greater, even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a tenfold increaſe of proſelytiſm. We anticipate, with pleaſure, the growth and multiplication of our church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. God grant that we may not, like the ſeven churches

of aſia, have a name to live, while we are dead. Happy will it be for us, ſhould we become a holy people, zealous of good works. For it is undoubtedly the will of heaven, and eſpecially after the recent ſalvations of the Moſt High, that we ſhould be <hi>a holy people unto the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is greatly to be wiſhed that theſe principles of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chriſtianity, might be found in general reception among <hi>all the churches</hi> of theſe ſtates.</p>
            <p>The trinity in unity, in the one undivided eſſence of the Great JEHOVAH.</p>
            <p>The ſacred ſcriptures are of divine inſpiration.</p>
            <p>In the immenſe univerſe, two little ſyſtems of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, or orders of being, have lapſed: and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily we have the diſhonor of being one of them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond perſon of the co-eternal trinity, having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed human nature, made a real atonement for ſin, and by his vicarious obedience and ſufferings, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited that righteouſneſs and vicarious merit, by which alone we are forgiven and juſtified.</p>
            <p>The holy ghoſt is equally a divine perſon with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the ſon; ſharing with them divine, ſupreme, equal and undivided honors.</p>
            <p>True virtue conſiſts in a conformity of heart and life to the divine law; which is as obligatory upon chriſtians as if eternal life was ſuſpended on perfect obedience.</p>
            <p>The internal principle of holineſs eſſentially conſiſts in DIVINE LOVE, a diſintereſted affection for moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, a delight in the beauty and glory of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, that is, the ſupreme LOVE OF GOD. And connected with, and iſſuing from this, is a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acquieſcence in his will, a rejoicing in his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and univerſal dominion.</p>
            <p>While ſalvation and pardon is of free grace, the retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of eternity will be according to our works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:018198_0074_0FA5BF5347C13EA8"/>
Whenever I find theſe principles, with others connected with them, and the <hi>real</hi> belief of them evinced by an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, there I judge the eſſentials of chriſtianity to be found, and thither my charity and benevolence extends, with equal ardor and ſincerity, be the religious denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as it may. Of theſe, the doctrines of the DIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NITY of the Lord Jeſus, and his real vicarious ATONEMENT, are the moſt important, the <hi>jachin</hi> and <hi>boaz,</hi> the pillar truths of the goſpel, the <hi>articuli ſtantis &amp; cadentis eccleſioe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the ſyſtem of theology brought over from the other ſide of the flood, by our pious forefathers, now with God. The more this is realized in a ſtate, the more will its felicity be advanced. For certainly the morals of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity are excellent. It enjoins obedience to magiſtracy, juſtice, harmony, and benevolence, among fellow citizens; and what is more, it points out immortality to man. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians indeed uſually conſider religion only as it may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſubſerve civil purpoſes: and hence it is mighty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to them, what the ſtate of religion be, provided they can <hi>ride in the whirlwind, and direct the ſtorm.</hi> No thing is more common than to ſee them, in every country, making uſe of ſects for their own ends, whom they, in their hearts, deſpiſe and ridicule with ſupreme contempt. Not ſo the chriſtian patriot, who, from his heart, wiſhes the advancement of chriſtianity, much leſs for the civil good than for the eternal welfare of immortal ſouls. We err much, if we think the only or chief end of civil government is <hi>ſecular happineſs.</hi> Shall immortals, illuminated by <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> entertain ſuch an opinion? God forbid! Let us model civil ſociety with the adoption of <hi>divine inſtitutions,</hi> ſo as ſhall beſt ſubſerve the training up and diſciplining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable millions for the more glorious ſociety of the church of the firſt born! Animated with the ſublime ideas which chriſtianity infuſes into a people, we ſhall be led to conſider the <hi>true religion</hi> as the higheſt glory of a civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. The chriſtian inſtitution ſo excelled in glory, that the moſaic loſt all its glory. So the moſt perfect ſecular polity, though very excellent, would loſe all its glory,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018198_0075_0FA5BF5402D73028"/>
when compared with a <hi>kingdom wherein dwelleth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> a community wherein the religion of the divine Jeſus reigns in vigour and perfection.</p>
            <p>Let us inſtitute a compariſon of religions in three differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent polities, which will ſufficiently repreſent the ſtate of the whole world. And may that ſpirit, which juſtly ſprings from ſuch a compariſon, animate all, whether in humble life, or in the moſt elevated ſtations among mankind. We may conſider three contiguous empires of the ſame civil po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, all alike as to the ſocial virtues, laws of juſtice, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, and the morals of civil ſociety—for I mean to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a very liberal and candid compariſon. On the one of theſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed the <hi>idolatry of the</hi> BONZAS, as a ſpecimen of all the idolatrous religions: <hi>Deiſm</hi> ſhall cover the ſecond: and of the unidolatrous religions, I will ſelect for the third, not the <hi>mahometan,</hi> not the <hi>jewiſh,</hi> but the <hi>chriſtian,</hi> in its pureſt <hi>apoſtolic form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the firſt, the ſpecies of idolatry is indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>antient</hi> or <hi>modern,</hi> that of the <hi>Druids</hi> or <hi>Zoroaſter,</hi> of the <hi>Bramins</hi> or <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> or laſtly, that of the great LAMA, of <hi>Potola,</hi> which is the moſt extenſive, as well as moſt ſplendid, religion on earth, being the religion of one third of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. Let us ſelect the laſt: it has for its baſis, in common with all other idolatrous ſyſtems, adoration and worſhip, of ſome kind or other, to an hierarchy of celeſtial ſpirits as our interceſſors and protectors under the ſupreme God. Theſe have been, in all ages, the MAHUZZIM of <hi>Daniel;</hi> who predicts the apoſtacy of the church to the worſhip of Mahuzzim departed ſouls, inviſible ſpirits as interceſſors with God. This is the real baſis of all idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, antient and modern. Theſe were the <hi>Baalim</hi> and the <hi>Heroes.</hi> And it is juſt indifferent, whether we ſacrifice and pray to <hi>Hercules</hi> or to <hi>St. Paul,</hi> to the thirty thouſand gods of athens, or the ſaints of the calender, as advocates with the Father of the Univerſe. Now let the inhabitants of an empire be reſolved into religious aſſemblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, for the ſacrifical worſhip of theſe inferior divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018198_0076_0FA5BF54BA609480"/>
with a ſplendid <hi>ceremonial</hi> and <hi>prieſthood.</hi> Who does not ſee, in theſe enlightened realms, that all this is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deluſion, a transfer of worſhip to the creature from the Creator—who may well ſay, <hi>who hath required this at your hands?</hi> If it be ſaid that ſupreme worſhip is not rendered to the ſaints of the pontifical canonization: ſo neither was it by the ten tribes, all of whom, but eight thouſand, kiſſed the calves and worſhipped the numerous Baalim, Heroe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or demi-gods. Dr. Middleton has ſhewn that the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal worſhip, with a change of names only, is paid at <hi>rome</hi> to the modern canonized ſaints, as to the deified he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes of the antient romans and greeks. The laſt effort of the <hi>philoſophers</hi> againſt chriſtianity, was in the time of <hi>Julian;</hi> and they ſubordinated the whole ſyſtem of ethnical worſhip to the worſhip of the ſupreme Being, aſſerting that as chriſtians acknowledge the miniſtry of angels, ſo they held with the miniſtry of genii that of deceaſed and departed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who muſt be ſuppoſed to retain a peculiar affection for their families, cities and kingdoms on earth; eſpecially for thoſe who ſhould have referred themſelves to their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and interceſſion with the Deus O. M. the ſupreme God. Thus they defended themſelves upon the very ſame reaſoning, as that upon which the chriſtian idolatry is defended. We are directed to aſk the prayers of our fellow chriſtians on earth; and by parity why ſhould we not aſk their prayers in heaven, where they muſt be ſuppoſed to have far greater influence? And if we are directed to treat one another, and eſpecially great benefactors of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with public reſpect while here, why not by parity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this reſpect and the ſymbols of honor to them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? What a beautiful gradation is there, it is ſaid, in the ethnical and chriſtian worſhip or aſcription of gratitude to inferior and powerful interceſſors? And how does it tend to keep alive in our minds and impreſs them with glorious ideas of that grand, auguſt, and beautiful ſyſtem of agency and ſubordinate adminiſtrations, in the great go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the one Great Supreme? How beautiful the ſubordinate mediation of <hi>angels</hi> and <hi>ſaints,</hi> under the all-comprehenſive mediation of the bleſſed JESUS, thro' whom
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018198_0077_0FA5BF558D9E38A8"/>
all worſhip, adoration and homage is to aſcend to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the Univerſe! Let us be aſſured that the romaniſts think themſelves to have great reaſon for the adoration of the ſuperior powers.</p>
            <p>Adjacent to this, an empire of the ſame excellent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſhall be overſpread with DEISM excluſively. And to give the idea the moſt candid extent, perhaps beyond the deſires of a <hi>Tindal,</hi> or even of a <hi>Shaftſbury</hi> the amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Confucius</hi> of deiſm, not to mention the ſmaller and more deſultory geniuſſes of a <hi>Hume,</hi> or a <hi>Voltaire;</hi> neither of whom had any more taſte or judgment in religion, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſoning, than <hi>Cicero</hi> in poetry, or <hi>Cibber</hi> for the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma:—I ſay, to give the faireſt idea of perfect deiſm, let the people of this empire be reſolved into occaſional, but not too frequent, worſhipping aſſemblies for worſhipping the God of nature, under the direction of the illuminated brethren, or of ſome right worſhipful brother: and alſo to thank God for his goodneſs in this life, and for a certain proſpect of a bleſſed immortality, if there ſhould be any; when, perhaps ſome noble minds, ſpirits of elevated and ſublime genius, of bold, refined, and independent ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might deſcant upon the common principles of ſocial virtue and benevolence. I have certainly done juſtice to deiſm; <hi>although we hear nothing of pardoning mercy,</hi> becauſe truly we need none—ſuch being the excellency and dignity of man, who, as <hi>Phocelides</hi> ſaith, is <hi>the image of God,</hi> that he well anſwers the end of exiſtence, merits reward, and muſt hereafter be happy under the all-comprehending, the moſt benevolent adminiſtration of the univerſal FATHER. How pure and ſublime is natural religion!</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY ſhall be the eſtabliſhment of the third territorial empire. And to preclude the ſectarian prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from diſturbing the clearneſs and calmneſs of the mental perception, let any one overſpread it with the BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLE chriſtianity, according to his own idea. I for myſelf might overſpread the whole with the congregational churches; being not ſimply ſatisfied, but ſure, from a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:018198_0078_0FA5BF564816C530"/>
perluſtration of all eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that they are nearly apoſtolical as to <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>polity.</hi> And let this juſtice further be done, that religion ſhall reign in the hearts and lives of the people at large; and that it be the great and harmonious endeavour of the ruling characters and influential perſonages through the ſtate, both by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and precept, to ſupport ſuch a reign of virtue and holineſs. All that is valuable and truly excellent in the other empires, is embraced; and in addition, we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and offers, and aſſurances, great in the confeſſion of all men, if true, and glorious beyond deſcription, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely momentous indeed, and infinitely ſurpaſſing what is to be found in all the mythologies or moral ſyſtems around the globe. But I do not enlarge.</p>
            <p>Ten thouſand myriads of ages hence, in which of theſe three, would the <hi>civilian,</hi> the <hi>patriot,</hi> the man of <hi>religion,</hi> wiſh to have been found? In which to have acted his part?—for moſt certainly they are not indifferent—and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing its glory, to have exerted the talents and activity, with which the Author of Nature had bleſſed him?</p>
            <p>Which of theſe governments is it probable would moſt contribute to the ſecular welfare, and be attended with the greateſt dignity, and even the greateſt worldly ſplendor? But above all, which moſt ſubſervient to eternity and its momentous concerns? In which, as a ſchool of inſtitution and diſcipline, ſhould we enjoy the happieſt advantages for immortality? Which of theſe empires would be the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite of JESUS? Or is he indeed an unconcerned ſpectator of human affairs? If not, why ſhould we doubt or heſitate to give the preference to the <hi>chriſtian republic?</hi> If revelation be not true, it does us no hurt: we are as ſafe and as well off as others, having all their <hi>moral virtue.</hi> But if revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be true, it is <hi>true excluſively,</hi> and therefore to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to at peril. This is no proof: but it is a reaſon for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing our attention to its evidence, both in <hi>miracles</hi> and <hi>prophecy,</hi> as well as in a certain <hi>internal beauty and glory</hi> opened by heaven upon a benighted world:—Peradventure

Which will be the caſe, the happy fact, the moment we perceive the evidence of the one ſingle fact of the RESURRECTION OF CHRIST, after his undoubted crucifixion:—a fact teſtified by eye witneſſes, and ſupported by evidence (preſerved in memoirs, which have come down to us with greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity than <hi>Juſtin</hi> or <hi>Tacitus</hi>) evidence, I ſay, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked indeed, but never overthrown, and which at once will ſupport the whole glorious ſuperſtructure of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
            <p>But I need pardon that I ſhould inſtitute this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in a chriſtian aſſembly, and in a country where we ſeem to be in no danger of idolatry, and where, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Deiſts are very thinly ſown, although, like another ſet of men among us, of illaudable and invidious deſcription, they magnify themſelves into legions.</p>
            <p>I have ſuppoſed all religions equal as to virtue: and that civil virtue is the only end of civil ſociety: but I muſt reſume both theſe miſtakes. Vices and every ſpecies of wickedneſs are found, more or leſs, to enter into the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all religions, except that of divine revelation. If chriſtians are wicked, and even ſhould they ſurpaſs the gentiles in vice, their religion never taught them ſo. But the very inſtitution of the feſtivals of the ancient gods and goddeſſes directly taught the moſt impure obſcenities and libidinous revellings. And this is continued to this day in the Eaſt-Indies. An indian <hi>Bramin</hi> ARUNASALEM, a Pandarum or Prieſt of <hi>Tarmaburam,</hi> was converted to chriſtianity in 1765: upon which the college of Panda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſent him a letter to reclaim him. Too long, ſays he in his reply, too long have I been a witneſs to public lewdneſs in the ſacrifices and worſhip of your pagodas or temples. My conſcience told me theſe inſtitutions could
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:018198_0080_0FA5BF588CBB4318"/>
not come from a pure and holy God. O my God! how do I lament that I have been 28 years thine enemy. No ablution, no ſacrifice of <hi>Lingam</hi> can waſh away ſin and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify the ſoul: the blood ſufferings and ſacrifice of JESUS <hi>Nadar</hi> the redeemer, alone cleanſe from all ſin.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In an account of his converſion, written by himſelf, he ſays, "I was much ſcandalized by the profane and immoral ſervice performed in our Pagodas At Supramanciam a famous pago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da three leagues from Goa, the image of a ſerpent with ſeven heads is worſhipped: at a certain feſtival, three girls of the moſt beautiful ſhape dance before him, ſtark naked, in ſight of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of ſpectators.

                  <p>Whereupon the college of Pandarams, at Tarmaburam, wrote him a very flattering and expoſtulatory letter.

            <p>Sir <hi>William Temple, Sale,</hi> and other learned deiſts, fond of depreciating chriſtian virtue by compariſons, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and celebrated the <hi>mahometan, chineſe</hi> and other ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental morals, as far ſuperior to the chriſtian. But the learned hiſtoriographer Principal <hi>Robertſon</hi> aſſerts with hiſtoric verity, that upon the compariſon of europe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in its <hi>gentile</hi> and <hi>chriſtian</hi> ages, her morality will appear to have been greatly improved and meliorated, and that the ethnic morals fell far below the chriſtian. While we have to confeſs and lament the vice rampant in chriſtendom, we have reaſon to believe that the more chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity prevails in a country, civil ſociety will be more advanced, ferocious manners will give way to the more mild, liberal, juſt and amiable manners of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Be it granted that in all countries are to be found men of integrity, honor, benevolence and excellent morals, even where vice has a prevalent reign, to the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of a general licentiouſneſs; yet ſuppoſing a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,

a kingdom, a world overſpread with ſuch characters, with the fineſt morals of a <hi>Socrates</hi> or a <hi>Confucius,</hi> what would be the moral ſtate of ſuch a country, in compariſon with one overſpread with the reign of the chriſtian morals? I mean in perfection.</p>
            <p>How much ſoever we may admire the morals of <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Epictetus,</hi> they are not to be compared with thoſe taught by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the divine <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Nor are we to conceive that civil virtue is the only end of civil government. As the end of God's government is his declarative glory in the holineſs and happineſs of the univerſe; ſo all civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ought to ſubſerve the ſame end. The moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential intereſts of rational beings are neglected, when their ſecular welfare only is conſulted. If therefore we defend and plead for chriſtianity, from its ſecular and civil utility only, and leave it here, we diſhonor religion by robbing it of half, nay its greateſt glories. It ſerves an higher pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For altho' it ſubſerves the civil welfare infinitely beyond the morals of deiſm and idolatry, yet it alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for the intereſts of eternity, which no other religion does. It opens to us the moſt grand and ſublime diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning God, reconciliation with him, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union of this lapſed world with the immenſe univerſe. Diſcoveries momentous and intereſting beyond conception! Without which we are left to perfect incertitude, if not totally in the dark with reſpect to eternity and its vaſt concerns.</p>
            <p>Should we have recourſe to the <hi>goodneſs of God;</hi> yet of all beings, angels would think, that man ſhould be the laſt, to reaſon from the benevolence and goodneſs of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal parent, to the impoſſibility of his offspring being involved in future ill, when from thence we might equally reaſon againſt the exiſtence of preſent ill. If ſome diſtant ſeraph, who never knew nor heard of ill, ſhould reaſon thus, it would be no marvel, perhaps: but that we, with all our ſins and ſufferings about us, ſhould go into ſuch reaſonings, is the height of folly, the abſurdity of abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!

which in truth only cloaths the taedium the wearineſs of half diſcuſſed unfiniſhed inquiries; or perhaps the hope that at worſt the want of certain knowledge may paſs with God, if there is any, as a ſufficient excuſe for ſome of the doubtful levities of life.</p>
            <p>But errors in judgment, it is ſaid, will be of no account with God. In ten thouſand matters they may not. We may trifle on many things; but on the things that reſpect eternity, the things of religion, it is too ſolemn, too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to trifle. Although moſt religions are falſe and ridiculous, there may however be one, which we muſt renounce or trifle with at our peril. For if revelation be true, as moſt aſſuredly it is, it is in Jeſus only that we have eternal life. Infidels, and thoſe exceſſively benevolent chriſtians, who conſider all religions alike and equally ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, do well, in their calmer moments to ponder thoſe words of the eternal Judge, Mat. x. 33.

It is obſervable, that, by a particular turn of genius and a peculiar diſcipline in early life, God often prepares great characters, for that future uſefulneſs and eminence, for which they are deſigned in the world.

Let us with the greateſt aſſiduity devote ourſelves to our Lord's work, as ambaſſadors of the Prince of Peace. Let us preach the divinity and unſearchable riches of Chriſt, and ſalvation by his atonement; that theological ſyſtem, which places the whole of redemption upon free grace—a grace free as to us, tho' merited by the holy Redeemer. Let us ſearch the ſcriptures for the real evangelical verity: and inquire, not ſo much for new theories in divinity, as what truths were known and realized in <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> by the primitive chriſtians of the apoſtolic age, and the three firſt centuries; and believe that no other ſyſtem, no other doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines are eſſentially neceſſary to carry men to heaven in theſe ages, than thoſe which enabled the myriads of holy martyrs to ſeal the teſtimony of Jeſus with their blood.</p>
               <p>There is but one true ſyſtem of theology, and this has been equally known in all the chriſtian ages. For altho'
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:018198_0095_0FA5BF66D61C7238"/>
great improvements and diſcoveries are daily making in philoſophy and natural ſcience, yet there have been no new diſcoveries in divinity, ſince the apoſtolic age: I do not mean merely no new revelation, but of the innumerable latent truths concealed in the bible (and there are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly greater treaſures hidden there than in nature) none have been percieved in later ages, but what have been as clearly diſcerned by the contemplative theologians of all ages. The ſentiments are the ſame, tho' cloathed in different dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Philoſophy, as I ſaid, is improving, nor has the progreſs of civil ſociety yet reached its ſummit: but divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, I apprehend, has been long at a ſtand, having ages ago come to the higheſt perfection intended us at preſent by heaven; which did not deſign any further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it, from the ſealing of the viſion till the ſecond coming of Chriſt. In the millenium theſe hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will be brought forth. But for the preceding period, divinity will be and remain at a ſtand, except perhaps that towards the cloſe of it, the prophecies will diſcloſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Religion has had and will have different faſhions, even where it is ſtill eſſentially the ſame. Previous to the tenth century, the writings of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> gave an extenſive complexion to theology: afterwards <hi>Lombard'</hi>s collection of ſentences o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We deſpiſe the <hi>fathers</hi> and the pious and learned divines of the <hi>middle</hi> ages: pious poſterity will do the ſame by us; and twirl over our moſt favorite authors with the ſame ignorant pity and neglect:—happy they, if their favorite authors contain the ſame bleſſed truths.</p>
               <p>I rejoice that God has hitherto preſerved a learned and evangelical miniſtry in theſe churches. The theology in general reception, comprehends all the excellent things of
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:018198_0096_0FA5BF67766E18E8"/>
our common chriſtianity. And if ſome favorite <hi>hurekas,</hi> ſome fancied diſcoveries, ſhould be burnt up in the day of the Lord, yet there will be left as great an abundance of precious ſtones, of the tried and pure gold of truth, as in any part of the world. Indeed we have gotten all the light of chriſtendom, and we need no more. We have enough: we are wealthy in ſacred knowledge. We may ſpend long lives, in making ourſelves maſters of that vaſt treaſure of ſacred wiſdom, which holy men of great light have attained. May I comprehend with all ſaints the height and depth of this knowledge, may my God poſſeſs me of this treaſure, and I am content. All this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to the greateſt extent of the human limit, has been gotten and acquired over and over again and again. Like other ſcience, to every generation it ſeems new, while it is only poſſeſſing the knowledge familiar to our predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>Moreover, charity, union and benevolence are peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ornamental in the miniſterial order. Let us cheriſh theſe amiable graces in ourſelves and others. Let us be faithful. And the nearer we come to the ſolemn moment when we muſt render our account to God the Judge, the more may we be quickened and animated in the miniſtry: and think no labor, no aſſiduity too great, nothing too much to be done for the ſalvation of precious and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls, nothing too much for the cauſe and kingdom of him who hath loved us to the death.
