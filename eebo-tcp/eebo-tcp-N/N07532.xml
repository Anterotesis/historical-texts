            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is well known to this numerous Audience, that the ſad and melancholy Occaſion of our aſſembling this Day, is, to ſee the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice upon the condemned <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> here preſent: And, as our Deſign in coming into the Houſe of GOD this Morning, is, to give <hi>Him</hi> one more Opportunity of hearing a Meſſage from the Oracles of GOD, and ſo from the Throne of Grace; as alſo to preſent our united Supplications to the ALMIGHTY in his Behalf, and to hear what GOD the LORD has to ſay unto us upon this ſolemn and affecting Occaſion,</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore addreſs myſelf immediately to the Conſideration of ſome Things, ſuitable, both to employ the Thoughts of the <hi>Criminal,</hi> (whoſe immortal Soul, before Night, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him) and alſo to aſſiſt the Meditations, and animate the Devotion of us all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009616_0004_0F77458FB3223D90"/>But, who of us can think of the guilty Cauſe of this general Concourſe, without feeling our Heart ſtruck, and deeply too, with the different Senſations of ſevere <hi>Indignation,</hi> and tender <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion?</hi> Indignation, at the black and horrid <hi>Crime</hi>; but Compaſſion to the abandon'd <hi>Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal?</hi> For we ought to pity his Perſon, tho' he is juſtly condemn'd to Death; and to pray for the Salvation of his immortal Soul, tho' we greatly abhor his Action.</p>
            <p>However; all our Pity, our Prayers and beſt Endeavours to recover him to a thoro' Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to the Mercy and Favour of GOD, would be abſolutely vain and without the leaſt Hopes of Succeſs, were it not for the Conſideration of, <hi>The</hi> BLOOD <hi>of</hi> SPRINKLING, <hi>that ſpeaketh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Things than the</hi> BLOOD <hi>of</hi> ABEL. Here is the Encouragement we have, to perſevere in uſing Means with <hi>Him,</hi> or indeed with any other Tranſgreſſor: And ſince it has pleaſed the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely merciful GOD to provide this ſovereign and powerful Remedy, for the Salvation of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that have deſtroy'd themſelves; therefore, as long as Life and Breath laſt, and as long as the Goſpel ſounds in our Ears, we ſhould be ſtriving, uſing Means, &amp;c. Becauſe, ſo long as we are favoured with Life, Reaſon, and the Goſpel, we have the rich Bleſſings of Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption held forth to us all, and freely offered to our Acceptance, thro' the virtuous Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Nevertheleſs; our Malady is to be ſet before us, antecedent to our Remedy; for <hi>the whole need not a Phiſician, but they that are ſick;</hi> and the Words of Scripture I have now read to you, as they refer to the <hi>Blood of Abel</hi> and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009616_0005_0F77459074B19BD8"/>
               <hi>Blood of Jeſus,</hi> (in which Light I conſider them) do furniſh us with ſuitable Matter, to anſwer both theſe Ends in <hi>general,</hi> and to anſwer the preſent Occaſion in <hi>particular</hi>; for,</p>
            <p>I think, we can hardly mention, or hear men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the <hi>Blood of</hi> ABEL, without bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh to our Minds, the horrible Murder that was perpetrated upon him by his Brother <hi>Cain</hi>; which Murder of <hi>Abel,</hi> as it was committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely without a great many of thoſe external Cauſes, Provocations, and Motives, that have oftentimes embolden'd, and hurried on other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious Sinners to the like guilty Act; on this Account, it ſeems nearly related, and a good deal ſimilar to the Murder we now deplore, and for which the Murderer is ſoon to be executed.</p>
            <p>Among the various Kinds, or Denominations of Homicide or Man-killing, I can think of but three Things that will free the Agent from the Guilt of innocent Blood in ſuch Inſtances, viz. either profound <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or what is called <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi> or <hi>Self-Defence;</hi> in all which Caſes, it is ſuppoſed that the <hi>Actor</hi> may be innocent, and accordingly Proviſion is made for his Safety, both in the Law of GOD and <hi>Man.</hi> Theſe Caſes excepted, there is no Excuſe for the Murderer; he muſt die, or the Guilt of Blood will lay upon the Community.</p>
            <p>As for Suicide (or Self-Murder) which is the worſt of all; nothing but <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> leave us any Ground to hope favorably of the Self-Deſtroyer. But as this is not the Crime un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration, I ſhall ſay nothing about it: Neither ſhall I inſiſt or enlarge upon the <hi>Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> which prove, that <hi>Murder</hi> is a Sin of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009616_0006_0F774591360B8688"/>
moſt enormous Size that we can commit againſt our Fellow-creatures, ſince the <hi>Evidences</hi> hereof are ſo deeply ſtampt, in the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> of GOD, and of <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I have mainly in my View, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is, to make ſome Repreſentation of the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs of the <hi>Crime</hi> of Murder, and alſo of the only <hi>Remedy</hi> provided by GOD for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the penitent Criminal; both of which Caſes will be toucht upon, if we attend to what is referred to in the Text: And accordingly I propoſe, with Brevity, to conſider the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What the Things were, that the <hi>Blood</hi> of ABEL ſpake. 2dly. What the better Things are, that the <hi>Blood</hi> of JESUS ſpeaks: Which done, the Way will be open, 3dly. For a pointed Addreſs to the <hi>Criminal</hi> in particular. And 4thly. A Word of Admonition and Exhortation to all in general. And may the SPIRIT of GOD be with us, to aſſiſt the Speaker and the Hearers; by whoſe gracious Influence alſo, may we all be thoro'ly convinced of Sin, and have <hi>that</hi> Blood of Sprinkling applied to us, which ſpeaketh bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Things than <hi>that</hi> of ABEL.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We are to conſider what the Things were, that the Blood of ABEL ſpake: In doing which, we ſhall naturally be led back to view the tragic Scene that open'd to the World, the firſt Inſtance of Murder;<note n="*" place="bottom">From that Time Virtue dates her Perſecution from Vice. Biſhop of Meaux's Uni. Hiſt. Vol. I.</note> and alſo the Proceſs of Juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the audacious Criminal.</p>
            <p>You well remember the affecting Hiſtory, by which we are informed that the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009616_0007_0F7745920AF7C510"/>
was ſhed by the Hand of his own, and only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cain,</hi> with whom he was bro't up and lived in Peace; againſt whom he had no Quarrel, and to whom he gave no Cauſe of Offence. <hi>Cain</hi> was the abandoned Wretch, who (inſtigated by Satan, and led on by the Envy, Malice, and Hatred of his own Heart) ſought, and found an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to vent the Rage and Malice of his Heart in the Murder of his Brother: <hi>Curſed be his Anger for it was fierce, and his Wrath for it was cruel</hi>; cruel to the laſt Degree, for nothing could allay the groundleſs Anger of his guilty Heart, or calm the raging Storm of unprovok'd Wrath and Envy in his troubled Breaſt, but the Death of his loving and harmleſs Brother. Unnatural <hi>Cain!</hi> to point his deadly Hatred and Fury againſt his pious Brother. But this he did, and his furious Paſſion roſe, and flam'd higher and higher, 'till it burſt forth, and impetuouſly drove him on to commit the horrid Deed. He roſe up againſt his Brother—all of a ſudden and in a Rage he ſmote him—the Blow was fatal—inſtantly the Blood guſhes forth, and runs from his wounded Body, and his Life tranſpires with his Blood—<hi>Abel</hi> is dead—the Deed is done, and it can neither be recall'd or cancell'd; for tho' <hi>Abel</hi> himſelf could not ſpeak, yet his Blood ſpake, and ſpake with a Voice ſo loud, that it piere'd Heaven, and enter'd into the Ears of that holy LORD GOD to whom Vengeance belongs. And,</p>
            <p>Inaſmuch as there were no Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World then, as there are now; GOD himſelf, the righteous Judge, in ſome more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Way and Manner than now he does, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to make Inquiſion for Blood, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute

the Criminal: Accordingly <hi>Cain</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before GOD; he was examined, convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and condemned: An Account of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs we have recorded in <hi>Geneſis, Chap. the</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a Hell of inward Anguiſh, Horror and Guilt muſt the Murderer feel in his Breaſt, when he came under the immediate Eye, and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sentence of GOD! and yet he was ſo far from Repentance, and ſo incorrigible in his Wickedneſs, that even when the omniſcient JUDGE aſk'd him the Queſtion, <hi>Where is Abel thy Brother?</hi> The vile Miſcreant had not only the Confidence, to tell a down right Lie, and ſay <hi>I know not,</hi> but alſo he had the Impudence, by Way of Reflection and Inſult, to aſk his Maker that impertinent Queſtion, <hi>Am I my</hi> Brother's Keeper? As if he had a Mind to controvert the Point, and maintain his guilty Cauſe, againſt the great Searcher of Hearts. And alas! is it not too common a Thing in our Day, for thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have committed an high Crime, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cover and ſecrete it with a Lie, and to inſult thoſe that examine them too, and even to perſevere in their Falſhood, 'till the Witneſs of their Crime is call'd and heard? Thus obſtinate was <hi>Cain,</hi> 'till the Witneſs of his Murder (i. e. the Blood of Abel) was refer'd to and mentioned, as it was by the Mouth of GOD himſelf. But O how muſt it pierce his guilty Heart to hear the <hi>Almighty</hi> pronounce, with a Tone awfully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic, and full of holy Reſentment, and ſay, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Addreſs to <hi>Cain, The Voice of thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Blood crieth unto me from the Ground?</hi> As if the <hi>Almighty</hi> had ſaid to him,</p>

               <q>See—there runs the Blood of thy innocent Brother, ſhed by thy guilty Hand—Behold it thrilling from his wounded Body, and ſoaking into the ſoften'd Earth, which has open'd her Mouth to receive his Blood from thy Hand. Know thou, that tho' he is dead, yet his Blood ſpeaks and cries to me from the Ground: This is the Witneſs of thy Murder; the Earth alſo teſtifieth againſt thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thy guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ecchoes to the Cry of both; and now hear the righteous, but terrible Sentence from the Mouth of thy Judge—<hi>Thou art curſed from the Earth</hi>—</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee that the Blood of Murder ſpeaks loud; it has a Voice that pierces Earth and Heaven; it reaches the Seat of Juſtice and the Throne of God: The Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did ſo; and tho' there was no other human Eye that was a living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Murder, but the Eye of <hi>Cain</hi>; yet as an ancient Writer ſaith, <note n="†" place="bottom">Cornelius a Lap: Com: in Pent:</note>
               <q>The Earth was a Witneſs, and the Heavens too, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars,</q> &amp;c.
And GOD himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Judge, He well underſtood the Teſtimony that theſe Witneſſes gave.</p>
            <p>But more immediately to the Point in Hand. The Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> ſpake many Things plain and eaſy to be underſtood; particularly, it ſpake not only who his Murderer was, pointing to his Brother againſt whom his Blood cried: It ſpake not only the enormous Guilt and Cruelty of his Brother, who, in committing the black Crime, laid aſide, and ſuppreſt the acting of all the Principles of Humanity, brotherly Affection, and every generous Sentiment; and abandon'd himſelf to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:009616_0010_0F77459430E9BE68"/>
the contrary Principles of gnawing Envy, dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Malice, and cruel Hatred; the Influence of which he followed, 'till he violently broke thro' all the Laws of Relation, Connection, Humanity, Juſtice, and of GOD himſelf; and made a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Victim of his innocent Brother: I ſay, the Blood of Abel not only ſpake this, but alſo,</p>
            <p>It ſpake for Judgment, and a perfect Sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Murderer, without the leaſt Variation from ſtrict Juſtice and the eſtabliſhed Law of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Alſo, it ſpake for Vengeance to be executed to the full, without the leaſt Mercy or Mitigation: And there was the higheſt Reaſon that the Voice of his Blood ſhould be heard and anſwered, for the Criminal had violated all the Laws of Nature, and of Nature's GOD.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things ſpake the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi>: And, the Blood of Murder ſpeaks the ſame Things for Subſtance now, and has ſpoke the ſame Things thro' all Ages of the World, that the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did: Nor has the Earth been a Stranger to the Repetition of the like Crime, and the like Cry; for ſhe has, from Time to Time, open'd her Mouth to receive the Blood of Murder from the Hands of wicked Men.</p>
            <p>But tho' the Sin of Murder is a Sin that wears the Colour of Scarlet and Crimſon, and brings the moſt aggravated Guilt upon the Criminal; ſtill, the Greatneſs of this Sin don't leſſen the evil Nature and Conſequence of other Sins; for every Sin (tho' not ſo aggravated as this, yet) is really wounding and deſtructive to the Soul as this is; becauſe every Sin is a Violation of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Law of GOD, and renders the Sinner obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Malediction of the Law; for the Law
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009616_0011_0F7745960DECB668"/>
being unalterably juſt and good, it muſt, as it does, ſpeak aloud for Judgment and Vengeance againſt the Tranſgreſſor; and the Author of the Law pronounceth, (let us hear the Sentence and lay it to Heart) <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die</hi>; nor will the Almighty alter a Tittle of his Law, or do any Thing that will ſtain his glorious Throne, for the Sake of ſaving a guilty Creature from deſerved Death and Deſtruction: And if this is the Caſe, all of us have Reaſon to be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, who of us can ſay we are without Sin, or that we have not tranſgreſſed the perfect Law of God in Thought, Word, or Deed, Times with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Number? Indeed, thro' the reſtraining Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD, we may be kept back from thoſe flagrant Acts of Wickedneſs, which expoſe us to the Obſervation and Puniſhment of human Laws: But we muſt remember that our eternal JUDGE is not limited to thoſe Laws in proceeding with us—far from it—he is limited only by his own perfect and eternal Law, to which he ſtrictly attends in dealing with us: And this Law is ſo pure, ſpiritual, and extenſive, that it reaches the Tho'ts and Motions of the Heart, as well as the Actions of the Life: Accordingly we find that it declares us Murderers for hating our Brother, as well as for taking away his mortal Life; and ſo of every other Sin; the Law condemns us for the in-dwelling, as well as for the out-breaking of it. And,</p>
            <p>If there was no Proviſion made for our Pardon and Redemption, but what is reveal'd in the pure and perfect Law of GOD; not only the <hi>Criminal</hi> here preſent, but alſo every Soul of us muſt be condemn'd and damn'd to all Eternity; for we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009616_0012_0F774596B5DFCB38"/>
being Tranſgreſſors of the Law, it calls as loud for Vengeance againſt us, as the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did for Vengeance againſt <hi>Cain; Curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them</hi>; inſtead of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Things, we have fail'd in all Things, nor is it poſſible for us, by any Offerings we can make, or Works of Righteouſneſs that we can do, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to atone for our Offences, or to eſcape the Vengeance of GOD, to which we are condemn'd by his holy Law.</p>
            <p>The Cry of the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> repreſents the Spirit and the Language of the Law againſt the Tranſgreſſor; ſo that if we Sinners, think to obtain the Favour of GOD our Judge, by the Deeds of the Law, we ſhall meet with the moſt amazing Diſappointment; for inſtead of hearing any Thing in our Favour, we ſhall hear the Law denounce againſt us, Death and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the glorious Author of the Law will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Sentence.</p>
            <p>But, through the tender Mercies of our GOD, (bleſſed be his Name) we hear a different Voice from the Goſpel, and a different Cry from the Blood of HIM <hi>who offered himſelf a Sacrifice for our Sins; who was wounded for our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; who bled to waſh us from our Guilt and moral Pollution; who died that we might live for ever. The Scene now changeth from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light; and O! that the Light of the Glory of GOD, in the Face of JESUS CHRIST, may ſhine into our Hearts, and raiſe us up to the lively Hope of Pardon and eternal Life! We are now call'd from a particular Attention to thoſe Things that the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> ſpake, and we are invited,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:009616_0013_0F77459775D52C78"/>II. To conſider the better Things that the Blood of JESUS ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>I take the Blood of Sprinkling, which is here ſet in Contraſt with the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> to intend the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; to the Voice of which, let our Ears and Hearts be open and attentive.</p>
            <p>If we conſider what we are to underſtand by the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; why it is call'd the Blood of Sprinkling; and, what the Things are that it ſpeaks; we ſhall ſee how much better Things it ſpeaks than the Blood of <hi>Abel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject is very copious, and affords Matter of the ſtrongeſt Conſolation to Sinners, whoſe Conſciences are ſtung with a Senſe of Guilt, and with the Fear of deſerved Vengeance from the almighty GOD: But the preſent Circumſtances oblige me to as much Brevity as is conſiſtent with Perſpicuity. Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. By the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, not meerly the material Blood that ran from his wounded Side, or any other Part of his wounded Body: but rather, the whole of thoſe Actions and Sufferings of His, which, as a a Surety, and Mediator between GOD and Man, he paſſed thro' in his Humiliation State, for the Redemption of Sinners to God: The Merit or Vertue of thoſe Actions and Sufferings are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his Blood: Hence the whole Redemption of thoſe that are finally ſav'd, is aſcribed to his Blood; ſo their grateful Song runs, <hi>Thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to GOD by thy Blood:</hi> Whence it is plain, that the virtuous Cauſe of our Pardon and Cleanſing; as alſo of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and full Redemption, is to be found in his Blood. To this Purpoſe are thoſe Paſſages of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009616_0014_0F7745981AB56ED0"/>
Scripture, Eph. 1.7.—<hi>We have Redemption tho' his Blood, the Forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi>—1 John 1.7.—<hi>The Blood of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> Chriſt the Son of GOD, being himſelf truly GOD, and truly Man in one Perſon, his Blood is of ſufficient Virtue to cleanſe us from the Guilt and Turpitude of all Sins, the greateſt as well as the leaſt, and alſo to render us righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy in the Sight of God: And inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as his Blood anſwers theſe great Ends, it muſt intend the Value, Virtue, or Merit of all that he acted and ſuffered for the Salvation of Sinners, in his Humiliation-State.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It is call'd the Blood of Sprinkling, from thoſe ceremonial Practices in the Hebrew Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which had Reference to the Blood of Chriſt, and the Uſe of it.</p>
            <p>You are ſenſible that the Sprinkling of the Blood of Sacrifices in old Times, had a different Meaning and Signification, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Objects that were ſprinkled. For Inſtance, when the Blood was ſprinkled upon the <hi>Mercy-Seat</hi> and before it; upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> and upon the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> it ſignified <hi>Atonement.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Levit. 16.15—19.</note> When it was ſprinkled on the <hi>Perſons</hi> who had committed any Fault, it ſignified <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. 24 8. Heb. 9.19—22.</note> In Anſwer to theſe Shadows, the Blood of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which, as our Surety he ſhed, has ſprinkled the Throne of GOD, the Altar of Juſtice, and the Book of the divine Law; by the ſprinkling of which, our Sins are aton'd for; the Law of GOD is magnified; his Juſtice is ſatisfied; his Wrath is appeas'd; and thro' this Medium the Throne of GOD is a Throne of Grace, to which
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009616_0015_0F774598C3A56D08"/>
we are invited. And furthermore; the ſame Blood being ſprinkled upon us, or applied to our Perſons and Conſciences, effectually removes our Guilt, and renders our Perſons righteous in the Eye of GOD; alſo it purges our Hearts from moral Defilement, and renders our Natures holy; ſo the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth: <hi>If the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the Aſhes of an Heifer, ſprinkling the Unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the Fleſh; how much more ſhall the Blood of Chriſt, who thro' the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without Spot to GOD, purge your Conſciences from dead Works, to ſerve the living GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The Things that the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeaks are many, and very comfortable. The Import of what it ſpeaks is; that the full Price of our Redemption from Sin, Wrath and Ruin, is paid down; and that the Way to GOD and Glory is laid open, by Virtue of it. Alſo it ſpeaks the Language of Pardon, Mercy, and Grace, to the moſt guilty and miſerable Sinner; for his Blood ſpeaks the ſame Language that dropt from his ſacred Mouth when he hung upon the Croſs, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> This he ſpake in Favour of his cruel Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, while they were perpetrating the horrid Act. O Love! beyond all Degrees of Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, to cry for Pardon to be given to his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiers, even in his Crucifixion-Pangs! For the like Bleſſing, his Blood ſpeaks now; it cries for pardoning Mercy for the greateſt Criminals, and pleads for their Admiſſion to the Favour of GOD: "When Juſtice calls for Sinners Blood, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhews his own" thro' the Virtue of which,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009616_0016_0F77459972183BE8"/>
the believing Sinner is accepted of GOD, and juſtified from all Things, from which he could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; the Import of what it ſpeaks, abundantly aſſures us, that it is an effectual Means, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to cleanſe us from the deepeſt Stains that Sin has fix'd in our Souls: Sprinkled with his Blood, the Eyes of our Underſtandings are open'd to behold the Glory of GOD in the Face of Chriſt, our Hearts too are ſoften'd into evangelic Repentance; our Conſciences are purged from dead Works; our Paſſions are renewed, and our whole Souls begin to ſhine in moral Purity. In a Word; his Blood ſpeaks, <hi>healing to the broken-hearted—Deliverance to Captives— the opening of the Priſon to them that are bound,</hi> and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with eternal Glory to them that deſerve Damnation and eternal Miſery. His Blood ſpeaks and pleads with GOD, for Mercy to be granted to Sinners; and it ſpeaks and pleads with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to come and waſh in the healing Fountain of it; and to look unto Him for Salvation; promiſing them an Admiſſion into the Kingdom of Grace here, and into the Kingdom of Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the comfortable Things that the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeaks; and O! how much better are they, than the Things that the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> or the Blood of Murder, or the violated Law of GOD ſpeak to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor. Theſe latter ſpeak for the Judgment of Condemnation againſt the guilty; but the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeaks for Pardon, Acquittance, and eternal Life: Theſe, ſpeak for Vengance, without Mercy, to be poured upon the Criminals; but
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009616_0017_0F77459A44B202D8"/>
the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> pleads the contrary; it cries with an interceeding Voice before the Throne of GOD;
<q>Spare the Rebels—forgive the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors—receive them to Favour and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bliſs; Here is Blood to atone for their Offences—to magnify the violated Law—and to ſatisfy the Juſtice of Heaven; Her is Blood to waſh their ſpotted Souls, and to cauſe them to ſhine in all the Beauties of Holineſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſovereign Remedy is here, for the moſt threatning Maladies and Miſeries of a guilty Soul! and, bleſſed be GOD<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this ſame Blood of Sprinkling, we are all invited, by the ſoft and alluring Voice of the Goſpel; the general Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which is, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World!</hi> And now; having endeavoured briefly to make Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Things that the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> ſpake; and the better Things that the Blood of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeaks, the Way is open,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To Addreſs myſelf to the <hi>Criminal</hi> here preſent, who is juſtly condemned to Death, for a bloody Crime that ſpeaks againſt him the ſame Language that the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did againſt his cruel Murderer.</p>
            <p>But, how ſhall I ſpeak to the poor Malefactor, who is preſt under the Weight, both of his own Guilt, and the Sentence of Death—juſt going into Eternity, and never more to hear a public Addreſs from the Oracles of GOD? There is a Senſibility in human Nature—if <hi>we</hi> don't feel for him, we are ſtupid—if <hi>he</hi> don't feel for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he is more ſo.</p>
            <p>May GOD of his infinite Mercy touch all our Hearts with a ſuitable Concern for him! May
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009616_0018_0F77459B09089388"/>
the Holy Spirit aſſiſt me in addreſſing him, and give to him a compoſed, attentive and believing Mind, that he may hear, ſo as that his Soul ſhall live!</p>
            <p>Poor unhappy <hi>Briſtol!</hi> The Day of your Death is now come, and you have but a very few Hours more to live. The Laws of the Land and the Laws of GOD, call for the Deſtruction of your mortal Life; <hi>Whoſo ſheddeth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 9.6.</note>: This is the Decree of Heaven, and it is to be executed by Man, nor have you the leaſt Ray of Hope that you ſhall eſcape; for the Sentence is paſt, not to be revok'd—the Day of Execution is come—the Guard is about you—the Inſtruments of Death are made ready—your Coffin and your Grave are open—</p>
            <p>Alas! to what a wretched and forlorn Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath your own extravagant Folly and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs bro't you? And with what ſevere Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and bitter Repentance ought you, once more, to ſurvey your vile Heart, your bloody Crime, and the Aggravations of it? That, ſelf-condemned, you may proſtrate your guilty Soul at the Foot of the Croſs of Chriſt, and plead for the Application of his Blood, which, alone, can ſave you from everlaſting Death, and the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of an angry GOD.</p>
            <p>You are not to imagine, that you are treated with any greater Severity meerly becauſe you are a black Boy, and bro't from your native Country among us, for you are not: If any of us had done ſuch a horrid Thing as you have, we ſhould be treated as you are: Your being of a different
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009616_0019_0F77459BB0DACE30"/>
Colour from us, makes no Odds in this Matter. You have not only an immortal Soul as we have, but you are of the ſame Kind of Fleſh and Blood that we are; for GOD <hi>hath made of one Blood, all Nations of Men, for to dwell on all the Face of the Earth</hi>: <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 17.26.</note> Hence you are under the ſame general Laws of GOD and of Man that we are; <note n="†" place="bottom">Men by Nature are equal, being compoſed of the ſame eſſential Parts: Whence, every one ought to treat every other as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Man with himſelf. This was known among the Pagans. <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> was ſo delighted with this Maxim,
<q>Do not to others what you would not have done to yourſelf.</q>
That he ordered it to be proclaimed aloud by a public Crier, when he was about to correct or animadvert upon any Perſon. Alſo he ordered it to be inſcribed every where in his Palace, and on all his public Works.—<hi>Turnbull</hi>'s Notes on Heinec's Uni. Law, Vol: 1. Chap. 7. Sect. 177.</note> both of which Laws you have broken, in the moſt daring and unmerciful Manner.</p>
            <p>You have done a moſt wicked Thing, and your Crime is of the blackeſt Nature; for, without Provocation, you have ſhed innocent Blood: Nor had you any Compaſſion upon the poor unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate young <hi>Lady,</hi> againſt whom your deadly Hatred was vented; for in a Fit of Malice you ſuddenly deſtroy'd her Life, without giving her a Moment's Time to prepare for Eternity. How differently have you been treated by your kind Maſter and Miſtreſs, and by the Civil Authority; who, out of Charity, lengthen'd out your Life; and by Numbers of others, who have taken much Pains to inſtruct, and prepare you for Death? I ſay, how differently have you been treated, from your Treatment of the unhappy Victim of your cruel Rage and Paſſion. She had not Time to cry to Heaven for Mercy: But tho' ſhe is dead, yet her Blood cries for Vengeance againſt you:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009616_0020_0F77459CC1551C38"/>
And O! what Horror and amazing Anguiſh will ſeize you, if you meet and hear <hi>that</hi> Blood cry againſt you at the Bar of God, where you will will preſently appear!</p>
            <p>You can't plead Ignorance; for not only your own Conſcience told you it was a great Sin, but your Education told you the ſame; for you had the Privilege of being caſt into Families of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Religion, from whom, we doubt not, but you was well inſtructed and cautioned; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, I have good Aſſurance, that the laſt worthy and virtuous Family in which you ſerved, took Pains to make you ſenſible of the Evil of Sin, how hateful it is to GOD, and how hurtful to you, and alſo to recommend to you a religious and virtuous Life; ſo that you are wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Excuſe: And not only without Excuſe, But,</p>
            <p>Your Crime is attended with the moſt aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating Circumſtances; and you have Reaſon to fear an aggravated Puniſhment. Your Sin points every Way, and calls for Vengeance from every Quarter. You have ſinned againſt the holy GOD before whoſe awful Bar you muſt appear and be judged: You have ſinned againſt the Light of your Conſcience—againſt the Light of Inſtruction, and againſt your own Soul; and you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably ſuffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire, unleſs you have Repentance and Redemption thro' the Blood of Chriſt: You have ſinned againſt the Laws of Man, that are founded on the divine Law: You have ſinned moſt ſenſibly againſt your Maſter and Miſtreſs, and filled them with inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Grief and Sorrow; tho' you can't but own that they have treated you with Chriſtian Care and Tnderneſs: In a Word, you have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009616_0021_0F77459D30D49088"/>
againſt all Mankind; and againſt all the Laws of Nature; and your Iniquity has found you out, nor can you hide any of the Circumſtances of it from the all-ſeeing Eye of your great Judge.</p>
            <p>Now you find, by painful Experience, that the Blood of Murder cries with a loud Voice, and that it is heard afar off as well as near: It pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued you ſwiftly when you fled, and call'd you back to Priſon, and laid you in Chains: It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to the Bar of Juſtice, and there cried for Judgment againſt you; and your own Confeſſion implicitly call'd for the ſame: Accordingly, the ſolemn Sentence was pronounced by the juſt, tho' tender-hearted Judge; and now there is nothing remaineth, but the ſtill more gloomy and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scene of Execution; to prepare you for which, you have no where to look but to the GOD whoſe Anger you have provoked, and whoſe Vengeance you deſerve.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the Greatneſs of your Sin, which calls aloud for the Deſtruction of your mortal Life, and of your immortal Soul too; yet (bleſſed be God) there is a ſweet and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Voice ſounding in your Ears from the Throne of Grace, thro' the Goſpel of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proclaiming Pardon, Peace, and eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption to Sinners, and even to you, thro' the precious Blood of Chriſt, which is of ſufficient Virtue and Power to atone for <hi>this</hi> and all your Sins—to waſh your Heart from Wickedneſs, and to preſent you with Acceptance before the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of your final Judge.</p>
            <p>The infinitely merciful GOD earneſtly calls and encourages you to Repentance: Hearken, and you will hear him ſpeak from his holy Oracles,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009616_0022_0F77459F03B9A0E8"/>

            <p>Again, the Saviour of the World invites you to run into his Name, and under the Wings of his Righteouſneſs, for Protection; and to his virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood for Pardon and Cleanſing: O, turn to this ſtrong Hold, thou Priſoner of Hope! And once more; we beſeech you to give up your Soul to the only Redeemer; we beſeech you by the Mercies of God—by the gracious Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpel—by the Terrors of the Law—by the Solemnities of the Judgment Seat, to which you are going—by the Worth of your immortal Soul, that muſt be filled with inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Pleaſure or Pain for ever—by the Horrors of Hell, and by the Joys and Happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; by all theſe important Conſiderations, we beſeech you to be reconciled to GOD, by a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſpeedy Embracement of Jeſus Chriſt: He yet waits to be gracious, and yet calls for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into your Heart; <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock,</hi> &amp;c.

that can befriend you in this important Point. Now, in an eminent Manner, is the accepted Time with you—Now is the Hour of Salvation: And, to encourage and perſuade you to believe on Chriſt with all your Heart, He not only invites you to come to him, but promiſes to receive you graciouſly, to forgive you freely, to waſh you thoro'ly, and to ſave you eternally: <hi>Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the</hi> LORD, <hi>tho' your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow; tho' they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> Here, guilty Briſtol! is a Fountain of Grace open, to waſh you from the Guilt and Stain of your ſcarlet and crimſon Sins; and the LORD himſelf bids you welcome, for to you he calls, with the ſoft Voice of Invitation, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, hear, and your Soul ſhall live!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, now collect all your Thoughts— rouſe all the Powers of your Soul, and, without Delay, center your Faith, Hope and Confidence intirely in Chriſt: Reſt upon his unbounded Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and almighty Power to remove your Guilt; to renew your Nature; to ſupport you thro' the gloomy Scene of Death; and to preſent you with Acceptance before the glorious Preſence of the eternal God: to whoſe infinite Grace we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you, and in his ſovereign Hands we leave you; earneſtly beſeeching him to ranſom your Soul from Deſtruction, and receive you to his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I ſhall cloſe, with a few Words, by Way of Admonition and Exhortation to this whole Aſſembly; every Individual of which, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly appointed to Death, by the Determination
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009616_0024_0F7745A058AD0C10"/>
of GOD, as the Criminal before us is, by the juſt Determination of Man.</p>
            <p>May GOD impreſs our Hearts with the ſolemn Inſtructions and Warnings that are ſuggeſted to us, by this Inſtance of Murder that is freſh in our Minds, and by the wretched Condition of the Murderer!</p>
            <p>If I have been rightly informed; this Negro Boy is the firſt Inſtance, of a Criminal, that has been convicted, and condemned to Death for Murder in this County, ſince <hi>This</hi> was made a <hi>Shire-Town,</hi> and for a great Number of Years before; would to GOD it may be the laſt! Within this Province alſo, this is the firſt Inſtance of a capital Offender that has been executed for more than ſix Years paſt. But unleſs the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Iniquity and bold Tranſgreſſors do receive ſome Check, and are reduced to more Caution and better Behaviour, we have Reaſon to fear that it will not be the laſt for ſix Years to come; for wicked and extravagant Men are apt to grow worſe and worſe, till they are violently ſeized by the high Hand of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>The preſent affecting Inſtance of Juſtice, upon a capital Offender, is like a flaming Beacon, ſet up before our Eyes, ſolemnly warning us to ſee, and hear, and fear, and not do ſo wickedly as he has done; for altho' this Inſtance of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Puniſhment ſeems to ſpeak, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Manner, to you that are Servants and Slaves, (as it really does, and loudly warns you to oppoſe every Temptation or Inticement to do a wicked Thing; to guard againſt ſudden Fits of Paſſion; againſt ſecret Envy, Malice, Hatred and a revengeful Spirit; and againſt open Violence:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009616_0025_0F7745A0F23E0B98"/>
to be faithful, attentive, and dutiful to thoſe whom you ſerve, and to behave in a modeſt and peaceable Manner to every Body,) yet this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpeaks an Admonition to us all, as well as to Servants; and therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us all take Warning, and ſtrictly guard againſt the out-breaking of any of the vile and violent Paſſions: Neither let us think, that the Warning is needleſs; for we have the ſame vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Seeds of Enmity, Prejudice, Wrath, Malice, Envy, Hatred, and the like in our Hearts, that were the guilty Cauſe of the Murder we now la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and if we give Licenſe to theſe Principles, they will lead us on to the Commiſſion of ſome enormous Wickedneſs, that will deſtroy either our Name, or mortal life, or immortal Soul, or deſtroy them all together: <hi>for, from within, out of the Heart, proceed evil Thoughts, Murders, Adulteries, Fornications, Thefts, Falſe-Witneſs, Blaſphemies:</hi> And 'tis dangerous giving Way to theſe evil Habits, and following their Dictates; for they will involve us in Deſtruction and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It is for theſe and the like Things that the Wrath or GOD cometh down on the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience. And I muſt tell you, my Hearers! that if you will not feel, nor yield At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Force of wholeſome Inſtructions, Counſels and Warnings, you muſt feel the Force of executive Juſtice, and deſerved Puniſhment; <hi>for he that bring often reproved, hardneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If thoſe of you who live a prophane, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, debauched, irreligious and vicious Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that indulge an envious, angry, and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009616_0026_0F7745A1D9EC5270"/>
Temper againſt any Body, imagine that you ſhall come off with Impunity, you are very great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken; for if thro' your cunning Crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you do happen to eſcape deſerved Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Men, <hi>yet the</hi> LORD <hi>our</hi> GOD <hi>will not ſuffer you to eſcape his righteous Judgments.</hi>— If you are not arraigned before the Judgment-Seat of Man, to anſwer for your Faults, you muſt be arraigned before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, from whoſe Eye you can hide none of your evil Purpoſes or Practices; and from whoſe almighty Power you cannot eſcape the juſt Puniſhment of your vicious and irreligious Life. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>Ceaſe to do Evil, and learn to do well: Let the Examples of revenging Juſtice, from the civil Authority, upon bold Tranſgreſſors, deter you from open Wickedneſs; and let the infinitely heavier Vengeance of GOD, upon the incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sinner, deter you from the Indulgence of any Sin in Heart or in Life. Guard againſt every Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to Sin, and cruſh the firſt Motions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Malice, and every evil Diſpoſition; and that you may ſucceed in your Attempts to purge your Heart and your Life from theſe moral Evils, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to Chriſt our Prince and Saviour; thro' Faith in whoſe Blood, and in no other Way, you can obtain the Forgiveneſs of Sins, Victory over Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Strength to crucify the Fleſh with its Affections and Luſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us remember, that altho' (thro' the good Hand of our GOD upon us) we have been preſerved from capital Offences againſt the Laws of Men, yet we have tranſgreſſed the infinitely higher Law of GOD, by which we ſhall be judged at the laſt. And ſince it is plain, that GOD will
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009616_0027_0F7745A270C42568"/>
not vary, in the leaſt, from his perfect Law, in proceeding with us: Since alſo it is true in Fact, that we have tranſgreſſed his Law in numberleſs Inſtances, and are juſtly condemn'd to Death by the Sentence of it; we have Reaſon therefore, to be greatly alarm'd, and the more ſo, becauſe we can neither atone for any of our Sins, nor wrench ourſelves out of the almighty Hand of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ſin-revenging GOD, who, out of Chriſt, is a conſuming Fire to the Tranſgreſſor.</p>
            <p>You ſee and hear what terrible Things the Blood of Murder, and the Laws of Men ſpeak againſt the Criminal, and you ought to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therewith, tho' they don't ſpeak directly againſt you: But tho' they don't, yet, againſt every one of you, who have not come by a living Faith to Jeſus Chriſt, nor been ſprinkled with the Merits of his precious Blood, which alone can take away Sin; againſt you, the holy Law of GOD ſpeaks, and denounces as terrible Things as ever the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> did againſt <hi>Cain</hi>; for you being a Tranſgreſſor of the Law, it breathes out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Woes, Curſes, Condemnation and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death againſt you; and the Sentence of the Law is ratified by GOD himſelf, who declares, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die</hi>: And had it not been for the Death of Chriſt, our Surety, there would be no Hope for us. But ſince, by his Obedience to the Death, he has fully aton'd for our Sins, anſwered the Demands of the divine Law, and opened, for us, a Door of Hope,</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Senſible that we are Tranſgreſſors of the Law of GOD, and that we have guilty and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Hearts, Let us come to <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Mediator
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009616_0028_0F76F4549B7FCF68"/>
of the New Covenant, and rely intirely upon the Power and Virtue of his Blood, for the Pardon of our Sins, for Reconciliation with GOD, and for the cleanſing of our rational Nature from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Defilement; that ſo we may be holy in Heart, and for the future, may walk in Newneſs of Life, and always exerciſe ourſelves <hi>to keep a Conſcience void of Offence toward</hi> GOD <hi>and toward Man:</hi> Thus living, we ſhall neither come to an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and violent End thro' overmuch Wickedneſs, nor have Cauſe to fear with any Amazement when the Time of our Departure from this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life ſhall come; but ſhall die in Peace—fall aſleep in <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and enter into everlaſting Reſt.</p>
            <p>And now in Behalf of the <hi>Criminal,</hi> let me call upon you all, not to ceaſe praying for him, 'till he ceaſes to be a Subject of Prayer: Tho' he is a bloody Malefactor, yet 'tis cruel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian to deny him your Prayers in the laſt Moments of Life. O, ſend up your fervent and inceſſant Supplications to the Throne of Grace, for Mercy on him, 'till his mortal Life tranſpires, and his immortal Soul returns to GOD who gave it.</p>
            <p>Finally; Let us all in a religious Manner, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deplore this awful Judgment of GOD, in ſuffering ſuch a horrible Murder to be committed among us; and let it alarm us all to ſtand in Awe and not ſin. In a ſpecial Manner, let me ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly warn and admoniſh you all, to watch and guard againſt all Indecencies, Rudeneſs, Vanity, and unbecoming Behaviour; which, upon this ſolemn Occaſion, will be moſt highly provoking to the holy GOD, a faint Reſemblance of whoſe revenging Juſtice upon the incorrigible Sinner, is
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:009616_0029_0F76F4554B11DCC0"/>
ſet before us this Day. Therefore be exhorted to behave ſoberly and decently, and to be earneſt in your Prayers to almighty GOD, that he would keep you now, and at all Times, hereafter, from every wicked Thing. In a Word, let us live as the Grace of GOD teaches—let us lay aſide Anger, Wrath, Malice, and every Sin that moſt eaſily beſets us; and let us live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, looking for the bleſſed Hope, and glorious Appearing of the great GOD and our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that when he ſhall appear, we may ſee him with Joy, and be admitted to dwell in his immediate Preſence and heavenly Kingdom for evermore.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>THE bloody Murder of Miſs <hi>Elizabeth Mc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Kinſtry,</hi> on <hi>June</hi> the 4th, 1763, which gave Occaſion for the preaching of the foregoing Diſcourſe, may truly be placed among the aſtoniſhing Events of Providence, and the alarming Frailties of human Nature: One cannot call to Mind the particular Circumſtances of this tragic Scene, without the deepeſt Emotions of Horror, Pity and Indignation.</p>
            <p>The Negro Boy who perpetrated this lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crime, was born in <hi>Africa,</hi> and at the Age of about eight Years was brought into <hi>New-England,</hi> where he lived about five Years in the ſame Family with Miſs <hi>McKinſtry,</hi> at <hi>Windſor</hi>; his Maſter then dying, he was purchaſed by her Brother Doctor <hi>McKinſtry</hi> of <hi>Taunton,</hi> where he had lived three Years when the Murder was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the deceaſed having been alſo about two Years in the ſame Family; ſo that from his Childhood (excepting one Year) he had lived in the ſame Family with her; and during this Time he was treated with all the Tenderneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that could be deſired. He always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009616_0031_0F76F45934E7B380"/>
happy in his Situation, and ſhewed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Readineſs to do his Buſineſs, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to perform what he undertook, without the leaſt Appearance of Sullenneſs or Malice. After he had done the Fact, he rode to <hi>Newport,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhewing the leaſt Concern 'till he was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; he then made ſome artful Excuſes 'till he had been committed about twelve Hours, when he confeſſed the whole Fact, the Subſtance of which was, "That early in the Morning Miſs <hi>McKinſtry,</hi> a little Girl, and himſelf, being the only Perſons of the Family that were up; and the little Girl being gone up Stairs, as Miſs <hi>Mc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>Kinſtry</hi> was ſtooping over the Fire, he catch'd up a Flat-Iron that ſtood on the Hearth, ſtruck her on the Head, and knock'd her into the Fire, which burnt her Face; he then gave her another Blow, and immediately dragged her down the Cellar Stairs, where finding an old Ax, he ſtruck her with it on the Head, and made off as faſt as he could."</p>
            <p>After his Commitment, he appeared very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and expreſſed his Sorrow for the Crime: Particularly for the Grief he had brought on his Maſter's Family; in ſpeaking of which, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſeem'd the moſt affected. He declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, during the whole of his Impriſonment to his laſt Moment, that he never had any Anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the deceaſed, nor any of the Family; and that he had never received any Treatment that deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: And tho' he always appeared free to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer any Queſtions that were aſked him, yet he never gave any Reaſon for committing the Crime, but that he was prompted to it by a Negro Boy of his Acquaintance, who threatned to kill him
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009616_0032_0F76F45B10455050"/>
if he did not do it; this he perſiſted in to his dying Moment.</p>
            <p>At his Trial he pleaded Guilty; but ſhewed no Emotion at the pronouncing Sentence of Death, nor at the public Worſhip, where in his Hearing, ſeveral Sermons beſide this were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Occaſion; nor even at the Place of Execution: This would naturally be conſtrued as Stupidity or Sullenneſs, had not his Diſcourſe plainly ſhown that he had a true Senſe of his Crime, and right Notions of a future State.</p>
            <p>At the Gallows he made a long Speech to the Spectators, particularly to thoſe of his own Colour, which for Subſtance was pertinent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; he expreſs'd great Concern for his Maſter's Family; was very particular in thanking every Body that had taken Notice of him while in Priſon; he acknowledged his Condemnation juſt; he expreſſed his Senſe of his Guilt, and the Hopes he had of Forgiveneſs and future Happineſs, thro' the Mercy of God in Chriſt; and then, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Lord's Prayer diſtinctly, he was turn'd off.</p>
            <p>The deceaſed, who was the unhappy Object of this unaccountable Malice, was a Daughter of the Pev'd. Mr. <hi>John McKinſtry,</hi> late of <hi>Windſor</hi>; a young Lady of a chearful Diſpoſition, an even generous Temper, and every Way of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Character: After tarrying with her Brother, ſhe was preparing to return to her Mother at <hi>Windſor,</hi> when in a Moment that ſhe tho't not of, ſhe was hurried in this cruel Manner to her long Home.</p>
            <p>Theſe Circumſtances are more particularly mentioned, as they are ſuch Peculiarities of this
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009616_0033_0F76F45B44191280"/>
dark Affair, as naturally fill us with more Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and Indignation, than if the ſame had happened after repeated Reſentments, ſettled Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or ſudden Provocation; for it ſeems difficult to conceive how one, who never ſhew'd ill-nature on any Occaſion, and who always appeared chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and contented, ſhould of a ſudden, without Provocation, commit the moſt barbarous Cruelty on one who never offended him, and whoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour had gain'd the Eſteem of all who knew her: Surely then it is a ſtricking Inſtance of the Weakneſs of human Nature, the horrid Effects of our ungovern'd Paſſions, and of the Baſeneſs and Danger of meer <hi>ſilly good Nature,</hi> without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tenderneſs, or virtuous Principles. It natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calls upon thoſe who have the Care of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes to be very vigilant in removing the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of their barbarous Diſpoſition by Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to inſtill into their Minds ſuch Chriſtian Principles as may influence their Actions when abſent from the Eye of their Maſters; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to inſpect their companying together, that grand Source of all the Evils that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſen ſo frequently from this Nation, when in their Conſpirings they cry out, <hi>Let us lay wait for Blood, let us lurk privily for the Innocent without a Cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſudden Manner in which Miſs <hi>McKinſtry</hi> came to her End, is an alarming Lecture on the Uncertainty of human Life, and ſhows us the ſurprizing Attacks of the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> whoſe Snares continually ſurround us, and whoſe Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners walk in the dark: Surely in the Midſt of Life we are in Death; and the Hand that we expected to adminiſter to our Comfort, may deal the fatal Blow.</p>
