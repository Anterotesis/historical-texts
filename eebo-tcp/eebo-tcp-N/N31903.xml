            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Viſion of Hell, &amp; a Diſcovery of ſome of the Conſultations &amp; Devices there.</head>
            <p>IN the month of May in the Year 1767, in a morning after I had been ſome time out of bed, I was muſing upon the low ſtate of religion, and the great progreſs of vice; I conſidered how the Devils would rejoice and triumph in the decay of piety, and in the flood of immorality that threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deluge the world.—While I was thus muſing, I ſell into a ſort of trance, I was certainly not a ſleep; my fancy and imagination were moſt lively, and yet I retained m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> memory and reaſon perfectly, I ſeemed to have a viſionary view, or clear repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of hell, or the world of miſerable ſpirits My mind was ſtrangely enlarged to view and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things—Hell, ſeemed a fire, as large as all this world, ſurrounded with impenetrable walls: the gate was very wide and was continually open, but guarded by the ſtrongeſt and crueleſt devils: and the brighteſt flame of the hoteſt fire ſeemed to ſtream out of the gate an amazing length: in the midſt of this immenſe fire were innumerable devils, and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſouls of Adam's race.</p>
            <p>I perceived the devils came to this world and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to hell often. They came here to tempt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and deſtroy mankind. and returned to hell to conſult and contrive the moſt effectual methods to ruin ſouls. Their greateſt malignity was againſt God, and Jeſus Chriſt. Their malicious deſire, and curſed endeavour, was to diſhonour God, and prevent Chriſt having glory among mankind. I perceived their principal deſign in promoting ſin, and bringing ſinners to hell, was to diſappoint God, reflect diſhonour on the methods of his grace, and prevent Chriſt's being glorified by the ſalvation of ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. The devils were much elated with pride, and filled with boaſting, that their empire in this world, was larger than Immanuel's and that they had more ſervants and ſubjects than he; and that Chriſt's laws and authority, were ſo little regarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:042104_0003_101B8B9D64868A48"/>
The devils held conſultation upon many ſubjects. I perceived they had been in deep conſultation upon ſeveral methods to diſhonour God. But they were juſt entering upon a new ſubject, as I had this viſion of Hell. Two principal devils had then juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from this world, to the infernal pit. The one was Moloch, the other Lucifer. The devils aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to hear what ſucceſs, and to conſult upon further meaſures—The damned ſouls were in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes all around, and as oft as they pleaſed, might attend, and hear the debates of the devils, for there was no privacy there.</p>
            <p>The conſultation which they held, while I had this viſion, was concerning the Goſpel miniſtry, and the ſabbath, or Lord's day. They employed their infernal wiſdom in deviſing how they might moſt effectually defeat God's end and deſign in both theſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give a faithful narrative of their conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and determinations. But to make my account the more intelligible, it may be proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, to give the names and characters of ſome of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cipal devils. I ſhall mention only ſome of the chief. Their names were Belzebub, Lucifer, Moloch, Apollion, Mammon, Dagon, Belial, Baal, and Niſroch.</p>
            <p>As to their character, 'tis to be obſerved, that they have all a skill and diſpoſition to any, and all evil: but yet moſt of them are peculiarly diſpoſed to promote ſome particular ſin and vice, more than others. Indeed, Belzebub the chief, is ſo ſkilled in all iniquity, and ſo bent and diſpoſed to all that is bad, that there is no devil in hell exceeds him, in any one evil. Lucifer's peculiar character is to act as an angel of light, and induce to evil under a ſhew or falſe appearance of good. Moloch, is the devil that vehemently tempts, and urges people to all vice in an open, bold, daring manner, leading them to commit ſin, with impudence, or without ſhame. Apollion, is the devil of cruelty, who tempts to malice and revenge, and peculiarly delights in the miſery of mankind. Mammon, is continually tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to covetouſneſs, and to make this world
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:042104_0004_101B8BA011EFDF88"/>their treaſure and delight. Dagon, is the devil of ſloth, who tempts men to ſloth and negligence in religion, and to ſink into a dead ſullen deſpair of any good. Belial, is the devil that tempts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and obſtinacy; and has peculiar influence with youth, who diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bey their parents. Baal, is an unclean devil, and excites to the indulgence of all ſorts of fleſhly luſts, and vicious appetites. Niſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roch, is the devil of pride, and is continually tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exciting to that ſin.</p>
            <p>Moloch, and Lucifer, being juſt returned from this earth, as I obſerved, and the devils being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, there conſultation &amp; devices were as follows.</p>

               <p>The preaching of the goſpel, is the deteſtable means of diminiſhing our kingdom.

               <speaker>Dagon.</speaker>
               <p>If we could by ſloth, or any other way keep people from attending public worſhip, our great end would in a good meaſure be anſwered, as to a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed goſpel, and the ſabbath both. I propoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we attempt this.</p>

               <p>My worthy aſſociate who ſpoke laſt, has propoſed, ſomething very proper in its place; but I think we ought not to depend upon that alone. Let us lay our ſcheme deeper and larger; and try in many ways, which I am ſure our ſuperior wiſdom can deviſe, to defeat the deſign of preaching the goſpel and the ſabbath.</p>

               <p>Excellent propoſal! And let us take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care to cover our deſigns as much as poſſible, &amp; give them ſuch a colouring that mankind may think them rational.

               <p>This may be done by degrees. We may at firſt make them think ſomething of this is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And when they once begin, the ſame neceſſity will lead them to it again and again, till they will not be afraid nor aſhamed to make a conſtant practice of it: Thus not only lawyers, phyſicians, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, but many others will ſpend the day in ſettling and adjuſting their accounts, and preparing for more publick buſineſs on other days of the week.</p>

               <p>I would propoſe, that Mammon ſhould tempt people in the country to walk over their fields and plantations on that day, and view their crops, creatures, fences, and the like. This will be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to many than attending public worſhip: And if any ſhould fault them for not attending the word preached, they can eaſily excuſe themſelves, by ſaying, they can read as good a ſermon at home as they can hear at church.</p>

               <p>We muſt by all means promote and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a practice, which to the joy of my heart, I find we have already had conſiderable ſucceſs in: A prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which I hope to make make very prevalent; I mean going into company, drinking, gaming, and whoring upon the ſabbath.</p>

               <p>I have prevailed with many, to prefer this day for viſiting their miſtreſſes and proſecuting lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And I think I ſhall in ſome places ſoon make it a principal time for drinking and gaming.</p>

               <p>'Tis moſt agreeable to have men ſpend this day in vain company, drinking, gaming, whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch like practices; becauſe they are then not only guilty of theſe vices in themſelves, but have the additional guilt of ſabbath braking, and neglect of publick worſhip. ſo that Jehovah is peculiarly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, his laws trampled upon, and his goſpel diſpiſed.</p>

               <p>Thy joy: O Lucifer, is worthy the noble powers of hell. But we have not done with the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. After all, many will pay ſome regard to the day, and attend public worſhip: It remains that we

               <p>In the firſt place, I will, ſuggeſt to them that as the ſabbath is a day of reſt, they may lie in bed late that morning, &amp; indulge their caſe, ſo that by this means they ſhall have little or no time for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or praying; ſcarce have time to dreſs, in order to ſhew themſelves at church, and after all, be ſo late that ſervice ſhall be great part over, before they arrive.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Niſroch.</speaker>
               <p>We muſt by all means induce them to employ their tho'ts and ſpend much time in dreſſing, decking, and adorning themſelves. There is L—. G. and G—. B. and a thouſand others, who ſcarce think of any thing on ſabbath morning, except of dreſſing, and contriving to appear to advantage in public. This is a noble perverſion of the ſabbath, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of what Meſſiah requires of them.</p>

               <p>Nothing I hate worſe, than to ſee ſome faintiſh oppoſers of our kingdom, ſpend the ſabbath morning in reading, meditation, and praying for a bleſſing on the word to be preached.</p>

               <p>By what we have propoſed about dreſs, ſeveral ends are anſwered, as,
<list>
                     <item>I. It prevents reading, hearing, and prayer.</item>
                     <item>II. It leads them to idolize themſelves.</item>
                     <item>III. It fits them to take the attention of others at church.</item>
                     <item>IV. It fills them with vanity, and offends their maker, that they are not likely to get much good by preaching.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Moloch.</speaker>
               <p>Another thing which we ought by all means to attempt, is, to influence perſons to vain and ſimple diſcourſe in going to, and from the houſe of God, and between exerciſes of public worſhip. Some my be tempted to talk upon, and contrive frolicks; ſome tell ſtories; ſome talk of their farms, oxen, horſes, and the like; ſome of their merchandize, and other buſineſs in life, and even innumerable other ſubjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Apollion.</speaker>
               <p>The mind being engaged about thoſe things in going to church, will dwell upon them in time of ſervice, ſo as to neglect any attention to the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:042104_0021_101B8BCFDC417988"/>truths delivered; and we know that no good is got by any preaching that is not attended to.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Baal.</speaker>
               <p>May we not to our advantage induce young perſons of different ſexes, to walk, or fit together, laugh and play, and thus ſpend the ſabbath. This is contrary to the holy deſign of the day, and ſo fills the mind with fin and vanity, and there is not much danger that the conſciences of ſuch perſons will be ſtruck with any truths of the word preached.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mammon.</speaker>
               <p>Some people may be induced to make their aſſembling on the ſabbath a ſeaſon to tranſact their worldly buſineſs: eſpecially they who live diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the country. There is D—. Q—. harneſſes his carriage, takes a ſon or two, and ſometimes a neighbour, and with cheerful chat paſſes eight or ten miles to church. There he meets perſons with whom he can do many errands, and tranſact much buſineſs. By the opportunity of ſeeing a number of perſons, he does more wordly buſineſs that day than he could any other way. He attends church two or three hours, and thinks he is a good Chriſtian, without knowing what Chriſtianity i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. We muſt try to increaſe this practice: This is ſo contrary to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah's command of not thinking their own tho'ts, nor finding their own pleaſures on his day, that he is provoked to leave them to greater hardneſs or wickedneſs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lucifer.</speaker>
               <p>This is agreeable advice; I would add this further here, viz That after public worſhip, people who think they dare not allow themſelves in vice, ſhould be induced to viſit friends and neighbours, be cheerful and talk upon common affairs. This will wonderfully help to baniſh from the mind any truths that might have ſome entrance in the time of hearing. It will alſo prevent their looking into the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>p, that God requires upon the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Many will make theſe viſits without ſcruple of conference, who would be afraid and aſhamed to go in to profane company.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:042104_0022_101B5DEDDA753568"/>ſatisfaction; but ſtill ſomething remains. In the very time of hearing, when the word is preached and inculcated by our enemies, then is the great danger. Mankind have ears to hear, and they are rational creatures; there are ſuch awakening and affecting truths delivered: Truths that in ſuch an awful and intereſting manner concern them, that it ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that rational creatures ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and not attend, and be affected; we cannon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but wonder that they are not. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by all means in the very time of hearing, uſe all our art, and throw into their minds, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, all ſorts of evil thoughts, moſt ſuited to their corrupt nature. If we can ſhield and ſecure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the time of hearing, we ſhall not have much reaſon to fear.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dagon.</speaker>
               <p>I can engage for ſome. The ſermon ſhall not proceed five minutes, before they ſhall begin to nod, or lay down their heads and ſleep ſecure; and it ſhall then be the ſame to them, whether the truth's deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be awakening or not.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Apollion.</speaker>
               <p>And let it be thought an affront, or at leaſt an unmannerly or impertinent thing, for any to jog or wake a neighbour in this caſe.

Devil's will hate me for diſcovering their deſigns and and plots; but I fear them not, while I truſt in God. They cannot go beyond their chain: And, oh, that poor ſinners on earth would ſhun the Devil's ſnares, and truſt in God! they would ſurely find his help and aſſiſtance. If they would reſiſt the Devil, he would be made to fly from them. Jeſus Chriſt is ſtronger than Satan, and they that truſt in him ſhall overcome the evil one.</p>
            <p>If I ſhould hereafter be favoured with any ſuch like viſion or diſcovery of any other of the Devil's deſigns, I might probably think it my duty to acquaint the world with it; eſpecially if I find mankind make a good uſe of what is here offered.</p>
