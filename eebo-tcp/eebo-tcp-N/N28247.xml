            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But without any viſible effect on the minds of their children until the February follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when on one Friday evening Elizabeth Lull, wife of Benjamin Lull, jun. aroſe from her bed in great diſtreſs of mind, and coming down ſtairs ſhe repeated the following words:</p>
            <q>
               <l>"Shall Simon bear thy croſs alone,</l>
               <l>"And other ſaints go free;</l>

They contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this exerciſe of mind until April, when Mrs. Lull and her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martha were brought into liberty. In the courſe of the enſuing ſummer ſeven more families moved into the ſettlement and united with them in their religious meetings. This ſummer was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable time with them, in the former part of which Increaſe Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's wife was brought to rejoice in the Lord, together with C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In June 1775, one Jackſon was killed by an Indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed him for his money.</p>
            <p>In A. D. 1776, the inhabitants began to be diſtreſſed by the war, and had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e more peace until they were deprived of moſt of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and forced to break up their ſettlement and retire to the interior of the country.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of this year a party of men were ſent by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſtate, who obliged the inhabitants to take the oath of neutr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ity and diſarmed them.</p>
            <p>In A. D. 1777, a party of the Britiſh came into the ſettlement, and obliged the inhabitants to ſwear not to take up arms againſt the King of Britain.</p>
            <p>In 1778, in conſequence of a ſuſpicion that the inhabitants had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d their oath, and ſupplied the enemy with proviſion. Two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies were ſent from the garriſon at Cherry. Valley, who took the principal men priſoners, and drove away all the cattle they could find: The priſoners were carried to Cherry-Valley and examined, then ſent to Albany and confined. In September the ſame year a party of the Oneida Indians came and took away all the men that were left except one who was abſent; and carried them to Fort Stanwix, and delivered them as priſoners to the garriſon under pretence that they took them on their way to Niagara. The women and children were now left alone ſurrounded by hoſtile ſavages and howling beaſt of prey.</p>
            <p>In a few days after the Indians were gone, Elizabeth, the wife Benjamin Lull, ſenior being deprived of her family (which conſiſted of her huſband and five ſons, who were all taken priſoners) formed the reſolution of leaving the place; accordingly ſhe ſet out (accompanied with another woman, who carried with her two ſmall children) through the wood for Cherry-Valley, where they arrived after two days tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, in which they endured great diſtreſs, on account of the ruggedneſs of the way, continual fears of the enemy, and the inclemency of the weather, for a great part of the time it rained exceeding hard, and at night they took up their lodging in an old hut and made their bed of ſome oat-ſtraw. The diſtance they travelled was about thirty-two miles. Mrs. Lull was at this time about 57 years of age, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a pack that was judged to weigh about thirty weight.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort time after this the priſoners were releaſed, as there was nothing found againſt them. They immediately removed their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies back into the old ſettlements. Thus were theſe people driven from their habitations after paſſing through ſcenes of anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, which muſt affect the feeling heart with exquiſite ſenſations.</p>
            <p>But through all their diſtreſs and danger, kind providence protected them, ſo that no lives were loſt except Jackſon's aforeſaid. In 1783 Benjamin Lull with his wife and one ſon returned to the ſettlement and lived alone through the winter.</p>

            <p>IN 1787 there was a collection of nine Babtiſt profeſſors in the town of Springfield, but were not regularly organized as a church: they continued in this ſituation until 1789, when Elder Furman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to that place, whoſe labor in the Goſpel (by the divine bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) proved ſucceſsful.

               <p>Sermon by Eld'r Cornell from Timothy 11.3. After a ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion proceeded to buſineſs. A Platform and plan of union for theſe churches was read and unanimouſly agreed upon.</p>
               <p>The delicate circumſtances in which the infant churches, in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive territory were placed, rendered them liable to impoſitions from artful and deſigning men; and ſeveral ſuch of dangerous principles and corrupt practices having already obtruded themſelves upon theſe new ſettlements, it became indiſpenſibly neceſſary that ſome method ſhould be deviſed to prevent ſuch impoſitions in future, and to keep out of our connexion all perſons ſuſtaining ſuch characters. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conference appointed Eld. Cornell to examine each church reſpecting their faith and practice, and each miniſter concerning his character. After which the aforementioned churches and miniſter being found in a circumſtance to unite, they UNANIMOUSLY vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to conſider themſelves at this and future meetings as an Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the name of the Otſego Aſſociation.

               <p>This being the firſt interview of this nature ever enjoyed in this weſtern country, it was apparently crowned with a divine bleſſing — The preſence of Jehovah was really felt, and the ſouls of God's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple expanded with joy, Some who came to the meeting with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to oppoſe the forming of an Aſſociation, were conſtrained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that God was with them; and their ſouls rejoiced in the union of theſe infant churches. Indeed it was a pleaſing and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, to behold the little churches ſcattered thoughout this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive land, coming up out of the wilderneſs and uniting together in an Aſſociate capacity, thereby exhibiting what the Lord had done and was ſtill doing in this once howling deſert.</p>

                  <p>ON the 17th of January 1798, B'r John Lawton moved into the town of Butternuts, in conſequence of a requeſt of the baptiſt church there: the church at that time was few in number: a good degree of harmony prevailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at this time: but not ſo great an engagedneſs in religion as could be wiſhed; and a great neglect of the duties of religion was prevalent among them; but ſtill there were ſome deſires for more engagedneſs in the cauſe of truth. Early in the ſpring there was ſome ſeriouſneſs apparent on the minds ſome of the youth, but it was ſoon gone: However the truth made ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, the minds of profeſſors ſeemed to be more and more impreſſed with the neceſſity of attending to religious duties: and deſires were encreaſed for the out-pouring of the holy ſpirit. Thus it continued until Lords day Auguſt 26th 1798, when one was excluded the church privileges, for immoral conduct. This was a ſolemn ſcene, it being the firſt caſe of that nature in the church. The members were deeply affected, and the audience in general appeared ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn and attentive: about this time information was received of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Otego creek. Lords day, September 26th 1798, was a ſolemn day; in the meeting, the power of the Lord ſeemed to be preſent; and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of youth and other perſons ſeemed to be greatly alarmed, while the people of God much encouraged. About this time a young woman gave a relation of

October 10th, Elder Hoſmer preached a ſermon from I. Peter 111, 12. and baptized four perſons. This was a ſolemn time, the arm of the Lord was revealed, and the glory of God diſplayed: the tongues of God's children were looſed, and their ſouls were filled with joy and gladneſs: while ſinners were expreſſing their concern with many tears and ſigns, fobs and groans were heard on every ſide: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the powerful operators many were paſſing under, yet there was no appearance of any wild enthuſiaſtic zeal: But a national concern agitated the minds of ſinners, while the children of God ſeemed to rejoice from having r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>SOME GENERAL REMARKS.</head>
            <p>WE have been particular in noting the day when the churches were formed, and by whom they were received into fellowſhip, that we may give the reader ſome idea of their circumſtances in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſtate of the country, and when there were but ſew in habitants to what there is now. The ſettlements were very ſmall and ſcattered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a great extent of country: many of the firſt ſettlers were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed children of God, but in general they became backſliders: the difficulties of ſettling a new and uncultivated country, the hardſhips they endured, and the want of opportunities to attend on religious meetings, may be aſſigned as part of the reaſons for this declenſion. God permitted them in ſome meaſure to overcome the ſtubbornneſs of the country, and then was pleaſed to recall the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of their minds. The reformations began with thoſe backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and was attended with power on the hearts of thoſe that knew not God; and yet the village perhaps ſo ſmall that all might meet in a ſmall log houſe, and if the ſhower extended further, a log barn or an adjacent wood formed their place of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Our brethren in the old towns and cities have ſept abroad accounts of the wonderful work of God among them, but if we take a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative view of the numbers, if ten in our ſmall villages are brought to the knowledge of the truth, it is more in proportion than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in ſome of thoſe places: but in ſome places, where the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been of earlier date, it has been ſurpriſing to ſee the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers collected, inſtances have been known of two or three hundred people convening at a weekly lecture. None of theſe churches are of longer ſtanding than about ſeven years (excepting Springfield church,) which time is ſhort for the extraordinary increaſe, which is about four times the number ſince the aſſociation formed, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five years. There are yet a number of churches in Onondaga and Ontario counties which have formed a conference among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, concerning which we have been able to obtain little or no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; a number of reformations have taken place there under the preaching of our fellow laborer Elder David Iriſh an account of which we cannot obtain before this goes to the preſs.</p>
            <p>We have given an account by whom theſe churches were received into fellowſhip, that we might inform the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In June 1795, Eld'r Aſhoal Hoſmer removed his family to Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington and began to labor, in connexion with Eld'rs Butler and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whoſe friendſhip to him as a ſtranger and unuſed to the woods, he is ever ready to acknowledge. An expenſive circuit became the lot of each of theſe, the frequent calls from the little numbers in one place and another, "to come over and help us," neceſſitated them to encounter the hardſhips of rains and ſnow, by day and night, through uncultivated wilds and unoccupied roads, without much hopes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Joined to theſe diſcouragements was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of greater magnitude; that was, the frequent intruſion of men of corrupt principles and characters, who, imagining that the country was favorable to their ſiniſter views, not only journeyed, but ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually removed and got into the vicinity of ſome of the ſmall churches, and through their means diviſions and contentions aroſe, which cauſed councils, the preachers muſt be called for, and when they diſcharged their duty, and bore teſtimony againſt their evil conduct, heavy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections from them and their partizans were the conſequence, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid all theſe diſcourag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About the firſt of January 1796, I agreed to preach at Litchfield one half of the time for one year. During this year I rode and preached in many places; and in the month<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The extent of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation from eaſt to weſt is about one hundred and forty miles, &amp; from north to ſouth about 60. The firſt aſſociation was holden in a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghouſe, built by the baptiſts and congregationaliſts in Springfield, the ſecond moſtly in the woods, the third in a barn, the fourth and fifth in dwelling houſes; and in all theſe the preſence of the Lord has more than made up the want of convenience. The rapid increaſe of theſe new ſettlements has now made many of our congregations reſpectable, though it is to be lamented that many of the ſettlers do not attention the worſhip of God.</p>

               <salute>"DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>"IN compliance with your requeſt, I ſend you an account reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religion in this new ſettlement in the ſummer of 1796, being deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of preaching a number of ſerious perſons agreed to meet togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the ſabbath, to read and pray together, which was ever after attended to. In the winter of 1797 religious conferences were ſet up and attended to weekly, although the number very ſmall, part of the not more than one male excluſive of the family where the meeting was held would attend. Although very diſcouraging, yet they were continued. A moſt remarkable ſtupidity appeared among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. About the beginning of Autumn 1797, there was one woman under ſtrong impreſſions of mind; and I truſt ſhe was born again as ſhe gives evidence of the new birth. The 9th of June, 1798, a church was gathered here by the Rev. Mr. S— which conſiſted of 13 members, which had belonged to other churches; there has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions made until its number was 24, ſince which two have moved away.</p>
            <p>The latter part of the ſummer, 1799, ſeveral perſons appeared to be under ſome impreſſions of mind; the work gradually increaſed till about the laſt of October, when there appeared an uncommon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity on the countenances of people, &amp; a number were ſtruck under ſtrong impreſſions: Nearly at the ſame time in No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ember, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were propounded to the church, and laſt ſabbath 17 more; and more I expect will ſhortly come forward and confeſs Chriſt before the world. At preſent the awakening appears to be at a ſtand: This work has been remarkable on account of the ſteadineſs of the people: nothing of the enthuſiaſtic nature has appeared; God is a ſovereign, he has taken ſome of the moſt unlikely perſons to human appearance; grey headed and middle-aged, and moſtly paſſed by the youth. Oh, my friend I moſt earneſtly intreat your prayers to Almighty God for us, that he would continue to pour out his ſpirit more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and not paſs by the youth, and that it may ſpread from houſe to houſe, from heart to heart, from ſtate to ſtate, and from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to nation; till the glory of the Lord covers the earth as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter does the ſea: which is the ſincere prayer of your friend.</p>
