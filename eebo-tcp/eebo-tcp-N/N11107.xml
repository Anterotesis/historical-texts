            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Remarks, <hi>&amp;</hi>c.</head>
            <p>IT is a fact not controverted by any, that the oppoſition, made by this town and province to a <hi>Britiſh act of parliament,</hi> laying a duty upon the importation of tea in any of the <hi>American colonies,</hi> hath involved us in great miſery and diſtreſs; and that we are threatened with much greater calamities, the horrors of which are beyond deſcription.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>parliament</hi> have or have not a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional power to impoſe this duty, I ſhall not pretend to determine; but this I may venture to ſay, and I hope without giving offence; that the <hi>oppoſition</hi> that hath been generally made to it, is inconſiſtent with our profeſſion of <hi>chriſtianity,</hi> with the <hi>loyalty</hi> we owe to our SOVEREIGN, and the reverence and reſpect that is due to the <hi>Britiſh parliament</hi>; and conſequently, inſtead of being a means to obtain a repeal of the ACTS, will in all probability being on us a heavier condemnation than that of the <hi>port-bill,</hi> or the ACT for the alteration of our <hi>conſtitution.</hi> All that is propoſed by the following pages is to give an impartial repreſentation of the deſtruction of the <hi>tea</hi> in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and to make a few remarks upon the proceedings of the continental and provincial <hi>congreſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the month of December 1773, a number of perſons in diſguiſe collected from Boſton and the neighbouring towns, not having the fear of GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes, or the good of their country at heart unlawfully aſſembled themſelves together, and in a riotous, tumultuous manner deſtroyed a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tea, belonging to the <hi>honorable Eaſt-India com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi>— An action of ſuch a groſs immoral nature
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014074_0003_0F92DB8EE652DE08"/>
as cannot be juſtified upon the principles of equity or policy: An <hi>action</hi> which laid the foundation for the miſeries and calamities we are now groaning under: An <hi>action</hi> of ſuch a malignant atrocious nature, as muſt expoſe the wicked perpetrators of it, without ſincere repentance, to the vengeance of that BEING, who is a GOD of order and not of confuſion, and who will puniſh all THIEVES as well as liars in the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone.</p>
            <p>This <hi>diabolical action</hi> it is true, was diſclaimed by the ſober thinking part of the <hi>town,</hi> but no ſteps were taken either by the <hi>town</hi> or <hi>government,</hi> to ſhow their diſlike of it; on the contrary, many amongſt us, who would be thought to be <hi>religious,</hi> in which claſs were ſome of the <hi>clergy,</hi> endeavoured to palliate the crime, as they ſaid it prevented a worſe evil, not duly conſidering that <hi>chriſtianity</hi> forbids our doing <hi>moral evil</hi> though ever ſo much <hi>good</hi> ſhould come from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The parliament of Great-Britain,</hi> highly incenſed againſt the <hi>town,</hi> for ſuch an <hi>outrageous</hi> action, thought proper to puniſh us by paſſing an <hi>act</hi> called the <hi>port bill.</hi> By which <hi>act</hi> it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that the innocent ſuffer as much, if not more than the guilty, which is often the caſe in <hi>national puniſhments</hi> and cannot well be avoided. However, as ſevere as this act may be accounted by ſome, the ſeverity of it would have been in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure leſſened, if the <hi>town</hi> had done their duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the news we had or the bill's having the <hi>royal ſanction,</hi> by paying the money to the order of the <hi>Eaſt-India company</hi>; and had they complied with the other parts of the <hi>act,</hi> which <hi>juſtice</hi> and good <hi>policy</hi> required them to do, the <hi>port</hi> would not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014074_0004_0F92DB90E647D5D0"/>
have been ſhut up above four months, the damages then would have been inconſiderable to what we now ſuffer by our refuſing to comply with the requiſitions of <hi>ſaid act</hi>; the charitable donations from the <hi>other governments,</hi> being very ſhort of a conpenſation for what we ſuffer by the loſs of our <hi>trade.</hi>—But to do juſtice to the ſober thinking part of the <hi>town,</hi> upon the certain news of the port bill's being carried into an <hi>act,</hi> they thought it to be our intereſt and duty immediately to pay for the <hi>tea</hi>; accordingly a <hi>town</hi> meeting was called to conſult what was proper to be done upon this alarming occaſion: And it ſeemed to be the ſenſe of moſt who were then preſent, that out of <hi>policy</hi> at leaſt, we ought to comply with the requiſitions of the <hi>act,</hi> but many difficulties were ſtarted as to the manner of doing it; ſome propoſed the voting of the money directly; this was objected to, as being illegal, the <hi>town</hi> not having any authority by <hi>law</hi> to raiſe monies for that purpoſe without the ſpecial aid of the <hi>general court,</hi> but as they were to ſet in a few weeks, it was motioned that a petition ſhould be preferred to them to enable the <hi>town</hi> to borrow the money upon the credit of a future tax; others thought that the <hi>province</hi> ought to pay the money, or at leaſt to let them have the loan of it for a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years without intereſt, and that a <hi>committee</hi> ſhould be raiſed to apply to them for that purpoſe: But others, whoſe <hi>importance</hi> and <hi>political ſalvation</hi> depend upon the <hi>province</hi> being kept in a continual flame, and obſerving that the general ſenſe of the <hi>town</hi> was in favour of paying for the <hi>tea,</hi> though they did not chuſe openly to oppoſe ſuch a <hi>righteous meaſure,</hi> yet artfully threw difficulties in the way of the different methods that were propoſed: They
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014074_0005_0F92DB911B7EB628"/>
did not pretend to deny the juſtice and equity of paying for it, but obſerved that this <hi>act</hi> might affect all the <hi>colonies</hi>; and that as in all probability there would ſoon be a <hi>continental congreſs</hi>; it would be our wiſdom to do nothing until we had the united ſenſe of the <hi>colonies</hi>; and that they did not doubt they would recommend the payment for the tea, and each <hi>colony</hi> would willingly advance their proportion of it; whereas, if we ſhould immediately order the payment they may poſſibly reſent it, and conſtrue it as our ſubmitting to the <hi>act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> impoſing the duty upon that article, and ſo the <hi>union</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> which at preſent ſubſiſts between the <hi>colonies</hi> would be in great danger of being deſtroyed.—In the mean time it was propoſed that we ſhould repreſent to the ſeveral <hi>colonies</hi> our diſtreſſed condition, praying them for relief for our ſuffering brethren, who were out of employ by reaſon of the <hi>port bill.</hi> Theſe reaſons though altogether deſtitute of ſincerity, ſeemed to be very plauſible, and they accordingly had their effect: And the <hi>town</hi> did nothing further concerning it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>general court</hi> met upon the laſt wedneſday in May, and were adjourned to Salem the tueſday following, but as no application was made to them, they took no <hi>order</hi> relative to it: And as nothing was done by the <hi>general court,</hi> nor likely to be done by the <hi>town,</hi> in order to open the <hi>port,</hi> the worthy tradeſmen began to be very uneaſy, and thought it proper, that they, who were like to be ſuch great ſufferers, ſhould have a meeting by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſult what was proper to be done to prevent their <hi>ruin</hi>; they accordingly aſſembled at <hi>Faneuil-hall</hi> to the number of two or three hundred, and many if not moſt of them went with a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014074_0006_0F92DB91C996E138"/>
reſolution to uſe their endeavors that the tea ſhould be paid for; but ſo artful and induſtrious were the <hi>principal heads</hi> of the oppoſition to <hi>government,</hi> that they placed themſelves at the doors of the <hi>hall</hi> and told the tradeſmen as they entered, that now was the time to ſave our <hi>country.</hi>—That if they gave their voice in favor of paying for the tea, we ſhould be undone, and the chains of <hi>ſlavery</hi> would be rivitted upon us! which ſo terrified many honeſt well meaning perſons, that they thought it not prudent to act at all in the affair, and ſo nothing was concluded upon.</p>
            <p>The next day the <hi>committee of correſpondence</hi> diſperſed among the people a moſt <hi>wicked, diabolical</hi> hand bill called a <hi>league and covenant,</hi> which was ſent to every <hi>town</hi> and <hi>diſtrict</hi> in the PROVINCE, calling upon the inhabitants to ſign it, which paper was introduced in many <hi>towns</hi> by the <hi>miniſter</hi> of the pariſh, who ſet them the example of ſigning firſt, and then called upon his pariſhioners to engage in the ſame <hi>covenant,</hi> and to ſign it upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion table, and it is reported that a certain <hi>cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman</hi> in the <hi>county</hi> of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> gravely told his people, that they who refuſed to ſign it were not worthy to come to that <hi>table.</hi>—I do not pretend to ſay poſitively that this is a fact, though it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed: But be that as it may, it is certain that many of the <hi>diſſenting clergy</hi> have ſo far proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituted their <hi>ſacred office,</hi> as to be leaders and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers of the people to ſign this wicked covenant, whereby they have led many of their people to commit the <hi>horrible crime of perjury</hi>; for not one of many hundred of thoſe who have ſigned it, have paid any regard to it, and what makes it more ſurpriſing that they ſhould have exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014074_0007_0F92DB93599028B0"/>
upon that occaſion is, that not one in <hi>Boſton</hi> where this <hi>covenant</hi> was fabricated has ſigned it; and conſequently every countryman who has, and has any dealings with the <hi>Boſtonians</hi> muſt infallibly perjure himſelf.</p>
            <p>We have now done with the <hi>ſolemn league</hi> and <hi>covenant,</hi> and ſhall proceed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations of the proceedings of the <hi>continental Congreſs.</hi> In the month of September they aſſembled at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> with all the pomp and grandeur of Plenipotentiaries; when the expectations of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general were, that by their wiſe and prudent councils, reſpectful and dutiful petitions to his MAJESTY and to his <hi>parliament,</hi> a door would be open for the <hi>ſupreme legiſlature of Great-Britain,</hi> conſiſtent with the honor and dignity of that <hi>auguſt aſſembly,</hi> to have our grievances redreſſed, and that the firſt ſtep that would have been taken for that purpoſe, would have been to have adviſed the <hi>town</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> to pay for the <hi>tea.</hi> But alaſs how have we been diſappointed! Thoſe perſons who have been the occaſion of our political troubles in this <hi>province,</hi> were members of this <hi>continental body,</hi> and having already become <hi>deſperate</hi> themſelves had no other card to play, but to involve the whole <hi>continent</hi> in their <hi>rebellion.</hi>—No doubt vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, that although a ſingle <hi>town</hi> or <hi>province</hi> may be reduced by the power of GREAT-BRITAIN; they would not venture an attack againſt the whole <hi>continent.</hi>—The Maſſachuſetts delegates ſo far ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their plan, that the firſt thing the <hi>congreſs</hi> did that was made public, was the adopting of the reſolutions of the county of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which were not ſhort of high <hi>treaſon</hi> and <hi>rebellion,</hi> nothing healing or ſalutary could then be expected from ſuch a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,</hi>

the only apology that could be made for their conduct was, that they came into this vote imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after drinking thirty two bumpers of the <hi>beſt madeira,</hi> and it ſeems the next morning when their heads were cool, they were aſhamed of what they had done; but it was then too late for a reconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vote, a copy of it atteſted by the <hi>preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> having been forwarded to <hi>Boſton</hi> by our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy citizen <hi>Paul Revere,</hi> who was diſpatched from <hi>Boſton</hi> as a <hi>courier</hi> with the <hi>Suffolk reſolves</hi>; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to avoid making any ſuch miſtakes for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they prudently determined to do no buſineſs after dinner.</p>
            <p>Their whole proceedings as they are made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, no doubt are in the hands of every gentleman who hath any taſte for <hi>political controverſy</hi>; though by the way, they cautiouſly omitted inſerting this extraordinary vote in the pamphlet they publiſhed, entitled, "Extracts from the votes and proceedings of the American continental congreſs."</p>
            <p>As ſeveral gentlemen at <hi>New-York,</hi> have made very ſenſible remarks upon their proceedings, and have proved to demonſtration if their aſſociation be ſtrictly adhered to, we muſt be involved in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ruin: For trade and commerce is the ſupport of the <hi>farmer</hi> as well as the <hi>merchant</hi> and <hi>ſhopkeep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>; and the foundation of learning; without which, in proceſs of time, there will be no true rational <hi>religion</hi> amongſt us; and as their writings are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the <hi>province,</hi> it is needleſs for me fully and particularly to animadvert upon them: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it may not be amiſs to make a few curſory remarks upon their conduct, which, whether perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or not, is humbly ſubmitted.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014074_0009_0F92DB95C75676B8"/>And here it is worthy of notice, they have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the number of thoſe that were concerned in the deſtruction of the <hi>tea,</hi> to thirty or forty, when it is very evident that TWO THOUSAND at leaſt, were employed either directly in deſtroying the <hi>tea,</hi> or in keeping a centry at the entrance of the wharf where the ſhips lay, and at thoſe wharves contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thereto: They then exclaim againſt the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>port bill,</hi> in puniſhing <hi>thirty thouſand,</hi> as they ſay, for the offence of a few individuals. It is poſſible that moſt of the <hi>congreſs</hi> might not have been acquainted with the truth of the fact, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the veracity of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates,</hi> put full faith and confidence in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations; be that as it may, it is manifeſt that thoſe members who went from <hi>Boſton,</hi> knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they certainly gave their voice in favor of a <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious falſhood,</hi> knowing it to be ſuch. What apology then can be made for gentlemen of their EXALTED CHARACTER, that for the ſake of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a point, could be guilty of ſuch a crime, that every one who is not entirely loſt to all ſenſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor would be aſhamed of?

This aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was agreed upon the 20th of October, 1774.</p>
            <p>Although there is nothing compulſive in this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, yet being compared with ſome other of their articles and reſolves, it is manifeſt they deſigned it ſhould have the operation of <hi>law</hi>; and it hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly had that effect in regard to ſeveral veſſels that have arrived at Salem and Plymouth, ſince the firſt day of December, the owners of which cargoes, have had their goods piratically taken from them and expoſed to public ſale, agreable to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned article.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:014074_0011_0F92DB97D0306CA8"/>Now admitting for argument ſake, this <hi>congreſs</hi> were conſtitutionally the <hi>ſupreme legiſlature</hi> of the whole <hi>continent,</hi> could any thing be more unjuſt, tyrannical, arbitrary and oppreſſive? Can the edicts of the moſt deſpotic princes under heaven exceed it? Pray what offence againſt the laws of GOD or man, or even againſt the ſenſe of the <hi>continent,</hi> have theſe merchants been guilty of, who have ordered goods to be ſhipped them from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> Ireland or the Weſt-Indies, and which could not poſſibly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive here 'till after the firſt day of December, that they ſhould be ſubjected to ſuch ſevere penalties?

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Charity</hi> to the proper objects of it, is no doubt a <hi>chriſtian duty,</hi> and a ſacrifice acceptable to the SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREME BEING; and GOD forbid that any thing ſhould be ſaid to diſcourage it; but it is an old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we ought not to rob <hi>Peter</hi> to pay <hi>Paul</hi>; nay, <hi>charity</hi> to the poor, when what we beſtow on them is the fruit of <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>robbery,</hi> is ſo far from being a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> with which GOD will be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that it will be a <hi>ſtench</hi> in his <hi>noſtrils.</hi> It is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014074_0012_0F92DB98905F3920"/>
no better than if a number of VILLAINS ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an <hi>aſſociation,</hi> to go upon the highway, and rob every gentleman they ſhould meet, with a <hi>pious</hi> deſign to relieve their poor brethren who were ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Newgate</hi> for their crimes; or even for the relief of thoſe, who by the providence of GOD were reduced to a ſtate of poverty; in neither of which caſes would they be entitled to the reward which is promiſed the <hi>charitable chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, theſe poor inhabitants among whom this <hi>charity</hi> is diſtributed, are not all of them neceſſarily ſufferers by the <hi>port-bill</hi>: Many of them might have been employed by the army in their reſpective occupations, whereby they would have accumulated more wealth than they could poſſibly have earned, if that <hi>act</hi> called the <hi>Boſton port-bill</hi> had never been paſſed, but they were prevented by the <hi>troublers</hi> of <hi>our Iſrael,</hi> left a ſtop ſhould be put to the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble donations from the neighbouring <hi>colonies.</hi>— Now the real unavoidable ſufferers by this act are the merchants and traders, and conſequently they are the perſons who have an equitable claim at leaſt to a part of the donations; but inſtead of conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in that light, the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>congreſs</hi> hath laid a tax upon them, to ſupport ſome of thoſe who by their induſtry in their ſeveral callings may get as comfortable a ſupport, as if this act had never paſſed. "Tell it not in Gath!"</p>
            <p>The <hi>continental congreſs</hi> have recommended it to the reſpective <hi>provincial congreſſes,</hi> to make ſuch further orders, as may by them be thought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to carry their orders into execution, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leads me to take ſome notice of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the provincial congreſs of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay held at Cambridge in November, 1774.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014074_0013_0F92DB995F9E44D0"/>But before we proceed to make any remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>conduct</hi> it will not be improper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the <hi>continental congreſs</hi> as they had no buſineſs with any <hi>acts of parliament,</hi> but thoſe that affected all the <hi>colonies,</hi> conſequently the <hi>Boſton port-bill,</hi> and the act for altering the charter and government of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Bay,</hi> and the <hi>Quebec bill,</hi> ought to have been out of the queſtion any further than as the <hi>port-bill</hi> being manifeſtly for the puniſhment of a certain offence that was charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> they ought to have adviſed them to pay the money for the <hi>tea,</hi> ſo that all the <hi>colonies</hi> might ſtand upon an equal footing in their humble application to his MAJESTY and to the <hi>parliament</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to repeal the <hi>act</hi> for laying a duty upon the importation of <hi>tea,</hi> in which all the <hi>colonies</hi> are equally concerned. But for them to pretend that the <hi>port-bill</hi> affected all the <hi>colonies</hi> and therefore it was their duty to intereſt themſelves in it, is perfectly ridiculous.—The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective inhabitants of each <hi>colony</hi> may with as much propriety object to a law made by their own aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for puniſhing <hi>theft</hi> with <hi>death,</hi> and even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to reſcue a delinquent, becauſe poſſibly it may hereafter be their own turn to ſuffer for the like offence.—But the folly and ingratitude of the <hi>congreſs,</hi> it is humbly apprehended will appear in a ſtriking point of light by the following ſimilitude.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe a wealthy <hi>farmer</hi> had acquired a conſiderable real eſtate, and was the <hi>father</hi> of ten ſons; and that theſe children were very ſerviceable to him in their minority, in clearing his lands and in improving his <hi>farms</hi>; at the ſame time he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed a tender and paternal care and affection for them, and aſſiſted them in ſetting out in life; and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014074_0014_0F92DB9A0E42FC58"/>
although they had got the means of a comfortable ſubſiſtence, they were ſtill in a great meaſure depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon their aged <hi>father.</hi>—And that <hi>one</hi> of them who had in a peculiar manner, been nouriſhed by his <hi>indulgent parent,</hi> impatient of thoſe reſtraints that every <hi>parent</hi> hath a right to lay upon his children, ſhould unnaturally rebel againſt him, throw of his dependence, and treat him in an inſulting, injurious manner, ſo as to provoke the <hi>father</hi> to diſinherit him, and turn him off from his farm, which he oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by ſufferance, and by that means this <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſon,</hi> was reduced to great want and indigence. And ſuppoſe that his <hi>indulgent father</hi> at the ſame time willing to receive him to his favor, and rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate him in the poſſeſſion of his farm, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of which, he could get a comfortable ſupport, upon the eaſy conditions of his humble ſubmiſſion, and recognizing his proper authority, and his promiſing to obey him in <hi>all things lawful for the future.</hi>—Suppoſe this undutiful <hi>ſon</hi> ſhould reject theſe lenient propoſals, with indignation, and continuing in his rebellious conduct, ſhould apply to his <hi>brethren</hi> for ſupport, and they, inſtead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing their unhappy <hi>brother</hi> to go to his offended father and ſay "Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and in thy ſight and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon, treat me as one of thy hired ſervants." Should for anſwer, ſay, our father is grown old and peviſh, and become a <hi>tyrant,</hi> and deſigns to make us all ſlaves; when he has ſubdued you, he will attack us; wherefore we adviſe you by no means to ſubmit to his arbitrary injunctions, and we will ſupport you; and when he finds there is a UNION amongſt us to oppoſe his tyrannical meaſures, he will reſtore you to his favor, for we know he has a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014074_0015_0F92DB9AECC26790"/>
peculiar affection for you. But admiting the old gentleman ſhould think his honor was too much concerned to give up this unhappy controverſy without a humble ſubmiſſion on your part, and ſhould perſiſt in oppreſſing you, we will enter into an <hi>aſſociation</hi> among ourſelves, and endeavor to engage all our friends not to have any commercial dealings with him, or with thoſe who ſhall counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance him; we will not purchaſe any of the produce of his <hi>farm,</hi> we will diſcourage his hired ſervants from working for him, or any ways aſſiſting him, in ploughing, ſowing and reaping; in which caſe, his <hi>farms,</hi> will be rendered in a manner uſeleſs to him; neither will we ſupply his friends and thoſe who adhere to him, with the neceſſaries of life; we will convince the old <hi>tyrant</hi> that we can live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, as well as he can without us; and altho' we acknowledge that he hath formerly been very kind to us, yet we have fully ballanced all his favors by the profits that he has accumulated by our labor; and further, <hi>dear brother,</hi> that you may not ſuffer in your GLORIOUS OPPOSITION to him, we will ſeize upon the produce of his farm, if he ſhould ſend any to market after the firſt of December, and apply a certain proportion of it for your ſupport. Now I aſk you, if <hi>children</hi> could act ſuch an unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, unfilial part, what muſt the ſober, judicious part of mankind think of them? What muſt the <hi>aged compaſſionate father</hi> think of them? And how muſt he treat them? Not ſurely as <hi>ſons</hi> but as <hi>baſtards.</hi> And what do you think, if theſe rebellious children ſhould have ſuch intereſt with ſome of the <hi>miniſters</hi> of the goſpel, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

the relief of their <hi>rebellious brother,</hi> when part of the ſupport thus afforded him, was what they got by <hi>robbery.</hi> The application of this ſimilitude is very obvious and needs no comment.</p>
            <p>Having finiſhed the remarks which I originally deſigned to make upon the proceedings of the <hi>grand continental congreſs</hi>; by ſome ſycophants and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers called the <hi>collected wiſdom of the colonies.</hi>— I ſhall proceed very briefly to animadvert upon ſome of the votes or reſolutions of the <hi>provincial congreſs</hi> held at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in November laſt; and here it is proper to obſerve that two gentlemen of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental</hi> were alſo members of the <hi>provincial congreſs,</hi> and by their influence no doubt obtained a vote to confirm and adopt the proceedings of the <hi>grand congreſs,</hi> and as though what they had done was not ſufficient to ruin the trade of the <hi>town</hi> and <hi>country,</hi> in order to compleat our <hi>miſery,</hi> this new fangled <hi>congreſs</hi> unconſtitutionally aſſembled, have in addition thereto, recommended, that in the month of October, 1775, the committees of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection for the ſeveral <hi>towns</hi> in the <hi>province,</hi> ſhould repair to the ſeveral ſtores and ſhops, and take an invoice of the goods they ſhall then have by them, and ſtrictly forbid their expoſing any of them for ſale, and if the reſpective owners of ſuch goods ſhall refuſe to comply with their demands, they are directed to take them into their poſſeſſion, and ſtore them at the riſque of the owners until the <hi>acts</hi> they complain of are repealed; and the inhabitants of the <hi>towns</hi> where ſuch goods are found, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to aſſiſt them in this high handed <hi>robbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, can it be ſuppoſed, that any ſet of men profeſſing chriſtianity, or even common honeſty, can poſſibly be guilty of a greater offence?—Nay
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014074_0017_0F92DB9C5729EA98"/>
is the crime of a <hi>highwayman,</hi> who robs the rich traveller of a few guineas, to be compared with this for it's iniquity? By no means; the latter is not ſo great an offender as the former; for in one caſe the gentleman only loſes a few guineas (as it may be) he can very well ſpare; but in the other, many a <hi>family</hi> may be deprived of the means of ſupport, and in time be reduced to the moſt abject ſtate of <hi>poverty.</hi> The <hi>congreſs</hi> not content with this <hi>wicked reſolve</hi> have <hi>impiouſly</hi> recommended it to the <hi>miniſters</hi> of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> who, by their ſacred office, are not only to preach the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> but to inculcate the duties of morality, in which a due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to government is included; I ſay, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed them by their circular letters, to uſe their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, that their tyrannical and wicked directions be put in execution. But as the weapons of thoſe <hi>reverend gentlemen</hi> are not, or ought not to be carnal, but <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> it is to be hoped they will not make uſe of the former, but confine themſelves to the latter. And certainly it would be more for the reputation of the <hi>clergy,</hi> and the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>religion,</hi> if inſtead of preaching politicks, as two many of them do, they would cry aloud and not ſpare, but lift up their voice like a trumpet, and ſhew unto <hi>Boſton</hi> their tranſgreſſions, and unto the whole <hi>province</hi> their ſins, and plainly tell them, that it is "their iniquities, that have ſeperated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their GOD," and have occaſioned the loſs of what they eſteem their <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges</hi>; and that ſincere repentance and reformation are the only means to have them reſtored to us. But while we continue in a ſtate of <hi>rebellion,</hi> "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing <hi>government,</hi>" "ſpeaking evil of <hi>dignities,</hi>" "and reviling the <hi>ruler</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s people"—encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging

mobs, riots and tumults—deſtroying the ſubſtance of our fellow creatures; inſulting and abuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their perſons in ſuch a manner as a BARBARIAN would be aſhamed of; and robbing them of their private property, to enable us to do acts of <hi>charity</hi> to the poor; it will be of no avail to us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve days of prayer and humiliation.—With ſuch ſacrifices GOD will not be well pleaſed.—But will ſay to us as he did by his <hi>prophet Iſaiah</hi> to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>old,</hi> "When you ſpread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when you make many prayers I will not hear; your hands are full of blood; you have made lies your refuge, and under falſhoods you have hid yourſelves."</p>
            <p>I have now finiſhed what I firſt propoſed, but cannot conclude without a word or two of advice to my deluded <hi>countrymen,</hi> who have been drawn into rebellion, by the lies and miſrepreſentations, of artful, wicked, and deſperate men.—I would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hope, that when you firſt enliſted under their banners, you deſigned no more than a rational peaceable defending your rights and privileges, and had you been early told, that you ſhould ever have gone ſuch lengths as you have, no doubt you would have adopted the language of Hazael and anſwered, "Is thy ſervant a dog, that he can do ſuch things;" and as many of you have forfeited your lives by your treaſonable practices, you may poſſibly think that there will be no mercy for you, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you had as good perſiſt in your <hi>rebellion</hi> as not, but let me tell you this is a ſuggeſtion of the <hi>devil.</hi> Our moſt GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN is far from being <hi>vindictive: Puniſhment</hi> is his <hi>ſtrange work</hi>; and he never inflicts any, but when the <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>government,</hi> and the real good of his ſubjects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014074_0019_0F92DB9DD0D28C90"/>
it. And although the <hi>ringleaders</hi> of this <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rebellion,</hi> may meet with the puniſhment that their crimes do juſtly deſerve, yet thoſe who have been deluded by them, if they give evident proof of their repentance and ſubmiſſion to <hi>government,</hi> and that ſpeedily, may have ſome reaſon to hope, that from his MAJESTY's wonted clemency they ſhall obtain forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore entreat you if you have any love for <hi>your country,</hi> any affection for your <hi>wives</hi> and <hi>children,</hi> and regard for your own ſafety and happineſs; to lay down the <hi>weapons</hi> of your <hi>rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi>; and ſubmit yourſelves to the wiſe, lenient and conſtitutional government we have the happineſs to be under; for we have abundant evidence of his MAJESTY's tender and impartial regard for the rights of his ſubjects; and altho' he will not ſuffer thoſe <hi>who deny his authority,</hi> and the authority of his parliament to eſcape with <hi>impunity,</hi> yet he will moſt graciouſly approve of every conſtitutional mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that may contribute to the peace, happineſs and proſperity of his <hi>colony</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> and which may have the effect to ſhew to the <hi>world,</hi> that he has no wiſh beyond that of reigning in the hearts and affections of his people.</p>
