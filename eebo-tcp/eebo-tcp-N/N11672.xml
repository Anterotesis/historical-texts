            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>" we have both heard of the deep laid plots, the dark and cunning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of thoſe who once ruled over us, to bring ruin and deſtruction upon this whole land; and have ſeen them endeavouring to effect it; by tying our hands firſt with the cords of oppreſſion, that then, with the greater facility, they might faſten our feet in the fetters of ſlavery. This is the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the wicked againſt the juſt: For although we have been a wicked people, and have deſerved more than this from the hands of a righteous God; yet from them we have deſerved better treatment: We never did them any wrong, as a people, but juſt and upright have been our dealings.</p>
            <p>WE have alſo ſeen them gnaſhing upon us with their teeth; as it were, wheting their teeth, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring every inſtrument of cruelty and death poſſible to be invented by them, to ſtrike dread and terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts, to frighten, and thereby bring us baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſubmit to their unjuſt requiſitions, which gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their teeth was accompanied with big threats, to ſpread deſtruction and deſolation over this whole land, if we refuſed to bow our necks, and would not ſubmiſſively take upon them the tyrant's yoke.</p>
            <p>AND we have likewiſe ſeen them brought into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion; the Lord hath laughed at them, i. e. hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014755_0003_0F94DD7679F1E0A8"/>
tied their hands and greatly diſappointed their expectations; for, inſtead of driving all before them, and ſpreading deſolation and deſtruction far and wide, they have been confined within narrow bounds, the ſmall compaſs of a few miles hath contained them for almoſt a year, ſheltered behind moſt ſtrong forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and many large ſhips of war: But although they were within fortreſſes, by nature and art render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt impregnable, yet ſurprize hath ſeized upon them in ſuch a remarkable manner and to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as to cauſe them to leave their ſtrong hold in the greateſt hurry and precipitation; and to flee for their lives, committing themſelves to the ſea for ſafety. "This is the Lord's doing and is marvellous in our eyes." And it becomes us now to conſider of the hand of providence in this happy event, and to make a ſuitable improvement of it; which is to reſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide more in God, thankfully acknowledging his kind interpoſition, and truſt ourſelves and our all with him; who hath hitherto dealt ſo favourably with us, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering mercy in the midſt of judgment.</p>
            <p>THIS whole Pſalm is a diſcourſe upon providence; and the main deſign is to bring the people of God to an intire and hearty acquieſcence in it: Various inſtances are mentioned, wherein the people of God ſeem for a while to be caſt down, and the wicked in ſome meaſure triumphing over them: But he ſhews that the triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, Ver. 2. and 10. "For they ſhall ſoon be cut down like the graſs, and wither as the green herb: For yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be: yea, thou ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently conſider his place, and it ſhall not be." This is ſaid to keep the righteous in a calm, ſedate and tranquil frame of mind, to prevent any uneaſy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude from taking place in their breaſts, at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and ſucceſs of the wicked, and to make them commit their way unto the Lord, confide in, and wait patiently for him; nothing doubting, but that he will make all things work together for their good, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014755_0004_0F94DD7739C206A8"/>
for the deſtruction of thoſe that riſe up againſt them. Ver. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. of the context.</p>
            <p>THE righteous and the wicked are here ſet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt; by which it appears that the righteous have the advantage of the wicked much every way, both in this world and the next: For if the righteous have but little of this world, it is better, it is more than all the abundance of the wicked; for they poſſeſs more by enjoying it better, with more ſatisfaction and greater comfort: "A little that a righteous man hath is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than great revenues without right!" And if they have but little here, yet they are heirs to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is infinitely better than the whole world, and will laſt them for ever, Ver. 18. An inheritance incorruptible, undefiled and which fadeth not away. Or, if the wicked have more honour, renown and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world, the righteous have no cauſe to envy them; for it is but ſhort, fading and dying, and will ſoon turn into ſhame, infamy and diſgrace. Or, if they lay dark ſchemes, deviſe wicked devices, and plot miſchief againſt them; yet, referring all to God, in the uſe of the means afforded them, they have no reaſon to be afraid: For he that ſitteth in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who regards, who loves the righteous, and whoſe ears are open to their cry, will undertake for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, defence and ſalvation; will laugh at the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, blow upon their devices and confound them, Ver. 38 and 9. But the tranſgreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the end of the wicked ſhall be cut off. But the ſalvation of the righteous is of the Lord, he is their ſtrength in the time of trouble. And this is ſpoken to the righteous in order to keep up their ſpirits and make them hold on, and hold out, and not give up when engaged in a good cauſe, though their enemies be many and potent, crafty and ſubtle, and have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in ſome meaſure attending them; being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to carry into execution ſome of their malicious purpoſes and wicked devices. And as we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a conteſt with ſuch as we juſtly eſteem uſurpers
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014755_0005_0F94DD77FA0D82E0"/>
and encroachers; who have in a moſt unjuſt manner levied war upon us: And we, being ſatisfied of the juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs of our cauſe, have appealed to heaven to decide the controverſy; we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be often looking up to God, as the Lord of Hoſts and God of armies, and depend on him, more than on our own ſtrength or wiſdom: "For the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong." And we ſhould take notice of every of his providences, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging his hand in them.—With a view to this, I ſhall further diſcourſe from theſe words: Which naturally lead us,</p>
            <p>IN the Firſt place, to take notice of the malicious, crafty and evil machinations, plots and devices of the wicked againſt the juſt.</p>
            <p>AND then, Secondly, To ſhew in what manner their unjuſt, proud and inſolent proceedings will turn to their own ſhame, diſgrace or infamy.</p>
            <p>Firſt, then, WE are to take notice of the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, crafty and evil machinations, plots and devices of the wicked againſt the juſt. It is here aſſerted that the wicked plotteth againſt the juſt: For wiſe reaſons and holy ends they are permitted to do ſo, by the wiſe and righteous Governor of the world; he permits them to take their courſe in contriving wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that their deſtruction may be of themſelves.</p>
            <p>WE ſhall begin at the foundation of the plotting of the wicked againſt the juſt, and follow them from the beginning down to the preſent day, in as conciſe a manner as poſſible; from which we ſhall be able, in the application, to aſcertain the true character of each, and make it appear, to which the one and the other belong, in the preſent ſtruggle betwen Great-Britain, and the UNITED COLONIES of AMERICA.</p>
            <p>WE would obſerve then, that there is a rooted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred &amp; enmity in the hearts of the ungodly againſt both God and his people: There is that in them, which is contrary to holineſs, righteouſneſs and purity; for this reaſon they are ſaid to be of their father the devil,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014755_0006_0F94DB3BBAB6F9B0"/>
whoſe works they do. They imitate him in contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every wile and ſtratagem poſſible to be invented by them, to bring ruin and deſtruction upon the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous people of God, who never meant them any harm, nor ever did them any wrong: This hath been the caſe, ever ſince Lucifer, once Son of the morning, but now prince of darkneſs, with helliſh malice ſo artful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſucceſsfully practiſed his devices upon the firſt Parent of the human race: By which one plot he got the world, in a ſenſe, under his dominion; led man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind captive at his will, and gained them upon his ſide againſt a righteous and holy God. Hence he is called the God of this world, and the prince of the power of the air; and is ſaid to be that ſpirit, which now worketh in the hearts of the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: And Chriſt hath undertaken to releaſe theſe captives, "to open the priſon doors to them that are bound, to take them from the dominion and deliver them from the power of Satan, and to bring them into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God." And the great Captain of our ſalvation will not ceaſe to ride forth conquering and to conquer, till he hath wholly ſpoiled the principalities and powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; led captivity captive, and deſtroyed him that hath the power of death, that is the devil. This is the foundation of the quarrel which Satan hath raiſed and continues in the world: And he carries on his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns by deceit, low-cunning and craft; he works in the dark, under handed, under ground; and ſo do his imps; hence he is called the prince of darkneſs, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the children of darkneſs; and both anſwer the character. In oppoſition to theſe the juſt are called the children of light; who always act above ground, and are open and fair in their proceedings, and do the thing that is lawful and right: But the wicked never ſtick at the baſeneſs of an action, no matter how vile, nor how cruel, if it hath but the appearance of ſubſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their malicious deſigns, in gratifying their rage, pride, or luſts. It is enough to put them upon the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014755_0007_0F94DD78BA0F4BE8"/>
moſt inhuman and bloody actions, to ſee but the leaſt proſpect of accompliſhing their wicked deſigns: Thus Cain, that firſt child of the evil one, in a ſly under hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner roſe up againſt, and ſlew his righteous bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this hath been the manner of the wicked from the beginning to the preſent day; whatever they do or deviſe againſt the righteous, it is unjuſt, and they endeavour as much as poſſible to deviſe and practiſe it in the dark. And, ſhould we look through their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings as far as we are able, we ſhould find, that this hath been their manner; we ſhould ſee a great deal of cunning policy and artful contrivance, dark ſchemes, and deep plots of the moſt black and helliſh nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of God. But ſuffice it to ſay, that this is the very nature of the kingdom of darkneſs; it is upheld, promoted, and carried on by darkneſs and iniquity, as well in large bodies and communities, as in the hearts of particular perſons: And this is always the caſe, except when they have got ſuch power in their hands as to think there is no danger of miſcarrying in their wicked deſigns; and then they will be open, bold and bare-faced, being ſure to drive all before them: And this power for a while is ſometimes given them. Thus, ſaith Chriſt to his malicious perſecutors, "this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs." And they delight to work in the dark—ſhut their eyes againſt the light—chuſe not to ſee it, and even court decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when purſuing their malicious deſigns: Thus did that proud and haughty Monarch Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and Saul, king of Iſrael, and the chief rulers among the Jews in Chriſt's time, &amp;c. And the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichriſt hath been upheld to this day, by keeping the people in ignorance and practiſing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit upon them; "by many dark ſigns and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the nations have been deceived;" and in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way could they uphold their kingdom, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their evil devices; for, ſhould the light of the truth be admitted, and diſperſe the dark clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and error, in which it is involved; that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014755_0008_0F94DD7981A49FB0"/>
would ſhake to its very foundations, and totter to the ground. And the neceſſity of keeping out of ſight, in order to carry into execution their diabolical plans, hath introduced this maxim, that deception is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary qualification to conſtitute a man an able poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician: And it is ſo—where wickedneſs is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, in laying plots and concerting ſchemes of a hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nature, which will not endure the light of the ſun; theſe muſt be carried into execution, in darkneſs, by deception. Upon this principle it is that the papal hierarchy have always been deviſing miſchief and practiſing deceit, to deſtroy the proteſtants (whom they call hereticks) from off the face of the earth. And ſo wicked and abandoned are they, ſo full of deceit, that they have often made oaths, promiſes and ſolemn proteſtations, for no other purpoſe than to deceive; and, whenever it appears for their intereſt, make no ſcruple to break over them all. And nothing is too bad for them to do; no matter what, if it hath but the appearance of affording them the leaſt help and aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in deſtroying or extirpating the people of the Lord: Witneſs their endeavours once and again to place the Pretender on the throne of England; their powder plot, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>AND at this day Britons have joined hands with them in this, to violate oaths, break promiſes and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn engagements: The faith of kings is regarded as nothing; ſolemn charters, the agreement between a king and his ſubjects (which ſhould ever be held as ſacred) are ſet at nought, broken over, troden under foot, &amp;c. and no ſtone hath been left unturned, no ſcheme unattempted, nor plot undeviſed, how villainous ſoever, if attended with any conſiderable proſpect of annoying, diſtreſſing, and reducing us to a ſtate of vile ſubjection, and baſe ſervitude. Obſerve their ſeveral ſteps, attempting, firſt, by ſubtil devices and deep laid plots; then by big words, threatning our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then by endeavours to rob, impoveriſh and ſtarve us into a baſe ſubmiſſion; and then by open violence,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014755_0009_0F94DD7A4A9939F0"/>
with every inſtrument of death pointed at our breaſts, to deſtroy, or force us to bow our necks, and take upon them the yoke of oppreſſion, tyranny and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude. All this is couched under Acts of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Senate: The revenue Acts, the Quebec Bill, the Boſton Port Bill, the fiſhery Bill, and the bloody Act, which dooms the American Colonies in a ſtate of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rebellion, for nothing but aſſerting, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining our juſt rights, liberties and privileges. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was there a more bare-faced plotting of the wicked againſt the juſt from the beginning till now; for there never was a people more loyal to their King, never any that ſhewed greater fidelity and all due ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, till our rights and liberties were encroached up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without the leaſt provocation given. They then plotted our ruin, when we gloried in being the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſubjects of England's King; long did they try to keep behind the curtain, and in darkneſs hide their baſe and evil intentions; but this being impracticable, through the vigilance of thoſe whoſe breaſts were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with patriotic virtue, and whoſe diſcernment was too great not to ſee through their dark and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns, who giving notice thereof to the people, with united voices, they proclaim aloud, <hi>liberty and property; down with oppreſſion:</hi> Which voice reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of King, Lords and Commons, who were ſo enraged at our diſcovery of the ſnare ſet for us, and our reſolutions not to be tamely ſhackled with the fetters of ſlavery, that they gnaſhed upon us with their teeth: The <hi>Lion</hi> rouſed, with grim and horrible looks, and with open mouth ruſhed, to ſeize his prey; fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hopes of certain and ſpeedy conqueſt, they diſdained our remonſtrances, nor would they liſten to our humble petitions: Nothing would ſatisfy their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious appetites, ſhort of an abſolute ſurrender of our liberty and property into their hands; we muſt ſubmit, and acknowledge that they have a right to bind us by acts of their own in all caſes whatſoever, or ſuffer the utmoſt that their power and policy, rage
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014755_0010_0F94DD7B06E7D668"/>
and malice could inflict upon us; there was no alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native: Therefore, upon our non-ſubmiſſion, they ſoon began their horrid and bloody deſign; when God and nature, juſtice to ourſelves, and poſterity, love to our country, to our wives and children, and the blood of our fellow country-men, wantonly ſpilled upon the ground, called loud upon us to ruſh to arms; we obeyed; and, thro' the interpoſition of heaven, ſucceſs hath hitherto remarkably crowned our endeavours, to fruſtrate their evil deſigns, to bring to nought their deep laid plots, and make their ſchemes abortive. Diſappointment, ſhame and confuſion hath hitherto fallen upon them; and thus it is with the wicked, in their malicious plotting againſt the juſt, and gnaſhing upon them with their teeth.</p>
            <p>THE manner of its being effected, was the next thing to be ſhewn. We proceed then to ſhew,</p>
            <p>Secondly, IN what manner their unjuſt, proud, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and inſolent proceedings will turn to their own ſhame, diſgrace, or infamy.</p>
            <p>HERE it may be neceſſary to obſerve that God often ſuffers the wicked to proceed to great lengths, before he laughs at them; permits them to proceed with ſuch an high hand, as to make the righteous fear, that they will drive all before them; but however ſucceſsful they may be in any of their enterprizes, thoſe that truſt in God, and believe his word, have no reaſon to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, or to give up a righteous cauſe on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: If this ſhould now be the caſe; ſhould our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies appear moſt formidable in their preparations, and like a flood threaten to ſwallow us up, and be in any meaſure ſucceſsful againſt us; it ſhould ſerve, not to diſcourage, but make us cleave faſter and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend more upon the Lord of Hoſts and the God of armies; believing that he will in due time diſappoint and confound them: This word is enough to keep up our ſpirits, ſo long as we make God our truſt and refuge, the Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth that his day is coming: For there is nothing, that they can deviſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014755_0011_0F94DD7BC4EBA0D8"/>
or plot, but what God permits, nor can they proceed an inch farther, in carrying their ſchemes into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than he ſuffers them; and, when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as that their ſhame and diſgrace ſhall be moſt conſpicuous, or fall with the greateſt weight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, then will be the time for the Lord to laugh at them and pour contempt upon them. And this is brought about by various means; as God in his infinite wiſdom ſees fit and beſt, ſometimes in one way and manner, and ſometimes in another; but by whatſoever method, or means it is effected, we ſhould always remember, that God's hand is principal: When the wicked are put to confuſion and ſhame, and infamy comes upon them, it is the Lord's doing; and God's people ſhould attribute it, not to themſelves, as if by their ſuperior wiſdom, ſtrength or courage, they had put their enemies to confuſion, flight or ſhame. For if we have wiſdom, reſolution and bravery to make a bold and manly ſtand, this ſhould be attributed to God, and all the ſucceſs of it to him, who "giveth power to the faint, and encreaſeth ſtrength to them that have no might."</p>
            <p>BUT the way and manner in which he moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly effects their ſhame and diſgrace, is, by permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to concert their ſchemes and lay their plots in ſecret, and to proceed in ſuch a manner as to raiſe their expectations high, preſuming their plans to be ſo well concerted, as that nothing can diſappoint them; and, when they have got ripe for execution, to blaſt all their hopes, fruſtrate their evil deſigns, and many times turn the miſchief they intended to others upon their own heads; <note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 14 and 15. of the context.</note> and this by means that they leaſt tho't of, and which were looked upon by them, as inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant and not worthy their notice. And the more deſpicable the means are, by which it is effected, ſo much the more conſpicuous is the hand of God; and nothing can be more apparent; unleſs, where means are made uſe of, that are above the reach of men; as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014755_0012_0F94DD7C85C101D8"/>
when the ſtars in their courſes, the winds, waves, &amp;c, are employed (as is often the caſe) to put a ſtop to the evil proceedings of the wicked. And being unable to execute their malicious purpoſes, and having lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up themſelves upon high raiſed hopes and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; priding, vaunting and boaſting of ſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in their enterprizes; diſappointment under theſe circumſtances falls with a double weight upon their heads, bringing an inſupportable load of ſhame and diſgrace. Thus oftentimes God pours contempt upon Princes, and makes proud inſolent oppreſſors gnaſh their teeth for rage at their diſappointment.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES God opens their eyes and gives them to ſee their folly in their unjuſt and evil proceedings; and ſhame and confuſion cover their faces.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES by putting fear, dread and terror into their hearts, by which they are rendered unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to proceed in their evil deſigns. This, He, who hath all hearts in his hand, can, and often doth effect, by the ſmalleſt means. A rumour is ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten and affrighten the Aſſyrian hoſt. 2 Kings xix.7. Yea the ſound of a ſhaken leaf is enough to chaſe and make them flee, as if flying from the ſword; and in their flight to deſtroy each other, Lev. xxvi.36. This was remarkably the caſe, when the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the children of the Eaſt, an innumerable multitude, were routed and put to confuſion by Gideon, with his three hundred men, Judges vii.21, 22.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES by bringing to light their dark deſigns and ſetting them in open view, ſhame and diſgrace is bro't upon the contrivers; and when malicious, deep laid plots are diſcovered and laid open; the wicked machinators will gnaw their tongues with rage, at their overthrow: And God often makes the means, which they uſe to bring about their wicked purpoſes, to effect their own ſhame, and ſo "taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:014755_0013_0F94DD7D43C9C5B8"/>GOD knows how to deal with all the wicked, how far to let them proceed in their evil deſigns, and when is the beſt time to put a ſtop to their evil proceedings; and, when that time comes, he will then do it in his own way and manner, which is always the beſt: God's own people may ſometimes think it is time for God to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and work for their ſalvation and for the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their enemies, long before it is accompliſhed; no doubt, but Iſrael of old when they ſhook off the yoke of Egyptian bondage, and were purſued by Pharaoh and his mighty hoſt, thought it was time for God to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for them, before they were ſo hemed in as to ſee no poſſible way of eſcape: But the event proved that God's time was the beſt time, and moſt for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their ſafety.</p>
            <p>THE wicked may be permitted to accompliſh ſome of their evil purpoſes againſt the juſt; but in the end they will be fruſtrated and put to ſhame; thus Saul could never wholly effect his malicious purpoſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt David; tho' he long purſued him and hunted him as a Partridge upon the mountains, he was always diſappointed, confounded and often aſhamed: Many a time Saul thought it almoſt impoſſible for David to avoid his fury, yet always a way was found out for his eſcape; and thus the Lord laughs at the wicked, by ſuffering them to build high, on the foundation which they think is laid deep and ſtrong, and, when their day is come, to diſconcert their plans and fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate all their evil deſigns: And this is what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the expreſſion, the Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth his day is coming; a day, a ſet day there is for them to be caſt down and brought into deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a day for their high looks to be brought low, and for the proud to be abaſed; thus was it with proud Pharaoh, he was lifted up on high, with ſure expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of deſtroying the Iſraelites and dividing the ſpoil, fluſhed with the hopes of certain ſucceſs, he ruſhes forward, till his glory, his pomp and his multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude are altogether buried in the ſea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:014755_0014_0F94DD7E0A9F4CA0"/>SOMETIMES God permits the wicked to go on with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much moleſtation or hinderance, to fill up their meaſure of wrath; and the time he hath ſet to laugh at them is in the other world, when they will be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down under an everlaſting weight of infamy, ſhame and diſgrace, "for the wicked ſhall not go <hi>finally</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed; the Lord ſhall laugh at him, for he ſeeth his day is coming."</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>And, firſt, WHAT hath been ſaid ſhould ſerve to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the people of God, from complaining of, fretting againſt or finding fault with Him or his providence, for ſuffering the wicked to become great, to plot againſt the juſt and to be in ſome meaſure ſucceſsful in their evil deſigns; but, on the contrary, the more ſpiteful and malicious they are, the greater they be and the more they ſucceed in their wicked purpoſes, ſo much the more ſhould God's people, with humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance look up to and wait upon him, who is higher than the higheſt, greater than the greateſt, and wiſer than the wiſeſt of them: Nothing doubting but that he, who knows how to reſerve the prince of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and all his legions, under chains of darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day; knows how far to ſuffer thoſe, who belong to his family to proceed, and no further can they go: Let us then, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to have the <hi>Lord</hi> for our God, believe and reſt ſatisfied in this, that the Lord ſeeth his day is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let us confide in him, who knoweth both how, and when is the beſt time to reſtrain and diſappoint them. And this is the beſt policy, that the children of God can make uſe of, even, to leave all with God, in confident hope and firm truſt, that he will find means to extricate his faithful people out of all their difficulties; that he will take care of them, prevent what they fear, and bring about all events in the iſſue to their full ſatisfaction: Their enemies in due time ſhall be impotent, aſhamed or deſtroyed; and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014755_0015_0F94DD7ECAFDACC8"/>
righteous at laſt be made to triumph over them all. Only truſt in the Lord and do good, and uſe the means, that are put into our hands, and then we need not fear what man can do unto us: If we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mind our duty, fear God and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and are truly conformed to the character of the righteous, we may then be certain, that the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing of the wicked will be ſhort, that the Lord will laugh at them, bring deriſion and contempt upon them, and never ſuffer them to deviſe evil devices or plot miſchief and execute it any further than He in his infinite wiſdom ſees fit and beſt, even beſt for us. Ver. 32.3. of the context.</p>
               <p>NOT but that God's people may for a time ſuffer greatly by them: The righteous may be brought low by rebukes of providence for their ſins, as ſome ſin cleaves to the moſt upright among men, and will do ſo, till they put off their robes of mortality: But the chaſtiſements they endure are ſo far from being hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that they are really ſubſervient to their good; they reap profit and benefit from them: The wicked indeed plot their miſchief, their ruin; but God means it for good. This it becomes us ſo firmly to believe, as to refer all to God and leave it with him, by his wiſe and good providence to diſpoſe of all our concerns as he pleaſes: To truſt wholly in him, to bring all to a good iſſue, with full ſatisfaction that all is well, is beſt, that God doth. Our part is to mind and do our duty, and then leave the event with God: Leave it with him to take care of and deal with thoſe, "who are the ſcandals and burthens, the blemiſhes and common nuſances of the earth." We ſhould not therefore fret at God or be any ways uneaſy, as tho' God was unkind to his church and people, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch malicious, ſly, crafty and ſubtil men to live, proſper and prevail as they do; for he never would, if he had not wiſe deſigns to anſwer by them: This we ſhould alſo believe, and therefore not fret our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

with vexation at their ſucceſs, in their evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, at any time.</p>
               <p>LOOK upon wicked Pharaoh; ſee how he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to afflict and diſtreſs the people, whoſe God was the <hi>Lord</hi>; and they then thought, that all theſe things were againſt them; that their God was unkind to them, when in truth it was only to make way for their freedom from bondage and ſlavery, to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free: Which could not be effected ſo eaſily by any other means. Had not their burthens been inſupportable, beyond what they were able to bear; perhaps it might have been impoſſible for Moſes to have perſuaded them to leave the tyrant's ſervice; but their grievous impoſitions, which Pharaoh intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a means to keep them all under his iron yoke, had directly the contrary effect; it united them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made them all with one heart and mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be free. Such inſtances we ſhould now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, to keep us from anxious diſquietude, and to encourage our hope and truſt in that God, who brings good out of evil. Perhaps in this view, we may ſee much of the goodneſs, mercy and loving-kindneſs of our God towards us, and our children, even in thoſe things which in themſelves, and for the preſent, are not joyous, but grievous; and this ſhould alſo ſerve to keep us from fretting or complaining, and make us acquieſce, and with patience wait for the event, till the end be: Only let us be careful to improve preſent troubles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; this we muſt do, in order for a well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hope, that good to us, to our poſterity and land, will come out of all this evil.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS our God, by theſe commotions, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſturbances and overtures, is about to lay a firm foundation for the laſting future peace, tranquility and liberty of theſe <hi>American Colonies</hi> for ages and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations yet to come: Hitherto, every thing bears this favourable aſpect! The means, that our unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014755_0017_0F94DD8040B2B218"/>
enemies have made uſe of, to bring and keep us under their power and controul, are much the ſame which Pharaoh, Egypt's haughty Monarch uſed, and they have as yet had the ſame effect: Their ſchemes to oppreſs, divide, and then ſubjugate theſe Colonies, have ſerved to unite our hearts, as one man, to caſt off the burthens they have been impoſing upon us: And there is no way, which could be thought of, that would ſo ſpeedily and ſo firmly have united us together, as the ways by them taken to divide and oppreſs us. Our God hath ſo ordered and diſpoſed of the means, which they wickedly deviſed and uſed, as to make them have directly the contrary effect to what they intended by them: "This is the Lord's doing and is marvellous in our eyes." Theſe things conſidered ſhould prevent all hard thoughts of our God, who in the midſt of judgment remembers mercy, and gives us ſo much reaſon to think, that he deſigns good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, if we will but cleave faſt unto him. See the ſix firſt verſes of this Pſalm.</p>
               <p>Secondly, WE may learn from what hath been ſaid, how to diſtinguiſh between the plots of the wicked, and the proceedings of the juſt. Wicked men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe evil devices; they <hi>plot,</hi> they work in the dark, ſaying, no eye ſeeth us, they hate the light, leſt their evil deeds ſhould be reproved; but the righteous, who are ever oppoſed to the wicked, are of upright converſation, are open and fair in their proceedings, are deſirous of, and endeavour to ſet things in a true light; their works are not works of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>AND here it may not be amiſs at this time, when we are engaged in ſo great a conteſt and weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as oppoſing by force of arms thoſe whom we once revered, in whoſe welfare and proſperity we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced, and in whoſe glory we gloried, as our own; who have unnaturally become our foes. premeditately riſen up againſt us, plotted and threatened our ruin; to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014755_0018_0F94DD81057C6F28"/>
run ſomething of a parallel between the conduct of the Britiſh nation and that of theſe Colonies, by which we ſhall ſee clearly, who are thoſe wicked, that are now plotting againſt the juſt.</p>
               <p>WE would obſerve then, that it is an infallible mark of the wicked's plotting, when by ſubtilty and craft, or open violence, they endeavour the hurt of thoſe, that have done them no wrong, nor given them any juſt provocation. The firſt wicked plot, that was ever concerted in this our world, was by a moſt wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apoſtate, againſt thoſe that never did him wrong, nor afforded him the leaſt juſt provocation. His envy and malice was enough to urge him on to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of millions; and ever ſince envy and ill will are continually ſtriking at the felicity, tranquillity and growing opulency of the brave and good. How e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently doth this character belong to thoſe that have riſen up againſt us? They then began to plot our ruin, when we were at eaſe and quiet, and had done them no wrong; yea then, when we were doing them all the good in our power; had been aſſiſting them, at the expence of our blood and treaſure to acquire vaſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories to the Britiſh crown; and were carrying into their boſom all our riches; they then framed an act,<note n="*" place="bottom">THE STAMP ACT</note> which, if it had been put into execution, we had now been wearing out our lives in more than Egyptian bondage; and ever ſince, all the craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty they were maſters of hath been employed, to bring us effectually under the yoke of oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>Which leads to another obſervation,</p>
               <p>THAT it is a ſure mark of the wicked's plotting, when they endeavour to hide the truth; and, as much as poſſible, to keep their evil deſigns out of ſight. How exactly hath this been the caſe with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration? They would fain make us believe, that they meant us no harm, that they had no deſign of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014755_0019_0F94DD81C8C78730"/>
depriving us of our rights, liberty or property, even then, when they were endeavouring by deep laid plots to effect it. They worked as it were in the dark, out of ſight; and tried every method, that their cunning and ſubtilty could invent, to make us implicitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they had a right to put their hands into our pockets, and take a little from thence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our conſent, that ſo they might in proceſs of time come at the whole. But, when by all their art and policy they could not bring us to ſubmit to this; when they perceived, that we ſaw thro' their dark deſigns, and would not believe them, though they aſſerted never ſo ſtrongly that they meant us no hurt, while they were endeavouring to rob us of our rights and properties; they then ſhewed themſelves; and plainly declared what they were after, to make us ſervants, tributary to them. And, thinking that they had power ſufficient to do with us as they pleaſed; they then became open and bare-faced in their proceedings; their language then was, own us for your maſters, or receive the point of the bayonet in your breaſts.—And wicked plots and devices require wicked and baſe means to execute and accompliſh them, as one lie requires another to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it. Therefore, we may obſerve further,</p>
               <p>THAT it is an undoubted ſign of the wicked's plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the juſt, when they purſue ſuch meaſures to bring about their malicious deſigns, as are evil in themſelves. For as truth needs no lie to ſupport it; ſo a juſt cauſe doth not require unjuſt meaſures to defend it. But with regard to Britain, may we not ſay, that truth is fallen in the ſtreets, and equity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter? For what means have they not uſed to blind, deceive and hide the truth, and to promote falſhood and lies? They have even courted decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and would never liſten to the true ſtate of facts, tho' ſet before them as clear as the ſun. And thoſe on this ſide the water, who have joined with them,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014755_0020_0F94DD8287A47778"/>
have left no ſtone unturned, in endeavouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both them and us <note n="*" place="bottom">See a full proof of this aſſertion, and much more, in the letters of the late Governor Hutchinſon.</note>. And ſince they have drawn the ſword, what have they left undone, which they thought would have the leaſt tendency to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and deſtroy us? It appears plain, that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon nothing too bad to do unto us; no meaſures, however baſe, vile and inhuman, have been omitted either before or ſince the commencement of hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: What could be more cruel, unmerciful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, than their ſeveral acts againſt us? One was made with a manifeſt deſign to encourage murder, by making proviſion to protect the murderers: Another vacates the Charter of a province (ever loyal to it's King) upon the ground of a falſe report: Another to ſtarve and impoveriſh one of the moſt populous towns on the continent: What could be more cruel, unmerciful and unjuſt? But, this not anſwering their malicious deſigns, they extended their cruelty to the four New-England Colonies, ſtoping the avenues of our riches, by depriving us of the fiſhery, which God and nature had put into our hands; and when this proved ineffectual, behold them enlarging their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful cruelty to every province, that would dare to ſtand up for us: And then, to crown all, drew the ſword and prepared every inſtrument of cruelty and death, to ſend deſolation and deſtruction through our whole land. And what unwearied pains have they taken, and what cruel and barbarous ſchemes and helliſh plots have they laid? Negroes and Indians, Barbarians, Infidels and Papiſts, have all been appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by our malicious foes. Surely had their cauſe been righteous; were they not wickedly plotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the juſt, they would not have wanted ſuch baſe props as theſe to ſupport it; nor accept them if offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Add to all this, their uſing every ſtratagem poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in the moſt ſecret manner, to ſtir up the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in the midſt of us, to cut our throats at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and to ſet the Savages and Roman Catholicks, like blood-hounds on our backs, while they like lions (as they term themſelves) were rouſed, and came to meet us with open mouths, gaping for their prey; moſt furiouſly and maliciouſly gnaſhing upon us with their teeth; filled with rage and indignation, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to eat us up; yea, ſo big as to devour us at a mouthful, and ſpread deſolation far and wide, by fire and ſword. And their burning ſeveral populous towns, over the heads of women and children, whoſe piercing ſhrieks and infantile bitter cries, were heard unrelented by thoſe, who would be thought humane; ſuch acts of cruelty are without a parallel among civilized nations. Not to mention the barbarity exerciſed upon thoſe of our brave countrymen, who have unfortunately fallen a prey into their relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs jaws. Again,</p>
               <p>IT is a ſign of the wicked's plotting againſt the juſt, in their endeavours to annoy and deſtroy them, when they are inſolent, proud and haughty, and open their mouths againſt the heavens, as well as againſt the people of God. Such as theſe are an abomination to the Lord; He hates the proud look, as well as the lying tongue; and "pride goes before deſtruction, and an haughty ſpirit before a fall." And we need not ſay, how Britons have vaunted themſelves, and even defied the Lord of Hoſts, if at the head of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans (if report be true) at leaſt they have derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, for making application to the God of armies, on our days of faſting and prayer for that purpoſe; being ſure that no force of ours could withſtand them, they have derided and looked down upon us, with utmoſt ſcorn and contempt, being fluſhed with hopes of certain and ſpeedy conqueſt: Never was a people
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014755_0022_0F94DD8404FCBFA8"/>
puffed up with a greater conceit of the ſufficiency of their own wiſdom, power and policy to accompliſh all their evil deſigns againſt us. Once more,</p>
               <p>DISAPPOINTMENT attending all their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſhame and confuſion covering their faces is another mark of the wicked's plotting againſt the juſt. The Lord ſhall laugh at him: And never was this more evidently the caſe than it is at preſent with our enemies: Though proud and inſolent, contempt hath been poured upon them; thay have hitherto made themſelves ridiculous: And their attempts have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vain, fruitleſs and ineffectual in a great meaſure: Their rage and malice hath been impotent; the lion rouſed hath been held faſt in a chain, he hath gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his teeth and ſhut his mouth: Their ſtrength hath failed them; their boaſted courage melted away; their hearts failed them for fear; confined as it were in a priſon; their counſels turned into fooliſhneſs; their deep laid plots all brought to light and fruſtrated; Barbarians, Infidels, Negroes, Indians and Papiſts, refuſed (generally) to aſſiſt them in their evil deſigns; and, to crown all, ſhame is come upon them to the uttermoſt; the Lord hath laughed at them, poured contempt upon them, and filled their hearts with fear, dread and terror; that thoſe, who ſtiled themſelves Britain's invincible troops, fled for their lives, from the face of thoſe, whom they deſpiſed in their hearts; no one purſuing them. "This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes." If they had a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time, a little ſtrength, and a little ſucceſs allowed them, it was only to lift them up for the greater fall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus God often abaſes the proud and lays low the haughtineſs of man. Witneſs Egypt's tyrant, and the Aſſyrian's proud blaſphemous Monarch, whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, greatneſs, pomp and multitude periſhed at once. Thus every mark of the wicked's plotting againſt the juſt is to be found on them: And thoſe words of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014755_0023_0F94DD84C66DB0E0"/>
prophet Iſaiah xvii.12. on to the end, ſeem applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Britain's troops at this time—"Wo to the multitude of many people, which make a noiſe like the noiſe of the ſeas: And to the ruſhing of nations, that make a ruſhing like the ruſhing of mighty waters. The nations ſhall ruſh like the ruſhing of many waters: But God ſhall rebuke them, and they ſhall flee far off, and ſhall be chaſed as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind, and behold at evening tide trouble, and before the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is not: This is the portion of them, that ſpoil us, and the lot of them that rob us."</p>
               <p>LET us turn now and look upon the conduct of the United Colonies; and ſee if it is not the conduct of the juſt: However we have been a ſinful back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding people, and provoked the Lord againſt us by our ſins; yet to Great-Britain (conſidered as a people) we have done no wrong: And we may hope and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many of this land are truly juſt and righteous; whoſe frequent, fervent prayers, and ſincere cries to the Lord of Hoſts, under our diſtreſſed and oppreſſed condition, have entered the ears of the Lord of Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth, the God of armies; and, in anſwer to them, he hath appeared for our help againſt the mighty, to the confuſion and ſhame of our enemies, crowning our endeavours with moſt remarkable ſucceſs. Let this not elate us, but make us more deeply humbled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and excite us, with united hearts and voices to cry more earneſtly to, and depend more upon him, "who giveth power to the feeble, and to them that have no might, encreaſeth ſtrength."</p>
               <p>But to return from this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>LET us look and we ſhall ſee, that our conduct hath been directly the reverſe to that of thoſe, with whom we are contending: Ever open and fair have been our proceedings; in all our repreſentations truth hath been the object aimed at; and by plain facts, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by ſound reaſons and demonſtrative argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014755_0024_0F94DD8587DAAA78"/>
we have endeavoured to undeceive thoſe, who were led to believe lies: But they ever ſhut their eyes and ears againſt them, and would not perceive nor underſtand.</p>
               <p>PARTICULAR provinces firſt remonſtrated againſt their evil proceedings; ſhewed the iniquity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of them, which were followed by many hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petitions to no effect, being rejected again and again without a hearing.</p>
               <p>THEN the whole United Provinces by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, ſtated matters moſt fairly; held up truth to light, and humbly petitioned for redreſs of grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they aſked for no more; but were anſwered with the bayonet pointed at our breaſts.</p>
               <p>OUR Congreſs, choſen for the purpoſe of effecting a happy reconciliation between Great-Britain and theſe Colonies, were inſulted, treated with the utmoſt ſcorn and contempt, and looked upon as nothing, and leſs than nothing.</p>
               <p>AND the meaſures we have taken to ſave our land from the threatened ruin, have ever been juſt, honeſt and upright; whatever hath been done, that may be fairly attributed to the people of theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, in their conduct towards England's King and his miniſtry, well deſerves the above epithets The doings of particular perſons, ſmall communities, or a number riſing and doing unjuſtly, is not to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to whole towns, much leſs to whole provinces.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus we are free from being chargeable with the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the India TEA, ſent hither by Act of Parliament. It was not the act of a colony or even of a town, but only of a ſmall number of perſons in diſguiſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>ALL that we have done (as a people) beſides pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to deſiſt from their evil deſigns and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, hath been only to defend ourſelves from their unjuſt encroachments. And they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled us to arms, by firſt unſheathing the ſword and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014755_0025_0F94DD8648DB2A88"/>
laying a number of our fellow countrymen dead on the ground:<note n="†" place="bottom">At Lexington a company of Militia were fired upon in cool blood, by troops of George the 3d. only for appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms in their training field; ſix were killed on the ſpot. This commenced the war between Great-Britain and America; which was on the 19th of April, 1775.</note> Whoſe innocent blood would have cried to God againſt us, had we not purſued the murderers and endeavoured to bring them to juſtice.</p>
               <p>WE may now aſk what evil have we done to Great-Britain? Was it an evil for us to endeavour to open their blind eyes? Was it an evil for us to try, by humble prayers, to ſoften their hard hearts? Was it an evil for us to remonſtrate againſt moſt iniquitous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings? Or was it an evil for us to defend our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, our wives and our little ones from the jaws of that <hi>roaring Lion</hi> who had rouſed himſelf, and with open mouth ruſhed to ſeize his prey gnaſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with his teeth; yea, whoſe cruel jaws were reaking in the gore of human fleſh? We may not forget to obſerve another part of our conduct, which hath been derided by them. As a people we have once and again been called upon, by thoſe whom we have ſet to rule over us, to humble ourſelves in the ſight of God, and to implore his aſſiſtance and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all our concerns; and tho' many there be, that are forſaking the Lord, and ſtill live in ſin, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his judgments upon us, yet it is to be hoped, that many of God's people among us, have learnt righteouſneſs by the judgments that have been abroad in our land; which have cauſed them to live nearer to him, and to walk more humbly and prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully before him.</p>
               <p>FURTHERMORE, If a bleſſing attending the means, and ſucceſs the endeavours of a people, be any mark of the righteouſneſs of the cauſe; never was it more
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014755_0026_0F94DD8702FA15C0"/>
conſpicuouſs than at this day; never had a people more reaſon to take notice of the interpoſition of heaven in their favour than we; who by the help of the Lord have been enabled to riſe as it were from nothing, to a force ſufficient to withſtand our enemies, and get the better of them every way: From <hi>North</hi> to <hi>South</hi> ſucceſs hath in a moſt remarkable manner crowned our endeavours. <note n="*" place="bottom">The ſpeed, with which the reduction of ST. JOHN's and MONTREAL was accompliſhed, and the few lives that were loſt, were very remarkable: And to the Southward, diſcovering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerting an horrid plan to raiſe an army of Tories and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, routing and driving Lord Dunmore and his forces from the land: And now the ſtrong hold of BOSTON is given up into our hands, &amp;c. &amp;c. and but four or five lives loſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>AND it is not to us that the ſucceſs is to be attributed; for the ſtars in their courſes have fought for us, the winds and the waves have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thouſands:<note n="†" place="bottom">This refers to the deſtruction brought upon them by the immediate hand of God, and it may be proper to mention ſome few inſtances of this kind of the many which might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the deſtruction of their fiſhing fleet by a violent ſtorm, in October laſt. whereby moſt of their veſſels were loſt, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a thouſand ſouls periſhed. What renders this the more remarkable is, that theſe men were to join the army under General Howe at Boſton, and the arms that were ſent over for them, fell into our hands. Alſo the ſhipwreck, which the fleet met with laſt fall, that was deſigned for a reinforcement to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe. by which ſome of them were loſt, and the moſt of them rendered unable to proceed on their voyage. The Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verians likewiſe, in their voyage to England, were ſhipwrecked and greatly damaged: And alſo, late in the fall, one of their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> was ſtruck by lightening and entirely conſumed, &amp;c.</note> And God Almighty hath wonderfully preſerved our lives and given us courage, to which muſt be attributed that ſucceſs which hath attended our enterprizes, and brought confuſion on our foes: that thoſe who, but a few months ago, vaunted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt us, being ſure of overcoming us, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014755_0027_0F94DD87C7514E68"/>
us to ſcorn, and gnaſhed their teeth in rage againſt us; the Lord having laughed at them and brought forward the day of their confuſion, now gnaw their tongues for diſappointment. It is not for what we have done, but for his great name's ſake, that he hath dealt thus favourably with us. From all theſe things it appears, that the character of the juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous belongs to us, as that of the wicked to them: For the wicked fear where no fear is, and flee when none purſueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion. Thoſe, who called themſelves brave and invincible; and us cowardly daſtards, have been ſeized with ſuch a panic, as none but He, who hath all hearts in his hands, could ſtrike into them: And the reſolution and courage, which hath been given to our ſoldiers, hath been as remarkable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, WE ſhould now be led to pay our grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments to that God. who rules on high and below; who hath taken ſuch wonderful care of us, ſaved us from that ruin and deſtruction, with which we have been threatened, we have lately ſeen the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Lord; and to be thankful for what our God hath done for us, and improve paſt favours to his glory, is the way to engage his kindneſs, and to be favoured with the continuation of his ſmiles.</p>
               <p>AND what reaſon have we to be thankful to that God, who hath hitherto reſtrained the rage, tied the hands, and put fear into the hearts of our enemies, and cauſed them to flee before us. For had they been ſuffered to ſucceed in their malicious deſigns: who can conceive of the dreadful havock and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that would have been made? Our land filled with the blood of the ſlain; we driven from our dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; our houſes pillaged and burnt; our towns laid in aſhes; our fields and vineyards laid waſte; our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſpoiled, and we either fallen by the ſword, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tributary ſervants to thoſe, whoſe tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014755_0028_0F94DD88864A1798"/>
are cruel.—Let us never forget the goodneſs of our God and his kindneſs to us: Let it lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and new obedience, and engage us to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in his ſervice. The acquiſition lately made affords abundant matter for thankſgiving and rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not only to thoſe who have long been driven from their beautiful ſeats and commodious habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and may now return to them in ſafety; but to us all, having obtained (at a very little expence of blood) one of the ſtrongeſt holds, the beſt fortified towns, and moſt commodious harbour, that our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, WE will now conclude with a few words of direction and encouragement to God's people. As we know where our great ſtrength lieth, even in God; let us then truſt all in his hands; let us wait upon him; let us ſeek to him in every time of need, and, having referred all our important concerns to him, let us not deſpair, or be diſcouraged, though our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are many, potent, ſubtil, crafty and malicious; let both the favours and frowns of God upon us ſerve to make us fly to him, and to be more earneſt with him to interpoſe by his grace and providence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us from our wickedneſs; to extricate us out of our difficulties; diſperſe the dark clouds, which hang over our heads; return and viſit us with his loving-kindneſs and tender mercies; and make us yet a people beloved of the Lord and favoured by our God: thus let us apply always to him, who can bring to light the darkeſt, deepeſt plots; who can fruſtrate the beſt and wiſeſt concerted plan of human politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians; who can ſtop the mouths of lions, deliver out of the paw of the bear, chain the tyger and reſtrain the wrath of man: Let us truſt in the Lord, wait al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on him, and he will bring it to paſs: For he that is higher than the higheſt regardeth it: And the Lord ſhall laugh at them, and bring them into deriſion and contempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:014755_0029_0F94DD894472DAE0"/>TO leave all with God, in the uſe of the means af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us, is our wiſdom, our ſtrength, our ſafety and our deliverance; for through God we ſhall do vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, for he it is, that ſhall tread down our enemies; and the Lord on high is mightier than the noiſe of many waters; yea than the many waves of the ſea. What then, though the waters roar and be troubled; though the mountains ſhake and tremble; and the earth be removed; the Lord of Hoſts being with us; the God of Jacob being our refuge; we may even then triumph and rejoice in him; ſaying, God is in the midſt of us; we ſhall not be moved; our God ſhall help us and that right early.</p>
