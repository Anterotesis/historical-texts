            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THERE was certainly a critical time, when the world was entirely happy, and bleſſed with content; when there was no cheating, ſlandering, envying, nor robbing and plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, and conſequently no gibbets, pillories, whipping poſts, &amp;c. Covetouſneſs was not known in thoſe days, but nature was liberal to all her ſons, and gave a plentiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to every diligent hand: Men cropped the ſweets of the earth, and had it for their pains; no Landlords then oppreſ'd their Tenants to fill their bags with wicked GOLD. Prieſts did not ſell their Faith for Lucre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor Maids their virginity for pride. No Son cut his Father's Throat to come at his bags; nor Mother bawd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her Daughter, to ſhare the reward. Such a time there was, but Hiſtorians have been ſo negligent as not to tranſmit it to theſe ſinful Times: However, ſince we have the Liberty to gueſs, I ſhall build upon a very ſtrong Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was before the invention of MON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EY; and it has puzzled ſome great Philoſophers to find out, whether it has not deſtroyed more People in the other World, than Gunpowder has done in this. As ſoon as this wicked Mammon ſprung up among Men they left their Maker's Image to worſhip Ceſar's; then ſprung up Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in the world, and the dark Seeds of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, Uſury, Extortion, Cheating and Knavery began to grow apace. Here was one cutting his neighbour's Throat for being richer than himſelf; and another ſelling his ſoul that he
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026511_0003_0FD083994B36E538"/>
may be richer than his Neighbour. Juſtice was bought and ſold like a pig in a market, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bidder went away with it. Money made a man righteous, and poverty made him a rogue: the ſin-offering of the poor was deſpiſed, but the fat ſacrifice of the rich perfumed it with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of the altar. The temple became the prieſt's ſhop, where religion was ſold by retail; according to the laudable expreſſion of a famous author:
<q>
                  <l>Natural religion eaſy was and plain,</l>
                  <l>
                     <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> made it fabulous, Prieſts made it gain;</l>
                  <l>And next the ſacrifices were prepar'd,</l>
                  <l>The prieſts eat roaſt meat, and the people ſtarv'd.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Money was both religion and laws, no penny, no pater-noſter; no money, no juſtice; a bad cauſe with a big purſe, was ſure to carry it from a good cauſe and a light one; and to this day, if you have retained a council, 'tis a thouſand to one but he forgets your face, if you dont give him a ſecond token to remember you by. If covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be the root of all evil, 'tis money is the root of all covetouſneſs. No ſooner was Dei Gratia ſtampt upon theſe enticing metals, but people forgot it in their prayers, and paid all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to mammon, wicked mammon. Selling and buying became ſo vehement among men, that for intereſt they ſold one another; example, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph was ſold by his brethren; Judas ſold his maſter; the S—h ſold their King; and how many Judas's of our age, have ſold their contry!
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026511_0004_0FD083AD13993258"/>
would you corrupt a man's honeſty, or a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's virtue, tempt them with money; 'tis a charm ſo ſtrong, there is no withſtanding it.—Would you have your neighbour's throat cut, money will do it. Would you lay with your neighbour's wife, money will introduce you.—'Tis the key to a ſtateſman's breaſt, and lets out all its ſecrets; it will bring you to my lady's bed, and will keep my lord's mouth ſhut. 'Twill make the crooked ſtrait, and the ſtrait crooked. Let a woman have a good portion, and though ſhe is as deformed as a crooked billet, ſhe will go off, though others both beautiful and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for want of it, ſtick a hand.</p>
            <p>Let a powdered coxcombly beau, with round ſhoulders, and a hatchet face, have a gilt chariot, and a fine equipage, the people ſhall preſently ſpend their judgment, there goes a pretty Gentleman, though he is extremly like a dog in a doublet, or a hog in armour.—A man that has money, is qualified for any poſt, while his wiſer and honeſter neighbours are neglected and deſpiſed for the want of it. In ſhort, money is a bewitching thing, and they are mad that ſet there hearts upon it. Riches are a perplexed ſtate; and a little with contentment, is better than all the wealth in the world. In my opinion, he was a happier man that ſold his fleſh to a jew, than the extorting infidel that bought it. Murder, whoredom, treaſon, felony, &amp;c. are the offspring of ſatan; and money is the grand parent of them all. The uſurer gets over his bags, and prays to this effect.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>In the mean time his ſervants pray as heartily for food, and with his neck as long as his bags, for not keeping a better houſe; but 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he neglects their bodies, when the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes him forget his own ſoul.</p>
            <p>A rich man is a mere ſhip in the tempeſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways toſſing and tumbling in the perplexity of his affairs, and if he chance to meet with ſome dire unexpected ill fortune, he ſinks downright, and becomes miſerable; he is always accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fear and concern, and even in the calmeſt of his buſineſs is never truly contented; while a man in a moderate condition, that carries moſt of his wealth about him, enjoys himſelf with a thouſand times the ſatisfaction. The careful father, like a true wiſe man, breaks his reſt, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſes his mind, and makes his whole life uneaſy; to get an eſtate for his ſon, who ſpends it like a fool as ſoon as he is dead.</p>
            <p>Were money a bleſſing, the Jews would nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be ſo univerſally rich; and he that ſits with a piece of bread and cheeſe, and content, under a hedge, may be a happier man, than he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
