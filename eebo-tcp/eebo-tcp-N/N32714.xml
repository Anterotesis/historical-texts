            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PLAIN TRUTH; CONTAINING, REMARKS ON A LATE PAMPHLET ENTITLED COMMON SENSE.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE now before me the Pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE; on which I ſhall remark with freedom and candour. It may not be improper to remind my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the inveſtigation of my ſubject, demands the utmoſt freedom of enquiry, I therefore entreat his indulgence; and that he will carefully remember, that intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate zeal, is as injurious to liberty, as a manly diſcuſſion of facts is friendly to it. "Liberty, ſays the great MONTESQUIEU, is a right of doing whatever the laws permit; and if a citizen could do what they forbid, he would no longer be poſſeſſed of liberty, becauſe all his fellow citizens would have the ſame power." In the beginning of his pamphlet, the Author aſſerts, that ſociety in every ſtate is a bleſſing. This in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of my heart I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny; for it is ſupreme miſery to be aſſociated with thoſe, who to promote their ambitious purpoſes, flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043001_0006_101CC204F3F47DC8"/>
pervert the ends of political ſociety. I do not ſay that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Author is indebted to BURGH'S POLITICAL DISQUISITIONS, or to ROUSSEAU'S Social Compact for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Government, and his large Tree; although I wiſh he had favoured his reader with the following extract from that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime reaſoner. "To inveſtigate thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of ſociety which may beſt anſwer the purpoſe of nations, would require the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of ſome ſuperior intelligence, who ſhould be witneſs to all the paſſions of men, but be ſubject itſelf to none, who ſhould have no connections with human nature, but ſhould have a perfect knowledge of it: A Being, in ſhort, whoſe happineſs ſhould be independent of us, and who would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs employ itſelf about us. It is the province of Gods to make laws for Men." With the utmoſt deference to the celebrated ROUSSEAU, I cannot indeed imagine, that laws even ſo conſtructed, would materially benefit our imperfect race; unleſs omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience deigned previouſly to exalt our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The judicious reader will therefore perceive, that malevolence only, is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to declaim againſt, and arraign the moſt perfect Governments. Our <hi>Political Quack</hi> avails himſelf of this trite expedient, to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole the people into the moſt abject ſlavery,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043001_0007_101CC207F2945D40"/>
under the deluſive name of independence. His firſt indecent attack is againſt the Engliſh conſtitution; which with all its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is, and ever will be the pride and envy of mankind. To this panegyric involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily our author ſubſcribes, by granting indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals to be ſafer in England, than in any other part of Europe. He indeed inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attributes this pre-eminent excellency, to the conſtitution of the people, rather than to our excellent conſtitution. To ſuch contemptible ſubterfuge is our Author reduced. I would aſk him, why did not the conſtitution of the people afford them ſuperior ſafety, in the reign of Richard the Third, Henry the Eighth, and other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannic princes? Many pages might indeed be filled with encomiums beſtowed on our excellent conſtitution, by illuſtrious authors of different nations.</p>
                  <p>This beautiful ſyſtem (according to MONTESQUIEU) our conſtitution is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy. But it is often ſaid, that the Sovereign, by honours and appointments, influences the Commons. The profound and elegant HUME agitating this queſtion, thinks, to this circumſtance, we are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Conſtitution would immediately degenerate into Democracy; a Government, which in the ſequel, I hope to prove ineligible. Were I aſked marks of the beſt government, and the purpoſe of political ſociety, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, the encreaſe, preſervation, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of its members, in no quarter of the Globe, are thoſe marks ſo certainly to be found, as in Great Britain, and her depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. After our Author has employed ſeveral pages, to break the mounds of ſociety by debaſing Monarchs: He ſays, "The plain truth is, that the antiquity of Engliſh Monarchy will not bear looking into."</p>
                  <p>HUME treating of the original contract, has the following melancholy, but ſenſible obſervation, "Yet reaſon tells us, that there is no property in durable objects, ſuch as lands, and houſes, when carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, in paſſing from hand to hand, but muſt in ſome period, have been f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

"Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is a ſpiritual religion, relative only to celeſtial objects. The Chriſtian's inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is not of this world. He performs his duty it is true, but this he does with a profound indifference for the good or ill ſucceſs of his endeavours: Provided he hath nothing to reproach himſelf, it is of little conſequence to him whether m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

If the ſtate be in a flouriſhing condition, he can hardly venture to rejoice in the public felicity, leaſt he ſhould be puffed up, with the inordinate pride of his country's glory. If the ſtate decline, he bleſſes the hand of GOD, that humbles his people to the duſt."</p>
                  <p>Having deſined the beſt government, I will humbly attempt to deſcribe good Kings by the following unerring rule. The beſt Princes are conſtantly calumniated by the envenomed tongues and pens of the moſt worthleſs of their ſubjects. For this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy truth, do I appeal to the teſtimony of impartial hiſtorians, and long experience. The noble impartial hiſtorian Sully, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the almoſt divine Henry the Fourth of France ſays, "Thus was this god-like prince repreſented (by the diſcontented of

theſe days) almoſt throughout his whole kingdom, as a furious, and implacable tyrant: They were never without one ſet of arguments to engage his catholic nobility in a rebellion againſt him, and another to ſow ſedition among his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

HUME ſays, that the cruel unrelenting tyrant, Philip the Second of Spain, with his infernal Inquiſition, was not more deteſted by the people of the Netherlands, than was the humane Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, with his inoffenſive Liturgy, by his mutinous ſubjects. The many unmerited inſults offered to our gracious Sovereign; by the unprincipled Wilkes, and others down to this late Author; will forever diſgrace humanity. For he ſays, "that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy was the moſt proſperous invention the Devil ever ſet on foot for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of idolatry. It is the pride of Kings which throws mankind into confuſion: In ſhort, continues this Author, monarchy and ſucceſſion, have laid not this or that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only, but the world in blood and aſhes." How deplorably wretched the condition of mankind, could they believe ſuch execrable flagitious jargon. Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily indeed, mankind in every age are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of deluſion; but ſurely our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's poiſon carries its antidote with it.

Attentive to the ſpirit of his publication, we fancy ourſelves in the barbarous fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century; in which period our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have figured with his "Common Senſe—and blood will attend it."</p>
                  <p>After his terrible anathema againſt our venerable conſtitution, and monarchy; let us briefly examine a democratical ſtate; and ſee whether or not it is a government leſs ſanguinary. This government is extremely plauſible, and indeed flattering to the pride of mankind. The demagogues therefore, to ſeduce the people into their criminal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ever hold up democracy to them; although conſcious it never did, nor ever will anſwer in practice. If we believe a great Author, "There never exiſted, nor ever will exiſt a real democracy in the World." If we examine the republics of Greece and Rome, we ever find them in a ſtate of war domeſtic or foreign. Our Author therefore makes no mention of theſe ancient States. "When Alexander ordered all the exiles, to be reſtored throughout all the cities, it was found that the whole amounted to twenty thouſand, the remains probably of ſtill greater ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and maſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Apian's hiſtory of the civil wars of Rome, contains the moſt fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful picture of maſſacres, proſcriptions, and forfeitures that ever were preſented to the world.</p>
                  <p>The excellent Monteſquieu declares, "that a democracy ſuppoſes the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a number of circumſtances rarely united. In the firſt place, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It corrupts at once, both rich and poor: The one, by the poſſeſſion, and the other, by the want of it."

                  <p>Our Author aſſerts, that Holland and Swiſſerland are without wars domeſtic or foreign. About a century ago, Holland was in a few weeks over-run by the arms of France, and almoſt miraculouſly ſaved by the gallantry of her Prince of Orange, ſo celebrated afterwards by the name of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Third. Almoſt from that period, until the treaty of Utrecht, Holland was a principal in wars, the moſt expenſive and bloody, ever waged by human kind. The wounds ſhe then received were unhealed in 1744, when reluctantly rouſed from her pacific lethargy, ſhe was dragged into war; and loſing her impregnable Bergenopzoom, and Mae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>richt; was again on the brink of becoming a province to France, when happily liberated by the Britiſh Nation.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043001_0015_101CC21DCDFEDED8"/>
In the war of 1756. Holland continually inſulted in the capture of her ſhips, by our cruiſers; preſerved a humiliating neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If victory indeed had not crowned the Britiſh banners; the Dutch indubitably would have aſſiſted their natural Allies, in whatever quarter of the globe attacked: For it is inconteſtibly true; that the exiſtence of Holland, as a State, depends, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably will depend, on the proſperity of Great Britain. Since the murder of Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt, and the immortal de Wits, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded furious people, Holland hath too often been convulſed by anarchy, and torn by party. Unfortunately alas! for the cauſe of humanity; the rugged and incult deſarts of Swiſſerland, preclude not ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſedition, and anarchy. Her bleak and barren mountains do not ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſecure precarious liberty, as daily vend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſons to the adjoining nations, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to France; by whom the thirteen Cantons, could be ſubjected in as many days, did that court meditate ſo ſenſeleſs and deluſive an object. Nugatory indeed, if we conſider, that France derives more ſubſtantial advantage from the preſent ſtate of Swiſſerland, than if ſhe exhauſted herſelf, to maintain numerous Battalions, to bridle the Cantons. A moment, let us
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:043001_0016_101CC21F6F22AA68"/>
ſuppoſe, that our author's aſſeverations of Holland and Swiſſerland, are as real as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive: His inferences do not flow from his premiſes; for their ſuperior advantages, do not ariſe from their popular government, but from circumſtances of peculiar local felicity, obliging the princes of Europe, to defend them from the omnipotent land force, if I may ſo ſpeak of France. After impotently attacking our Sovereign; and the conſtitution: He contradicts the voice of all mankind, by declaring, that America "would have flouriſhed as much, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably much more, had no European power taken any notice of her."</p>
                  <p>If he means, that had this Continent been unexplored, the original inhabitants would have been happier: For once, I agree with him. Previous to the ſettlement of theſe Provinces by our Anceſtors, the kingdom of France was convulſed by religious phrenzy. This, and Sebaſtian Cabot's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> diſcovery, perhaps, happily afforded the people of England, an opportunity of locating theſe Provinces. At length, peace being reſtored to France, by her Hero, Henry the Fourth: His nation in turn, were ſeized with the rage of colonizing. Finding the Engliſh claimed the Provinces on the Atlantic; they appropriated the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:043001_0017_101CC22433D59F70"/>
ſnow banks of Canada, which we dare not ſuppoſe, they would have preferred to theſe fertile provinces, had not the prior occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pancy, and power of England interfered. I hope it will not be denied, that the notice taken of us, at this time by an European Power, was rather favourable for us.—Certain it is, had not England then taken notice of us, theſe delectable Provinces would now appertain to France; and the people of New England, horrid to think, would now be counting their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ads. Some years after the AEra in queſtion, the civil wars intervening in England, afforded to the Swedes and Dutch, a footing on this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. Charles the Second being reſtored; England reviving her claim, rendered abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the Swediſh pretenſions; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and granting Surinam to the Dutch, procured the ceſſion of their uſurpation, now New York. I do indeed confeſs, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity to diſcern the injury ſuſtained by this ſecond "notice taken of us, by an European Power;" in default of which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention, the Swedes, to this hour, would have retained their ſettlement, now the famed Pennſylvania; and the Dutch, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, had retained theirs. Some time after this period, the people of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were employed, in framing and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutting
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:043001_0018_101CC226D3324A98"/>
laws, ſo intolerant and ſanguinary, that to us, they ſeem adapted for devils, not men.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it is worthy of note, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jamaica, Barbadoes, and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, at that very time, enacted laws, breathing the ſpirit of humanity, and ſuch as men could bear. Soon after the period in queſtion, arrived the great and good WILLIAM PENN, with his philoſophic people called Quakers; together with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, induſtry, and permanent credit. The people of England, encouraged by the extenſion of their laws and commerce to thoſe colonies, powerfully aſſiſted our merchants and planters, inſomuch, that our ſettlements encreaſed rapidly, and throve apace. It may be affirmed, that from this period, until the preſent unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hour; no part of human kind, ever experienced more perfect felicity. Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire indeed ſays, that if ever the Golden Age exiſted, it was in Pennſylvania. France diſguſted with the unhappy ſituation of her American Colonies, had long me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated the conqueſt of one of our middle provinces. To accompliſh this purpoſe, ſhe extended a line of forts on our fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and actually fortified the place now called P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:043001_0019_101CC22895FE89F8"/>

After ſpilling torrents of blood, after expending one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety millions of their dollars, and four or five millions of ours; they gloriouſly reduced the French ſettlements. Surely it will not be ſaid, that this laſt NOTICE taken of us by the people of England, was injurious to us. Our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies indeed alledge, that this laſt interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by bloating us with pride, will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ruin us, and render the people of Britain objects of deriſion, for laviſhing their blood and treaſure, in defence of provinces; "a match not only for Europe, (according to our author,) but for the world."—Our author next remarks, "that the commerce by which ſhe hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched herſelf, are the neceſſaries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cuſtom of Europe."</p>
                  <p>I reply, that our exporting grain, is as it were of yeſterday, that the recent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was principally occaſioned by the diſtractions in Poland, and other parts of Europe, and probably will totally or partly
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:043001_0020_101CC22B41840BD8"/>
fail, ſoon as the fertile country of Poland, and more fertile Ukraine ſhall again become cultivated. I believe the Europeans did eat before our merchants exported our grain, and perhaps will eat, when they ceaſe to export it. I deny, that this momentary commerce hath enriched us; and I could adduce numberleſs melancholy proofs of the contrary. I ſhall only remark, that in the moſt fertile and delectable wheat coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in America, bounded by Cheſopeak-bay, and almoſt adjoining that of Delaware; a tract of the beſt wheat land ten years ago, would hardly have exceeded a guinea and a half per acre, indeed, in 1773, ſuch land covered with wood, would ſcarcely have ſold for four guineas an acre, an undoubted proof of want of PEOPLE, induſtry, and wealth; particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, if we conſider that one crop of corn and wheat on ſuch land judiciouſly cultivated, would actually repay the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed price. Our author aſſerts, "that our preſent numbers are ſufficient to repel the force of all the world. That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent hath at this time the largeſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined army of ANY POWER UNDER HEAVEN. That the Engliſh navy is only worth three millions and a half ſterling," which in effect, would reduce it to thirty-five
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:043001_0021_101CC22ED3A7D858"/>
ſhips of the line, twenty ſhips of forty guns, twenty of thirty-ſix, and eight of twenty guns. "That if America had only a twentieth part of this force, ſhe would be by far an over-match for Britain, that Independence is neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe France and Spain cannot aſſiſt us, until ſuch an event;" he alſo affirms "that Great Britain cannot govern us, and that no good can ariſe from a reconciliation with her."</p>
                  <p>I ſhall humbly endeavour to ſhew, that our author ſhamefully miſrepreſents ſacts, is ignorant of the true ſtate of Great Britain and her Colonies, utterly unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the arduous taſk, he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly aſſumed; and ardently intent on ſeducing us to that precipice on which himſelf ſtands trembling. To elucidate my ſtrictures, I muſt with fidelity expoſe the circumſtances of Great Britain and her colonies. If therefore, in the energy of deſcription, I unfold certain bold and honeſt truths with ſimplicity, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reader will remember, that true knowledge of our ſituation, is as eſſential to our ſafety, as ignorance thereof may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger it. In the Engliſh provinces, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of negroe and other ſlaves, we have one hundred and ſixty thouſand; or one hundred and ſeventy thouſand men capable
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:043001_0022_101CC2305F5679E8"/>
of bearing arms. If we deduct the people called Quakers, Anabaptiſts, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioniſts averſe to arms; a conſiderable part of the emigrants, and thoſe having a grateful predilection for the ancient conſtitution and parent ſtate, we ſhall certainly reduce the firſt number to ſixty or ſeventy thouſand men. Now admitting thoſe equal to the Roman legions, can we ſuppoſe them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defending againſt the power of Britain, a country nearly twelve hundred miles extending on the ocean. Suppoſe our troops aſſembled in New England, if the Britons ſee not fit to aſſail them, they haſte to and deſolate our other provinces, which eventually would reduce New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

of the years 1759-60, and 61, was more aſtoniſhing to Europe, than the victories of her fleets and armies. The annual rents of the kingdom of England only, many years ago, amounted to thirty three millions ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Thirty five millions buſhels of wheat are annually produced in that kingdom; and perhaps as many buſhels of other grain: Twelve millions of fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, the Kingdom is a perfect Bee-hive, in numbers and induſtry; and is ſaid to contain more induſtry, conſequently more wealth, than all the reſt of Europe. The famed HUME ſays, "I ſhould as ſoon dread, that all our rivers and ſprings, ſhould be exhauſted, as that money ſhould abandon a kingdom; where there are people and induſtry." The Britiſh navy, at the cloſe of laſt war, conſiſted of nearly two hundred ſhips of the line, one hundred large frigates, and about one hundred ſmaller frigates, or other armed veſſels. Since the peace, I believe, the navy has been moſt vigilantly preſerved by Lord Sandwich, (ſaid to be as equal to that arduous department, as any man in Europe.) Since the war, ſeveral capital ſhips have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually been built; and it is moſt certain, that on ſix months notice, Great Britain could equip fleets, ſufficiently formidable, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with all the naval force, that could,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:043001_0029_101CC24370337658"/>
or would act againſt her. The immenſe quantity of naval and other ſtores, in the different arſenals, with the royal navy<note n="*" place="bottom">Seventeen capital ſhips were built from 1763 until 1771.</note> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at this time be worth leſs than twenty millions ſterling. The iſland of Great Britain, between ſix and ſeven hundred miles in length, and upwards of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles circumference; and being every where indented with harbours, forms (with other cauſes) ſuch nurſeries of ſeamen, as the world cannot produce.</p>
                  <p>Let us now examine our author's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the navy of Great-Britain. "It is ſays he, worth no more than three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and an half ſterling." This in effect will reduce it to ten ſecond rate ſhips of war, ten third rate, fifteen fourth rate, ten ſhips of forty guns, ten of thirty ſix, and eight of twenty. "If America ſays he, had only a twentieth part of the naval force of Britain, ſhe would be by far an over-match for her, becauſe as we neither have, nor claim any foreign dominion, our whole force would be employed on our own coaſt; where we ſhould in the long run have two to one the advantage of thoſe who had three or four thouſand miles to ſail over,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:043001_0030_101CC246161142F0"/>
before they could attack us; and the ſame diſtance to return, in order to refit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit. And although Britain by her fleet, hath a check over our trade to Europe, we have as large a one over her trade to the Weſt Indies, which, by laying in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Continent, lies entirely at its mercy."</p>
                  <p>Were it lawful to joke on ſo ſerious an occaſion, I would remind the reader of our Author's modeſty, in ſaying, "that we claim no foreign dominion:" Since we have the moſt numerous, and beſt diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed army under Heaven; and a navy ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſtrong to combat that of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For our preſent naval armament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a fleet more than equal to a twentieth part of the Britiſh navy, (according to our author's eſtimation.) Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our author's delicacy, relying on the well known utility of melaſſes, to the New England governments: I hope they will order Admiral Manly to ſeiſe Jamaica, and the other Weſt India Iſlands. The Admiral cannot be at a loſs for men; ſince, according to our author, "a few ſocial ſailors, will ſoon inſtruct a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of active landmen, in the common work of a ſhip. I do indeed confeſs, that the Britiſh ſhips of war, are conſtantly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:043001_0031_101CC247A38DCA98"/>
equipt altogether with very ſocial ſailors; and as conſtantly drub the French ſhips, double mann'd, with active landmen, tho' ſufficiently inſtructed by a few ſocial ſailors. The reader will perceive, that our author, has humbled the naval power of Britain, with more facility than France and Spain could have done: And, has alſo expelled her from our ports with happier ſucceſs, than did Spain; who was compelled to yield her Gibraltar and Portmahon, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of her fleets and commerce.</p>
                  <p>We muſt indeed allow, that Spain, tho' poſſeſſed of Mexico and Peru, cannot maintain the moſt numerous and beſt diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined army under Heaven, nor equip a navy fit to contend with the fleets of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that he makes Great Britain, very favourably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of her humbled navy, by employing nineteen parts of it in the Mediterranean, Aſia, Africa, and I know not where: When he knows we have ſo great a check on her Weſt India trade, a commerce, of the laſt importance to her.</p>
                  <p>I would bluſh for poor human nature, did I imagine that any man, other than a bigot could believe theſe ridiculous ſtories, theſe arrant gaſconades, reſpecting our numerous and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:043001_0032_101CC24B76DAE860"/>
about our navy, and a few ſocial ſailors, and that France and Spain will not aſſiſt us, (who by-the-bye, according to our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, are able to conquer them,) until playing upon words, we declare ourſelves INDEPENDENT. Can a reaſonable being for a moment believe that Great Britain, whoſe political exiſtence depends on our conſtitutional obedience, who but yeſterday made ſuch prodigious efforts to ſave us from France, will not exert herſelf as powerfully to preſerve us from our frantic ſchemes of independency. Can we a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doubt, that the Sovereign of Great Britain and his miniſters, whoſe glory as well as perſonal ſafety depends on our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, will not exert every nerve of the Britiſh power, to ſave themſelves and us from ruin.</p>
                  <p>"Much ſays our author has been ſaid of the ſtrength of Britain and the Colonies, that in conjuction they might bid defiance to the world; but this is mere preſumption, the fate of war is uncertain."</p>
                  <p>Excellent reaſoning, and truly conſiſtent with our author. We of ourſelves are a match for Europe, nay for the world; but in junction with the moſt formidable power on earth; why then, the matter is mere preſumption. The fate of war is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:043001_0033_101CC24F274E0EB8"/>
It is indeed humiliating to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this author ſhould vamp up a form of government, ſor a conſiderable part of mankind; and in caſe of its ſucceeding, that he probably would be one of our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, until we prayed ſome more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tyrant of the army, to ſpurn him to his primeval obſcurity; from all his ill-got honours flung, turned to that dirt from whence he ſprung. "A government of our own, is our natural right," ſays our author.</p>
                  <l>" Had right decided, and not fate the cauſe,</l>
                  <l>" Rome had preſerv'd her Cato and her laws."</l>
                  <p>Unfortunately for mankind, thoſe are fine ſounding words, which ſeldom or ever influence human affairs. If they did, inſtead of appropriating the vacant lands to ſchemes of ambition, we muſt inſtantly deputiſe envoys to the Indians, praying them to re-enter their former poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and permit us quietly to depart to the country of our anceſtors, where we would be welcome gueſts. But continues our author, "What have we to do with ſetting the world at defiance? our plan is commerce, and that well attended to, will ſecure us the peace and friendſhip of all Europe; becauſe it is the intereſt of all Europe to have America a free-port, her trade will always be her protection, and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:043001_0034_101CC250B1E44EF0"/>
her barrenneſs of gold and ſilver, will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure her from invaders."</p>
                  <p>I am perfectly ſatisfied, that we are in no condition to ſet the world at defiance, that commerce and the protection of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will ſecure us peace, and the friendſhip of all Europe; but I deny that it is the intereſt of all Europe to have America a free-port, unleſs they are deſirous of depopulating their dominions. His aſſertions, that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs of gold and ſilver will ſecure us from invaders, is indeed highly pleaſant. Have we not a much better ſecurity from invaſions, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the moſt numerous and beſt diſciplined army under heaven; or has our author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſbanded it. Pray how much gold and ſilver do the mines of Flanders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce? and what country ſo often has ſeen its unhappy fields drenched with blood, and fertiliſed with human gore. The princes of Europe have long dreaded the migration of their ſubjects to America; and we are ſenſible, that the king of Pruſſia is ſaid more than once to have hanged Newlanders, or thoſe who ſeduced his ſubjects to emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate. I alſo humbly apprehend, that Britain is a part of Europe. Now, <hi>old gentleman,</hi> as you have clearly ſhewn, that we have a check upon her Weſt India trade, is it her intereſt to give us a greater check

Can we ſuppoſe it to be her intereſt to loſe her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable commerce to the Colonies, which effectually ſhe would do, by giving up A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica to become your free port. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is the intereſt of all Europe, to have America a free port: The people of Britain are extremely ſimple to expend ſo many millions ſterling to prevent it. "It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the nature of things, to all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples from former ages, to ſuppoſe that this Continent can long remain ſubject to any external power."</p>
                  <p>Antiquity affords us no eclarciſement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the future government of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Rome ſituated in a ſterile corner of Italy, long, long, retained the then world in chains, and probably had maintained her dominion longer, had not the croſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the empire to Byzantium, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the eagles, and in turn, juſtly been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the Barbarians. I ſee no reaſon to doubt, that Great Britain, may not long retain us in conſtitutional obedience. Time, the deſtroyer of human affairs, may indeed, end her political life by a gentle decay.

                  <p>This I have granted, and I add, that a million of revolutions may happen on this Continent, for every one of which, I am not indeed ſo over ſolicitous, as our Phoenix of Whims, the Author of Common Senſe.

We are not indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, that Great Britain is uniformly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with defending us from intereſted motives. In like manner, however, may every ingrate, reproach his benefactor; ſince all benefactions may be ſaid to flow from no purer fountain. With predilection, we view our parent ſtate; and wiſhfully contemplate on our late felicity, almoſt realizing that ſtate of old, ſo beautifully feigned by the poets. We venerate the conſtitution, which with all its imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (too often exaggerated) we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend almoſt approaches as near to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as human kind can bear. We ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the idea of arming with more virulence, more unremitting ardour, againſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate, than againſt France; by whom our RIGHTS, CIVIL, as well as RELIGIOUS, certainly were more imminently endangered. With horror we reflect on the former civil wars, when every crime, odious and baneful to human nature, were alternately perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by the ſoldiers, particularly by the Independents."</p>

"Every quiet method of peace has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; our prayers have been rejected with diſdain." I do not indeed agree with the people of England in ſaying, that thoſe, who ſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully laboured to widen the breach—defired nothing leſs than peace. That they who ſhortly were to command the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven, and a navy fit to contend with the fleets of England, imagining <hi>the time had found us,</hi> diſdained to be juſt. I highly venerate a majority of the Delegates. I have not indeed the honour of knowing all the worthy members; however, I wiſh the Gentlemen of the Congreſs, e'er they entered on their important charge, had been better acquainted with the ſtrength of our friends in parliament. I ſincerely lament, that the King did not receive the laſt excellent petition from the Congreſs; and I as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

"As to government matters," (continues our Author,) "it is not in the power of Britain to do this Continent juſtice: The buſineſs of it will ſoon be too weighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of convenience, by a power ſo very diſtant from us, and ſo very ignorant of

us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot govern us. The difference between Pennſylvania, and Connecticut, reſpecting ſome unlocated lands, ſhews the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance of a Britiſh government, and fully proves, that nothing but Continental au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can regulate Continental matters."</p>
                  <p>Until the preſent unhappy period, Great Britain has afforded to all mankind, the moſt perfect proof of her wiſe, lenient, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous government of the Colonies—The proofs to which we already have alluded, <abbr>viz.</abbr> our ſupreme felicity, and amazing increaſe.

                     <hi>Saints</hi> from their delicious abodes and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fields.—"But (ſays the Author) the moſt powerful argument is, that nothing but independence, (that is a Continental form of government) can keep the peace of the Continent, and preſerve it inviolate from civil wars. I dread the event of a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation now with Britain, as it is more than probable, that it will be followed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt ſomewhere; the conſequences of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain. Thouſands are already ruined by Britiſh barbarity, thouſands more will probably ſhare the ſame fate. Theſe men have other feelings, than thoſe who have nothing ſuffered: All they now poſſeſs is liberty, what they before enjoyed is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to its ſervice, and having nothing more to loſe, they diſdain all ſubmiſſion."</p>
                  <p>Here we cannot miſtake our author's meaning, that if one or more of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or ſouthern Colonies reconcile with Great Britain, they will have war to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with New England; "the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which may be more detrimental, than all the malice of Britain." This ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible denunciation, fortunately for ſuch Colonies, is as futile as its author. Should Great Britain re-eſtabliſh her authority in the ſaid Colonies by negociation, ſurely it
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:043001_0041_101CC264A0031180"/>
is not temerity to add, that the weight of Britain, in the ſcale of thoſe provinces, would preponderate againſt the power of New England. If Britain ſhould reduce the Colonies by arms, (which may Heaven avert!) The New England provinces will have as little inclination, as ability, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the peace of their neighbours. I do indeed moſt ſincerely compaſſionate thoſe unhappy men, who are ruined by our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate diſtractions. I do fervently pray, that Britain, and the Colonies may moſt effectually conſider their peculiar infelicity. Such attention will do infinite honour to the parent ſtate; who cannot view them as enemies, but as men unhappily irritated by the impolitic meaſures of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. "The diminution of trade affords an army, and the neceſſities of an army, create a new trade." (So ſays our Author) I am ſurpriſed the miniſtry, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with ruining the commerce of Britain, never urged, (what was never thought or ſaid before.) Our Author's excellent axiom, "that the diminution, &amp;c." Certain it is, the minority had replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince the commencement of this century; the diminution of the commerce of France hath afforded her nearly one million of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; but the neceſſities of this prodigious
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:043001_0042_101CC2663672D3D8"/>
number of troops, created her ſo bad a commerce, that ſhe hath twice proved bankrupt ſince, and more than once expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced the miſeries of famine.</p>
                  <p>"If premiums (ſays our Author) were to be given to Merchants to build and employ in their ſervice, ſhips mounted with 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, the premiums to be in proportion to the loſs of bulk to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. Fifty or ſixty of thoſe ſhips, with a few guard ſhips on conſtant duty, would keep up a ſufficient navy, and that without burdening ourſelves with the evil ſo loudly complained of in England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuffering their fleets in time of peace to lie rotting in their docks." Yield the palm of ingenuity to our Author, ye De Wits, Colberts, Pelhams, and Pitts. He has outdone ye by conſtructing a beautiful navy; alas! on paper only.—Firſt, no nation in Europe depends on ſuch ſhips for her defence: Secondly, ſuch ſhips would be unfit to contend with capital ſhips: Thirdly, in the hour of danger, theſe ſhips on their voyage, or return, would alternately be taken by an active enemy: Laſtly, ſix times as many ſuch ſhips would be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually matched with that part of the naval power of Britain, which ſhe actually could ſpare to combat on our coaſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This cannot be thought exaggeration, if we conſider
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:043001_0043_101CC267D10456A8"/>
that the Britiſh navy, laſt war, carried about ſeventeen thouſand guns; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ninety-five thouſand ſocial ſeamen. "No country (ſays our author) is ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſituated, or internally capable of raiſing a fleet as America. Tar, timber, iron and cordage are her natural produce." He ſpeaks of forming a fleet, as if he could do it by his Fiat. A third rate ſhip of the line fitted for ſea, is allowed to coſt ſeventy four thouſand pounds ſterling, which at the preſent exchange, is about one hundred and twenty nine thouſand pounds. Now, as labour, ſail cloth, cordage, and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites, are dearer than in Europe, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe the advanced price, at twenty-five per cent. which makes the amount one hundred and fifty four thouſand pounds. We muſt next ſuppoſe our navy equal to that of France, which conſiſts of ſixty four ſhips of the line (fifty gun ſhips incluſive) twenty-five frigates, with ſhips of inferior force. In caſe of independence, we cannot admit a ſmaller naval force. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when joined to the fleets of France and Spain, the navies ſo united, and navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated principally with landſmen, inſtructed by a few ſocial ſailors, will be vaſtly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the ſquadrons of Britain. The amount therefore of ſuch our navy, will
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:043001_0044_101CC26A6E24A710"/>
only require the trifling ſum of twelve mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, ſix hundred and twenty five thouſand pounds currency, which I am very willing to believe we can ſpare, being ſcarcely one fourth the value of our property, real and perſonal. With excellent management, our navy would laft eight, nine, or ten years; we therefore would find it extremely conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to rebuild it conſtantly at the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that term: Of this there cannot be a doubt, when we remember with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, "that ſhip-building is America's greateſt pride. The vaſt empire of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia is almoſt ſhut out from the ſea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her boundleſs forreſts, her tar, iron, and cordage, are only articles of commerce." I reply, that Ruſſia containing ten times our numbers, is deſtitute of induſtry and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. She has ports ſufficient to build and contain a navy to ſubdue the world. Deſtitute as we have remarked of induſtry and commerce, her navy is inconſiderable, and being equipt with landſmen, cannot figure againſt ſhips navigated by ſocial ſailors. Who can doubt the ability of Spain to build a navy? The cargo of two or three of her annual galeons were ſufficient to build a navy as formidable as that permitted to Great Britain (by the author of Common Senſe.) In her Iſland of Cuba, poſſeſſed of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:043001_0045_101CC26F82E2B948"/>
an immenſity of fine cedar; ſhe might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct a navy as formidable as that of Great Britain, but to what purpoſe, other than to adorn the triumph of her enemies; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhe could arm her ſhips, otherwiſe than by active landſmen, inſtructed by a few ſocial ſailors. Our Author ſays, "that the Terrible, Capt. Death, ſtood the hotteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of any ſhip laſt war, yet had not twenty ſailors on board," (tho' her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men was upwards of two hundred.)</p>
                  <p>We do indeed confeſs ourſelves doubtful on this head, and therefore wiſh our Author had produced his authority. We do appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that naval actions, very generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on ſeaman-ſhip, that is, on dextrouſly working the ſhip during the combat. Now the judicious reader will remember, that ſhips of war in engagement cannot be navigated by a few ſocial ſailors, nor even by a bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency, unleſs ſuch ſailors are more invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable than was the great Achilles.</p>
                  <p>"Were the Continent (ſays our Author) crowded with inhabitants, her ſufferings under the preſent circumſtances, would be intolerable, the more ſea ports we had, the more we ſhould have both to defend, and to loſe." This is rather incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; I cannot imagine, that we would be leſs formidable with ten times our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:043001_0046_101CC2721DA36318"/>
numbers, if at preſent we can defend one ſea-port; ſurely, with ten times as many inhabitants, we could equally defend ten. If with our preſent numbers, we are a match for the world, conſequently with ten times as many, we would be a match for ten worlds, which would indeed be prodigious! The infant ſtate of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies as it is called, ſo far from being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is an argument in favor of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence." This aſſertion is as abſurd, as if he had maintained, that twenty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior in number to two. "But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and diſadvantages we ſuſtain by that connection, are without number, and our duty to mankind at large, as well as to ourſelves, inſtruct us to renounce the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance; becauſe any ſubmiſſion to, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon Great Britain, tends di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to involve this Continent in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean wars and quarrels. As Europe is our market for trade, we ought to form no poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical connection with any part of it." Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable are the advantages of our connection with Britain; and a juſt dependence on her, is a ſure way to avoid the horrors and calamities of war. Wars in Europe, will probably than heretofore become leſs frequent; religious rancour, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly animated princes to arms, is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:043001_0047_101CC273AA8C0B48"/>
by a ſpirit of philoſophy extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly friendly to peace. The princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope are or ought to be convinced by ſad experience, that the objects of conqueſt, are vaſtly inadequate to the immenſe charge of their armaments. Prudential motives, therefore, in future, will often dictate ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, inſtead of war. Be it however admitted, that our ſpeculations are nuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and that as uſual, we are involved in war. In this caſe we really do not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate a twentieth part of the miſery and hardſhips of war, experienced by the other ſubjects of the empire. As future wars will probably be carried on by Britain in her proper element, her ſucceſs will hardly be doubtful, nor can this be thought audacity, if we remember the great things effected by Britain in her naval wars, then ſecondary objects to her Germanic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, to which ſhe now politically ſeems indifferent. Our ſailors navigating our veſſels to the Weſt Indies during war, are exempted from impreſſment, and if our trade to any part of Europe is then ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, it flows with uncommon rapidity in the Weſt Indies, nor is the object of cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Our author ſurely forgets, that when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent, we cannot trade with Europe,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:043001_0048_101CC2757569EB70"/>
without political connections, and that all treaties made by England or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial ſtates are, or ought to be, ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſubſervient to their commerce. "But (ſays our author,) admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event? I anſwer the ruin of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and that for ſeveral reaſons." Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation would conduct us to our former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate. The happineſs of the governed is without doubt the true intereſt of the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and if we aim not at independence, there cannot be a doubt, of receiving every advantage relative to laws and commerce that we can deſire. Monteſquieu ſpeaking of the people of England, ſays, "They know better than any people on earth, how to value at the ſame time theſe three great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, religion, liberty, and commerce." "It is a matter worthy of obſervation, that the more a country is peopled, the ſmaller their armies are." This indeed would be worthy of obſervation, did not daily experience contravert it. The armies of Ruſſia, France, Auſtria, England, and Pruſſia, are certainly more numerous than' thoſe of Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Portugal, and Sardinia. Now, the firſt five ſtates contain nearly ſixty millions, and the laſt kingdoms do not contain fourteen millions
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:043001_0049_101CC27A634649E8"/>
of people. "In military numbers, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients far exceeded the moderns, and the reaſon is evident, for trade being the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of population, men become too much abſorbed thereby, to attend to any thing elſe, commerce diminiſhes the ſpirit both of patriotiſm, and military defence."</p>
                  <p>Every man of ſenſe, now rejects the fabulous numbers of the army of X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rxes, and other fabled armies of antiquity. The ancient armies, did not exceed in numbers the armies of the moderns. If ſo, their ſtates had been deſolated by the horrid carnage of their battles, ariſing from the military ſpirit of defence, from the nature of their arms, and the arrangement of their armies, which permitted the combatants to buckle together, who ſeldom gave quarter. The Roman armies never exceeded twenty-five legions, which including auxiliaries, did not exceed two hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, a number greatly inferior to the armies of France, or perhaps Britain during war. Notwithſtanding my ardour for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, I do moſt fervently pray, that we may never exchange the ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, for that of military defence, even at the price of augmenting our armies. Let us hear the teſtimony of Monteſquieu in favor of commerce: "Commerce, ſays
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:043001_0050_101CC27BF054DD20"/>
he, is a cure for the moſt deſtructive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, for it is almoſt a general rule, that wherever we find agreeable manners, their commerce flouriſhes. Let us not be aſtoniſhed then, if our manners are now leſs ſavage than formerly. Commerce has every where diffuſed a knowledge of all nations, theſe are compared one with another, and from this compariſon ariſe the greateſt advantages. Peace is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect of trade, &amp;c." The Athenian people, perhaps the moſt reſpectable of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, did not long poſſes a commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſpirit, but were almoſt continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by this ſpirit of military defence. The common people in effect diſtributed the public revenues amongſt themſelves, while the rich, were in a ſtate of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. According to Lyſius the orator and others, it was their cuſtom, when in want of money, to put to death ſome of the rich citizens, as well as ſtrangers, for the ſake of the forfeiture. In ſhort, could we enumerate the infinite train of misfortunes inflicted on mankind, in every clime and age by this ſelf-ſame ſpirit of military de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; our readers will ſurely join us in opinion, that commerce has moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily humanized mankind. I am not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware, that there are many declamations
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:043001_0051_101CC27EA6BDBD68"/>
againſt commerce, theſe I have ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as trials of wit, rather than ſerious productions. Our author's antipathy, and extreme averſion to commerce, is eaſily accounted for. If his independence takes place, I do aver, that commerce will be as uſeleſs, as our ſearching for the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone. "And hiſtory (ſays he,) ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently informs us, that the braveſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements were always accompliſhed in the non-age of a nation." The Greeks in their early ſtate were pirates, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans robbers, and both warred in character. Their glorious actions were performed, (If I may ſo expreſs myſelf) in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their empire. Carthage, Greece, Aſia, Spain, Gaul, and Britain, were not indeed conquered during the non-age of the republic. Agincourt, Creſſey, Oude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Ramillies, Blenheim, Dettingen, and Minden, ſurely were not fought in the infancy of the Engliſh Empire. "With the encreaſe of commerce, England has loſt her ſpirit." This is really a curious diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; who is unacquainted, that the Engliſh are the lords and factors of the univerſe, and the Britain joins to the commerce of Tyre, Carthage and Venice, the diſcipline of Greece, and the fire of old Rome. "The city of London, ſubmits to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:043001_0052_101CC28034400D88"/>
inſults, with the patience of a coward. The more men have to loſe, the leſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling they are to venture, and ſubmit to courtly power with the trembling duplicity of a ſpaniel." That an inconſiderable part of the people in London, ſubmit to a perſon not very honorably diſtinguiſhed in the world is certain, but that the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſubmits to continued inſults is certainly a miſtake. I ſuppoſe our author means, that by ſubmitting to the beſt laws on earth they ſubmit to continued inſults. The rich whom he ſo very honorably diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, can be at no loſs for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. An Agrarian law, would perhaps be convenient for himſelf and his independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. It may not however be amiſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him of that, which in the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his projects, he may have forgot, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the richeſt part of the community will always be an overmatch for the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. "It might be difficult, (ſays our author,) if not impoſſible, to form this Continent into a government half a century hence."</p>
                  <p>Here I humbly apprehend our author's meaning is truly conſpicuous. This Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent fifty years hence, infallibly will be richer, and much better peopled than at preſent; conſequently abler to effect a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.

But alas! e'er that period, our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will forever be forgotten; impelled therefore by his villainous ambition, he would raſhly precipitate his country into every ſpecies of horror, miſery, and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather than forego his fancied protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torſhip. "But if you have, (ſays our author) and ſtill can ſhake hands with the murderers, then are ye unworthy the name of huſband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward, and the ſpirit of a ſycophant, &amp;c.

                  <p>Ye that are not drunk with fanaticiſm anſwer me? Are theſe words dictated by peace, or baſe foul revenge, the conſtant attendant on cowards and ſycophants? Does our author ſo perfectly verſed in ſcripture, mean to conduct us to peace or deſolation? or is he fit to legiſlate for men or devils?

hands with our inveterate enemies the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who have ſcalped nearly as many of our people as the Britiſh troops have done: Why therefore may we not forgive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile—By no means, it blaſts our author's ambitious purpoſes. The Engliſh and Scotch, ſince the firſt Edward's time, have alternately ſlaughtered each other, (in the field of Bannockburn, more men fell, than are now in the New-England provinces) to the amount of ſeveral hundred thouſand: And now view each other as ſubjects, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſing the efforts of certain turbulent ſpirits, tending to rekindle the ancient animoſity. Many of the unhappy men criminally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Pretender; reconciled by humane treatment to that family againſt whom they rebelled; ſerved in their armies a few years after. Indeed the conduct of the Canadians to our troops, as effectually illuſtrates our doctrine, as it reprobates the Anti-chriſtian, diabolical tenets of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.—"The unwarrantable ſtretch like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which that houſe made in their laſt ſitting, to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of that province, ought to warn the people at large, how they truſt POWER OUT OF THEIR OWN HANDS. A ſet of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for the Delegates were put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which in point of ſenſe, and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

would have diſhonored a ſchool-boy, and after being approved by a few, a very few, without doors, were carried into the houſe, and there paſſed in behalf of the whole Colony. Whereas, did the whole Colony know, with what ill will that houſe hath entered on ſome neceſſary public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they would not heſitate a moment to think them unworthy of ſuch a truſt." This very inſidious charge, we cannot read without indignation. If the Pennſylvanians, had happily adhered to their virtuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, it is more than probable, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional reconciliation had e'er now taken place. Unfortunately, reſcinding their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they perhaps adopted the ſentiments of <hi>certain perſons,</hi> by no means ſuperior in virtue or knowledge. Thoſe not inebriated with independency, will certainly allow, that the inſtructions to their Delegates, were dictated by the true ſpirit of peace, juſtice, and exalted policy. If inſpiration had dictated thoſe reſolves, obnoxious as they are to independency, our author had repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated them. How dare the author of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe ſay, "that they attempted to gain an undue authority over the Delegates of their province? Who ſo proper to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, as thoſe choſen by the people, not in the hour of paſſion, riot and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

but in the day of peace and tranquil reflection. The gentleman, whom our author impotently attacks, in this and other innuendos; will be long revered by his grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countrymen, and the friends of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; as well for his true patriotiſm and extenſive abilities, as his unbounded bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence. Would we profit by the unhappy examples of our anceſtors, (which alas! mankind too ſeldom do,) let us remember the fate of thoſe illuſtrious patriots, of the firſt Charles's time: Allied at firſt with the independents; they did not ſuſpect thoſe execrable hypocrites, of the horrid deſign of deſtroying the King and conſtitution. When they ſaw through their abominable views, it was too late to ſave the King and kingdom; for the independents had ſeized the ſovereignty. Soon as they were firmly poſſeſſed of power; they perſecuted thoſe illuſtrious patriots, with more unrelenting virulence, than the profeſſed advocates of arbitrary power. Every virtuous Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian, muſt be fired with indignation at the inſidious attack made by this indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the reſpectable aſſembly of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Indeed, the Aſſembly of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania in this unworthy treatment have a ſure earneſt of their future expectations.—"It is the cuſtom of nations, (ſays our author)

when any two are at war, for ſome other powers not engaged in the quarrel, to ſtep in as mediators, and bring about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries of a peace. But while America calls herſelf the ſubject of Britain, no power, however well diſpoſed ſhe may be, can offer her mediation. Wherefore in our preſent ſtate we may quarrel on forever."</p>
                  <p>Nations, like individuals, in the hour of paſſion attend to no mediation. But when heartily drubbed, and tired of war, are very readily reconciled, without the intervention of mediators; by whom, belligerents were never reconciled, until their intereſts or paſſions dictated the pacification. If we may uſe our author's elegant language, mediation is "farſical." I grant however, that the idea of our forcing England by arms to treat with us is brilliant. "It is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable continues (our author) to ſuppoſe that France and Spain will give us any kind of aſſiſtance, if we mean only to make uſe of that aſſiſtance for the purpoſe of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the breach, and ſtrengthening the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Britain and America; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe powers would be ſufferers by the conſequences."</p>
                  <p>Conſidering "we have the moſt numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and beſt diſciplined army under Heaven;

and a fleet fit to contend with the navy of Britain;" we muſt ſuppoſe our Author's brain affected by dwelling conſtantly on his beloved independency, elſe he would not have the imbecility to require the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of France and Spain. The manner of his prevailing on France and Spain to aſſiſt us, is alſo a ſtrong proof of his inſanity. Did thoſe powers, heſitate to ſuccour the Scotch rebels in 1745, becauſe they did not declare themſelves independent. It then was their intereſt to create a diverſion, alas! too ſerious in the ſequel for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded rebels in that kingdom; and were they now intereſted in aiding us, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly would do it in ſpite of quibbles. In ſuch caſe, e'er this time, their armies and navies had joined us without interruption: For we muſt confeſs, that the efforts of Britain hitherto, would not have precluded the republic of Genoa from aiding us. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our author, had a ſon or an apprentice eloped to his intimate acquaintance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to enter into his ſervice: If this perſon replied to the youth; I know your appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip is unexpired, notwithſtanding declare yourſelf a freeman, and I will hire and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect you.

Our author "challenges the warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advocate for reconciliation to ſhew a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle advantage this Continent can reap, by being connected with Great Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a ſingle advantage is derived: Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe:" Were the author's aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards have no demand for theſe articles; and the French little or none. Britain would be a principal mart for our lumber, part of our grain, naval ſtores, tobacco, and many other articles, which perhaps are not generally wanted in any kingdom in Europe. If it is ſuggeſted, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh

I reply, that it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common to ſee Engliſh flour for ſale in thoſe Iſlands; as our merchants have more than once found to their coſt. Since 1750, flour hath ſold in the Iſlands, at ten and twelve per cent. the price being reduced by flour from England.</p>
                  <p>Britain is alſo better calculated to ſupply us, with woollen goods and other neceſſary articles, than any kingdom in Europe. Should a ſeparation enſue; Britain will open an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive commerce to the Baltic, and Ruſſia, for all, or many of the commodities, ſhe now receives from us. The Ruſſians, ſince their laſt glorious treaty with the Porte; can now export the commodities of their moſt fertile Ukraine, through the Mediterranean, until that period, they were conſtrained to carry their hemp, eight or nine hundred miles to the Baltic, whence by a long and dangerous navigation, it reached the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ports in the Atlantic. I need not inform the reader that ſuch immenſe land carriage, precluded the ſubjects of Ruſſia from raiſing wheat, which generally ſold in the Ukraine for ten-pence per buſhel, as did rye at five-pence in that extenſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than which no country on earth is more happily adapted for that grain.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:043001_0061_101CC29BE1E60250"/>
The Britiſh nation, pre-eminently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for induſtry and enterpriſe, will eſtabliſh factories in the provinces of Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and animate thoſe people to emulate our productions, which they will tranſport by the Mediterranean, to the ports of Europe, and the Weſt-Indies.—By theſe means, and the culture of Poland, our grain would probably be reduced to its priſtine price, two ſhillings and ſix pence. As our Author is ſo violently bent againſt reconciliation; he muſt either ſuppoſe a conſtant war with the incenſed power of England; or admit that he is a proper inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the domains of Arioſto, (the world in the moon.)

Our author affirms "that our trade will always be our protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." I therefore crave his pardon, and ſhall believe, that the ſight of our grain, and ſmell of the New England Codfiſh, will effectually ſerve as a Mediterranean paſs, to the piratical rovers. I do humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſuſpicions, leaſt Portugal extremely dependent on Great Britain, may not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult us.

being as potent as Great Britain. Let us now conſider our army, nearly as I have ſtated it, and our navy as an object by no means ſublunary. It now behoves us well to conſider, whether it were better to enter the harbour of peace with Great Britain, or plunge the ſhip into all the horrors of war.—Of civil war. As peace and a happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of commerce, are objects infinitely better for Great Britain; than war and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of her commerce. It therefore is her intereſt to grant us every ſpecies of indulgence, conſiſtent with our conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dependence, ſhould war continue, there can be no doubt of the annihilation of our ſhips, ports and commerce, by Great Britain. The King's ſhips now in New England, unhappily are more than ſufficient to ruin the ports and commerce of theſe provinces. New York is already ſecured; and I ſhould be extremely grieved to hear, that a ſmall armament, were deſtined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Philadelphia. In the opinion of the beſt officers of the navy; Philadelphia is acceſſible to a few forty and fifty gun ſhips, in deſpite of our temporary expedients to fortify the river Delaware. If ſuch opinion is groundleſs, the miniſtry by their imbecil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity have befriended us; ſince by guarding the River Delaware with a few frigates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:043001_0064_101CC2A225BA3FB8"/>
they had precluded us from arming our veſſels and ſtrengthening the river Delaware. I would remind our author of the conſtant language, and apparent purport of all ranks in oppoſition to Great Britain: "We have (ſay they) been the happieſt people on earth, and would continue to be ſo ſhould Great Britain renounce her claim of taxation. We have no ſiniſter views, we claim not independence; No! Periſh the thought." Such I believe alſo was the tenor of the petitions from the Congreſs to his Majeſty. Now I would aſk every man of ſentiment, what opinion our friends in Great Britain, nay the whole world will entertain of us, if ingratefully, and madly adopting our author's frantic ſchemes, we reject reaſonable terms of reconciliation? Will they not moſt aſſuredly believe, that our popular leaders, have by infinite art, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded the unwary people into their pre-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed ſchemes; on ſuppoſition, <hi>that the time had found us?</hi> Thoſe acquainted with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain muſt confeſs, that the minority in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, hitherto have been our main prop. Now independency for ever annihilates this our beſt reſource. Let us admit a part of the minority, republicans, or what is more probable, bent on removing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miniſtry from their power. Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:043001_0065_101CC2A5DE0F05C8"/>
ſchemes annihilates all their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, all their oppoſition. In caſe of our independence, ſhould a BARRE, or BURKE, patroniſe our goverment; ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, would infallibly participate the fate of the great and good DEWITS; be torn in pieces by the furious People.—If my remarks are founded on truth, it reſults, <hi>that the time hath not found us;</hi> that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency is inexpedient, ruinous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and that reconciliation with Great Britain on good terms, is our ſole reſource. 'Tis this alone, will render us reſpectable; it is this alone, will render us numerous; it is this only, will make us happy.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall no longer detain my reader, but conclude with a few remarks on our Author's ſcheme. The people of thoſe Colonies would do well to conſider the character, fortune, and deſigns of our Author, and his independents; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with thoſe of the moſt amiable and venerable perſonages in, and out of the Congreſs, who abominate ſuch nefarious meaſures. I would humbly obſerve, that the ſpecious ſcience of politics, is of all others, the moſt deluſive. Soon after the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ableſt ſtateſ-men in England, and other parts of Europe; confidently

The Nation now indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nearly thrice that ſum; is not arrived at the zenith of her credit and power. It is perhaps poſſible to form a ſpecious ſyſtem of government on paper which may ſeem practicable, and to have the conſent of the people; yet it will not anſwer in practice, nor retain their approbation upon trial. "All plans of government (ſays HUME) which ſuppoſe great reformation in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of mankind, are merely imaginary."</p>
                  <p>The fabricators of Independency have too much influence; to be entruſted in ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and important concerns. This reaſon alone, were ſufficient at preſent, to deter us from altering the Conſtitution. It would be as inconſiſtent in our leaders in this hour of danger to form a government; as it were for a Colonel forming his battalion in the face of an enemy, to ſtop to write an eſſay on war.</p>
                  <p>This author's Quixotic ſyſtem, is really an inſult to our underſtanding; it is infinitely inferior to HUME's idea of a perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth; which notwithſtanding his acknowleged greatneſs of genius, is ſtill reprehenſible. It is not our buſineſs to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, in what manner this author's aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, acquired their knowledge in national

affairs; but we may predict, that his ſcheme of independency would ſoon, very ſoon give way to a government impoſed on us, by ſome Cromwell of our armies. Nor is this ſentiment unnatural, if we are atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to conſtant experience, and human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The ſublime MONTESQUIEU, ſo aptly quoted by the Congreſs, unhappily corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates our doctrine, "from (ſays he) a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of thinking that prevails amongſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. They ſet a higher value upon cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than timorouſneſs, on activity than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, on ſtrength than counſel. Hence, the army will ever deſpiſe a ſenate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect their own officers. They will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſlight the order ſent them by a body of men whom they look upon as cowards, and therefore unworthy to command them, ſo that as ſoon as the army depends on the legiſlative body, it becomes a military one;" and if the contrary has ever happened, it has been owing to ſome extraordinary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch as Holland being able to drown her garriſons, and the Venetians having it in their power to compel their troops to obedience by the vicinity of the European armies.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding our Author's fine words about toleration: Ye ſons of peace and true chriſtianity; believe me, it were folly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, madneſs, to expect angelic toleration from New-England, where ſhe has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly been deteſted, perſecuted and execrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even in vain would our Author; or our CROMWELL cheriſh toleration; for the people of New-England, not yet arrived in the ſeventeenth or eighteenth century, would reprobate her.—It is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to ſuppoſe, that the New-England go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments would have no objection to an Agrarian law; nor is it unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that ſuch diviſion of property would be very agreeable to the ſoldiers. Indeed their General could not perhaps with ſafety to his exiſtence as a General, refuſe them ſo reaſonable a gratification, particularly, as he will have more than one occaſion for their ſervices.

In ſhort, I affirm that it would be moſt excellent policy in thoſe who wiſh for TRUE LIBERTY to ſubmit by an advantageous reconciliation to the authority of Great Britain; "to accompliſh in the long run, what they cannot do by hypocriſy, fraud and force in the ſhort one."

                  <p>THE town has been lately amuſed with a new political pamphlet, entitled COMMON SENSE.</p>
                  <p>This piece, though it has taken a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar name, and implies that the contents are obvious, and adapted to the underſtandings of the bulk of the people is ſo far from meriting the title it has aſſumed, that in my opinion it holds principles equally incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with learned and common Senſe.</p>
                  <p>I know not the author, nor am I anxious to learn his name or character; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or the book, and not the writer of it, is to be the ſubject of my animadverſions.</p>
                  <p>'Tis the glory of a free country to enjoy
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:043001_0072_101CC2BA35797FB8"/>
a free preſs, and of this, that the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinions of the meaneſt, equally with thoſe of the greateſt, are brought to view; for we know by frequent inſtances, that the rich and high born are not the monopolizers of wiſdom and virtue.—On the contrary, theſe qualities are oftener to be found among the middling claſs in every country, who, being leſs diſſipated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched than thoſe who are uſually called their betters, apply themſelves with more induſtry to the culture of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in reality become better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the true intereſts of the ſociety in which they live.</p>
                  <p>But to my great grief I have too often ſeen inſtances of perſons in every claſs of life, whoſe publications, at the ſame time they have reflected honor on the parts and genius of the authors, have been ſo ſhamefully wanting in candor as to attempt, by the cadence of words, and force of ſtile, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal perverſion of the underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>The pamphlet in queſtion ſeems to be plainly calculated to induce a belief of three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That the Engliſh form of government has no wiſdom in it, and that it is by no means ſo conſtructed as to produce the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:043001_0073_101CC2BBC5410C08"/>
happineſs of the people, which is the end of all good government.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. That monarchy is a form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inconſiſtent with the will of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. That now is the time to break of all connection with Great Britain, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare an independence of the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be obvious to every impartial eye, that the author reaſons from the abuſes of, againſt the benefits derived from, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh conſtitution; and after reciting theſe abuſes concludes, very unfairly, that, "it is incapable to produce what is ſeems to promiſe."—For if an argument of this ſort is to be received, it will prove perhaps ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than the author would chooſe—it would even prove that the Jewiſh theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy was quite as improper, and as inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to produce what it aimed at, as the reprobated Engliſh government. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ſacred hiſtory inform us, that the law was given to the people from God, and that the great Jehovah himſelf conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to call them his choſen people. He ſignally interpoſed in their behalf in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of bondage, in preſerving them from the rage of Pharoah's army, and ſeating them in a land flowing with milk and honey, under his immediate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:043001_0074_101CC2BE92684BA8"/>
and laws, "written with his own finger."</p>
                  <p>"And he will love thee and bleſs thee, and multiply thee: he will alſo bleſs the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy corn and thy wine, and thy oil; the increaſe of thy kine, and the flocks of thy ſheep, in the land which he ſware unto thy fathers to give thee." Deut. vii. 13.</p>
                  <p>"Thou ſhalt be bleſſed above all people, there ſhall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle." Deut. vii. 14.</p>
                  <p>But what effects did all theſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favors and promiſes of the Deity him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf produce upon that wicked, perverſe, ſtiff necked people? Moſes tells them,</p>
                  <p>"From the day that thou didſt depart out of the land of Egypt until ye came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this place, ye have been rebellious againſt the Lord." Deut. ix. 7.</p>
                  <p>"You have been rebellious againſt the Lord from the day that I knew you. Deut. ix. 24.</p>
                  <p>Profane as well as ſacred hiſtory informs us of the ineffectuality of the beſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the wiſeſt laws among a corrupt, degenerate people. It does not regularly
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:043001_0075_101CC2C0440079A0"/>
follow, that if the people are not happy under an excellent form of civil polity, that the fault is in the government, it may be owing to the corruption of the people, and this I take to be the caſe in Great Britain at this day. When the Britiſh parliament is properly balanced, and each branch of the legiſlature faithfully executes its duty, I think I am ſafe in affirming there was never yet a form of government in the world ſo well calculated for the happineſs of a free people as this, and yet we are told by the author of the pamphlet, that the "preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Engliſhmen in favor of King, Lords and Commons, ariſes as much or more from national pride than reaſon." The world has already ſeen numberleſs inſtances of fine ſpun political theories, which, like the quackeries of mountebank doctors, are to cure all the political evils to which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature is liable.—But when the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is made, they become aſtoniſhed at the ill ſucceſs of their boaſted ſchemes—they find a thouſand little paſſions and intereſts continually interfering with their deſigns, and at length retire again to their cloſets, chagrined they had not thought it neceſſary to ſtudy the great volume of human nature, before they ventured to ſay what was the beſt for mankind.</p>

The author, after venting his ſpleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Engliſh form of government, comes next to conſider the ſubject of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and heriditary ſucceſſion; in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he plainly diſcovers the utmoſt prepoſſion in favor of a republic. I ſhall not follow him through his ſcripture quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which he has ſo carefully garbled to anſwer his purpoſe, but beg leave to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome authorities to it.</p>
                  <p>The celebrated Trenchard, in No. 60, of Cato's Letters, ſays, "There is no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment now upon earth, which owes its formation or beginning to the immediate revelation of God, or can derive its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from ſuch revelation: It is certain, on the contrary, that the riſe and inſtitution, or variation of government, from time to time, is within the memory of men or of hiſtories; and that every government which we know at this day in the world, was eſtabliſhed by the wiſdom and force of mere men, and by the concurrence of cauſes evidently human."</p>
                  <p>"Nor has God by any revelation nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated magiſtrates, ſhewed the nature or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their powers, or given a plan of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil polity for mankind." (Hutcheſon's Moral Philoſophy. p. 272.)</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:043001_0077_101CC2C855DB7968"/>
                     <hi>"There being no natural or divine law for any form of government,</hi> or that one perſon rather than another ſhould have the ſovereign adminiſtration of affairs, or have power over many thouſand different families who are by nature all equal, being of the ſame rank, promiſcuouſly born to the ſame advantages of nature, and to the uſe of the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faculties, therefore <hi>mankind is at liberty to chooſe what form of government they like."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>"God's providence or permiſſion ſuffered his own peculiar people the Jews to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der divers governments at divers times; as firſt under patriarchs. Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, &amp;c. then under judges, Othniel, Ehud and Gideon; then under high-prieſts, Eli and Samuel; then under kings, Saul, David and the reſt; then under captains and high prieſts again, "as Zerobabel, Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren; and the government was laſtly taken from them, and they brought under the power of Rome. And that God permits ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate or magiſtrates as the community thinks fit to approve, is plain by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Holy Scriptures; when God ſaid to Solomon, "By me kings rule, even all the judges of the earth." Prov. viii. 16.</p>
                  <p>"When the ſons of Samuel were judges over Iſrael, they took bribes and perverted
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:043001_0078_101CC2C9E5093380"/>
judgment, therefore the elders of Iſrael de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Samuel to make them a king; and though the elders are only mentioned to have aſked a king of Samuel, they ſeem to have been deputed from the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; for God ſaid unto Samuel, <hi>"Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they ſay unto thee."</hi> 1 Sam. viii. 4, 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>"And Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. x. 25. 'Tis plain the manner of the kingdom ſignifies the conſtitution of the government, by which was meant the conditions on which Saul was to be king, and they his ſubjects; for though <hi>God had given him the crown,</hi> it was to rule the people according to juſtice and laws."</p>
                  <p>"After the battle between Saul and the Ammonites, Samuel ſaid to the people, <hi>Come, let us go to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. xi, 1, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15. <hi>Now therefore behold the king, whom ye have choſen, and behold the Lord hath ſet a king over you."</hi> Sam. chap. 12. 13.</p>
                  <p>Theſe latter quotations are taken from the great Lord Sommers's book called the "Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of whole Kingdoms and Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rights of Kings and the People." This nobleman was Lord high chancellor of England in King William's reign, and
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:043001_0079_101CC2CCD708A6F8"/>
was remarkable for his revolution-prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, great learning and unſhaken inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, in public and private life.</p>
                  <p>It does therefore from the foregoing teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies appear, that monarchy (ſpecially a limited one, ſuch as that of England) is not inconſiſtent with the Holy Scriptures, as is ſet forth in ſaid pamphlet, but that it is as pleaſing to the Almighty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> agreeable to the people, as any other form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even the author's beloved republic.</p>
                  <p>The writer next proceeds to inform his readers of the numerous wars and ſcenes of blood acted in England under their kings, and aſſerts that <hi>"Monarchy and ſucceſſion have laid the world in blood and aſhes. 'Tis a form of government which the word of God bears teſtimony againſt, and blood will attend it."</hi> Here are bold aſſertions indeed. To the latter part I have already endeavoured to make ſome reply, ſo far as he aſſerts it is contrary to the word of God; but will the author's candor permit him to inform his reader of the infinite diſtractions and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which have happened in the ancient and modern republics—Under this form there are always two parties, which divide the whole body of the people, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal warfare ſubſiſts between them for power.

enough, no ſword ſufficiently ſharp, to puniſh thoſe whom they have ſubdued.—It then becomes a many headed monſter, a tyranny of many.</p>
                  <p>Let any man read with an unprejudiced eye the accounts which hiſtorians give us of the famous Grecian Commonwealths, and I will venture to ſpeak for him, that he will not beſtow great commendations on them.—The Athenians, a wiſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed people, very often baniſhed their beſt citizens, from an apprehenſion of their power—a glorious reward for a virtuous citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, who, as was the caſe in more inſtances than one, had preſerved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

In the latter times of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian and Roman republics, what conſtant ſcenes of blood and devaſtation does hiſtory preſent to us—The multitude in a perpetual ferment like the ocean in a ſtorm—In a ſtorm did I ſay,—like the waters of the ſea, agitated by a dreadful whirlwind, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the fury of one party encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rage of another.—Every trace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity being thus loſt, men change their natures and become as fierce and ſavage as wolves and tygers.</p>
                  <p>But let us deſcend nearer to modern times—let us look for happineſs and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the republic of Holland, ſo often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and ſo little known—let us recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

Whenever one of them dies, the vacancy is filled up without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the people, and this important change was made in the ſtate, becauſe of the intolerable feuds and animoſities which attended the elections of repreſentatives.

Let us never give that advantage to thoſe who have been ſtriving to excite the indignation of mankind againſt us as faithleſs people, ferocious, barbarous, and uninfluenced by thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſentiments and finer feelings, which, in modern times, have, in ſome meaſure, ſoftened the horrors of war. We know that ſuch a charge is as malicious as it is groundleſs. Inſtances enough might be produced to refute it, ſince this conteſt was carried on by arms; and I truſt no future ones will be found which might have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>As we have long profeſſed an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of peace, let us meet thoſe who bring the terms, with that virtuous confidence, which is inſeparable from an upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.

Let us hear their propoſals with patience, and conſider them with candor; remembering how deeply the happineſs of millions may be concerned in the iſſue. If what they offer be ſuch as <hi>freemen</hi> ought to accept, my voice ſhall be for an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate reconciliation; as I know of no object ſo worthy of a patriot as the healing our wounds, and the reſtoring of peace, if it has for its baſis an <hi>effectual</hi> ſecurity for the liberties of <hi>America.</hi> If on the contrary, the terms, which may be offered, ſhould be ſuch as we cannot accept, we have only to ſay ſo, and the negociation will be at an end.</p>
                  <p>But this writer is greatly concerned for our virtue, leſt we ſhould be cajoled, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and corrupted. I confeſs theſe fancies appear to me ſo groundleſs, that I ſuſpect their reality. Is it poſſible, in good earneſt to entertain ſo ill an opinion of thoſe, who have ſtaked their lives and fortunes on this conteſt, as to believe that they will ſuffer themſelves to be flattered out of their liberties, or induced to ſell their birthright for a <hi>meſs of pottage?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I conſider that this treaty is to be managed, on the part of America, by men delegated for their integrity and abilities by the voice of their country, I feel myſelf quite eaſy on that ſcore. If the ſcheme of the miniſtry be to try the <hi>arts of corruption,</hi> where their arms cannot prevail, there are
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:043001_0088_101CC2E4D29CB1B8"/>
other and leſs ſuſpicious ways of carrying it into execution, than by Commiſſioners, in the face of America, where they will have the eyes of all fixed upon them, and their conduct diligently watched and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely ſcrutinized.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, it appears that this writer is more an enemy to the buſineſs on which the Commiſſioners are to be ſent than really apprehenſive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or our virtue. He ſeems to have drank deep of the <hi>cup of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency;</hi> to be inimical to whatever carries the appearance of <hi>peace;</hi> and too ready to ſacrifice the happineſs of a great Continent to his favourite plan. Among ſuch writers I pretend not to claſs myſelf; for I am bold to declare, and hope yet to make it evident to every honeſt man, that the true intereſt of America lies in <hi>reconciliation</hi> with Great-Britain, upon <hi>conſtitutional principles,</hi> and I can truly ſay, I wiſh it upon no other terms.</p>
                  <p>Why the many publications in favor of <hi>independency,</hi> with which our preſſes have lately groaned, have paſſed hitherto unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, I am not able to determine. But there are certainly times when public affairs become ſo intereſting, that every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a debtor to the community for his opinions, either in ſpeaking or writing. Perhaps it was thought beſt, where an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi> was pretended to be made to the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:043001_0089_101CC2E88BED8338"/>
SENSE of this country, to leave the people for a while to the free exerciſe of that good underſtanding which they are known to poſſeſs. Thoſe who made the <hi>appeal</hi> have little cauſe to triumph in its ſucceſs. Of this they ſeem ſenſible; and, like true quacks are conſtantly peſtering us with their additional doſes, till the ſtomachs of their patients begin wholly to revolt. If little notice has yet been taken of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications concerning, independence, it is neither owing to the popularity of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the unanſwerable nature of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the fear of oppoſing them, as the vanity of the authors would ſuggeſt. I am confident, that nine-tenths of the people of Pennſylvania, yet abhor the doctrine.</p>
                  <p>If we look back to the origin of the preſent controverſy, it will appear that ſome among us at leaſt, have been conſtantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging their views, and ſtretching them beyond their firſt bounds, till at length they have wholly changed their ground. From the claim of Parliament to tax us, ſprung the firſt reſiſtance on our part. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that unjuſt claim was ſet on foot, not an individual, not one of all the profound legiſlators with which this country abounds, ever held out the idea of independence. We conſidered our connection with Great-Britain as our chief happineſs—we flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, grew rich, and populous, to a degree
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:043001_0090_101CA6B2EF612A68"/>
not to be paralleled in hiſtory. Let us then act the part of ſkilful phiſicians, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adapt the remedy to the evil.</p>
                  <p>Poſſibly ſome men may have harboured the idea of independence from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this controverſy. Indeed it was ſtrongly ſuſpected there were individuals whoſe views tended that way; but as the ſcheme was not ſufficiently ripened, it was reckoned ſlanderous, inimical to America, and what not, to intimate the leaſt ſuſpicion of this kind.</p>
                  <p>Nor have many weeks yet elapſed ſince the firſt open propoſition for independence was publiſhed to the world.—By what men of conſequence this ſcheme is ſupported, or whether by any, may poſſibly be the ſubject of future enquiry.—Certainly it has no coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance from the Congreſs, to whoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we look up with reverence. On the contrary, it is directly repugnant to every declaration of that reſpectable body. It would be needleſs to quote particular paſſages in proof of this, as they are to be met with in almoſt every page of their proceedings. I will refer to a few only, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their Reſolves, March 5, 1775—their Declaration, July 6.—their Addreſs to the King, July 8—their Letter to the Lord Mayor of London—and more eſpecially their Declaration for a faſt, June 12, in which with the deepeſt marks of ſincerity they call upon all America to

join with them in addreſſing the great Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the World—<q>humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to avert the deſolating judgments with which we are threatened, to bleſs our rightful Sovereign, &amp;c.—that ſo America may ſoon behold a gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Heaven for the redreſs of her many grievances, the reſtoration of her invaded rights, and reconciliation with the parent ſtate, on terms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and honorable to both.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Will any one be ſo hardy as to ſay, that either the appointment or obſervation of this ſolemn day was a mere mockery of Heaven and earth, or even that any Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can joined in it, who was not ſincere?—I truſt not. But if multiplying authorities were of any uſe, I might add the ſentiments of our own repreſentatives in aſſembly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the inſtructions to their Delegates; the ſentiments of Maryland in ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; the Reſolves of New Jerſey and New-Hampſhire; nor ſhall the much injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed province of Maſſachuſetts Bay be left out of the catalogue, whoſe Provincial Congreſs, while yet bleeding with the wounds receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Lexington, thus addreſſed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Great Britain—<q>Theſe are marks of miniſterial vengeance againſt this Colony, but they have not yet detached us from our royal Sovereign, &amp;c. truſting that in a <hi>conſtitutional</hi> connection with the mother

"When the fortune of war, after a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and glorious reſiſtance, had incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated you with the body of Engliſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we rejoiced in the truly valuable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, both on our own and your account; expecting, as courage and generoſity are naturally united, our brave enemies would become our hearty friends, and that the Divine Being would bleſs to you the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his over-ruling providence, by ſecuring to you and your lateſt poſterity the ineſtimable advantages of a free Engliſh conſtitution of government, which it is the privilege of all Engliſh ſubjects to enjoy."</p>
                  <p>"Theſe hopes were confirmed by the King's proclamation, iſſued in the year 1763, plighting the public faith for your full enjoyment of thoſe advantages."</p>
                  <p>"Little did we imagine that any ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſters would ſo audaciouſly and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly abuſe the royal authority, as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from you the fruition of the irrevoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights, to which you were thus juſtly entitled."</p>
                  <p>"But ſince we have lived to ſee the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected time, when miniſters of this flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious temper have dared to violate the moſt ſacred compacts and obligations, and as you, educated under another form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have artfully been kept from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the unſpeakable worth of <hi>that</hi> form you are now undoubtedly entitled to, we eſteem it our duty, for the weighty reaſon
<pb facs="unknown:043001_0095_101CC2F79816F630"/>
herein after mentioned, to explain to you ſome of its moſt important branches."</p>
                  <p>"In every human ſociety," ſays the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Marquis <hi>Beccaria,</hi> "there is an <hi>effort, continually tending</hi> to confer on one part the heighth of power and happineſs, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakneſs and miſery. The intent of good laws is to <hi>oppoſe this effort,</hi> and to diffuſe their influence <hi>univerſally</hi> and <hi>equally.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Rulers, ſtimulated by this pernicious effort,</q> and ſubjects, animated by the juſt "intent of oppoſing good laws againſt it," have occaſioned that vaſt variety of events, that fill the hiſtories of ſo many nations. All theſe hiſtories demonſtrate the truth of this ſimple poſition, that to live by the will of one man, or ſet of men, is the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery to all men."</p>
                  <p>"On the ſolid foundation of this principle, Engliſhmen reared up the fabrick of their conſtitution with ſuch a ſtrength, as for ages to defy time, tyranny, treachery, internal and foreign wars: And as an illuſtrious author (Monteſquieu) of your nation, hereafter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, obſerves,—"they gave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their colonies the form of their own government, and this government carrying proſperity along with it, they have grown great nations in the foreſts they were ſent to inhabit."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:043001_0096_101CC2F9243614A0"/>
"In this form, the firſt grand right is that of the people having a ſhare in their own government by their repreſentatives choſen by themſelves, and, in conſequence, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruled by <hi>laws,</hi> which they themſelves approve, not by <hi>edicts</hi> of <hi>men</hi> over whom they have no controul. This is a bulwark ſurrounding and defending their property, which by their honeſt cares and labours they have acquired, ſo that no portions of it can legally be taken from them, but with their own full and free conſent, when they in their judgment deem it juſt and neceſſary to give them for public ſervices, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely direct the eaſieſt, cheapeſt, and moſt equal methods, in which they ſhall be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected."</p>
                  <p>"The influence of this right extends ſtill farther. If money is wanted by rulers who have in any manner oppreſſed the people, they may retain it, until their grievances are redreſſed, and thus peaceably procure relief, without truſting to deſpiſed petitions, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing the public tranquillity."</p>
                  <p>"The next great right is that of trial by jury. This provides, that neither life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty nor property can be taken from the poſſeſſor, until twelve of his unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble countrymen and peers, of his vicinage, who from that neighbourhood may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſuppoſed to be acquainted with his character, and the characters of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
<pb facs="unknown:043001_0097_101CC2FF23FF9768"/>
upon a fair trial, and full enquiry face to face, in open court, before as many of the people as chuſe to attend, ſhall paſs their ſentence upon oath againſt him; a ſentence that cannot injure him, without injuring their own reputation, and probably their intereſt alſo; as the queſtion may turn on points that, in ſome degree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the general welfare; and if it does not, their verdict may form a precedent, that, on a ſimilar trial of their own, may militate againſt themſelves."</p>
                  <p>"Another right relates merely to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the perſon. If a ſubject is ſeized and impriſoned, though by order of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he may, by virtue of this right, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obtain a writ, termed a Habeas Corpus, from a judge, whoſe ſworn duty it is to grant it, and thereupon procure any illegal reſtraint to be quickly enquired into and redreſſed."</p>
                  <p>"A fourth right is that of holding lands by the tenure of eaſy rents, and not by rigorous and oppreſſive ſervices, frequently forcing the poſſeſſors from their families and their buſineſs, to perform what ought to be done, in all well regulated ſtates, by men hired for the purpoſe."</p>
                  <p>"The laſt right, we ſhall mention, regards the freedom of the preſs. The importance of this conſiſts, beſides the advancement of truth, ſcience, morality, and arts in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb facs="unknown:043001_0098_101CC3581154BBC8"/>
in its diffuſion of liberal ſentiments on the adminiſtration of government, its ready communication of thoughts between ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and its conſequential promotion of union among them, whereby oppreſſive officers are ſhamed or intimidated into more honorable and juſt modes of conducting affairs."</p>
                  <p>"Theſe are the invaluable rights, that form a conſiderable part of our mild ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; that, ſending its equitable ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy through all ranks and claſſes of men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends the poor from the rich, the weak from the powerful, the induſtrious from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious, the peaceable from the violent, the tenants from the lords, and all from their ſuperiors."</p>
                  <p>"Theſe are the rights, without which a people cannot be free and happy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protecting and encouraging influence of which, theſe colonies have hitherto ſo amazingly flouriſhed and increaſed. Theſe are the rights, a profligate miniſtry are now ſtriving, by force of arms, to raviſh from us, and which we are, with one mind, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to reſign but with our lives."</p>
                  <p>"THESE ARE THE RIGHTS, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO, AND OUGHT AT THIS MOMENT IN PERFECTION TO EXERCISE."</p>

This balance was wanting to the Romans; the Patricians and people were always divided at Rome, without a mitigating power to reconcile them. The Senate of Rome, who had the unjuſt and puniſhable pride to ſhare no part of their power with the Plebeians, knew no other ſecret to remove them from government, than to employ them continually in foreign wars; they regarded the people, as a beaſt of prey, whom it was neceſſary to let looſe on their neighbours, leaſt he ſhould tear his maſter. Thus, the greateſt fault of the government of the Romans made them conquerors; it was, becauſe they were

                  <p>The writer of Common Senſe, and his partizans, to promote their flagitious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, endeavour to make the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the number of our free people amount to three millions.

Virginia and Maryland, and the battalions now on foot in theſe provinces, ſuch, as doubt our computations, may ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that we are not widely miſtaken. If I am told that 72 counties are included in Virginia and Maryland, I reply, that they do not comprehend half the number of people contained in Yorkſhire. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of white people therefore in the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent provinces, may be truly ſtated in the following manner; in the ſouthern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, 450,000, in the middle colonies, 550,000, in the New England colonies, 500,000. Thus extenſively disjoined, theſe numbers form not ſo great a national ſtrength, as would half that number united in a compact territory. Now, a ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 1,500,000 people, cannot <hi>prudently</hi> keep up more than 15,000 ſoldiers. A perſon poſſeſſed of £ 1000 may indeed for ſome time diſplay the expence of him ſeiſed of £ 1000 yearly revenue, but he will affect ſuch imprudent parade at the expence of his <hi>ruin.</hi> On ſuch, and no other principle, may a community of 1,500,000 arm more than 15,000 men.</p>

                  <p>I would aſk thoſe who aſſert we are to be aided by France and Spain, on what aſſurance do they ground their hopes of ſuch aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Did Britain retain Manilla, Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Martinico, Guadaloupe, or Belleiſle?

Did Britain interfere in the conqueſt of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica?

Has France recovered the tone of her power, weakened by ſo many ſignal defeats? Are not her finances in deep diſorder, and likely ſo to continue for many years? Did not theſe <hi>weighty</hi> conſiderations lately retain France from ſuccouring the Turks, tho' brought to the verge of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the victories of Ruſſia?

                  <p>Circumſtanced as France and Spain are, would they not act extremely impolitically to aid or create a civil war in the dominions of Britain? Such procedure on the part of France would probably again rouſe the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ambition of the <hi>proud iſlanders,</hi> ſo as to recal to her memory the age of Henry the 5th. or the delivery of Dunkirk to Cromwell.

Monteſquieu very juſtly remarks, "that no ſtate threatens its neighbours with conqueſt ſo much as that which is involved in the horrors of civil war: In ſuch a ſeaſon, the nobility, the citizens, the artizans, the peaſants, and in ſhort the whole body of the people become ſoldiers." Can we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Sovereigns of France and Spain, charmed with our author's encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums on monarchs and monarchy, will in <hi>gratitude</hi> raiſe him to his beloved, his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately deſired <hi>protectorſhip?</hi> Let us how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſuppoſe that theſe monarchs jealous of the power of England, would gladly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her, even at the certain price of creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the independent ſtates of America, a very dangerous power to their colonies. Let us next examine the probable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. In ſuch war, <hi>Holland,</hi> perhaps <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> would take part with their <hi>natural</hi> ally, Great Britain. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed incumbent on theſe powers to preſerve, inviolate the Britiſh power in America and the Weſt Indies, which alone maintains the ſtability of the political balance in Europe. It conſequently will behoove France and Spain to arm with the utmoſt vigour, which cannot be effected at leſs annual expence than fifteen millions ſterling to each of the ſaid belligerents. Now ſhould this war
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:043001_0107_101CC31620CC7818"/>
prove unſucceſsful on the part of Great Britain, we cannot imagine that it will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, e'er many bloody fields are loſt and won; I ſay, it probably will not end in leſs than 10 years. This war therefore would coſt to France and Spain at leaſt 300 millions ſterling, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 3, 4, or 500,000 ſubjects.—Methinks I hear the writer of Common Senſe exclaim, Britain diveſted of her American commerce, cannot ſo long maintain war. I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him that Britain and Ireland contain nearly ten millions of people. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is the leaſt foundation in his aſſertion "that the diminution of <hi>trade creates</hi> an <hi>army,</hi> and the neceſſities of an army create a trade," the candid reader will ſurely allow that Great Britain may arm and maintain a moſt redoubtable army, poſſeſſed of nearly a million of manufacturers (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our author, and his congenial frantic declamators) in danger of ſtarving. Let us ſuppoſe that in the courſe of this war, unhappily for mankind the glory of Great Britain is ſtained by repeated diſgraces and defeats, and that ſhe is forever ſtripped of her colonies, who become independent.</p>

Let us now view the other

ſide. If we conſider the powerful efforts Britain has heretofore made to ſupport Auſtria, and the balance of power in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, we may readily imagine the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous efforts ſhe will perform to ſave herſelf from impending deſtruction. Her navies covering the ocean would rapidly deſtroy the fleets of her enemies. France and Spain overwhelmed with the deſtruction of their commerce and colonies, like a tree ſtript of of its branches, would pine and languiſh. Soon would they again implore Britain for peace.—The French and Spaniſh colonies once more, and perhaps forever would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive laws from Britain. The very fertile iſland of Hiſpaniola, of much more value than all the Britiſh iſlands, only awaits a <hi>ſummons</hi> to ſurrender to Great Britain. OPPRESSED BY EVERY SPECIES OF DESPOTISM, the planters of Hiſpaniola lately flew to arms, but alas! were defeated by the regular troops of their arbitrary Prince. Thoſe rich planters being in the vicinity of Jamaica, are charmed with the felicity of the Britiſh ſubjects, and languiſh to partake the happineſs of the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The ſurrender of this iſland (and its reduction would be infallible) would afford to Great Britain as real a monopoly

of ſugar and indigo, as the Dutch poſſeſs of the ſpice trade. Britain by moral and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſes habituated to glory, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly prevail, and triumphantly returning to our devoted ſhores.—I draw a veil over the event. Is it not a melancholy ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom that many, too many reſpectable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the colonies have attended to our "viſionary's tale of foreign aid? Is it not humiliating to conſider, that ſuch perſons have been miſled by our <hi>would be protector.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Can we be ſo credulous to believe what our author has aſſerted about our creating a navy, &amp;c.? We are not ignorant that Spain enjoys more commerce than the colonies, conſequently more ſeamen than America. We are not uninformed that Spain poſſeſſed of Mexico and Peru (mines not indeed ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily worked as our very valuable paper mines) would purchaſe ſeamen, if unhappily for the peace of mankind, gold could purchaſe ſailors; perhaps only to be obtained in Britain or Holland.—This our aſſertion is expreſly confirmed by <hi>the friend of mankind</hi> Monteſquieu, who ſays, "in this age, the whole life of a prince is ſcarce ſufficient for the raiſing and equipping a navy capable to make head againſt a power already poſſeſſed of the empire of the ſea." This perhaps
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:043001_0111_101CC320AE569450"/>
may be the only thing which MONEY CANNOT EFFECT. I apprehend that this very excellent authority, independent of our humble reaſons, will aſſuredly evince, to every candid reader, that in our days we cannot form a navy to contend with the pride and miſtreſs of the main. If the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Common Senſe is ſtill inflexibly bent on building a navy, I adviſe him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct it on his native plains of the moon.—There, indeed may it defy the power of Great Britain, which alas! it cannot brave on the Blue mountains, or any other part of Britiſh America. Seriouſly, the man's judgment muſt be ſtrangely depraved who can give the leaſt faith to our viſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's navy, and his other rhodomontades!</p>
                  <p>I apprehend that our planters, farmers, and others, who cannot obtain a ſhilling for wheat, who in barter for two buſhels of that article, cannot acquire one buſhel of SALT; who cannot procure other articles almoſt indiſpenſibly neceſſary to life; I ſay, ſuch perſons, as well as every other rank of inhabitants, will, I dread ſoon experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally find, that the writer of Common Senſe has inſulted their underſtanding, in ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them about their grain ſelling, "while <hi>eating is the cuſtom in Europe,"</hi> concerning a navy and ſuch like extravagancies.</p>

                  <p>"In ſupport of independency adds this author, I could if I judged it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, produce ſome of the ableſt and moſt experienced men on this continent, and whoſe ſentiments on that head are not yet publicly known. We lament he had not judged it proper to favour the public with the names of <hi>his able</hi> and <hi>experienced men</hi> who wiſh their country plunged into every ſpecies of miſery.</p>

In the Pamphlet, the author ſpeaks of the trade by which America has enriched herſelf. In the Appendix it is ſaid, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica doth not yet know what opulence is. This is ſurely contradictory. "Becauſe, that it is the intereſt of America to be ſeparated from Britain, becauſe it will come to that one time or other; becauſe the longer it is delayed, the harder it will be to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh." This is devoid even of the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of truth, and no man in his ſenſes can believe it. Let us however for argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſake admit it. Are we to precipitate ourſelves into ruinous meaſures, becauſe our remote deſcendants are to be involved in war? We may honeſtly anſwer no; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever political quacks allege to the contrary in ſupport of their criminal deſigns. If an aſſembly of 100 oppulent perſons were told that according to human affairs it were a million to one, that none of their deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants one or two thouſand years hence would poſſeſs one ſhilling of their property, would they do well to afflict themſelves? Surely not. In fine, exiſting a moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two eternities, our deſigns are frail as ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>"The continent (ſays the author) by that time would not have had a general, or even
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:043001_0118_101CC341ADD7CB8"/>
a military officer left; and we, or thoſe who may ſucceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us, would have been as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of martial affairs, as the ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians: and this ſingle poſition cloſely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, will unanſwerably prove, that the preſent time is preferable to all others." Here I do the author juſtice to ſuppoſe, that he really means to joke. If he is in earneſt, his invention is rather fertile; for I can ſafely ſay, that he has adduced a reaſon for arming, which no one elſe would have thought of. I believe my countrymen, who laſt war carried arms, will candidly own, that had we no better reaſon for taking up arms than that juſt aſſigned, we very ſafely might poſtpone the war 50 or 100 years longer. If our troops gathered laurels, the Britons alſo acquired glory. Certain I am, that our experienced officers will moſt chearfully allow, that the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional number of 150 or 200,000 men, (which additional number, in that remote period, the continent will at leaſt poſſeſs) would be an EQUIVALENT for their military ſkill. Why may not our deſcendants then expect foreign generals? Will not ſoldiers of fortune then have ſtronger inducements to explore military fame and fortune than at preſent? Why may not our youthful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:043001_0119_101CC335A68F71D8"/>
courting glory in the well fought fields of Europe, return with laurels, and inſtruct their countrymen to acquire honor and fame in defending America. The author of the Appendix next remarks, "that the value of the back lands which ſome of the provinces are clandeſtinely deprived of, by the unjuſt extenſion of the limits of Canada, valued only at five pounds ſterling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twenty five millions, Pennſylvania currency, and the quit-rents at one penny ſterling per acre, to two millions ſterling."</p>
                  <p>"It is by the ſale of <hi>thoſe lands</hi> that the debt may be ſunk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent reſerved thereon, will always leſſen, and in time, will wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the yearly expence of government. It matters not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ow long <hi>the debt is in paying,</hi> ſo that the lands when ſold be applied to the diſcharge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congreſs for the time being, will be the continental truſtees." This is perhaps the moſt glaring inſult ever offered to mankind, and as he evidently means to betray the cauſe he pretends to ſerve, I will therefore chearfully detect his duplicity. Firſt, I obſerve that his back lands are only 480 millions of acres, or a territory BUT 82 times larger than Pennſylvania,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:043001_0120_101CC33845D3B6E8"/>
which comprehends all the ſpace, even to the polar circle (land or ſeas of ice mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not to him) three fourths of which will forever remain a dreadful deſart. I am not ignorant that our author will allege the preceſſion of the equinoxes, which in the courſe of a million of years, by changing every climate on earth, <hi>may render his back lands habitable.</hi> Secondly, this project of his back lands will exterminate every Indian in North America; nor can this aſſertion be thought raſh if we remember the RESPECT with which our frontier ſettlers very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally treat their Indian neighbours. Now ſuch murderous ambition is rather too bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced in our ſtateſman ſo converſant in <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in juſtice, and our</hi> NATURAL RIGHTS. Thirdly, the habitable part of our author's provinces, will not be peopled (if ever) in leſs than 1000 or 1500 years. China, <hi>by every cauſe,</hi> is as favourable to population as any region or empire on earth. Yet doth it not contain one twentieth part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants our provinces ARE to comprehend in the ſhort ſpace of one or two centuries. In fine, there is no example on earth of ſuch population. War, famine, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence will ever prevent it. Mankind ever were and ever will be the ſame. Nor doth Providence ſeem ſolicitous to croud the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:043001_0121_101CC33B17D16980"/>
earth with inhabitants, elſe ſuch amazing numbers of human kind would not periſh in infancy, and every ſtage of life, as well by natural and acquired maladies, as by their paſſions rouſing them to war, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding them a prey to the accurſed ambition of deſigning leaders. Let us however ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe ridiculous tales about population are realized. Can we believe that our nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous deſcendants will be happier than their leſs numerous anceſtors? I reply we dare not believe it. I have not the leaſt doubt that modern Rome with her prieſts and violins, is not happier than ancient Rome with her triumphs, ſeditions, and proſcriptions. Now will any reaſonable perſon pretend to deny that the APPENDIX STATESMAN doth not mean to ſtab our credit by telling the public creditors, that they are to have unexplored, uninhabitable wilds, or ſeas of ice as a pledge for money? Will any one affirm that the proffered ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is in any degree preferable to the planet Saturn?</p>
                  <p>Well doth he know, that only naming ſuch ſecurity to the monied men is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual method of ſhutting their purſes. "It matters not (continues the appendix writer) how long the debt is in paying, &amp;c." Our author's ſincerity on this head, I moſt ſincerely believe.</p>

The author more than once mentions, "the ſufferers, whoſe <hi>all</hi> is already gone, and the ſoldier who has quitted his <hi>all</hi> for the defence of his country." I ſay, he attempts to terrify us with thoſe who have no fortunes but their SWORDS. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready expreſſed my ardent wiſhes, that Britain, and thoſe provinces may effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally commiſerate the unfortunate ſituation of the unhappy ſufferers. Surely thoſe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who on principles of virtue and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry defend their country; will, on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhment of peace, chearfully return to their families and avocations. Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the reader will not be bullied by ſuch impotent menaces, but will readily perceive the true cauſe of our author's aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to conciliatory meaſures, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that in ſuch caſe he would no longer be able to fiſh in troubled waters; that peace would reduce him and his aſſociates to their native inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficance. Peace doth not ſuit ſuch men: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy and war—civil war is their grand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource: They know, and perfectly agree with Swift, "that in party as in had wine, the DREGS always mount higheſt."</p>
                  <p>"But if it were, ſays our author, and even ſhould be granted (that is our former happy ſituation) I aſk as a reaſonable queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by what means is a corrupt and faithleſs

This axiom is as true as that light flows from the ſun. If we adopt reconciliatory meaſures, our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and wealth will probably augment in a greater degree than the people and riches of Britain circumſcribed in territory. In fine, conſidering the preſent ſituation of Europe, we muſt confeſs that a future period cannot preſent a juncture more unfavourable to the deſigns of our author and his independents.</p>

Can we without horror, read this deteſtable charge; to murder our deluded citizens?

If ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are the firſt fruits of REPUBLICAN LIBERTY?

                  <p>In PLAIN TRUTH, having too precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately conſidered commerce, I ſhall here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſider that ſubject. And firſt, I obſerve the reſtrictions of Britain on our commerce ſo often held up to us, as a grievance of the firſt magnitude, is, I humbly apprehend ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ideally, than really ſo. Here, I aſk thoſe merchants trading to Hamburgh, Holland, France, or other parts of Europe; to the Spaniſh, French, Dutch, and Weſt India ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; do they heſitate to import into our provinces, the commodities of theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kingdoms and colonies? I dare ſay, they will not anſwer in the negative, but the riſque exclaims the ſuperficial obſerver, I believe, the riſque is a bugbear, not very terrific to commercial adventurers.</p>
                  <p>

A ſeiſure I apprehend, is an event, that doth not happen to one in a thouſand ſuch ſpeculiſts; if it does, it muſt ariſe from the tranſactors miſconduct. Great Britain, as already obſerved, is without doubt our beſt market for our lumber, naval ſtores, ſhips, part of our grain, for our iron, train oil, flax ſeed, furs; I may include indigo, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, if not rice. No doubt, I ſhall be told, that rice and tabacco would ſell better in other parts of Europe than Britain. I reply, that we legally tranſport rice to any country in Europe, ſouth of Cape Finiſterre; and if the rice veſſels bound to Holland and the Baltic, call at England, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally have indigo and other articles to land in that kingdom.</p>
                  <p>France is well adapted to raiſe tobacco, where it ſoon will probably be cultivated; ſuch deſign ſome time ſince hath been in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. "It is well known, that the French might raiſe tobacco at home if they would, much cheaper than they can import it. The fact is this: The farm of tabacco is one of the great five farms, which make up the chief part of the Royal revenue; and therefore, the farmers general, for bye ends of their own, have hitherto had intereſt enough with the court, to prohibit the cultivation of it in old France, under the ſevereſt penalties. But nevertheleſs the real
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:043001_0127_101CC34B00C23E90"/>
French patriots, and particularly the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs de Mirabeau, have fully demonſtrated, that it is the intereſt of the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to encourage the cultivation of it, and have pointed out a ſure and eaſy method of collecting the duties; which was the ſole pretence of the farmers general for ſoliciting a prohibition: So that it is apprehended, that the French government will at laſt open their eyes in this reſpect, and allow the cultivation of it."</p>
                  <p>In caſe of ſeparation ſays the Dean of Glouceſter, "The ceaſing of the payment of bounties on certain colony productions will be another great ſaving, perhaps not leſs than £200,000 a year: and it is very remarkable, that the goods imported from the colonies in conſequence of theſe bounties, could not have been imported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any other part of Europe, were there a liberty to do it; becauſe the freight and firſt coſt would have amounted to more than they could be ſold for; ſo that in fact, we give premiums to the colonies for ſelling goods to us, which would not have been ſold at all, any where elſe."</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, evident beyond a diſpute it is, that were we independent of Great Britain, it were our intereſt to carry a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of our produce to her without <hi>bounties,</hi> and receive from that kingdom
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:043001_0128_101CC34D982E1040"/>
18 twentieths of the articles we now take from her. It will be ſaid, if this is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted why doth Great Britain annually expend 3 or 400,000 ſterling to keep armies and navies in America, and at this time appear ſo willing to recover our allegiance. With the utmoſt deference to the Dean of Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter, I humbly imagine, that our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would endanger the Weſt Indies, according to the preſent ſyſtem of infinite conſequence to Great Britain, and the other powers of Europe. I again repeat, that were we independent, the Princes of Europe, by enacting perſecutive laws to reſtrain their ſubjects in Europe would only increaſe the evil, ſince every one knows that perſecution eternally defeats its own purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, that this event would encourage many emigrants from Europe, incited as well by the natural levity of mankind, as the hopes of one day viſiting Mexico. The event we now deſcribe is doubtleſs a principal motive, which prevents Britain from diſolving the connection. Perhaps American independence if effected at this juncture, might afford materials to light the torch of republicaniſm ſo powerfully in Britain, as to deſtroy the monarchy. But ſome may reply, are not ſuch future proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of grandeur ſufficient inducements for
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:043001_0129_101CC3504267FF50"/>
independence: I reply, that they are not, even could we effect it, without wading through ſeas of blood. Every ſenſible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will acknowlege, that a well regulated connection with Britain, will afford us more real happineſs, than independence, ſupported at an intolerable expence of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and perhaps of blood. Without doubt, a happy mediocrity is preferable to a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, tho' brilliant condition; as we have partly remarked in the inſtance of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern Rome.</p>
                  <p>In Plain Truth, we obſerved, that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, or a democratical government would ſoon give way to a military ſyſtem impoſed on the colonies, by ſome Cromwell of our armies. I am not ignorant that ſuch uſurpation would not take place, while our virtuous citizen, General Waſhington com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. But let us remember, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whoſe turbulent ambition, and extenſive talents would enable him to erect a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is perhaps at preſent a ſubaltern; whoſe talents I ſay, for war, &amp;c. gradually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding will prompt, and enable him to ruin his country. To illuſtrate this ſimple truth, let us tranſiently view the late civil wars. When the patriots of thoſe days virtuouſly endeavoured to reſtrain preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and aſcertain liberty; they raiſed armies
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:043001_0130_101CA6B7B418DA60"/>
for that noble purpoſe ONLY: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of which, were given to the Earl of Eſſex, Lord Fairfax, and other preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as truly virtuous, as any men then on earth. It is notorious that thoſe leaders, as well as every virtuous patriot in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, reprobated the thought of deſtroying that conſtitution, which they ſo often bled to defend. At the commencement of thoſe unhappy times, Cromwell poſſeſſed of no fortune, ſcarcely ranked as a field officer. This execrable hypocrite, poſſeſſing exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive military talents, and a moſt perfect knowlege of mankind, ſaw with pleaſure, that ſoldiers accuſtomed to a life of every ſpecies of diſſipation, would not willingly return to their ploughs, looms, &amp;c. He alſo knew, that nine tenths of his officers, being a ſort of Demi-Gentry, (if I may ſo expreſs myſelf) had ſtill a ſtronger averſion to reſign their faſtidious profeſſion (unhappily for mankind) more pleaſing than their former peaceable departments. Cromwell, and his congenial aſſociates, by degrees acquainted the ſoldiers with their real ſtrength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. It muſt alſo be confeſſed, that in ſuch unhappy times, victorious ſoldiers are very readily tutored by a Cromwell, Caeſar, Pompey, or an Octavius. The Earl of
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:043001_0131_101CC353ED554150"/>
Eſſex, Lord Fairfax and others, as we have already remarked, of the moſt approved patriotiſm and virtue, diſdaining to enſlave their country, and ſcorning to command thoſe military hypocrites, were ſucceeded by Cromwell, whoſe crimes and tyranny it were ſuperfluous to enumerate. In ſhort, virtuous generals do not ſuit ſoldiers, who are determined to enſlave their country: The ſame cauſes ever produce the ſame effects. Hawks were ever birds of prey; AND MEN WILL STILL BE MEN.</p>
                  <p>The elegant Ferguſon remarks, "that a ſpecious government may be formed on paper, which in execution may prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely arbitrary." Let us however ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe fix of the firſt ſages of antiquity, and join with them the moſt reſpectable names of our times, and in this venerable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, let Trajan, who was the beſt qualified to do honor to human nature, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the divinity on earth: I ſay, let the almoſt divine Trajan preſide in this auguſt Aſſembly, who, in the hours of calm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, are to form a democratical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for us. In theory, perfect as ſuch government would ſeem, let us not delude ourſelves, by ſuppoſing it would long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unconvulſed by ambitious men ſtriving to lord it over their equals. Let us remember the dangerous influence obtained by dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:043001_0132_101CC35685929ED8"/>
in every age, debauching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people. Suppoſe a dangerous war, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic or foreign, victoriouſly terminated by an able general. He is adored as well by the people, as the ſoldiery; if his abilities equal his fortune, what may not he then effect? Innumerable are the ways to accompliſh his ambitious purpoſes. Hiſtory affords him too many examples to pervert the laws of his country. Our ambitious general impels his emiſſaries in the ſenate, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote unjuſt wars, laws, and taxes, to deſtroy, their unhappy country. The wretched peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, worn out, and toſſed in ſeas of anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and ſedition, at length gladly repoſe in the ſhade of arbitrary ſway, where they are ſure to find themſelves no leſs wretched.</p>
                  <p>It is a melancholy truth that ſuch as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude mankind conſtantly repreſent our race infinitely more perfect than they really are. This hackneyed expedient enables them ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to inveigh againſt the beſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on earth: Too many of the human race give into the ſnare, forgetting that mankind, according to SOLON, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring experience of ages, can BEAR none other than imperfect laws.</p>
                  <p>Let us remember that the Chineſe, the moſt ancient reſpectable and poliſhed people on earth, have at LEAST for 4000 years been governed by Monarchs. Yet ſurely the arbitrary government of China cannot be placed in competition with our happy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited government. I finally aſk the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:043001_0133_101CA6B62CBE5498"/>
of the pamphlet called Common Senſe if all the moments of eaſe peace and liberty could be ſelected and united which democracies have enjoyed from the origin of government until this hour, would they equal that portion of felicity enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Chineſe during the <hi>reign only</hi> of one of their princes? Impelled by exalted truth, we anſwer in the negative.

And will they not forever bluſh to have ſaid that ſuch a miſerable production as the pamphlet in queſtion was unanſwerable?</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, let us remember, that by our connection with Great Britain, we have been the happieſt people on earth, and by a juſt agreement with her we may long continue ſo. Let us diſpaſſionately conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in a connection with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we may poſſeſs all the ROSES of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, without being curſed with its innumerable THORNS.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall take little notice of the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent abuſe with which the Appendix writer impotently beſpatters the reſpectable people, called Quakers.

there is <hi>no virtue</hi> or moral duty, but what with facility may be refined away, if we indulge a falſe philoſophy, ſifting and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinizing by every captious rule of logic, &amp;c. In this ſort of logic lies our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's fort. Speaking of their virtuous teſtimony, he has the following words, "it tends to the decreaſe and reproach of all religion whatever, &amp;c." Need I remark, that his aſſertion is the moſt impudent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of language that ever diſgraced the Preſs, or ever polluted paper.</p>
                  <p>The conduct and morals of this moſt reſpectable ſociety, is their defence, and I hope will ever as effectually protect them, as they have benefitted <hi>their province of Pennſylvania,</hi> and adorned mankind by their excellent example. We muſt confeſs that the advancement of the adjoining middle colonies in induſtry and morality, was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally owing to the very laudable and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful example of thoſe real practicers of chriſtianity. This honeſt truth is dictated in gratitude for the ſignal bleſſings derived to the community at large in the virtuous example of thoſe induſtrious and peaceable moraliſts. Utterly unconnected with any of the ſociety is the writer, who is poſſeſſed of property, and if he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, of a natural independence of ſpirit. He execrates flattery as ardently as he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates truth. He therefore hopes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will peruſe Voltaire, and other celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted authors on the ſubject of this eſtimable
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:043001_0135_101CC35D5EC24098"/>
ſociety. This philoſoher treating of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeems to forget that he is writing the hiſtory of mankind, which according to him is almoſt a continued ſucceſſion of crimes. Were not the facts as modern as notorious, we might imagine he is ſpeaking of beings ſuperior to men.</p>
                  <p>According to Voltaire, "they began by making a league with the Indians their neighbours. It is the ONLY TREATY be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe people and the chriſtians which was not confirmed by OATH, and which has not been BROKEN or INFRINGED. The original inhabitants inſtead of flying into their foreſts, inſenſibly accuſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the peaceable Quakers. As much as they deteſted the other CHRIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN DESTROYERS and conquerors of America, as much did they LOVE theſe new comers. In a little time, thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſavages charmed with their new neighbours, came in crouds to requeſt WILLIAM PENN to receive them in the number of his vaſſals. It was a ſpectacle entirely new—A ſovereign whom all the world thee'd and thou'd, and addreſſed with their heads covered, a government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prieſts, a people without arms, citizens all equal, except in magiſtracy, and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without jealouſy. WILLIAM PENN might have boaſted of bringing on earth the golden age of which ſo much has been ſaid, and which probably never exiſted but in PENNSYLVANIA." We cannot indeed
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:043001_0136_101CC360049504F8"/>
view this pleaſing happy picture of morality, without receiving as much pleaſure, as we do grief, from his narration of the horrid civil wars in the firſt Charles's time: Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating all the ever deteſtable acts of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natics, and military hypocrites of that age, he ſays they perpetrated all their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions while they were SEEKING THE LORD.</p>
                  <p>I believe I have proved that we have not numbers nor wealth to ſupport a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble army for a length of time, and that we have not the moſt diſtant proſpect of foreign aid. Evident it is beyond a diſpute, that we cannot in our days conſtruct a navy to raiſe us to independence, or protect our trade—I therefore hope we ſhall not be ſo dazzled by falſe views of grandeur, as to reject honourable terms, and ruſh to aſſured deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>I have remarked, that the event of which ſome perſons ſeem ſo paſſionately fond, may in the fulneſs of time be naturally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, without coſting one drop of blood to Britain, or our deſcendants. If ſuch event, by the misfortunes or concurrence of Great Britain could be immediately effected, it would indeed plunge us into inextricable difficulties. Many weighty conſiderations might be offered in ſupport of this allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuffice it at preſent to remark that we are not arrived at ſufficient maturity for this important event. Let us view matters through a ſerene medium, and not through
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:043001_0137_101CC362A25DDA00"/>
a glare of deceitful paſſions. Let us not then put bridles into our mouths, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ambitious men to ride us to ruin.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion, perhaps it may not be amiſs to remind the public, that great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots have more than once been caught nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. Let us hear what the Dean of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter ſays on this head.</p>
                  <p>"When the duty on ſtamps was firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Americans made as little objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it, as could be expected to be made to any new tax whatever. Nay, ſeveral of their popular orators and leaders uſed conſiderable intereſt to be employed as agents in the diſtribution of theſe ſtamps: and one among the reſt, whom I NEED NOT NAME, was more than ordinary aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his application on this head: ſo that had the act paſſed within the uſual time, inſtead of being a flaming American patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, he would probably have acted the part of a tax-gatherer and an American publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. But when the outs and the pouters on this ſide the water, ſaw the advantage which the miniſter gave them by a whole year's delay, they eagerly ſeiſed the opportunity; emiſſaries and agents were diſpatched into all quarters; the newſpapers were filled with invectives againſt the new intended tax. It was injudicious! it was ill-timed! oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive! tyrannical! and every thing that was bad! Letters upon letters were wrote to America to excite the people to aſſociate, to remonſtrate, and even to revolt. The
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:043001_0138_101CC36585CD4A60"/>
moſt ample promiſes were made from hence of giving them all the aſſiſtance which fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and clamour, and mock-patriotiſm, could muſter up. And then it was that this very man, this ſelf intended publican, changed ſides, and commenced a zealous patriot. Then he appeared at the bar of the houſe of commons to cry down that very meaſure which he himſelf had eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then as the avenging Angel of America.</p>
                  <l>He rode in the whirlwind to direct the Storm."</l>
                  <p>Even ſincere Patriots are fallible, and at ſome periods, do not ſee the true intereſts of their country, in the cleareſt light. Thoſe who wiſh to underſtand the true intereſt of America would reap uſeful knowledge, by peruſing the pamphlet from which the laſt paragraph is extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is entitled, "The true intereſt of Great-Britain, ſet forth in regard to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; and the only means of living in peace and harmony with them; in which are included FIVE different PLANS for effecting this deſirable purpoſe. By Joſiah Tucker, D. D. Dean of Gloceſter.</p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning this piece, becauſe I am perſuaded (notwithſtanding the miniſterial attempts to ruin this Country) that the intereſt of Britain and America are ſo nearly related, and their commercial felicity ſo dependent upon reciprocality of kindneſſes to each other, THAT HONORABLE CONNECTIONS,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:043001_0139_101CC3693A154B10"/>
AND POLITICAL HAPPINESS, ARE SYNONYMOUS TERMS.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, let us remember, that reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation on generous principles with Great Britain, is our true and only road to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent happineſs. Above all, let us ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, that this (when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners arrive to treat with the Congreſs) is the juncture, this the moment, when we may receive every thing we can reaſonably deſire.</p>
                  <p>I conclude theſe remarks, by obſerving, that if they are founded in truth, they will inſtruct you to keep a good look out, that ye may not be ſurprized into AMERICAN INDEPENDENCY; without a thorough examination, both of it, and its conſequences.</p>
