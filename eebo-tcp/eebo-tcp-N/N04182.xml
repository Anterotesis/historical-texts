            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IF the following</hi> Treatise <hi>is, in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Measure, adapted to serve the Ends of Religion, by guarding People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the</hi> Errors in Doctrine, <hi>and</hi> Disorders in Practice, <hi>which have, of late, obtain'd in many Parts of the Land, there can be no need of an Apology for its</hi> Publication: <hi>If it is not, the usual Excuses upon such an Occasion are well known; and I may claim the Benefit of them, in common with others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Instead therefore of saying any Thing upon this Head, I shall look back to the first Times of this Country, when there was the Prevalence of an</hi> erroneous, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastic <hi>Spirit, beyond what has been known from that Day 'till the late</hi> Appearance, <hi>in some Places, in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND: <hi>And I the rather chuse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert here some brief Account of the</hi> religious State <hi>of Affairs in</hi> those Days, <hi>because of its surprising Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in many Instances, with what has happened in</hi> these Times; <hi>which, if duly attended to, will not only prepare the</hi> Reader <hi>for what he may meet with in the following Sheets, but powerfully tend to undeceive him, if he has entertain'd a good Opinion of such Things as have, once already, raised Disturbances in the Country, to the Grief of our</hi> first Fathers, <hi>who
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005151_0003_1016C614A1111680"/>
may justly be rank'd among the most pious and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Men, who have yet liv'd in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Not many Years after the Settlement of our</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors <hi>in this Land, some, who, through an Excess of Heat in their Imaginations, had been betrayed into various unsound and dangerous Opinions, came over to them from</hi> ENGLAND. <hi>They had not been here long, before they freely vented their Notions among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Multitudes of whom, both Men and Women, Church-members and others, were soon led aside, to the Hindrance of the Gospel, and throwing these Churches into great Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My purpose is to show distinctly, though briefly,</hi>
            </p>

And this Opinion of them was the more lifted up, through the Simplicity and Weakness of their Followers, who would, in Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them, tell others, that, since the</hi> Apostle's <hi>Time, they were perswaded, none ever received</hi> so much Light from GOD, as such and such had done, naming their Leaders.</p>

that</hi> many declined hearing them, though they were Members of their Churches; <hi>and others that did hear, were so</hi> filled with Prejudice that they profited not, but studied how to object against them, and censure their Doctrine, <hi>which (whilst they stood right) was wont to make their Hearts to melt and tremble.

She had discovered some of her Opinions in the Ship as she came over, which occasion'd some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay of her Admission, when she first desir'd Fellowship with the Church of</hi> BOSTON; <hi>but by colouring her Opinions, she got admitted into the Church, and som went to Work; and being a Woman very helpful in the Times of Child-Birth, and other Occasions of bodily Infirmities, and well-furnish'd with Means for those Purposes, she easily insinuated her self into the Affections of many; and the rather, because she was very inquisitive about their spiritual Estates, and in discovering to them the Danger they were in by trusting to common Gifts and Graces, without any such</hi> Witness <hi>of the SPIRIT as the Scripture holds out for a full Evidence;—all which was well, and suted with the</hi> public Ministry: <hi>But when she had thus prepared the Way by such wholsome Truths, then she began to set forth her own Stuff, and taught, that</hi> no Sanctification was any Evidence of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, <hi>except their</hi> Justification <hi>were first cleared up to them by the</hi> immediate Witness of the SPIRIT; <hi>and that to see any</hi> Work of Grace <hi>(either Faith or

Repentance, &amp;c. ) before this</hi> immediate Witness <hi>was a Covenant of Works: Whereupon many good Souls, that had been of long-approv'd Holiness, were brought to</hi> renounce all the Work of Grace in them, and to wait for this immediate Revelation. <hi>Then sprung up also the Opinion of the</hi> indwelling of the Person of the HOLY GHOST, and of Union with CHRIST, and Justification before Faith, and a denying of any Gifts or Graces, or inherent Qualifications; and that CHRIST was all, and did all, and that the Soul remained always as a dead Organ, <hi>and other gross Errors.—It was indeed a Wonder, upon what a sudden the whole Church of</hi> BOSTON <hi>(some few excepted) were become her new Converts and infected with her Opinions: And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny also out of the Church, and of other Churches, yea, many profane Persons became of her Opinion; for it was a very easy and acceptable Way to Heaven, to see nothing, to have nothing, but to wait for</hi> CHRIST <hi>to do all. After she had thus prevail'd, and drawn some of eminent Place and Parts to her Party, she kept open House for all Comers, and set up</hi> two Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Days <hi>in the Week, when there usually met at her House threescore or fourscore Persons. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was to repeat Sermons; but when that was done, she would comment upon the Doctrines, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret all Passages at her Pleasure, and expound dark Places of Scripture, so as whatsoever the</hi> Letter <hi>held forth (for this was one of her Tenets,</hi> that the whole Scripture in the Letter of it held forth nothing but a Covenant of Works) <hi>she would be sure to make it serve her Turn, for the confirming her main Principles, whereof this was another,</hi> that the darker our Sanctification is, the clearer is our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>And indeed most of her Tenets tended to Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and quench all Endeavours in the Creature.

                  <hi>Now, you might have heard one of them preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most dangerous Sermon, in a great Assembly, when he divided the whole Country into two Ranks, some (that were of his Opinion) under a</hi> Covenant of Grace, <hi>and those were</hi> Friends to CHRIST; <hi>others, under a</hi> Covenant of Works, <hi>whom they might know by this, if they</hi> evidence their good Estate by their Sanctification: <hi>Those (said he) were</hi> ENEMIES TO CHRIST, HE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RODS, PILATES, SCRIBES <hi>and</hi> PHARISEES; <hi>yea,</hi> ANTICHRISTS: <hi>And advis'd all under a</hi> Covenant of Grace <hi>to look upon them as such, and did with great Zeal stimulate them to deal with them as they would with such; and withall alledging the Story of</hi> MOSES <hi>that killed the</hi> EGYPTIAN, <hi>barely left it so.

breathing in them, our Hearts sadded, and our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits tired, we sighed and groaned to Heaven, we humbled our Souls by Prayer and Fasting that the LORD would find out, and bless some Means and Ways for the Cure of this Sore, and deliver his Truth and our selves from this heavy Bondage: Which, when his own Time was come, he hearkened unto, and in infinite Mercy looked upon our Sorrows, and did, in a wonderful Manner, beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, free us by these Means following.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He stirred up all the</hi> Minister's <hi>Spirits, in the Country, to preach against those</hi> Errors, <hi>and</hi> Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, <hi>that so much pestered the Country, to inform, to confute, to rebuke, &amp;c. thereby to cure those that were diseased already, and to give Antidotes to the rest, to preserve them from Infection: And tho' this Ordinance went not without its appointed Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in the</hi> latter <hi>Respect; yet, we found it not so effectual for the driving away of this Infection as we desired, for they (most of them) hardened their Faces, and bent their Wits to oppose, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm themselves in their Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>We spent much Time and Strength in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with them, sometimes in private before the</hi> Elders <hi>only, sometimes in our</hi> public Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>for all Comers; many, very many Hours, and half Days together we spent therein, to see if any Means might prevail. We gave them free Leave, with all Lenity and Patience, to lay down what they could say for their</hi> Opinions, <hi>and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered them from Point to Point, and then brought clear Arguments from evident Scriptures against them, and put them to answer Things, even until they were oftentimes brought to be either silent, or

driven to deny common Principles, or shuffle off plain Scripture; and yet, (such was their Pride and Hardness of Heart, that) they would not yield to the Truth, but did tell us they would take Time to consider of our Arguments: And, in the mean Time, meeting with their Abetters, strengthened themselves again in their old Way, that when we dealt with them next Time, we found them further off than before, so that our Hopes began to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of reducing them by private Means.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The last Stroke that slew the Opinions, was the</hi> falling away of their Leaders. (1.) <hi>Into more hideous, and Soul-destroying</hi> Delusions, <hi>which ruin, indeed, all Religion; as, that the Souls of Men are mortal like the</hi> Beasts; <hi>that there is no such Thing as</hi> inherent Righteousness; <hi>that these</hi> Bodies <hi>of ours shall not</hi> rise <hi>again; that their own</hi> Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of particular Events were as</hi> infallible as the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (2.) <hi>They grew also (many of them) very</hi> loose, <hi>and</hi> degenerate <hi>in their</hi> Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices <hi>(for these Opinions will certainly produce a filthy Life by Degrees); as</hi> no Prayer in their Families, no Sabbath, insufferable Pride, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and hideous Lying; <hi>diverse of them being proved guilty, some of five, others of ten gross Lies: Another falling into a Lie, GOD smote him in the very Act, that he sunk down into a deep Swound, and being by hot Waters recovered, and coming to himself, said Oh GOD, thou mightest have struck me dead, as</hi> ANANIAS <hi>and</hi> SAPPHIRA, <hi>for I have maintained a</hi> Lie. <hi>Mrs.—and others cast out of the Church for</hi> Lying; <hi>and some guilty of</hi> FOULER SINS <hi>than all these, which I here name not.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>These Things exceedingly amazed their Followers, (especially such as were led a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

of their Hearts, as many were) and now they began to see that they were deluded by them.—Now no Man could lay more upon them than they would upon themselves, in their Acknowledgements. Many, after this, came to us, who before fled from us, with such Desires as those, Acts</hi> 2. Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, What shall we do? <hi>And did willingly take Shame to themselves, in the open Assemblies, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing (some of them with many Tears) how they had given Offence to the LORD, and his People, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Truth, and being led by a Spirit of Error, their Alienation from their Brethren in their Affections, and their crooked and perverse walking in Contempt of Authority, slighting the Churches, and despising the Counsel of their godly Teachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now they would freely discover the Sleights the Adversaries had used to undermine them by, and steal away their Eyes from the Truth, and their Brethren, which before (whilst their Eyes were seal'd) they could not see. And the Fruit of this was great Praise to the LORD, who had thus wonderfully bro't the Matter about; Gladness in all our Hearts and Faces, and Expressions of our renewed Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by receiving them again into our Bosom: And from that Time until now they have walk'd (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their renewed Covenants) humbly and loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among us, holding forth Truth and Peace with Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But from the rest, who (notwithstanding all these Means of Conviction) yet stood obdurate, yea, more hardned (as we had Reason to fear) than before, we convented those of them that were Members before the Churches, and yet labour'd once and again to convince them, not only of their</hi> Errors, <hi>but also of sundry</hi> exorbitant Practices <hi>which they had
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:005151_0024_1016C657E0A49140"/>
fallen into, as manifest Pride, Contempt of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, neglecting to hear the Church, and lying &amp;c: But after no Means prevail'd, we were driven with sad Hearts to give them up to Satan; yet not</hi> simply for their Opinions <hi>(for which I find we have been slanderously traduced), but the chiefest Cause of their Censure, was their</hi> Miscarriages <hi>persisted in with great Obstinacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus the LORD heard our Groans to Heaven, and freed us from this great and sore Affliction, which first was small, like</hi> ELIAS'S <hi>Cloud, but after spread the Heavens; and hath given the Churches rest from this Disturbance ever since, that we know none that lifts up his Head to disturb our sweet Peace, in any of the Churches of CHRIST among us: Blessed be his Name.</hi>

And if People a few Years since, had generally known what had befallen the Country, in its Beginnings, it would have been, I can't but think, a great Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative against the</hi> Errors <hi>and</hi> Disorders <hi>they have unhappily run into: Nor is it too late now to furnish them with some general History of this.—It may still be of Advantage, not only to guard those who are not as yet infected, but to check the Growth of our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; especially, if due Attendance is given to the</hi> Means <hi>and</hi> Methods <hi>used by our Fathers, when the Churches, in their Day, were in Danger.—Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spoken of under all the Names of Ignominy and Contempt did not affrighten them from Duty; no, but they appeared, notwithstanding, bold in the Cause of</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> good Order, <hi>against all Opposition:

Faith, <hi>have spoken in much the same Language, upon the Things now in Agitation, with those who have been called</hi> Opposers of the Work of GOD, <hi>and charg'd with</hi> leading Souls to Hell: <hi>And I was in Hopes, what they said might be regarded, if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was poured upon what I offered in my own Words.

Some of the Language, in here and there a Paper I have made use of, I own, is harsh; and should have been altered, had it been in my Power to have done it.

My Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Times, I have freely offered, from the Beginning, in several Sermons, which have been made publick; and if, instead of secretly</hi> whispering <hi>to my Disadvantage, any, by the Way of the</hi> Press, <hi>or</hi> private Conference, <hi>had endeavoured to show me wherein I have delivered any Thing dishonorary to the Cause of Religion, I should have esteemed it a Kindness.—I hope I have all along aim'd at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Truth and Holiness: This is the View I profess to write with at present; and if I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced that which has a contrary Tendency, I should be glad to be convinced of it, that I might make an</hi> open Retraction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I expect to be further loaded with</hi> ill Names: <hi>And so far as this may tend to render me less useful to those I would be glad to serve, I shall be sorry: But otherwise, 'tis with me a</hi> small Matter to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Man's Judgment: <hi>Nor shall I regard the little Squibs that may be thrown at me by those, who think the Cause of Truth will be better serv'd by</hi> rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>than</hi> arguing. <hi>I shall not mispend my Time to take Notice of what may be said by such; but if any will be at the Pains to give what I have offered the public a fair and Christian Examination, I shall think myself obliged to make them some sutable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</hi>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ONE of the <hi>first Fathers</hi> of this Country, the memorable SHEPARD (whose <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> have been, of late so highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended) thought it needful to caution People,<note n="*" place="bottom">See his <hi>Parable of the Ten Virgins,</hi> second Part, Page 61.</note> 
               <q>not to trust Men too far, nor boast of any Man too much; especially, in Regard of his glorious <hi>Profession</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> at <hi>first.</hi> GOD (says he) sends divers of his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to a Place; and many, at first hearing, are wrought upon, battered down, convinc'd, mourning after Peace, going to Ministers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Ordinances: Now many bless GOD for their <hi>Conversion;</hi> and many a Christian is put out of Doubt of it, Parents of their Children, and Children of their Parents; one Brother of another, and one Christian Neighbour of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—O take Heed of boasting too much! It may be they may, and will fall down (before they have liv'd many Years) when at their Height. What Man was ever more sought unto, than JOHN? All JUDEA came unto him; yet, at last they forsake him, rejoiced but a Season in his Light: They went also from him to CHRIST, (John 7. 26. 32.) yet, JOHN complains, none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Testimony. CHRIST himself preached
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005151_0049_1016C6AD3A29FFD8"/>
in CAPERNAUM, and never such <hi>exalting</hi> a Man: They <hi>boasted</hi> in him: Yet only a few Babes which the LORD wrought upon. The GALATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS would loose their Eyes for PAUL; yet, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they slight him, and join with false Teachers against him. O therefore pray for them, and weep for them, but do not trust them too far! Neither trust yourselves too much. <hi>Then are ye my Disciples,</hi> (Joh. 8. 31.) <hi>if ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.</hi> DEMAS forsakes PAUL: All in <hi>Asia</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Had this observable Caution been the Product of a <hi>Spirit of Prophesy,</hi> I can searce see, how it could, in a more pointed Manner, have admonished us in these Days. There never was a Time, in this Land, wherein there was such flocking after <hi>some particular Ministers,</hi> and <hi>glorying</hi> in them, as though they were GODS rather than <hi>Men;</hi> never a Time, wherein Men's <hi>Professions</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> rose high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; never a Time, wherein <hi>Conversions, numerous</hi> Conversions were so much boasted of: Would to GOD, there was no Reason to suspect the Truth of any one of them! But it ought always to be remembred, there may be a <hi>very specious Shew,</hi> where there is not the <hi>Substance</hi> of Religion: Nor are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons without Danger of resting in the <hi>former,</hi> to the Neglect of the <hi>latter:</hi> And, it may be feared, whether this Danger han't been greatly increased, while so many have been encouraged to look upon themselves as in a <hi>State of Grace,</hi> without that Proof of the <hi>Reality</hi> of their <hi>Conversion,</hi> which might reasonably be expected. There has certainly been too much <hi>Haste,</hi> as well as <hi>Positiveness,</hi> in declaring these and those, in this and the other Place, to have <hi>passed from Death to Life:</hi> A Judgment has been too commonly formed of Men's <hi>spiritual</hi> Condition,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005151_0050_1016C6B215574D78"/>
more from their <hi>Affections,</hi> than the <hi>permanent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> of their Minds discovered in the habitual <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct</hi> of their Lives; not duly considering, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious that Religion must be, which has its <hi>Rise</hi> from the <hi>Passions,</hi> and not any <hi>thorow Change</hi> in the <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much, I am sensible, has been said, in these Days, of <hi>a Work of GOD</hi> going on in the Land: And I trust, this has all along been the Case with this People, from the Days of our <hi>Fathers:</hi> And I doubt not, 'tis so now; nay, I charitably hope, there have been more <hi>numerous</hi> Instances of <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conversion,</hi> in the Years past, than usual: But must it not be said, at the same Time, that there have been <hi>more Disorders</hi> and <hi>greater Extravagances,</hi> than common: And what is of still more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Tendency, han't the great Talk of a <hi>Revival of Religion</hi> arisen <hi>more</hi> from the <hi>general Appearance of some Extraordinaries,</hi> (which there may be where there is not the <hi>Power of Godliness</hi>) than form such Things as are <hi>sure Evidences</hi> of a <hi>real Work of</hi> GOD in Men's Hearts? I am clearly satisfied, this is the Truth of the Case, however unwilling some may be to own it.</p>
            <p>Nor have People been so plainly and faithfully taught, as it were to be wisht, what a <hi>Work of GOD is,</hi> or how to distinguish between those Things which are undoubted Marks of <hi>such a Work,</hi> and those which are not. They have often been told of <hi>the glorious Work of GOD; his Work,</hi> so as was never before seen in our <hi>own,</hi> or <hi>Father'</hi> s Days.</p>
            <p>But have they not been too much left to think, as if the Thing hereby intended was, the late <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Appearance,</hi> taken in the <hi>Gross?</hi> This, I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005151_0051_1016C6B3A7EAEAF8"/>
believe, is the <hi>Idea</hi> Multitudes have of what is called, <hi>the Work of GOD going on in the Land;</hi> which, if it be, they certainly include that in their Notion of <hi>GOD's Work,</hi> which is highly dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to him: Nor is it any Wonder, if, from this mistaken Tho't of what is truly the <hi>Work of</hi> GOD, they should speak of those as its OPPOSERS, who are its greatest FRIENDS; and have proved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so, by their Endeavours to discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance such Things as are dangerous to Men's Souls, and may prove a Hindrance to the Progress of <hi>real Religion.</hi> People must have in their Minds some distinct Conception of the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Work of GOD, or they will act in the Dark, while they embrace <hi>these</hi> as the <hi>Friends</hi> of it, and stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loof from <hi>those</hi> as its <hi>Enemies:</hi> They will, in this Case, neither know what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>
            <p>What I propose therefore, by way of <hi>Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> is, to exhibit, in as brief a Manner as I can, a distinct and clear Idea of a <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> with the <hi>Appearance</hi> it will make; especially, when it is <hi>remarkable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in a Sense, every Thing that comes to pass, may be call'd the <hi>Work of GOD;</hi> for as our SAVIOUR said to his Disciples,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>A Sparrow shall not fall to the Ground without your Father: The very Hairs of your Head are all number'd.</hi> All <hi>great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> in Providence, whether in a Way of <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> are more especially the <hi>Work of GOD;</hi> according to that,<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005151_0052_1016C6B6E2E8A158"/>
are still more eminently the <hi>Works of GOD,</hi> and always so spoken of in the Oracles of Truth. But the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> here intended, is the same with that, concerning which our SAVIOUR says,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> 6. 29.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Work of GOD, that ye believe on him whom GOD hath sent:</hi> 'Tis the same with that, of which the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, when he affirms,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 3.</note> that <hi>he who hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; and which he calls,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The Work of Faith with Power:</hi> 'Tis in one Word, That <hi>Work of divine Grace,</hi> which is sometimes, called the <hi>New-Creation;</hi> sometimes the <hi>New-Birth;</hi> sometimes the <hi>Spirit's Renovation;</hi> sometimes <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> or as 'tis otherwise express'd, a being <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Sin and Satan unto GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me observe the following Things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>Work of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First</hi> of all, There is <hi>ordinarily</hi> some Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Mind of Sinners, previous to it. This is call'd by Divines <hi>Conviction;</hi> by which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in a Way agreeable to the Nature of Man, he opens to the Sinner a View of himself, in his <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> and <hi>Guilt:</hi> upon which, he is driven out of his former Ease, and fill'd with Anxiety and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress. This inward Disturbance may, as to its Degree, be various in different Persons; but there is the <hi>Reality</hi> of it in all: In all, I mean, who have come to Years, before they have had awakened in them serious Thoughts of their Souls, and another World: In respect of this Kind of Persons, &amp; those among them in <hi>special</hi> who have not been under
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005151_0053_1016C6B89792CA40"/>
Restraints from Sin, but have accustomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to do Evil, 'tis rare, if ever, that the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> is wrought in them, but their Consciences are first alarmed, and their Hearts fill'd with bitter Remorse for their past Follies.</p>
            <p>But then, it may be worth a particular Remark, this <hi>Preparation of Mind,</hi> is not the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> in the <hi>special</hi> and distinguishing Sense; in such a Sense, as that the <hi>Subjects</hi> of it may be thought to be in a State of Salvation. <hi>Hypocrites in Zion</hi> may say, <hi>Who among us can dwell with devouring Fire?</hi> And they may be Hypocrites still: Nor is the greatest Disquietude of Soul; a Disquietude expressing itself in <hi>Roarings,</hi> or <hi>Tremblings,</hi> or the <hi>strangest bodily Effects,</hi> a sufficient Evidence of a <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Work of Grace;</hi> yea, it may be nothing more than the Effect of <hi>Nature;</hi> or, if it should, in the Beginning, arise from a <hi>divine Influence,</hi> 'tis yet a <hi>Mark</hi> of a converted State that may not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on. Persons, notwithstanding all this, may be under Condemnation, and finally doom'd to a Departure from CHRIST with the Workers of Iniquity.</p>
            <p>It may be nextly said, This <hi>Work of GOD</hi> is a <hi>Secret</hi> Thing; a Work <hi>within</hi> Men; a Work ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in the <hi>inward</hi> Frame of their Mind. It <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> lies in a <hi>new Heart, another Soul;</hi> in other Views and Intentions, other Thoughts and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, other Principles and Springs of Action: All which Things are hidden, out of the Sight of the World.</p>
            <p>From whence it follows, by the Way, that the <hi>Work of God,</hi> as an <hi>internal</hi> Thing, can be judged of by others, only from the <hi>outward</hi> Discoveries of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005151_0054_1016C6C14CC0BD70"/>
it. One Man can't look into the Heart of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This is the Prerogative of him who has said,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>I am he that searcheth the Heart, and trieth the Reins of the Children of Men.</hi> If therefore we would judge of the <hi>interior</hi> State of <hi>others,</hi> we must do it from some <hi>external Manifestations</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Men may open to us the Temper of their Minds, in a Relation of their <hi>Experiences:</hi> But even here, we are liable to be deceived. They may be mistaken about their own State; and what is worse, may represent Things different from what they really are: so that at the best we only judge in this Case upon Supposition. And as there is so much Hypocrisy in the World, it would be but Prudence to hear Men's Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, respecting themselves with a heedful Caution. It may perhaps be a Truth here, as well as in other Cases, <hi>Actions</hi> speak much louder than <hi>Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this therefore is another Way, in which Men may disclose what is <hi>within</hi> them; and 'tis the great <hi>Gospel Rule</hi> by which we are to govern our <hi>practical</hi> Sentiments one of another. Says our SAVIOUR,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>By their Fruits ye shall know them? Do Men gather Grapes of Thorns? Or Figs of Thistles? Even, so every good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit: but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit. A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; neither can a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</hi> Agreeable whereto are those Words,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 33, 35.</note> 
               <hi>Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good; or else make the Tree corrupt, and the Fruit corrupt: For the Tree is known by his Fruit.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005151_0055_1016C6C2EC387EE0"/>
—A good Man, out of the good Treasure of his Heart, bringeth forth good Things; and an evil Man, out <hi rend="sup">c</hi> the evil Treasure, bringeth forth evil Things.</hi> 'Tis true, this is not an infallible Rule; nor did our SAVIOUR ever intend to give us one: This would anticipate the <hi>last Judgment,</hi> or render it needless; for <hi>Men's States</hi> would be known beforehand.</p>
            <p>It may be further noted, <hi>this Work of GOD</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> at <hi>all Times,</hi> and in <hi>all Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mean not that the <hi>Instruments, Means,</hi> or <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> of it's Production, are always alike. There has commonly been a great <hi>Diversity</hi> here, as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed best to the Wisdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, he has taken the Work very much into <hi>his own Hands,</hi> and sometimes he has made use of <hi>Instruments:</hi> And when this has been the Case, the <hi>Instruments</hi> he has chosen, have sometimes been <hi>more</hi> adapted to such a Design, and sometimes <hi>less</hi> so. i. e. to the Eye <hi>of Man's Wisdom;</hi> for in <hi>themselves,</hi> they have always been the <hi>best,</hi> and were we able to see clearly into the <hi>Reasons</hi> of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we should perceive them to be so: To be sure, they are never such as are in their <hi>own Nature</hi> unfit to be made use of.</p>
            <p>There has likewise ordinarily been a <hi>Variety</hi> as to the <hi>Means.</hi> Sometimes it has pleased GOD to make Use of <hi>one</hi> Means, and sometimes of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> sometimes the Means have been <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>extraordinary,</hi> as in the Days of MOSES and of CHRIST; and sometimes they have been of a <hi>more common</hi> Nature: And sometimes <hi>He</hi> may have accomplished the Work without any Means at all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:005151_0056_1016C6C50A528848"/>
And <hi>alike various</hi> has been the <hi>Manner,</hi> in which GOD has wrought upon the Minds of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Sometimes it has been in a Way of <hi>great Terror,</hi> and sometimes in the Methods of <hi>Mildness</hi> and <hi>Gentleness.</hi> Sometimes he has dealt so with them, that they could not but have a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>distinct Perception</hi> of his <hi>Operations in them;</hi> and sometimes he has formed them into a <hi>new Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship,</hi> in a more <hi>insensible,</hi> and variously inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Way.</p>
            <p>Neither do I mean, that this <hi>Work of GOD</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> in its <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Beauty</hi> in all; or that 'tis always wrought in the like Number of Instances, either in one Place, or another. There has always been an <hi>admirable Diversity</hi> in this Respect! Some have been made to partake of the <hi>divin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Nature</hi> in one Degree, others in another; sometimes a <hi>greater</hi> Number have appeared <hi>living Images</hi> of their Father in Heaven, sometimes a <hi>less.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to the <hi>Work,</hi> for <hi>Substance,</hi> 'tis the <hi>same</hi> in all <hi>Places,</hi> and among <hi>all People</hi> under Heaven. There may be a Variety as to the <hi>Circumstances, Degrees,</hi> and <hi>Appendages</hi> of it; but for the Thing it self, as to it's <hi>Essence,</hi> 'tis the <hi>very same</hi> all over the World; has been so from the Days of CHRIST; yea, from the Days of ADAM, and will be so to the End of the World. Very observable to our Purpose here, are the Words of the famous Dr. OWEN. Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Discourse of the Holy Spirit,</hi> P. 177, 178.</note> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Regeneration</hi> by the HOLY SPIRIT is the <hi>same Work</hi> for the <hi>Kind</hi> of it, and wrought by the same Power of the SPIRIT, in all that are regenerate, or ever were, or shall
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005151_0057_1016C6C6A20BBE78"/>
be so, from the Beginning of the World to the End thereof. <hi>Great Variety</hi> there is in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the <hi>outward Means;</hi>—nor can the <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> hereof be reduced unto any certain Order. For the SPIRIT worketh how, and when he pleaseth, following the sole Rule of his own Will and Wisdom.

It may be again remarkt, The <hi>Appearance</hi> of <hi>this Work</hi> of GOD, as well as the Work it self, is always the <hi>same.</hi> What I intend is, that the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> is ever of a <hi>like Kind</hi> and <hi>Nature.</hi> As the <hi>Instruments, Means, Circumstances</hi> and <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> may be different, so will be the <hi>Appearance</hi> as to these Things: And as the <hi>Work it self</hi> may be <hi>more</hi> of <hi>less</hi> perfect, in this or the other Place, at this or the other Time, so will be the <hi>Appearance</hi> more or less glorious. It will bear an <hi>exact Proportion</hi> to the <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Degree of the Work it self: So it always has been, so it is now, and so it ever will be to the End of Time, in all Parts of the Earth: Which leads me, to what I have principally in View here,</p>
            <p>In the last Place, to describe the <hi>Appearance</hi> of this Work of GOD. And in doing of this, I shall confine my self to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the <hi>surest Guide,</hi> as well as <hi>only Rule.</hi> And the <hi>Texts,</hi> descriptive of <hi>this Work of GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Appearance</hi> it will make, are so numerous, and expressive, that there can be no reasonable Ground for Debate upon the Matter.</p>
            <p>There are several <hi>Prophesies</hi> in the <hi>Old-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which look beyond the then present Day to the Times of the MESSIAH, and plainly point out the <hi>Appearance</hi> this <hi>Work of GOD</hi> will make in the World. Such an one is that,<note n="†" place="bottom">

mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only Son; and shall be in Bitterness for him, as one that is in Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for his first-Born.</hi> I here take that for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which is supposed by the Generality of <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors</hi> to be the Truth, that these Words look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to be the Truth, that these Words look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Days of CHRIST, and foretell the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT, in a <hi>marvellous Work of Grace.</hi> Whether they refer more immediately to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and were fulfill'd in the <hi>first Times</hi> of the Gospel; particularly, when <hi>three Thousand,</hi> who had been consenting to the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of CHRIST, were, upon PETER'S <hi>Sermon, pricked in the Heart:</hi> or concern Sinners in general under the <hi>Gospel-Dispensation,</hi> I dispute not. In which ever Sense the Words are understood, the <hi>Effect</hi> or <hi>Appearance</hi> of this <hi>Work of Grace</hi> (which is all I now aim at) is the same; <abbr>viz.</abbr>
               <hi>a great and bitter Mourning for Sin,</hi> such a Mourning as Parents are subject to upon the Death of an <hi>only Son,</hi> or <hi>first-born.</hi> But then, you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Rise</hi> of this Sorrow and Lamentation. It flows from a <hi>Look</hi> to that SAVIOUR, whom by Sin we have <hi>pierced;</hi> and not from a <hi>Dread of Wrath and Hell.</hi> There is, 'tis true, a Sorrow for Sin which may be excited from a <hi>Fear of Punishment;</hi> and this is commonly the <hi>first</hi> Kind of Sorrow, and it has its Use in Religion: But its no Sign of a <hi>truly penitent Heart,</hi> whatever Stress Sinners may be dispos'd to lay upon it: Nor is it the <hi>Mourning for Sin</hi> here <hi>prophesied</hi> of. This is a Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row taking <hi>Rise</hi> from <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST, and a View of Sin as occasioning those Sufferings, HE underwent to make <hi>Atonement</hi> for it. And 'tis no Wonder if the Sorrow, which has such a <hi>Rise,</hi> is great like to <hi>that</hi> for a <hi>First-Born.</hi> For there is nothing; no, not the <hi>Torments of Hell</hi> itself, that will so effectually move and melt the Heart, as a <hi>believing Sight of</hi> CHRIST, in his <hi>bitter Sufferings,</hi>

and <hi>dying Agonies,</hi> for our Sins. This, if any Thing, will open the Springs of Grief, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm our Souls with Sorrow at the Remembrance of our Transgressions.</p>
            <p>And this, let me add, is the <hi>only</hi> Sorrow for Sin, that is a <hi>Fruit of Grace,</hi> and <hi>evidential</hi> of a <hi>saving Work</hi> of the SPIRIT upon the Sinner's Heart. An <hi>Eye</hi> to CHRIST is the <hi>only Gospel-Ground</hi> of a <hi>Gospel-Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> and the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> may alarm Conscience, and distract the Sinner almost with Anguish and Terror; but all will be to no Purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>The <hi>Appearance of this Work of GOD,</hi> is again particularly described in that Prophecy, referring to the Times of CHRIST, Isa: 11. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>The Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid: and the Calf, and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a little Child shall lead them. And the Cow and the Bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down together: and the Lion shall eat Straw like the Ox. And the sucking Child shall play on the Hole of the Asp, and the weaned Child shall put his Hand on the Cockatrice-den. They shall not hurt, nor destroy in all my holy Mountain: for the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the Waters cover the Sea.</hi> The Meaning of which Words, according to the Sense of almost all Expositors, stripped of Metaphor, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to plain English, is obviously this, That in the Times of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when Men are effectually wrought upon by divine Grace, the Roughness of their Temper shall be smoothed, their Passions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained and brought into Order, so that they shall live together in Love and Peace, doing to each other all the Offices, not only of Humanity, but of Christian Kindness and Charity. Such Persons
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005151_0064_1016C6E00C1D2E58"/>
as were once <hi>ravenous</hi> in their Disposition, should undergo a <hi>Transformation,</hi> as if a <hi>Wolf</hi> should change his <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Savage</hi> become gentle so as to <hi>feed with Lambs,;</hi> or as if the <hi>Leopard</hi> should quit his <hi>Fierceness,</hi> and lie down with the <hi>Kids:</hi> And such as were once <hi>angry</hi> and <hi>techy,</hi> should pass through an Alteration, as if the <hi>Asp</hi> should lose its <hi>Venom,</hi> and suffer a <hi>Child to play about its Hole.</hi> There should, in a Word, be no more biting, opposing and devouring one another. But <hi>this Change</hi> in Men would make them mild and gentle; disposing them to behave towards each other with all Tenderness, loving one another as themselves.</p>
            <p>But the best Idea of the <hi>Appearance of this Work of GOD</hi> is to be fetched from the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> where the <hi>Texts</hi> descriptive of it, are still more clear and express.</p>
            <p>Only, before I proceed, I shall make one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark: It is this; That there is a <hi>two-fold Work of the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of GOD</hi> spoken of in Scripture: The one respects his <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi> and <hi>Powers;</hi> the other, his <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that by which <hi>a Work of Grace</hi> is begun and carried on in the Souls of Men, to their being prepared in this World, for Glory and Honour in the better World that is to come. Some <hi>Texts,</hi> when they speak of the <hi>Work of the SPIRIT,</hi> may include <hi>both</hi> his <hi>ordinary</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> Work; and some may more especially mean the <hi>former,</hi> and others the <hi>latter.</hi> But however this be, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction ought always to be made between these <hi>Works of the SPIRIT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let it be carefully remembred, when the <hi>Work of the SPIRIT,</hi> in the <hi>extraordinary Sense,</hi> is the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005151_0065_1016C6E35A52AD90"/>
Thing intended, the <hi>Effect</hi> hereof, or its <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> in <hi>Prophesyings, Visions, Revelations, Signs, Wonders,</hi> or any other <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> Events, is not the <hi>Appearance</hi> to be looked for, from the <hi>ordinary</hi> Influence of the SPIRIT, i. e. his <hi>saving Work</hi> upon the Souls of Men: Nor can it be collected from all the <hi>miraculous</hi> Gifts and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that any were the Subjects of, when the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT was poured forth in the Days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they were among the <hi>Sanctified in</hi> CHRIST JESUS. Some, who were then the Subjects of a <hi>Work of Grace,</hi> were, no Doubt, endowed with the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Gifts of the <hi>HOLY GHOST;</hi> but their <hi>extraordinary Endowments</hi> were no Proof of their having wrought in them an <hi>effectual Work of Grace.</hi> Says the celebrated Dr. OWEN,<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <q>Those who were <hi>miraculously</hi> converted, as PAUL; or, who upon their Conversion had <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi> bestowed upon them, as had Multitudes of the primitive Christians, were no otherwise <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> nor by any other <hi>internal Efficiency of the Holy SPIRIT,</hi> then every one is at this Day, who is really made Partaker of this Grace and Privilege: Neither were those <hi>miraculous</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the <hi>Holy SPIRIT,</hi> which were <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> unto others, <hi>any Part</hi> of the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; nor did they belong necessarily to it: For many were the Subjects of them, and received <hi>miraculous</hi> Gifts by them, who were never <hi>regenerate;</hi> and many were <hi>rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,</hi> who were never Partakers of them!</q>

than acquired Gifts, which are the <hi>ordinary</hi> Means of Faith and Repentance, make us.

Or, suppose thou hadst the Spirit of <hi>Prediction;</hi> what then? The Knowledge of Things past being as excellent in its self, and generally more useful to the World, than the Knowledge of Things to come, the <hi>Historian</hi> would then have as much to boast of as thou?—But if thou couldest do <hi>Miracles;</hi> what if thou couldest? <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Magicians</hi> have done them, and JUDAS did them; and many shall say to me in that Day, LORD, LORD, <hi>have we not prophesied in thy Name, and in thy Name cast out Devils, and in thy Name done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works?

               <hi>If we say we have not sinned, we make him a Liar, and his Word is not in us.</hi> But the plain Import of them is, That the Frame of Mind, in those who have <hi>the Work of GOD</hi> wrought in them, is such as renders Sin so odious to them, that they can't entertain the Thought of committing it, or of a Temptation to do so, but with Detestation; nor can they live in the habitual Practice of it: And if they fall into Sin, especially a hainous one, 'tis but rarely, and then thro' Surprise, or the Violence of Temptation: And when they come to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they condemn themselves, repent of what they have done, and are upon their Guard parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly against this Kind of Sin for the Time to come.</p>

            <p>And the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very clear as to the <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> of this <hi>Righteousness</hi> or <hi>Holiness,</hi> as they will appear in those, in whom there is a <hi>Work of Grace.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> has enumerated the <hi>Fruits of the</hi> SPIRIT. i. e. the <hi>visible,</hi> as well as <hi>internal</hi> Effects of his <hi>special Work</hi> on the Hearts of Men. <hi>The Fruit of the SPIRIT</hi> (says he<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 9.</note>) <hi>is in all Goodness, and Righteousness and Truth.</hi> The Enumeration is more full in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the GALATIANS<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 22, 23.</note>; <hi>The Fruit of the SPIRIT is Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance: against such there is no Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherever there is the <hi>saving Work of the SPIRIT,</hi> it will appear in <hi>Love;</hi> Love to GOD, and Love
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005151_0073_1016C6FC0EF3E568"/>
to our <hi>Neighbour, on which two Commandments</hi> (as our SAVIOUR expresses it<note n="**" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 40.</note>) <hi>do hang all the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will be Love to GOD; the <hi>Reality</hi> of it in the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the genuine <hi>Appearance</hi> of it in the <hi>Life.</hi> If may discover itself in the <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and this in a <hi>lower</hi> or <hi>higher</hi> Degree, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Temper, Education and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the Persons who are the Subjects of it: And where the <hi>passionate Appearance</hi> may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, many may be ready to think, there is the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and highest Love: But this is a Mistake. The <hi>passionate</hi> Discovery of Love is not the best Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, either of its <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Strength:</hi> The surest and most substantial Proof is, <hi>Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD;</hi> and the <hi>stronger</hi> the Love, the more uniform, steady and pleasant will be this <hi>Obedience.</hi> The Scripture is remarkably express in this Matter. Says our SAVIOUR,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15.</note>, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments.</hi> And in the 21 v. <hi>He that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</hi> So, in the 23 v. <hi>If any Man love me, he will keep my Words.</hi> The same Thing is again repeated<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 3.</note>, <hi>This is the Love of GOD, that we keep his Commandments.</hi> It is added, <hi>and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will also be Love to our <hi>Neighbour;</hi> a Love unconfin'd as to its <hi>Object.</hi> We shall love not only those who <hi>love us,</hi> and are of <hi>our Opinion</hi> and <hi>Party:</hi> This is nothing more than the Love of <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 46.</note> But we shall love those
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005151_0074_1016C70422C6AA08"/>
who <hi>hate</hi> us, and are out <hi>greatest Enemies;</hi> yea, we shall love <hi>all Men,</hi> but those especially, who are of the <hi>Houshold of Faith.</hi> And our Love will be a Love like to that we have for our <hi>ourselves;</hi> like it for unfeigned Sincerity, and all the genuine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of true Benevolence. It will be a Love, <hi>not in Word, neither in Tongue</hi> only, <hi>but in Deed and Truth.</hi> It will appear in all the Offices of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, both to Men's <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies;</hi> opening our <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Hands</hi> to minister to their Help, as we are able. Wherever this Love reigns, as it ought to do, it will banish ill Nature, evil Surmisings, unchristan Jealousies: It will restrain the <hi>Mind</hi> from <hi>evil Thinking,</hi> and much more the <hi>Tongue</hi> from <hi>evil Speaking.</hi> There will be no secret <hi>Whispering</hi> and <hi>Backbiting,</hi> much less open dealing in <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Reproach:</hi> So far will Christians be from injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously treating one another, that they will rather cover one another's Failings; forbearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, as GOD for CHRIST'S Sake forgiveth us.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>Fruit of the SPIRIT is Joy;</hi> by which we are to understand, not meerly an <hi>animal Passion,</hi> a free <hi>Flow of Spirits:</hi> This there may be where there is no true Joy. And that Joy ought always to be suspected, which rises high in is <hi>sensible Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,.</hi> while the <hi>Temper of the Mind</hi> is not, at the same Time, proportionably exalted in its <hi>real Spirituality.</hi> Wherever there is this Joy, there will be a <hi>Complacence</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> in GOD, a holy Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Chearfulness of Mind: And as it will be mixt with a becoming <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Caution,</hi> so will it express it self in as low an <hi>Abasement</hi> of our selves, as <hi>high</hi> Adorations of the free and rich Grace of GOD.—But of this I shall have Occasion to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course largely afterwards.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005151_0075_1016C705B7BF1288"/>
Another of these <hi>Fruits</hi> is <hi>Peace;</hi> by which (I suppose) is here meant, not so much a holy Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind (that being before spoken of) as that State of <hi>outward Quietness,</hi> and <hi>good Order,</hi> which may justly be expected, where Men's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are under a divine Government, and they themselves have been formed to a Temper, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them to <hi>live peaceably with all Men, if it be possible, and as much as in them lies.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> has told us,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 20.</note> that <hi>Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions,</hi> are <hi>Works of the Flesh.</hi> He also mentions it as the Character of the <hi>Wisdom that is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 20.</note>, that it is <hi>peaceable, gentle and easy to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; full of Mercy and good Fruits;</hi> While he declares<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Ver.</hi> 14, 15, 16.</note>, that if we have <hi>bitter Envyings and Strife, this Wisdom descendeth not from above; but is earthly, sensual, and devilish: For where Envying and Strife is, there is Confusion and every evil Work.</hi> If Men are fierce and furious; if they foment Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and promote Contention and Schism, they are so far <hi>sensual, not having the SPIRIT;</hi> for the <hi>Fruit of the SPIRIT is Peace,</hi> a dwelling together in Love and Unity. 'Tis true, our SAVIOUR has said<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 51, 52, 53.</note>, <hi>Suppose ye that I am come to give Peace on Earth? I tell you nay; but rather Division. For from henceforth there shall be five in one House divided, three against two, and two against three. The Father shall be divided against the Son, and the Son against the Father; the Mother against the Daughter, and the Daughter against the Mother,</hi> and so on. But this Text is intended to represent, not the <hi>proper De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> of CHRIST'S <hi>coming,</hi> nor yet the <hi>genuine Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency</hi> of it; but what would unhappily be the <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005151_0076_1016C707E15B8D00"/>
through the Prevalence of Men's Lusts, in Opposition to the Precepts of the Gospel: Nor can it be suppos'd, this should be the <hi>Effect,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>those</hi> who are <hi>savingly wrought upon by the SPIRIT.</hi> Whatever Occasion the <hi>coming of</hi> CHRIST may give to the <hi>working of Lust</hi> in <hi>others,</hi> in respect of <hi>these,</hi> the Turbulency of their Spirits has been so check'd, their Passions brought under such Restraint, their <hi>old Man</hi> suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd such a Mortification, that it can't be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they should be given to Strife and Contention, and go into the like mutinous and divisive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, with Men that are <hi>carnal.</hi> If the <hi>Fruit of the SPIRIT is Peace,</hi> those, certainly, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the SPIRIT, must be distinguish'd from others by their <hi>peaccable</hi> Temper and Conduct: Nor may it be thought, that they should be the Disturbers of Society, the Instruments to sow the Seeds of Discord and Confusion: They will rather <hi>endeavour to keep the Unity of the SPIRIT in the Bond of Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth <hi>Fruit of the SPIRIT</hi> is <hi>Long suffering.</hi> This supposes Injuries and Abuses, and is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Behaviour</hi> of one that is <hi>spiritual.</hi> He is slow of Resentment, loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliate; not apt to take Offence, nor hasty to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Evil for Evil; but prone rather to overcome Evil with Good: He is patient under Ill-treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, firm against the Impressions of Wrath; can suffer a great deal, and endure Insults and base Carriage, without being fill'd with Indignation, and hurried on to Acts of Revenge; in these Ways <hi>walking worthy of the Vocation wherewith he is called, with all Lowliness, Long-suffering and Forbearance.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005151_0077_1016C709E020CAE0"/>
Another Fruit is <hi>Gentleness.</hi> i. e. a Disposition to treat one another with Candour and Mildness. Where this Fruit is, the Temper is softened, and rendered sweet and pleasant: And this it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in a courteous and obliging Deportment. It won't stand upon nice Points; it won't be harsh and rugged; much less will it be fierce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive, calling for Fire from Heaven to devour all who don't think just as we do: It will rather put us upon the Methods of Mildness, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having towards one another with Kindness and Lenity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goodness</hi> is also rank'd among these Fruits. This is descriptive, not so much of a <hi>virtuous</hi> Character in <hi>general,</hi> as of <hi>that,</hi> the distinguishing Mark of which is <hi>Kindness</hi> and <hi>Benignity:</hi> As when our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR speaks of the <hi>good Man</hi> for whom one would even dare to die, he means to point out, not only a Man of Religion, but one eminent for his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> and <hi>Beneficence!</hi> And this Kind of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there will always be, in a less or greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, wherever there is a <hi>special Work of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT.</hi> It will make Men <hi>tender-hearted</hi> and <hi>compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate; kindly affectioned</hi> to each other, ready to all the Offices of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> apt to shew Favour: And this they will do, in all the Ways they can devise; yea, they'll take more Pains, and go through greater Difficulties for the Good of Mankind, than, according to the Rigour of strict Justice, might be expected of them. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this is that <hi>Selfishness,</hi> which prompts Men to <hi>seek their own, and not the Good of others;</hi> that <hi>Hardiness</hi> of Spirit that is not touch'd with a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other Men's Miseries; that <hi>niggardly, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> Disposition, which can see a <hi>Brother have need, and shut up its Bowels of Compassion from him.</hi>

               <hi>Faith</hi> is likewise number'd among the Fruits of the SPIRIT. By this some suppose is meant that <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> which consists in an Aversion to Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Falshood and Deceit; and in a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to act with Uprightness and Sincerity: But others incline to think, the Faith here intended is that by which we are <hi>justified.</hi> And to be sure, <hi>this Faith</hi> is a <hi>Fruit of the SPIRIT,</hi> and such an <hi>essential</hi> one too, that no Man may be said to have been wrought upon by the SPIRIT, in a <hi>saving</hi> Sense, that has it not. But then it must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, this Faith is not a meer <hi>speculative,</hi> nor yet <hi>unactive</hi> Thing: It will have a powerful Influence both on Men's <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Lives.</hi> 'Tis spoken of as that which <hi>purifies the Heart</hi>

without the Spirit is dead, so Faith without Works is dead also.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another of these Fruits is <hi>Meekness,</hi> i. e. a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sweetness of Temper, making Men mild and placid and quiet; which they will discover more or less, in their whole Deportment in the World, whether towards GOD or <hi>Man.</hi> In Respect of GOD, they will be ready to believe what he says, to do what he commands, and to suffer what he lays upon them with Patience and Chearfulness. In Respect of Men, they will behave towards them, if they are <hi>Superiors,</hi> with a modest Deference and Respect; if they are <hi>Inferiors,</hi> with Kindness and Condescension; and if they are <hi>Equals,</hi> with a friendly affable Freedom. The contrary to this Fruit of the SPIRIT, is that Ungovernableness of Temper, which is apt to express it self in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Wrath, Clamour; in Impatience, Discontent, Murmuring, and the like, according to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ways wherein Men's Passions may be excited.</p>
            <p>The last Fruit of the SPIRIT here mentioned is <hi>Temperance,</hi> i. e. a Christian Moderation in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Things of Time and Sense: Or, it may rather mean the same Thing with <hi>Chastity;</hi> which wherever it has a predominating Influence, will restrain from all Filthiness, not only in <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Behaviour</hi> but in <hi>Heart</hi> also; according to that <hi>spiritual</hi> Interpretation, which our SAVIOUR has left us of the <hi>Seventh Commandment,</hi> in the 5th Chapter of MATTHEW'S <hi>Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But besides these, there are other Things, wherein a <hi>Work of the SPIRIT</hi> will <hi>appear.</hi> It will set Men a <hi>praying,</hi> and dispose them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a constant Course of this Duty. This we are
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005151_0080_1016C715BB9A0E80"/>
taught from the Instance of PAUL, of whom, one of the Things recorded, after his Conversion, is, <hi>Behold he prayeth. Acts</hi> 9. 11.</p>
            <p>It will also beget in Persons a Love to the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of GOD in his <hi>House,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, them in a continued Attendance thereon. So, the first Christians <hi>continued stedfast in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers: Acts</hi> 2. 24, 46, 47. And this they did with <hi>one Accord; praising GOD, and having Favour with all the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This now, in general, is the <hi>Appearance a Work of</hi> GOD will make, wherever, and in whomsoever; it takes Place. And if the <hi>Work</hi> be <hi>remarkable,</hi> so will be its <hi>Appearance</hi> in these Things: And 'tis to delude Men to pretend the contrary. If great Numbers, in a <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Land,</hi> are <hi>effectually</hi> wro't upon by the SPIRIT, it will appear in their <hi>Ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do Evil,</hi> and <hi>Learning to do well.</hi> They will certainly become <hi>better Men;</hi> and it will be <hi>visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> they are so. They will appear more like to their SAVIOUR in the <hi>Temper</hi> of their Minds, and in the <hi>Course</hi> of their Lives: To be sure, it will be thus, if the <hi>Work</hi> is remarkable in the <hi>Degree</hi> in which it is wrought. They will, in this Case, be eminent for their <hi>Faith, Love, Meekness, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Patience, Justice, Brotherly-Kindness, Forbearance, Forgiveness, and the like:</hi> And as for <hi>Bitterness, Wrath, Strife, Emulation, Pride, Sedition, Schism,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Works of the Flesh,</hi> it can't be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that these should abound, and be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent than before; certainly, not among those, who are <hi>remarkably</hi> the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>this Works.</hi> This would be to invert the Order of Things, to make that to be the <hi>Appearance of a Work of Grace,</hi> which is an <hi>Appearance</hi> arising from <hi>Men's Lusts;</hi> and perhaps, the worst of them too.</p>
            <p>

Having thus, in as plain a Manner as I could, shown what a WORK OF GOD is, together with the APPEARANCE it will make; especially, when REMARKABLE, it will not be thought, my Design, in the following Treatise, is, to reflect Dishonour upon any of those Things wherein I have made <hi>a real Work of GOD,</hi> or its <hi>Appearance</hi> to consist. I trust, I am not mistaken in the Idea I have given, either of <hi>such a Work,</hi> or its <hi>Appearance;</hi> and the rather, because what I have said upon this Head, I have mostly exprest in the very Words of <hi>Scripture:</hi> And so far as <hi>the Work,</hi> I have above described, appears in <hi>this</hi> or any <hi>other</hi> Place, I am, if I know myself, in a Disposition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in it, and thank GOD for it; And instead of saving any Thing to <hi>oppose</hi> it, would do all in my Power, to encourage and promote it. But 'tis easy to observe, <hi>a Work of GOD</hi> may be thought to consist in those Things, in which the <hi>Bible</hi> does not make it to consist; and great Stress may be laid upon such <hi>Appearances</hi> as are no sure <hi>Characteristicks</hi> of a <hi>saving Change</hi> in Men's Hearts: And 'tis too evident to need Proof, that this has been too much the Truth of the Case in <hi>these Times.</hi> Many have taken <hi>the Work of</hi> GOD to lie in those Things, which are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either <hi>Parts</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>such a Work,</hi> that 'tis rather a Reproach to the <hi>HOLY SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> to suppose he should be the Author of them: And one of the best Ways to serve the Cause of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> is, in my Opinion, to point out, with Freedom and Plainness, those <hi>Appearances,</hi> which instead of being the <hi>genuine Fruits of a Work of GOD,</hi> are <hi>real Hindrances</hi> to the flourishing of pure and undefil'd Religion: And this prepares the Way to enter upon the Business I have taken in Hand.</p>

            <head>Particularly pointing out the Things of a bad and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tendency, in the late reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Appearance in NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>THERE is not a Man, in the Country, in the sober Exercise of his Understanding, but will acknowledge, that the late religious <hi>Stir</hi> has been attended with many <hi>Irregularities</hi> and <hi>Disorders.</hi> These, some are pleased to call, <hi>Imprudencies, human Frailties, accidental Effects</hi> only, such as might be expected, considering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of Corruption in good Men, even among those in whom a <hi>remarkable Work of Grace</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on: Others are in the Opinion, they make a <hi>main Part</hi> of the <hi>Appearance</hi> that has been so much talk'd of, and have arisen unavoidably, in the natural Course of Things, from the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of this <hi>Appearance;</hi> and that it could not reasonably be suppos'd, it should have been otherwise.</p>
            <p>I shall particularly show what these <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous</hi> Things are; making such Remarks (as I go along) as may be thought needful to set Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in a just and true Light.</p>

Among the <hi>bad</hi> Things attending <hi>this Work,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall <hi>first</hi> mention <hi>Itinerant Preaching.</hi> This had its <hi>Rise</hi> (at lest in these Parts) from Mr. WHITEFIELD; though I could never see, I own, upon what Warrant, either from <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> he went about Preaching from one <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Parish</hi> to another, where the Gospel was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preach'd, and by Persons as well qualified for the Work, as he can pretend to be. I cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably hope, his Design herein was good: But might it not be leavened with some undesirable Mixture? Might he not, at first, take up this Practice from a mistaken Thought of some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Mission</hi> from GOD? Or, from the undue Influence of <hi>two high an Opinion</hi> of his own <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces?</hi> And when he had got into this Way, might he not be too much encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to go on in it, from the <hi>popular Applauses,</hi> every where, so liberally heaped on him? If he had not been under too strong a Biass from something or other of this Nature, why so fond of preaching always himself, to the Exclusion, not of his <hi>Brethren</hi> only, but his <hi>Fathers,</hi> in <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> as well as <hi>Age?</hi> And why so ostentatious and assuming as to alarm so many Towns, by proclaiming his Intentions, in the <hi>publick Prints,</hi> to preach such a Day in such a <hi>Parish,</hi> the next Day in such a one, and so on, as he past through the Country; and all this, without the Knowledge, either of <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in most Places? What others may think of such a Conduct I know not; but to me, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared the most indubitable Expression of that Modesty, Humility, and prefering others in Love, which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> highly recommend as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005151_0084_1016C72313CD9098"/>
what will adorn the <hi>Minister's,</hi> as well as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's Character.</p>
            <p>And what became of his <hi>little Flock</hi> all this while? This <hi>Gentleman</hi> (if I don't mistake) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses a very contemptuous Thought of NON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RESIDENTS and PLURALISTS, when he makes that Remark, in one of his <hi>Journals</hi>

                  </gap> NEW-ENGLAND, Page 94, 95.</note>, <q>The Towns through CONNECTICUT, and the <hi>Province</hi> of the MASSACHUSETTS-BAY—are well-peopled.—Every five or ten Miles you have a <hi>Meeting-House,</hi> and I believe there is no such Thing as a PLURALIST or NON-RESIDENT-MINISTER in both <hi>Provinces.</hi>
               </q> And what is the mighty Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference (so far as a <hi>particular Flock</hi> is concerned in its <hi>Pastor's Labours</hi>) between an ITINERANT PREACHER, absent from his Charge seven Eights of his Time, and a NON-RESIDENT-MINISTER? Or, between a PLURALIST, and one that acts as though <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Parishes</hi> in a <hi>Country</hi> were his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cure?</hi> 'Tis true, your NON-RESIDENTS and PLURALISTS have their worldly Encouragements; And some are in the Opinion, it han't been to Mr. WHITEFIELD's Disadvantage, on <hi>temporal</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that he has travelled about the World in Quality of an <hi>Itinerant Preacher.</hi> He has certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made LARGE COLLECTIONS: And if, in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this, he had a <hi>Fellow-Feeling</hi> with the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,</hi> 'tis no more than might be expected. No one, I believe, besides himself, can tell the <hi>Amount</hi> of the <hi>Presents,</hi> he received in this Town, as well as in other Places, for his <hi>own proper Use.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Gentleman</hi> that practised upon this <hi>new Method</hi> was Mr. GILBERT TENNENT, who came
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005151_0085_1016C725D8762560"/>
in the Middle of Winter, from NEW-BRUNSWICK (a Journey of more than 300 Miles) to BOSTON, <q>to water the Seed sown by Mr. WHITEFIELD;</q> the <hi>Ministers</hi> in the <hi>Town,</hi> though a considerable Body, being thought insufficient for that Purpose. I shall not think it amiss to insert here Part of an <hi>expostulatory Letter</hi> sent to him, after he had been preaching among us for some Time. <q>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> (says the Writer<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Boston Post-Boy,</hi> Numb. 353.</note>) let me put it to your Conscience; was not the Reason of your travelling so many hundred Miles to preach the Gospel, in this Place, founded on the Insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Ministers here for their Office? Why travel so far, in such a rigorous Season, to preach the Gospel, if the Gospel was really preach'd by the Ministers here? Did you not fear<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Seward's Journal.</hi>
                  </note>, <q>that notwithstanding they pretend to water what Mr. WHITEFIELD, by the SPIRIT, had planted, had set up a <hi>Lecture,</hi> and the like, they would <hi>build with untempered Mortar,</hi> would <hi>build Wood, Hay, Stubble,</hi> &amp;c.?</q> Had you not some suspicion, that, either they had not a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace, or if they had, that it was only a <hi>Head Knowledge,</hi> that they were not converted, and of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not likely to be made Instruments of much good? If this be the natural Construc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be put upon your coming hither, can you think, you are in the Way of your Duty? Can you think, the bringing the <hi>standing Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> of a Place into Contempt, the Way to promote the Interest of Religion, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls? But perhaps, you did not
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005151_0086_1016C72A15612118"/>
think, nor would have any Body else think, quite so hardly of the Ministers here? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, you only thought, that if they did a little Good, you might do a great Deal more. Is not this approaching too near to Vanity? Is it not thinking more highly of your self than you ought? Is it not contrary to the Scripture Rule of <hi>preferring others in Love</hi>?</q> The <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to this Letter I never look'd upon as satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory: And I have the more Reason to think, there was a Propriety in these Questions, as I <hi>now</hi> know what Opinion Mr. WHITEFIELD entertain'd of the <hi>Generality of the Ministers in Town.</hi> I shall only say, I have had personal Conversation with one, who join'd in the Prayers previous to this <hi>Journey to</hi> BOSTON.</p>
            <p>Mr. TENNENT tarried in Town a great Part of the Winter; in all which Time, he never exprest a Desire (so far as I can learn) of being assisted by <hi>any of the Ministers:</hi> But seem'd as fond, as Mr. WHITEFIELD before him, of preaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Day himself; and did so, willingly taking from the other Ministers even their <hi>own Turns</hi> in the <hi>stated Lectures:</hi> And if, by their Submission to him herein, they fell in the Opinion of the People, who can wonder at it? It would indeed have been a Wonder, if they had not. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Circumstances of the Town were such as to require Preaching every Day in the Week, or they were not: If they were not, why did they encourage such a Practice? If they were, I don't see how they could answer it to GOD, <hi>their own Consciences,</hi> or <hi>their People,</hi> to fit still, and let one Man have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>the sole Trouble of that which was the proper Business of their Office. Such a Conduct as this naturally taught People to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:005151_0087_1016C72BA66A7518"/>
upon them as <hi>idle Shepherds:</hi> And if this was the Reflection, some cast upon them, it was no other than might be expected.</p>
            <p>Mr. TENNENT went from BOSTON to PISCATAQUA in the Path of Mr. WHITEFIELD; and, in some Places, appear'd very forward in tendring his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to preach, though he knew it was not (as to Time) agreeable to the <hi>Ministers.</hi> Upon his Return home, he preach'd in most, if not all the Towns as he past along: And if, in all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,</hi> he had the Consent of the <hi>Pastors,</hi> it was, I am ready to think, by Constraint. They might give into it to prevent Difficulties among their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; not that they approved this <hi>Manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> the Construction of which seemed to be, that <hi>upon him lay the Care of all the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Time, the Method of <hi>Itinerant Preaching</hi> became common. Many, in various Parts of the Land, took upon them to visit the Churches; preaching from Place to Place, wherever they went.  Sometimes, contrary to the known Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>settled Ministers,</hi> and in <hi>Opposition</hi> to them; and sometimes, where their Consent was only a Matter of Necessity to keep Peace among their People. Sometimes, they have come into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes of their own Accord; and sometimes, by Application made to them from a few disaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed persons. Sometimes, in order to get the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the <hi>Meeting-Hourse,</hi> they have us'd mean and indirect Arts; and sometimes, when they could not get into it, they have gone into <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houses,</hi> or gathered Assemblies in the <hi>Fields.</hi> Nay, <hi>Lay-Exhorters,</hi> Men of no Capacity, nor Learning; yea, some of them of a suspicious Character for their Virtue. (not to say any Thing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005151_0088_1016C72ED4D35450"/>
worse) have travell'd about from Town to Town, <hi>calling Assemblies,</hi> and sometimes exciting Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>People</hi> against their <hi>Ministers,</hi> for not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> or not encouraging them in their <hi>disorderly</hi> Practice. I cannot better describe the <hi>Manner</hi> of these <hi>Itinerants,</hi> than in the Words of a <hi>Friend</hi> in his <hi>Letter</hi> to me. <q>The <hi>Itinerant</hi> Ministers that have been among us, have been (as I think) very <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly</hi> in their Proceedings. It hath been their Manner to estrange themselves, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, from me, and to associate with a <hi>disaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Party.</hi> They appoint and warn <hi>Lectures</hi> without my Consent or Knowledge, and just before the Time of Exercise they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sent for my Approbation: And upon my manifesting a Dislike of their Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have preach'd sometimes in <hi>private Houses;</hi> sometimes in a <hi>Barn;</hi> sometimes in the <hi>open Air</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Inconveniences, which have arisen from this Method of acting, more especially in CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NECTICUT, have been so great, that the GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT there have taken the Matter into Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and come into an <hi>Act,</hi> whereby they have restrained, both <hi>ordained Ministers,</hi> and <hi>licensed Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates,</hi> from preaching in <hi>other Men's Parishes,</hi> without <hi>their</hi> and their <hi>Church's</hi> Consent; and wholly prohibited the <hi>Exhortations</hi> of <hi>illiterate Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is not my Business to consider, how far an <hi>Irregularity,</hi> in this Kind, may properly fall under
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005151_0089_1016C732A8CA71A0"/>
the Cognisance of the <hi>civil Magistrate:</hi> What I have to do with, is the <hi>Thing it self;</hi> which I can't but reckon among the <hi>Disorders</hi> of the present Day.</p>
            <p>I see not but those, who make it their Practice to go about <hi>gathering Assemblies,</hi> in <hi>other Men's Parishes,</hi> properly come under the Character of <hi>Busie-Bodies.</hi> These were common, in the <hi>first Days</hi> of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and there seems to have been <hi>two Sorts</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>Some were <hi>idle,</hi> not doing their <hi>own Business;</hi> but wandring <hi>about from House to House, talking, and speaking the Things they ought not.</hi> This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Character of some <hi>idle</hi> Persons, who have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly risen up among us. And what is the Tho't of the great St. <hi>Paul</hi> concerning them? Why, he says,<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. from the 10th to the 15th.</note>

it was <hi>his</hi> not <hi>their's.</hi> This is the Conduct the <hi>Apostle</hi> points out: And he has an ill Opinion of it, or he would not have rank'd it with some of the <hi>greatest Crimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears indeed to be a Fault of the same Kind with that, which the Apostle PAUL blames in the <hi>false Teachers,</hi> who had crept into the Church of CORINTH, to their great Disservice. Remarkable are his Words upon this Head. I shall set them down at large. <q>We dare not, says he<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. from the 12 to the 17 Verse.</note>, make ourselves of the Number, or compare ourselves with <hi>some that commend themselves:</hi> But they measuring themselves by themselves, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring themselves among themselves are not wise. But we will not <hi>boast of Things without our Measure.</hi> but according to the <hi>Measure of the Rule, which GOD hath distributed to us,</hi> a Measure to reach even unto you. For we <hi>stretch not ourselves beyond our Measure,</hi> as tho' we reached not unto you; for we are come as far as to you also, in Preaching the Gospel of CHRIST: Not <hi>boasting of Things without our Measure,</hi> that is, of <hi>other Men's Labours;</hi> but having Hope, when your Faith is encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we shall be enlarged by you, <hi>according to our Rule</hi> abundantly, to preach the Gospel in the Regions beyond you, and not to <hi>boast in another Man's Line of Things made ready to our Hand.</hi>
               </q> Three Things are suggested to us as faulty in these <hi>Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>their commending themselves so much. We dare not,</hi> says the <hi>Apostle, compare ourselves with
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005151_0091_1016C736DC6FC900"/>
some, who commend themselves.</hi> The Language is satyrical, setting forth, in the strongest Light, the undue Praises <hi>these Teachers</hi> heap'd upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. They were vainly puffed up in their Minds, glorying in themselves, as though they were <hi>extraordinary</hi> Persons, out-doing even the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</hi> Such was their Pride and Self-Conceit, that they took all Occasions to <hi>proclaim their own Goodness;</hi> which they, no Doubt, did, with such Art and Cunning, as hereby to insinuate themselves into the good Opinion of the People, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing them against the very <hi>Apostles.</hi> They are therefore called, in the next Chapter,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>deceitful Workers;</hi> and represented,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>V.</hi> 14, 15.</note> as <hi>transforming them selves into the Ministers of Righteousness,</hi> according to the Example of <hi>Satan,</hi> who can <hi>transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into an Angel of Light.</hi> Mr. BURKITT's Note here is very just, and may be worth transcribing.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vid. in</hi> Loc.</note> 
               <q>It is very possible, says he, for Men to be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Satan's</hi> Instruments, animated and taught by him, to do his Work against the Interest of CHRIST and his Truth; and yet, at the same Time, to pretend to excell and go beyond CHRIST's faithful Ministers, in preaching Truth and Holiness: So that the highest Pretences to Truth, Orthodoxy, free Grace, Purity and Unity, are no sufficient Evidences of a true Ministry. <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>his Instruments,</hi> who love to <hi>transform themselves</hi> sometimes into an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light,</hi> may pretend to all these; and notwithstanding, be the sworn Enemies of CHRIST and his Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another Thing insinuated to be Blame-worthy in <hi>these Teachers</hi> is, their <hi>entring into other Men's
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005151_0092_1016C738712C68D0"/>
Labours,</hi> and making their <hi>Boast of Things made ready to their Hands.</hi> This Method of acting, the <hi>Apostle</hi> condemns by his <hi>own Example</hi> to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. It was not his Practice to bestow his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours <hi>chiefly</hi> on the Places where the Gospel had been settled, and was <hi>now</hi> preach'd by <hi>faithful Men</hi> set apart for that Purpose: He chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the <hi>first Founder</hi> of Christianity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went. He did not neglect <hi>ungospelized Places,</hi> to go to those where the Gospel was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preach'd; [This was the Practice of the <hi>false Teachers</hi> he is arguing against] but on the contrary, he past by the People, who enjoyed the Gospel, in the stated Preaching of it by <hi>settled Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> that he might make known the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to those who had not heard of his Name. very express are his own Words to this Effect,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 20, 21.</note> 
               <hi>Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where CHRIST was named, lest I should build upon another Man's Foundation: But as it is written, to whom he was not spoken of, they shall see; and they that have not heard, shall understand.</hi> And if those, in this Day, who would be thought more <hi>zealous</hi> than their Neighbours to promote the Interest of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, instead of going, from Place to Place, where the Gospel is already preach'd, and by Persons much better qualified for the Work than they are; I say, if instead of this, they would carry the Gospel to the People <hi>sitting in Darkness,</hi> and that <hi>see no Light,</hi> (Multitudes of whom there are upon our Borders) they might discover as much truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Zeal, and do as great Service to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of CHRIST.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005151_0093_1016C73A0E072408"/>
The last Thing the <hi>Apostle</hi> blames in these <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> is, <hi>their not keeping to Rule,</hi> their <hi>going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their Measure.</hi> If this had not been a <hi>Fault</hi> in <hi>them</hi> it would not have been to the <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> that his conduct, in this Matter, has been contrary to <hi>their's.</hi> And yet, this he glories in: He seems to exult in it, that it could not be said of him, as of these <hi>false Teachers,</hi> that he had <hi>transgressed his Line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Measure.</hi> Says he, comparing himself with them, <hi>we stretch not our selves beyond our Measure.</hi> And again, <hi>Not boasting of Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our Measure, that is, of other Men's Labours.</hi> And yet again, <hi>Not to boast in another Man's Line of Things made ready to our Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Language of the <hi>Apostle</hi> appears singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly beautiful, as well as expressive, to those who have Acquaintance with the GRECIAN AGONES, to which it evidently alludes. One of these was RACING; concerning which, two Things may be taken Notice of: The <hi>Stage of Ground</hi> they were to run; and the <hi>white Lines,</hi> which mark'd out the <hi>Paths</hi> for the <hi>Racers</hi> to run in. These were as many as the <hi>Racers:</hi> Each Man had his Path chalk'd out to him, out of which if he stept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Path of another, he <hi>went out of his Line,</hi> and lost the Prize. To this the <hi>Apostle</hi> alludes in these Words. His <hi>Apostleship</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Doctor HAMMOND. Not. c. d. in <hi>Loc.</hi>
               </note>, his preaching the Gospel, is his <hi>running in a Race;</hi> the <hi>Province</hi> assign'd him to gospelize, is the <hi>Measure distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him,</hi> his <hi>Stage</hi> or Compass of Ground, which GOD, as it were, by the <hi>Line in a Race,</hi> had mark'd out for him to exercise himself in: And
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005151_0094_1016C7403082ABB0"/>
to this he had kept. He had not, like these <hi>false Teachers, gone beyond his Measure;</hi> he had not stept out of <hi>his own</hi> into the <hi>Line of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The obvious Import of all which is, that such are unlike to the holy Apostle PAUL, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> condem'd by his Example, who keep not within <hi>their own Bounds,</hi> but go over into <hi>other Men's Labours:</hi> They herein intermeddle in what does not belong to them, and are properly <hi>Busie-bodies;</hi> especially, when they concern themselves in the Affairs of others <hi>uncalled,</hi> and so as to introduce Disorder and Confusion into the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD.</p>
            <p>And if, in the <hi>first Days</hi> of Christianity, when the State of Things was such as to require the <hi>travelling</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> from Place to Place, to preach the Gospel; I say, if, in these Times, even an <hi>Apostle</hi> thought it <hi>disorderly</hi> to go out of his <hi>own Line,</hi> and enter upon <hi>other Men's Labours,</hi> 'tis much more so in the <hi>present settled State</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Pastor</hi> has now his <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Charge. He is devoted to the Service of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, in a <hi>particular</hi> Place, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>particular</hi> People. His Work, as a Minister, does not lie at large; but is restrain'd within certain Boundaries. I don't mean, that he may'nt use his Office, in other Places, within the <hi>Rules of Order,</hi> upon <hi>special</hi> Occasions, and where there may be a just Call: But his stated, constant Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is with his <hi>own People.</hi> These have been committed to his Care; these, he has solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engagd, before GOD, and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and <hi>holy Angles,</hi> to do all the Duties of a <hi>Pastor</hi> to. And can he be faithful to his <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Vow,</hi> or the Command of GOD, which says, <hi>Feed the Flock over which the HOLY GHOST hath

            <p>And as to <hi>others,</hi> who are so forward in going into <hi>other Parishes,</hi> to preach there perpetually, I can't learn that they do more among their <hi>own</hi> People, than those who make no such Excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?

               <q>Church Officers are Officers to <hi>one</hi> Church, even that <hi>particular</hi> over which the HOLY GHOST hath made them Oveseers; insomuch as <hi>Elders</hi> are commanded to feed, not <hi>all</hi> Flocks, but <hi>that</hi> Flock which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Faith and Trust, and dependeth on them: Nor can <hi>constant Residence</hi> at one Congregation be necessary for a Minister, no, nor yet lawful, if he be not a Minister to <hi>one</hi>

            <p>And 'tis observable, though they allow of a <hi>Communion of Churches,</hi> yet it is only in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and under such Limitations, as may consist, with the <hi>Rights</hi> both of <hi>particular</hi> Churches and their <hi>Pastors;</hi> yea, and with the <hi>Duties</hi> too they mutually owe to each other.</p>
            <p>On the one Hand, they concede to <hi>Ministers</hi> officiating in other Churches besides their own; but then, it is upon Supposition of a <hi>mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> not only between the respective <hi>particular Churches,</hi>

               </q> 'Tis evident from these Passages, and indeed from the whole Scope of the <hi>Platform,</hi> that our <hi>Fathers</hi> never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd it warrantable, either from <hi>Reason,</hi> or the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> for Ministers to <hi>act</hi> in any Church

            <p>On the other Hand, they allow that the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> of a <hi>particular</hi> Church may <hi>occasionally,</hi> and as there may be <hi>real Need</hi> of it, communicate with <hi>other</hi> Churches in any Acts of Church Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship; but then, they particularly give it as their Judgment<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Platform,</hi> Chap. 18. Sect. 1.</note>, That <q>Church-Members may not remove or depart from the Church, and so one from another, as they please, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out just and weighty Cause; but ought to live and dwell together, forasmuch as they are commanded not to forsake the Assembling of themselves together.

the like Reasons to withdraw from publick Communion in Word, or Seals, or Censures, is unlawful and sinful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Had these Paragraphs been wrote, on Purpose to describe the <hi>disorderly Separations</hi> of the present Day, they could not have done it more exactly: And, at the same Time, they clearly exhibit the Opinion of our <hi>Fore-Fathers,</hi> as to the probable Issue of these Things; that they tend to break the Church to Pieces. And what indeed can be expected but Confusion, when <hi>Church Members</hi> will forsake their <hi>own Pastors</hi> for every <hi>wandring Stranger;</hi> and, rather than not hear them, will break away from their <hi>own</hi> Church, forget their Duty to <hi>him that has been set over them in the LORD,</hi> and treat him with <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Wrath,</hi> if not with <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Insult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all that has been said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this <hi>Itinerant preaching,</hi> 'tis a Practice migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily pleaded for; and many are the Things that are offered in its Vindication.</p>
            <p>'Tis said, <hi>much Good</hi> has been done by it. And han't there been <hi>much Evil</hi> likewise? Han't it been the Occasion, not <hi>accidentally,</hi> but in the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Course</hi> of Things, of uncomfortable Heats, Animosities and Contentions? Han't Christians, hereby, been divided into Parties, <hi>One saying, I am of</hi> PAUL; <hi>another, I am of</hi> APOLLOS; <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I am of</hi> CEPHAS, to the disturbing the Peace of Churches? Han't People, by this Practice, been led to <hi>glory in Men?</hi> And han't they had <hi>some Men's Persons</hi> so much in <hi>Admiration,</hi> as to <hi>throw unjust Contempt</hi> upon others? But, if more Good had follow'd upon <hi>this Kind</hi> of Preaching
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005151_0103_1016C7509B8B77C8"/>
than really has, it would not hereby be justified; unless it can be made to appear, that <hi>Evil</hi> may not, by the alwise and gracious GOD, be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled for <hi>Good.</hi> The Question ought not to be, whether <hi>Good</hi> has been done in this Way? But whether the <hi>Way it self</hi> is countenanced in the <hi>Bible,</hi> or can be vindicated upon the Principles of uncorrupted Reason? If not; 'tis, in it's Nature, bad, and unalterably so, let its Effects be what they will.</p>
            <p>It is further pleaded, they are <hi>good Men</hi> that go into this Practice: Their Hearts are fir'd with a holy Zeal to serve the Interest of Souls; and 'tis to forward their Salvation, that they thus tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel about Preaching. And are not the Ministers, into whose Labours they enter, <hi>good Men</hi> also? Have they not a Love to the Souls of Men, and ardent Desires of their Salvation? Or, must they be thought selfish and carnal, because they are steady, and keep within the <hi>Rules of Order</hi> in their Endeavours to do good? I know, 'tis a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing for Ministers to go about from Place to Place, professing a compassionate Concern for Sinners, a Readiness to do, or suffer any Thing, to promote their Conversion; especially, if this is accompanied with a <hi>bitter Zeal</hi> against all who can't come into their Measures: And they may be flock'd after, on this Account, and held in great Reputation, as more <hi>holy</hi> than their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, more like to CHRIST, and his <hi>Apostles:</hi> But for my self, I have liv'd too long in the World, and seen too much of the Wickedness of it, to be over-pleased with <hi>high Professions;</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when they are rewarded with <hi>as high popular Applauses.</hi> Pride of Heart; an Itch to come out of Obscurity, and to be thought some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005151_0104_1016C754AF9198D8"/>
a secret Pleasure arising from the <hi>Hosan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> of the Multitude; an undue Self-Love, in some Shape or other, may urge on (as it actually has done in Hundreds of Instances) to as zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pains in preaching the Gospel, as any in these Times, can pretend to; and from as great a seeming Regard to the Good of Men's Souls.</p>
            <p>I mean not by what I here say, to reflect upon ALL those, who have gone up and down the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, making a more than ordinary Shew of Zeal for the spiritual Welfare of their Neighbours; as though they were SOLELY acted, in this Matter, from mean, and base Motives. They may, SOME OF THEM, be as good as they profess to be, for all that I know: But this Conduct of theirs, is not, in my Opinion, the strongest Evidence of their being so: Nor can it be collected from their Zeal to preach in <hi>other Men's Parishes,</hi> that they are better than their Neighbours; or that the Practice they are in, is such as it ought to be. They may be <hi>good Men,</hi> and yet do that which is <hi>Evil:</hi> They may have a Zeal for GOD; and yet, act without sufficient Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Prudence. Meerly their being <hi>good Men,</hi> or <hi>zealous for the Good of Souls,</hi> won't war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant this Conduct of theirs: If it can't be jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified from other Considerations, it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
            <p>'Tis again urg'd in Favour of these <hi>Itinerants,</hi> That <q>when the Time of Reformation was come on, one of the most effectual Things done to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Reformation</hi> in ENGLAND, about the Middle of the former Century, was to send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Kingdom certain <hi>Itinerant Preachers,</hi> with a License to preach the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005151_0105_1016C75743A71EA0"/>
Religion, instead of the <hi>Stuff</hi> with which the Souls of the People had formerly been famished.</q> This, which is a <hi>Quotation</hi> from Dr. MATHER'S <hi>Magnal. Chris. American,</hi> we had printed in the BOSTON Weekly <hi>News-Paper</hi>

            <p>As to the <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Itinerants</hi> here refer'd to, a just Account has been given of them, in the <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>Author</hi> of the above <hi>Quotation,</hi> in the following Words<note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Boston</hi> weekly <hi>News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paper,</hi> Numb. 2018.</note>, <q>At the Time when the Reformation came on, which began with the Reign of King EDWARD the VI, and was carried on by gradual Steps, through the long Reign of Q.

Church were also performed. And whatever Articles of <hi>Belief</hi> the People held, they receiv'd from their <hi>Priests,</hi> by an <hi>implicit</hi> Faith, which naturally produces a blind Obedience. Nor was the State of Things much better with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who were, the greater Part of them, grosly ignorant, and <hi>blind Leaders of the blind.</hi> The chief Learning they had, was from Acquaintance with <hi>School Divinity,</hi> and the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> which, however it might pass for <hi>Science,</hi> in those Times, was <hi>falsly so called.</hi> In short, the <hi>Clergy</hi> were so ignorant, that few of them were able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their <hi>Sermons;</hi> to supply which Defect, certain <hi>Homilies</hi> were set forth by <hi>publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and enjoin'd to be read, instead of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to the People.</q>
            </p>

               <p>This was the true State of Things respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion in <hi>England,</hi> when the Morning of the Reformation began to dawn: Which leads me to say something of the <hi>Character</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the <hi>itinerant Preachers</hi> employ'd in that glorious Work.</p>
               <p>As to their <hi>Character,</hi> they were Men of <hi>eminent</hi> Learning, and substantial Piety; they were <hi>ready Scribes, well instructed in the Things that pertain to the Kingdom of GOD;</hi> and able to communicate their Knowledge to others: In short, they were every Way qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to teach the People the great <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of</hi> Religion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>As to their <hi>Mission,</hi> it was from <hi>proper Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> They did not follow the blind Impulses of a wild Imagination, or <hi>run before they were

sent;</hi> no, your <hi>Quotation</hi> tells us, that they were <hi>licens'd:</hi> They had a regular <hi>Call and Commission</hi> to enter on so great a Work.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The Account Bishop BURNET gives of the Occasion and Rise of these <hi>Itinerants,</hi> in the beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> is very observable. <q>The <hi>Fryars,</hi> says he, used all the Force and Skill of their Industry to raise the People into <hi>Heats,</hi> by passionate and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourses; that both inflam'd a <hi>blind Devotion,</hi> and DREW MONEY:—But there was not that Pains taken, to inform the People of the Hatefulness of Vice, and the Excellency of Holiness, or the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Love of CHRIST, by which Men might be engaged to acknowledge and obey him. And the Design of their Sermons was rather to raise a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Heat,</hi> which they knew afterwards how to manage, than to work a real Reformation on their Hearers. They had also intermixt, with all <hi>divine Truths,</hi> so many Fables, that they were become ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extravagant; and that Alloy had so embased the whole, that there was great Need of a <hi>good Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> to deliver People from those Prejudices, which <hi>these Mixtures</hi> brought upon the whole Christian Doctrine. THEREFORE, the <hi>Reformers</hi> studied with all possible Care, to instruct the People in the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of Christianity, with which they had been so little acquainted.—And much Pains was taken to send <hi>eminent</hi> Preachers over the Nation; not confining them to <hi>particular</hi> Charges, but send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the <hi>King's Licence</hi> up and down to many Places.</q> It follows, <q>BECAUSE in that <hi>ignorant</hi> Time, there could not be found a <hi>sufficient Number</hi> of <hi>good Preachers;</hi> and in a Time of so MUCH JUGLING, they would not trust the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People to every one: <hi>Therefore,</hi> none was to <hi>preach</hi> except he had got a <hi>particular Licence</hi> for it, from the <hi>King,</hi> or his <hi>Diocesan.</hi> But to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie this, a Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> was printed, &amp;c.</q> The whole Account is worth reading.

In the same <hi>Letter,</hi> we have also a just Account of <hi>these Times</hi> and the <hi>present Itinerants.</hi> The Words are, <q>I shall now proceed to say something of the <hi>State of Religion in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, about two Years ago, when the <hi>Itinerant</hi> Way of Preaching began to be practised among us. And if we look into our Church at <hi>that Time,</hi> we shall find them professing the true <hi>protestant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of it, and walking in the <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The Generality of our People were well instructed in divine Things, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion:</hi> Great Numbers of them were Righteous, <hi>Walking in all the Ordinances and Commandments of the LORD blameless.</hi> As to the Ministers in this Land, I believe, it may be truly said of the <hi>greatest Part</hi> of them, that they were Men of <hi>sound Learning,</hi> and <hi>serious Godliness;</hi> they were <hi>skilful in the Word of Righteousness, wise Master-Builders in the House of GOD.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, whatever you may think, their <hi>Sermons</hi> were not <hi>empty Stuff,</hi> tending to starve Men's Souls; but plain, and practical; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore profitable. They took Pains to feed their respective Flocks with Knowledge and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and went before them in a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, holy Conversation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>present Itinerants,</hi> it is remark'd, <q>as certain and obvious, that the most, if not all of them, are swollen and ready to burst with <hi>spiritual</hi> Pride. As to their <hi>Mission,</hi> they have none, except from their own fond Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations. They indeed tell us of an <hi>immediate</hi> Call, and <hi>Assistances</hi> from Heaven; but can we believe them, while the Divisions and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders they create, wherever they come, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005151_0109_1016C76034621860"/>
confute their Pretences. As to their <hi>Furniture</hi> for Preaching, the most of them are <hi>Babes</hi> in Knowledge, meer <hi>Novices</hi> in spiritual Things, Workmen that have great Reason to be ashamed, because they cannot rightly divide the Word of Truth. In one Word, they are so far from being able to instruct Mankind, in the <hi>fundamental</hi> Doctrines of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that, as the venerable Dr. COLMAN, speaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, elegantly expresses it, They can only give some uncertain <hi>Flashes</hi> out of <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Darkness.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>From all which (as the same <hi>Writer</hi> adds) it plainly appears, that this <hi>Quotation</hi> from Dr. MATHER cannot serve the Purpose; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be drawn from it in Favour of our <hi>Itinerants,</hi> and their <hi>disorderly</hi> Practice: And therefore it can be no CHECK to such, as, with great Reason, speak freely against them. I believe Dr. MATHER could never have thought, that this Passage, in his <hi>History,</hi> would ever be wrested to serve such a wretched Design: For whoever reads the <hi>History,</hi> and <hi>other Works,</hi> of that venerable Person, will find, that he forever insists on the vast Importance of a <hi>learned</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and always sets his Face against such <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>mischeivous Itinerants,</hi> as are now caress'd and encouraged; speaking of those <hi>Vagrants,</hi> with a just Severity of Language, and in Terms of the highest Indignation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis still pleaded, from 1 Cor. 3. 21, 21, where it is said, <hi>All Things are your's, whether</hi> PAUL, <hi>or</hi> APPOLLOS, <hi>or</hi> CEPHAS, that<note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. EMERSON'S <hi>Exhortation</hi> to his People. Page 5.</note> "Ministers, with their various Gifts and Labours, are for the Use and
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005151_0110_1016C7621EF385E0"/>
Benefit of the Church and People of GOD." And who ever disputed this? The Question is not, Whether GOD had instituted a Ministry; and this, for the Good of his Church, i. e. The whole Collection of Believers. This is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on all Hands: But the Question is, in what Sense, <hi>particular</hi> Churches that make up the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church, have a <hi>Propriety</hi> in all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; so as that it may be said, they are <hi>your's.</hi> 'Tis only talking at Random, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse People, to tell them, PAUL and APOLLOS and CEPHAS are <hi>your's,</hi> i. e. <hi>All</hi> Ministers are <hi>your's,</hi> without saying, at the same Time, according to some determinate Meaning, How they are so.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle,</hi> in this same Text, says, ALL THINGS <hi>are your's.</hi> But does this destroy private Property, and make all Things common? This, I know, has been pleaded for from this, together with some other Texts; and a Liberty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taken to have Communion, not only with other Men's <hi>Goods,</hi> but <hi>Wives</hi> also. <hi>All</hi> THINGS <hi>are your's</hi> 'Tis a Truth as to <hi>particular</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or Churches, in no Sense but what will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with <hi>every Right,</hi> which GOD has given to one Man, in Distinction from another: Nor may they lay Claim to any Thing, but in <hi>that Way,</hi> and according to <hi>those Rules,</hi> which are laid down in Scripture, or pointed out by the Laws of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> Notwithstanding these Words of the <hi>Apostle, all</hi> THINGS <hi>are yours; particular</hi> Men have their <hi>own</hi> Wives, and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Women their <hi>own</hi> Husbands; this Man has his <hi>own</hi> House or Field, and so has <hi>that:</hi> Nor can they invade one another's Property with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinning against GOD. Christians can be said to have a <hi>Right</hi> in <hi>all</hi> THINGS, only so far, and
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005151_0111_1016C7662ADF4010"/>
under such Restrictions, as GOD has been pleas'd to give them a Title to them.</p>
            <p>So when it is said, PAUL and APOLLOS and CE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHAS, i. e. <hi>all</hi> Ministers are <hi>your's;</hi> the meaning cannot be, that <hi>every particular People</hi> have a Right to <hi>every particular Minister,</hi> in any Sense but what shall consist with the <hi>Order,</hi> GOD has set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in his Church. They can have a <hi>Propriety</hi> in them, only in Subordination to <hi>prior</hi> Rights; and so as that there may be an Harmony among them all. Though it be a Truth, when spoken of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, all Ministers are your's;</hi> yet each <hi>particular</hi> Church has its <hi>own</hi> Pastor, and each <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> his <hi>own</hi> particular Church: And in Vertue of this Relation that subsists between <hi>particular Churches</hi> and <hi>Pastors, each Church</hi> has its <hi>special Rights</hi> with Respect to its <hi>particular Pastor,</hi> and <hi>each Pastor</hi> the like Rights with Respect to his <hi>particular Church;</hi> Nor may these Rights, either of them, he broke in upon, under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that <hi>all</hi> Churches have a Propriety in <hi>all</hi> Ministers. Their Propriety is restrain'd within certain Limits, beyond which, if they extend their Claim, it interferes with other Rights, which can't, without Sin, be invaded.</p>
            <p>The Churches, upon this Principle, <hi>For all Things are your's, whether</hi> PAUL, or APOLLOS, or CEPHAS, have been lately exhorted,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. EMERSON'S <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Page 6.</note> 
               <q>To hear and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove for their Benefit, not only the Minister that is ordained over them, and fix't among them, but as they have Occasion and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity other Ministers also.</q> And have been told,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pag. ibid.</note> 
               <q>If any should attempt to deprive them
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005151_0112_1016C76871BA7FD0"/>
of this their Christian Priviledge, they are guilty of Robbery: They rob them of a very great Priviledge, which the LORD has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased at the dearest Rate; and which he has, in Love to their Souls, confered on them:</q> Whereupon they have been war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note n="†" place="bottom">Page ibid.</note>, "To stand fast in this Liberty of their's wherewith CHRIST has made them free." If the Thing meant by this Exhortation, which was "apprehended most needful and seasonable at this Day",<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               </note> be only this that <hi>particular</hi> Churches have a <hi>Propriety</hi> in <hi>other</hi> Ministers, their Gifts and Labours, according to <hi>Gospel-Order,</hi> and so as not to Infringe on the <hi>Rights</hi> of their <hi>own Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> or <hi>other particular Churches,</hi> 'tis what all, so far as I know, are agreed in; And 'twas per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly needless to found an Alarm, as though <hi>this Liberty</hi> of the Churches was in Danger. But if the Thing aimed at is, To give Countenance to that rambling about from Parish to Parish, which some Ministers have come into, to the <hi>Uneasiness</hi> of their <hi>own People,</hi> to the raising <hi>Factions</hi> among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People, and to the <hi>Invasion</hi> of the <hi>just Rights</hi> of the <hi>Pastors</hi> among whose <hi>People</hi> they have gone: I say, if this be the Thing intended, the <hi>Scripture</hi> upon which this <hi>Exhortation</hi> is founded, has been grosly abused: Nor indeed could an <hi>Exhortation,</hi> to <hi>this Purpose,</hi> have had its Rise from it, but in a <hi>mistaken</hi> and <hi>perverted</hi> Sense.</p>
            <p>I complain not of People's hearing Ministers that are not their <hi>own,</hi> as they may occasionally happen among them; Nay, I object not against <hi>one</hi> Minister's coming among the People of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:005151_0113_1016C76A08C12278"/>
on Purpose that they might have the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his Gifts and Labours; provided there be a mutual Agreement between <hi>all</hi> the Parties concern'd, and the Case such as may properly call for such an Expedient: But for Ministers to make a Business of going out of their <hi>own,</hi> into <hi>other Men's</hi> Parishes, unask'd; or, at the Desire of only some disaffected People; And this, in known Opposition to the <hi>settled</hi> Pastors: it's contrary to all <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as <hi>Scripture,</hi> and subversive of all <hi>Order</hi> in the Churches; Especially, when they carry the Matter so far as to <hi>creep into private Houses,</hi> when they can't any longer force themselves into the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate such Things against the <hi>fixt</hi> Ministers, as tend to leaven the Minds of their People with Prejudices against them, and hinder their further Advantage from their Labours. Some may think highly of this Manner of Conduct, and "bless GOD for the many Sermons that have been preach'd by such Ministers"<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 7.</note>; but for my Part, I have not <hi>so learned CHRIST,</hi> nor the <hi>Order</hi> of his Gospel. And I shall be much mistaken, if the bad Effects of this Method of Conduct, don't make some Men see with other Eyes than they do at present.</p>
            <p>'Tis granted in this Exhortation<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 7.</note> 
               <q>That Ministers ought to be well perswaded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>these Strangers</hi> that come among us, that they are Men of Knowledge, Prudence and Piety; Men of good Principles and Morals, and that they have a Call to visit us, before we invite them to preach to our People.</q>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:005151_0114_1016B7F218F8BB10"/>
And will any have the Face to Pretend, that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Care has been taken upon this Head? Nay, where 'Ministers have not been satisfied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, either the Knowledge, or Prudence, or call, some Persons have had to come into their Parishes, have they not thrust themselves in notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And han't the Ministers, instead of being well thought of for their <hi>Caution,</hi> been reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as OPPOSERS of the <hi>Work of GOD?</hi> And what is it but to upbraid Ministers, to tell them, <q>they ought to be well satisfied about <hi>these Strangers</hi> that come among them,</q> when, if they an't satisfied, they shall be call'd all the bad <hi>Names</hi> that can be thought of? Han't this commonly been the Case? Can it be denied?</p>
            <p>Those Ministers, I should think, who don't see through the <hi>Propriety,</hi> or <hi>Reasonableness,</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> of Ministers going about into <hi>other Men's</hi> Parishes, have just the same Right not to invite them into their Pulpits, as those have to take them in, who think well of this Practice: And why should their <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> be invaded? Why should strange Ministers force themselves upon them? Is it not an Usurpation on their <hi>Rights</hi> as <hi>Pastors</hi> to <hi>particular</hi> Churches? Does it not lead to Alienations and Contentions? Does it not naturally tend to hinder the Usefulness of such Ministers among their <hi>own</hi> People?</p>
            <p>It may be insinuated, as though their not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving these <hi>Itinerants</hi> was owing to the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of "a Spirit that lusteth to <hi>envy."</hi> And might it not as justly be insinuated, as though this <hi>Itinerating</hi> Disposition might have its Rise from a Spirit too much puffed up with <hi>Pride<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> But however this be, I do not think, those who
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005151_0115_1016C770756693F8"/>
are for <hi>Order</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, and keeping Things from running into Confusion, have any great Reason to <hi>envy</hi> those, who, from <hi>among our selves,</hi> have been most noted for their travelling up and down the Country to preach. We gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally know who they are, and what <hi>Character</hi> they bear in the World; and if dispos'd to <hi>Envy,</hi> these are some of the <hi>last</hi> Men who would excite it. And I am clearly of the Mind, that if <q>the Spirit and Disposition of the <hi>holy and humble</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle PAUL more universally prevail'd among Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</q>, they would not so often imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Men of <hi>so much more Importance</hi> than they really are; nor would they, from this vain Conceit they have of themselves, so often go out of their <hi>own,</hi> into the <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>others; boasting of Things beyond their Measure, and made ready to their Hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had thought here to have left this <hi>Head;</hi> but can't do it without first expressing my Surprize at the late <hi>Ordination</hi> of a Person <hi>to go about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as an Itinerant Preacher.</hi> The Account we have in the <hi>Boston Evening-Post</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. 381.</note>, <q>We have lately heard from YORK, that on, or about the 13 of <hi>July</hi> last, one Mr. D—L R—s, a <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Methodist,</hi> so call'd, summon'd together a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn (and we think) unlawful Assembly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the <hi>Elders,</hi> and pretended <hi>Messengers,</hi> of some of the neighbouring Churches, <hi>to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the said</hi> R—s <hi>at large, to be a vagrant Preacher to the People of GOD in this Land;</hi>—in which Transaction we hear, that the Rev'd Messieurs M—Y, W—E, J. R—S and G—N
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005151_0116_1016C773090A3580"/>
resolutely proceeded, although some other of the neighbouring Ministers bore their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against such an irregular Action.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That late venerable Man of GOD, whose Praise is in all our Churches, Dr. INCREASE MATHRR, has given the World his Thoughts at large upon such a Transaction as this; which I shall here present to the Reader.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Order of the Churches in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND <hi>vindicated,</hi> he proposes this Question<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Page 101. And onwards.</note>, <q>May a Man be <hi>ordained</hi> a <hi>Pastor,</hi> except to a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Church?</q> In Answer whereto, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, that <q>no Man ought to be <hi>ordain'd</hi> a <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> except to a <hi>particular</hi> Church.</q> And for these Reasons.</p>
            <q>
               <p n="1">1. We have no Instance in the Scripture of <hi>ordinary</hi> Officers ordain'd, except unto a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Flock. Act 14. 23. <hi>They ordained El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by Election</hi> (so does the <hi>Geneva</hi> Translation read the Words truly enough, as that learned Knight, Sir <hi>Norton</hi> KNATCHBULL, has critically evinced<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad. in Lib. N. T.</hi>
                  </note>) <hi>in every Church.</hi> PAUL left it in Charge with TITUS, that he should <hi>ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every City,</hi> Tit. 1. 5. He was not to ordain them to be <hi>Individua vaga;</hi> but a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Place, a City wherein was some Church, was assign'd to them to labour in. He might not (as Mr. BAYNES<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Altare</hi> Damascen. Page 209.</note>, and from him DIDOCLAVIUS, speaks) ordain Elders as the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversities
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:005151_0117_1016C774985D5DA0"/>
create <hi>Doctors</hi> of <hi>Physick,</hi> without assigning them any Patients; or as they make <hi>Master of Art,</hi> without providing for them any Scholars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Flock</hi> are <hi>Relates;</hi> and therefore one cannot be without the other.—To say that a <hi>wandring Levite,</hi> who has no Flock is a Pastor, is as good Sense as to say, that he that has no Children is a Father, and that the Man who has no Wife is a Husband: Nor may it be pretended, that the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is his Flock; for,</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Pastor is under an Obligation to <hi>feed every one</hi> that is of the Flock, he is a Pastor unto. Acts 20. 28. <hi>Take Heed therefore to your selves, and to all the Flock over which the HOLY GHOST has made you Overseers.</hi> Is any Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to feed <hi>all that Flock</hi> of the <hi>Church Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> visible? A Minister must give an Account concerning every Soul in that Flock, he is the Pastor of. Heb. 13. 17. They that say, they are Pastors of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> may do well to think, what Account they can give of the ten Thousands of Souls belonging to their Flock, that were never instructed, nor fed by them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Supposing a Man to have a <hi>particular</hi> Church to which he is related, if he is a Pastor to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches besides that, then it is not in the Power of that Church to deprive him of his <hi>pastoral Office.</hi> If they should reject him and that deservedly from being their Pastor, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ay pretend, I am a Pastor of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and will be so, do you do your Worst.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005151_0118_1016C77675EC8CD8"/>
This favours of the <hi>Papist's indelible Character,</hi> who pretend, if a Man has once been ordain'd, he can never be a <hi>Laic</hi> again. Thus a Person who is justly not only <hi>depos'd</hi> from his <hi>Office,</hi> but <hi>excommunicated,</hi> may be a <hi>Pastor still.</hi>—Our <hi>Discipline</hi> declares, not only such as never were related to a <hi>particular</hi> Flock, but such as have been, but now are not so related, to be no <hi>Church Officers.</hi> The Words, in the <hi>Platform,</hi> Chap. 9. Sect. 7. are, He that is clearly loosed from his <hi>Office Relation</hi> unto <hi>that Church</hi> whereof he was a Minister, cannot be looked at as an <hi>Officer,</hi> nor <hi>perform any Act of Office, in any other Church,</hi> unless he be again <hi>orderly called into Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. When <hi>Ordinations at large</hi> did, with <hi>other Corruptions,</hi> creep into the Church, a <hi>whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> found it necessary, not only to bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against <hi>that Practice,</hi> but to declare <hi>such Ordinations</hi> to be <hi>void</hi> and <hi>null,</hi> and the <hi>Ordainers liable to censure.</hi> It is well observed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Writer of the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> of TRENT,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hist. Trid. Conc. L. 6. Page 550.</note> that "in the golden Times of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, <hi>no Persons were ordain'd but to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Ministry;</hi> but that this pious Institution was soon <hi>corrupted,</hi> Bishops <hi>ordaining</hi> Men that had no <hi>Election by any Church."</hi> This caused great Confusion, as the <hi>Magdeburgensian Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> have noted. As a Remedy, the <hi>Council</hi> of CALCEDON made a Decree against all such Ordinations. The sixth <hi>Canon</hi> of that <hi>Synod</hi> declares, <hi>That if any Man should be ordain'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi> that is, to the <hi>Catholick,</hi> without Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005151_0119_10180739C133CCE0"/>
to a <hi>particular</hi> Church, <hi>the Imposition of Hands, which he has received, shall be null; and that he shall serve in the Church to the Dishonour of them that have ordained him.</hi> This Decree was confirmed by other <hi>Synods</hi> afterwards; so that it became a <hi>general Rule</hi> in the Church, that no Man should be ordained without a <hi>Title.</hi> But the forementioned <hi>Historian</hi> (with many others) takes Notice that this Rule was in Process of Time perverted. For whereas, at first, to have a <hi>Title</hi> was to have a <hi>particular</hi> Church, afterwards to have a <hi>Title</hi> was to have Money. The <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church of ENGLAND will not permit any one to be ordain'd without a <hi>Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The impleaded <hi>Ordinations</hi> are contrary to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of our <hi>eminent Divines,</hi> and to the <hi>Practice</hi> of some of the best reformed <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> JUNIUS<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Animadvers.</hi> in BELLARM. Cap. 3. &amp;c. 7.</note> declares his Approbation of the mention'd <hi>Canon</hi> of the CALCEDON <hi>Synod;</hi> and that since an <hi>Elder</hi> is not ordained to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry <hi>absolutely,</hi> but to the Ministry of this, or that <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> it is fit the <hi>Church</hi> should be concern'd in the Ordination; and, that in the <hi>apostolical</hi> Times, in the Ordination of a Minister, there was first a <hi>Cheirotonia,</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> by the People; and then a <hi>Cheirothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> or <hi>Imposition</hi> of Hands; that these two were always join'd together as the antecedent and Consequent. Mr. CARTWRIGHT<note n="†" place="bottom">2 <hi>Reply.</hi> Page 272.</note> says, that after <hi>Election</hi> follows Ordination, which is a solemn investing or putting a Minister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Possession of <hi>that Office</hi> whereunto he was before chosen. To the like Purpose does WHITAKER speak. It is needless, and would be endless, to heap up Testimonies concerning this, since it is a common received Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>our Divines,</hi> that <hi>the Election of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister by the Church should precede his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>I shall add to what the <hi>Doctor</hi> has said, That there has appear'd, in all Ages, more or less of a Disposition, in <hi>some</hi> Persons, to think themselves <hi>qualified,</hi> and <hi>called,</hi> to act as tho 'they were <hi>Pastors,</hi> not to <hi>particular</hi> Churches only, but <hi>all the Flocks</hi> in a <hi>Neighbourhood,</hi> or <hi>Province.</hi>

               <p>It agreeth not with the Word of GOD, that <hi>Bishops</hi> should be <hi>Pastors of Pastors,</hi> Pastors of <hi>many Flocks,</hi> and yet without a <hi>certain Flock,</hi> and without <hi>ordinary Teaching.</hi>

            <p>It may, as the Practice with us is <hi>new,</hi> carry with it a good Face, and be readily encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; especially, for the Sake of <hi>some Men,</hi> who may be tho't <hi>more holy than their Brethren;</hi> but 'tis the same Evil <hi>now,</hi> it always has been, and will be productive of the like <hi>bad Effects;</hi> some of which we have already seen and felt: And I pray GOD, they may not prepare the Way for still <hi>greater.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>next</hi> Thing I shall take Notice of, as what I can't but think of dangerous Tendency, is <hi>that Terror</hi> so many have been the Subjects of; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005151_0124_101806F9C10ECC38"/>
it self in <hi>strange Effects</hi> upon the <hi>Body,</hi> such as <hi>swooning away</hi> and <hi>falling to the Ground,</hi> where Persons have lain, for a Time, speechless and motionless; bitter <hi>Shriekings</hi> and <hi>Screamings; Convulsion-like Tremblings</hi> and <hi>Agitations, Strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glings</hi> and <hi>Tumblings,</hi> which, in some Instances, have been attended with Indecencies. I shan't mention: None of which Effects seem to have been <hi>accidental,</hi> nor yet peculiar to some <hi>particular Places</hi> or <hi>Constitutions;</hi> but have been common all over the Land. There are few Places, where there has been any considerable religious Stir, but it has been accompanied, more or less, with these Appearances. Numbers in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 10, 20, 30, would be in this Condition at a Time; Nay, Hundreds in some Places, to the opening such a <hi>horrible Scene</hi> as can scarce be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in Words.</p>
            <p>The Account, those, who have been under these Circumstances, give of themselves is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Some say, they were surprized and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and insensibly wrought upon, they can't tell how: Others, that they had presented to their View, at the Time, a Sight of their Sins, in all their Number and Desert: Others, that they saw Hell, as it were, naked before them, and Destruction without a Covering; and that it seemed to them as though they were just falling into it: Others, that they imagined the Devils were about them, and ready to lay hold on them, and draw them away to Hell. The more general Account is, that they were fill'd with great Anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety and Distress, having upon their Minds an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powering Sense of Sin, and Fear of divine Wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:005151_0125_101806FBDD090B60"/>
But whatever was the Cause, these <hi>bodily Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> were, at first, highly thought of by many; yea, look'd upon as <hi>evident Signs</hi> of the <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Presence of the</hi> HOLY GHOST. Hence, it was common in one Congregation, to tell of these wonderful Things, as they had appear'd in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to pray for the like Testimony of the divine Power, to give GOD Thanks when they had it, and lament it when religious Exercises were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and no such Effects followed: And too much Encouragement has been given People, to depend on these Things as <hi>sufficient Tokens</hi> of that <hi>Sense of Sin,</hi> which is of the <hi>Operation</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD.</p>
            <p>I have now <hi>Letters</hi> by me, from different Parts of the Country, all concurring in this Account; and wrote by Persons of as good Character as most among us, and upon their own Knowledge. One, after he had given a Narrative of the <hi>Strange Appearance</hi> he had been present at, in all the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations</hi> and <hi>Out-cries</hi> above describ'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in these Words, <q>But what appear'd to me most dangerous and hurtful was, that Mr.—(the Minister through whose Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment these Things were effected) laid very much Stress on these <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> as though they were <hi>sure Marks,</hi> or, at least, <hi>sufficient E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences</hi> of a just <hi>Conviction of Sin,</hi> on the one Hand: or, on the other, of that <hi>Joy there is in Believing,</hi> and so of an Interest in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God.</q> Another, after an Account of the <hi>Groaning, crying out, falling down and scream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> he had been a Witness to, in one of our Places of Worship, among other Things, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, <q>That these Things were encouraged by Mr.—(a travelling Preacher) and the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005151_0126_101806FFB6838930"/>
Minister of the Town, who esteemed them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Evidences</hi> of the Operation of the BLESSED SPIRIT; which appeared by all their Discourse.</q> A third, having exhibited a Relation of the like Effects, adds upon it, <q>I perceived by the Preacher's Discourse, that he suppos'd all these Things, the Effect of a <hi>strong Sense of Truth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd upon the Minds of the Auditors, by the HOLY GHOST.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And these Accounts perfectly harmonise with the <hi>Pleas,</hi> which have been made, both from the <hi>Press</hi> and <hi>Pulpit,</hi> in Justification of this <hi>Appearance</hi> in Religion. We have been told of the <hi>falling down</hi> of the JAILOUR, and of SAUL, afterwards PAUL; we have been minded of the <hi>Trembling</hi> of FELIX, and of the <hi>Three Thousand</hi> in the <hi>Acts,</hi> who were <hi>pricked in the Heart</hi> by PETER'S <hi>Sermon:</hi> And the State of <hi>unconverted</hi> Sinners has been represented to be such, that it ought to be wondered at, these Effects are not universal, rather than that some of them have been seen among us.</p>
            <p>But these Pleas notwithstanding, I could never yet see Reason, I confess, to entertain a good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of these <hi>religious Fears,</hi> with their <hi>Effects</hi> visible on Men's Bodies, considered <hi>by the Lump.</hi> I mean not by what I here say, to express a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of that <hi>Fear,</hi> excited from a <hi>just Sense of Sin;</hi> which, in Respect of <hi>adult</hi> Persons, is <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> previous to their Conversion. The <hi>first Operation</hi> of the blessed SPIRIT upon the Minds of <hi>such Sinners</hi> usually is, to awaken their <hi>Fear</hi> from a <hi>Perception of Sin,</hi> and <hi>Consciousness of Guilt,</hi> as I have largely exprest my self, upon this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter elsewhere: But then, it ought to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005151_0127_101807025D288DC8"/>
remembred, the Passion of <hi>Fear</hi> may be excited, not only from a just Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Truth to the Mind by the SPIRIT of GOD, but from the <hi>natural Influence</hi> of <hi>awful Words</hi> and <hi>frightful Gestures.</hi> Even where the Torments of another World are the Object of Fear, the Passion it self may be mov'd, and to such a Degree too, as to appear in all the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Surprize;</hi> and yet, the <hi>Origin</hi> of it be no other, than a <hi>mechanical Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> on <hi>animal Nature:</hi> And this, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to think, has been too generally the Case, in Respect of those <hi>Fears,</hi> and the Effects of them, which have been so much talk'd of among us. A good Number, I trust, have been wro't upon by the <hi>proper Influence of Truth,</hi> duly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed upon their Minds by the <hi>Divine SPIRIT;</hi> but in Regard of a far <hi>greater</hi> Number, I have no other Thought of their <hi>religious</hi> Fears, disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in their <hi>Cries,</hi> and <hi>Shrieks,</hi> and <hi>falling down,</hi> than a mere <hi>sensitive Commotion;</hi> such a Sort of Surprize and Astonishment as is affected, not by a rational Conviction of Truth, but a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and strong Impression on the <hi>animal Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> My Reasons are these that follow,</p>
            <p>'Tis with me, an Objection of some Weight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Divinity</hi> of these <hi>bodily Effects,</hi> that they have been, in all Ages, so <hi>rare</hi> among <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> Christians; while among others, of a contrary Character, they have, all along, been <hi>common.</hi> So it was with the MONTANISTS of old; with the GERMAN-ENTHUSIASTS, in the beginning of the Reformation; and with the FRENCH-PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS, within the Memory of many now living: And so it was with the QUAKERS. They had their Name indeed from the <hi>trembling</hi> and <hi>shaking</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:005151_0128_101807040D589870"/>
ordinarily fell into, as though they were all over convulsed: Nor can there be given more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Instances of <hi>Groaning,</hi> and <hi>Foaming,</hi> and <hi>Roaring,</hi> than from these People; Whereas, if we turn our View to the more <hi>sober</hi> Part of Christians, we shall be at a loss to find <hi>Examples</hi> in this Kind.</p>
            <p>A noted <hi>Writer</hi> on the Times<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. EDWARDS, in his late Book, <hi>Some Tho'ts on the Revival of Religion in</hi> New-England.</note> seems to have been at a pritty Deal of Pains to collect <hi>Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> But how few has he been able to produce, though he had the whole <hi>Christian World</hi> before him, for more than <hi>Seventeen Hundred Years?</hi> Nor are those he has brought to View so much to the Case as might have been expected.</p>
            <p>The first Instance is of a <hi>single</hi> Person, the exellent Mr. BOLTON,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 25.</note> 
               <q>who being awakened by the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the famous Mr. PERKINS, was subject to such Terrors as threw him on the Ground, and caused him to roar with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; and the Pangs of the New-Birth in him were such, that he lay pale and without Sense, like one dead; as we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture,</hi> the 5th Edition, Page 103. 104.</q> These are the Words of this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> How it came about, I know not; but he has very much mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his <hi>Author,</hi> in representing from him Mr. PERKINS as the Person, by whose <hi>Preaching</hi> Mr. BOLTON was <hi>subjected to Terrors that threw him to the Ground;</hi> for it is not so much as insinuated in the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture,</hi> either that Mr.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005151_0129_1018070A2DC47DE0"/>
PERKINS was the Instrument of Mr. BOLTON'S <hi>Terrors,</hi> or that he was ever thrown into them in the <hi>Time of Preaching;</hi> unless the <hi>Edition</hi> I use (the <hi>Second</hi>) is different from <hi>that,</hi> this <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> has in his Hands, which I question, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have now before me the <hi>Life of Mr.</hi> BOLTON, from whence the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture</hi> took his Account: In which, one Mr. PEACOCK is spoken of as the <hi>Instrument</hi> of his Conversion; and 'tis ascribed to his <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance</hi> with this godly Man, and not to his <hi>Preaching,</hi> or the <hi>Preaching</hi> of any other Person whatever, that he was awakened to a Sense of his Sins.</p>
            <p>Nor is it so clear to me, that Mr. BOLTON, <hi>literally</hi> speaking, was <hi>thrown to the Ground,</hi> or <hi>reared out,</hi> or <hi>lay like one dead.</hi> The <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture</hi> has given the World, not the very <hi>Words,</hi> but what <hi>he took to be the Sense,</hi> of the <hi>Writer</hi> of Mr. BOLTON'S <hi>Life;</hi> and this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> has done the same by the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture.</hi> The best Way therefore of judging, in this Case, will be from the <hi>very Words</hi> of the <hi>original Writer</hi> himself; which are these, <q>The first News he heard of GOD, was not by any soft and still Voice, but in terrible Tempests and Thunder; the LORD running upon him as a Giant, taking him by the Neck, and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to Pieces as he did JOB; beating him to the very Ground, as he did PAUL, by laying before him the ugly Visage of his Sins, which lay so heavy on him, as he roared for Grief of Heart, and so affrightened him, as (I have heard him say) he arose out of his Bed in the Night, for very Anguish of Spirit. And to augment his spiritual Misery, he was
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005151_0130_1018070CFB4366E8"/>
exercised with foul Temptations, <hi>horribilia de</hi> DEO, <hi>terribilia de fide.</hi>
               </q> And these are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to have been so vehement upon him, that, with LUTHER, <q>The very Venom of them drank up his Spirits, and his Body seemed dead, that neither Speech, Sense, Blood, or Heat appeared in him. And this, it's said, Continued for many Months.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis obvious at first Sight, that <hi>some</hi> of the Language here used is <hi>figurative,</hi> and to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as such, and not <hi>literally;</hi> as where the LORD is said to have <hi>run upon him as a Giant;</hi> where he is said to have been <hi>taken by the Neck and shaken to Pieces:</hi> As also where his <hi>Body</hi> is represented as <hi>seemingly dead, without Sense, Blood, or Heat.</hi> The <hi>Idea</hi> intended to be conveyed is not, <q>That the Pangs of the New-Birth in him were such, as that he lay pale, and without Sense, like one dead.</q> i. e. According to the <hi>Letter</hi> of these Words, and as is commonly the Case in these Times. The Meaning is evidently this, and only this, that his Distress was so <hi>great,</hi> and of <hi>such Continuance,</hi> that it had a visible Effect on his <hi>Body,</hi> to make him look <hi>pale,</hi> and like one in a <hi>languid State.</hi> And if any should be dispos'd to think, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of this <hi>Author's</hi> Words is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be regarded than the <hi>Letter,</hi> when he speaks of Mr. BOLTON, as <hi>beat to the very Ground,</hi> and <hi>roaring for Grief of Heart,</hi> I don't know that they would be to blame; especially, as such a Construction of his Words is the only one, that would, perhaps, have been thought of, if it had not been for what has happened among ourselves. He, no Doubt, design'd to exhibit this <hi>Gentleman</hi> as an Instance of one, who was in <hi>great spiritual
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:005151_0131_1018070E833096E0"/>
Distress;</hi> but that he mean't any Thing further, is not, to me, so evident as to be beyond Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>Nor is <hi>this Kind</hi> of spiritual Trouble uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in Respect of Persons of a <hi>like Character</hi> with Mr. BOLTON, before his Concern for his Sins. For 'tis observable, and particularly remark'd by the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Page 231, 232.</note>, that he was <q>
                  <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently prophane; a horrid Swearer; and much accustomed to mock at Holiness, and those who most shined therein; particularly, that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man of GOD Mr.</hi> PERKINS.</q> The <hi>Writer of his Life</hi> adds<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 12. 14.</note>, that <q>
                  <hi>he loved Stage-Plays, Cards and Dice; was a Sabbath-Breaker, a Boon-Companion, and one that for the Sake of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had actually accepted of a Motion to go over to the Church of</hi> ROME.</q> And has it not been usual, in all Ages, for such <hi>great Sinners,</hi> when brought to a Sense of their Sins, to be <hi>greatly pained</hi> in their Minds? There is nothing <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> in the Case of Mr. BOLTON, unless, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Words, he <hi>roared out,</hi> and was <hi>thrown down to the Earth;</hi> which, as I said, can't certainly be collected from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of speaking us'd by the <hi>Writer of his Life:</hi> Though if it could, it ought to be remembred, his Concern lasted for <hi>many Months;</hi> and by this continued Pressure on his Spirit, his <hi>Body</hi> was reduced to an <hi>ill State,</hi> and it might be thus with his <hi>Mind also.</hi> And under these Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though his Trouble was of a <hi>divine Origin,</hi> there might be a Mixture in it of <hi>human Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> It might be owing to <hi>himself,</hi> and not to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:005151_0132_10180711EA9EF320"/>
the SPIRIT of GOD, its arising to an undesirable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess: Which is quite different from what is supposed to be the Case in these Times; <abbr>viz.</abbr> That 'tis by the <hi>immediate Power</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, that such Fears are excited in the Minds of Persons, as that they are, at once, <hi>struck to the Earth,</hi> or forc'd to <hi>scream out.</hi>

               <q>I am persuaded, that many of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> formerly, were deluded by such <hi>Voices</hi> and <hi>Impulses,</hi> from the <hi>impure Spirit,</hi> which they mistook for the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD; many of them having been <hi>grosly ignorant,</hi> and so fitted to entertain such <hi>Delusions of the Devil,</hi> as I then was.</q>

It was then a frequent Thing for many to be so <hi>extraordinarily</hi> seized with <hi>Terror</hi> in hearing of the Word, by the SPIRIT of GOD, that they <hi>fell down,</hi> and were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Church, who afterwards prov'd most solid and lively Christians: As the Author of the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture</hi> informs us, Pa. 185.</q> I should have been glad, if <hi>this Author</hi> had been a little more particular in his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; because so far as I can find, (and I have been at the Pains to consult all the <hi>Writers</hi> I could meet with, in some of the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>largest</hi> Libraries in NEW-ENGLAND, upon the religious Affairs of SCOTLAND) He only has recorded this Story; and he has done it so <hi>generally,</hi> that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be argued from it. He has said, 'tis true, it was in <hi>hearing the Word,</hi> they were seiz'd with this <hi>extraordinary</hi> Terror: But how the Word was preached, either as to <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Manner,</hi> he does not declare; which is a <hi>weighty Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> in <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>this Nature,</hi> as we shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently see, from what I have to say upon the <hi>like Effects</hi> among our selves. He has likewise said, "They <hi>afterwards</hi> prov'd <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>lively.</hi> Christians:" But how were they at the Time? This is a material Question. For if they were like others, among whom these <hi>same Effects</hi> have appear'd, at other Times, and in other Parts of the World, they may justly be rank'd with them; at lest, while under the Influence of these Things. And there is the more Reason for such a Question as I have put, because this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> has himself given an Intimation, as though <hi>these Effects,</hi> at the Time when they happened, were, by some attributed to <hi>another Cause</hi> than
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005151_0135_1018071CD3DBA610"/>
that which is divine. His Words are these<note n="*" place="bottom">

And though I deny not, that "many were wonderfully affected under the Preaching of FAREL and VIRET," yet I must be excused, if I han't the best Opinion of the <hi>whole of this Affection;</hi> Especially, as excited by FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REL: For he was a Man zealous even to <hi>Fury;</hi>

            <p>The next Account is from IRELAND, in 1628; But as the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture</hi> has taken no Notice of any <hi>strange bodily Effects,</hi> unless those may be so called, which relate to the People's making <hi>little Use of Meat, Drink, or Sleep, and not feeling the Need thereof, through a Sense of GOD;</hi> These only are mentioned, but in a more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Manner, than by the <hi>original Writer.</hi> For <hi>he</hi> speaks of <hi>some</hi> only whose Case this was, not <hi>many.</hi> And <hi>he</hi> tells us, in <hi>general, how long</hi> it was they went without a <hi>full Supply</hi> of these Recruits, and does not leave the Matter at <hi>large.</hi> It was, in that Day, according to him, a sweet easy Thing for Christians to go 30, 40 Miles, to the solemn Communions, and to <hi>continue there from the Time they came, till they returned,</hi> with but little of these Supplies; and this, in Regard of SOME, without their feeling the Need thereof, their Souls were so filled with a Sense of GOD;
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005151_0138_1018072795943738"/>
which is no incredible Account, unless they <hi>tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried longer,</hi> or <hi>eat,</hi> or <hi>drank,</hi> or <hi>slept,</hi> in a less <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,</hi> than need be supposed.</p>
            <p>The Story of CATHERINE BRETTERGH, I pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with this Remark only, that if nothing had appear'd in <hi>these Times,</hi> but what is here record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her, I believe no serious Person would have cried out of <hi>Wildness</hi> and <hi>Distraction;</hi> tho' perhaps, they might have thought, there had been, in such Instances, some <hi>Mixture</hi> of that which is <hi>Humane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are the Instances brought from the <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture:</hi> And I should have had, I own, a much better Opinion of them, if the <hi>Author had not betrayed,</hi> by many of the Stories contain'd in his Book, a Turn of Mind, too easily disposing him to a <hi>Belief</hi> of <hi>such Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries,</hi> as few besides himself would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the World: Nor can I account for it, that, among all the <hi>wonderful</hi> Things he has recorded as Examples of a <hi>prophetical</hi> and <hi>apostolic</hi> Spirit, not so much as one is mentioned; unless it was thought, the mentioning of <hi>these</hi> might have lessen'd the Credit of the <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Gentleman</hi> now presents us with a <hi>Letter</hi> from his honoured Father, wherein we are told, from a <hi>Letter</hi> he saw, which came from SCOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, that at the Preaching of a Sermon in EDIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BURG, the People were so affected, that there was a <hi>great and loud Cry through the Assembly.</hi> And if the <hi>Fact</hi> be allow'd, is it possible, from such a general Account, to form a Judgment, as to its true <hi>Origin?</hi> That there have been <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crys,</hi> in <hi>Congregations,</hi> in diverse Parts of the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005151_0139_1018072AE4170768"/>
World, and at diverse Times, every Body knows that is acquainted with the History of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>wonderful Narrative</hi> has mentioned a considerable Number of such; but an Account of those <hi>Out-crys</hi> are here expected, which may justly be supposed to be of a <hi>Divine Rise.</hi> And can this be determined, unless we know something in particular, of the <hi>Means, Manner,</hi> and <hi>after-Effects?</hi> 'Tis impossible. And the same may be said of what is further related a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the famous Mr. ROGERS of DEDHAM in ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND; tho' he was such a <hi>Speaker,</hi> that if, under his Preaching, People had sometimes cried out, it ought not to be at once concluded, that it was owing to the <hi>extraordinary Power of GOD.</hi> For this is an <hi>Effect, Voice</hi> and <hi>Action</hi> may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times produce, as we shall see by and by.</p>
            <p>The Account from Mr. FLAVEL, I leave as it stands, with only saying, that good Men may differ in their Sentiments as to the <hi>Cause</hi> of such <hi>Effects;</hi> and if any should think, they are not to be <hi>wholly</hi> ascribed to a <hi>divine Influence,</hi> I would not be too peremptory in saying, their Judgment was not according to Truth.</p>
            <p>The Persons "in NORTHAMPTON, and some of the <hi>neighbouring Towns,</hi> who formerly <hi>cried out,</hi> and <hi>fell down,"</hi> I never heard of 'till now: Nor of those, "whose Flesh waxed cold and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, whose Hands were clinch'd, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies set into Convulsions:" Neither do I think, that such Accounts tend much to the Credit of Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:005151_0140_1018072FC4B11C60"/>
But these Instances notwithstanding, and the <hi>most</hi> that can be made of the foregoing ones, it must be own'd, that such <hi>bodily Effects</hi> as have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Land, have <hi>always</hi> been <hi>rare</hi> among <hi>sober</hi> Christians: Whereas, They are the <hi>very Things,</hi> by which, those of <hi>another Complexion</hi> have ever been distinguished. Whole Volumes have been wrote containing Accounts in this Kind: And whatever <hi>strange Effects,</hi> upon Men's <hi>Bodies,</hi> have been <hi>common</hi> among us, the <hi>same</hi> have been <hi>common</hi> also among <hi>this</hi> Sort of Persons, in all Parts, and Ages, of the World: Nor is there any Fact more notorious in the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> But this I mention only as a <hi>Circumstance</hi> worthy of Consideration with some others, that are to follow. Wherefore to go on,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Way</hi> in which <hi>these Fears</hi> have been excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in many Places, is not, in my Opinion, the best Evidence in Favour of them. People have been too much applied to, as though the Preacher rather aimed at putting their Passions into a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than filling them with such a <hi>reasonable</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude, as is the Effect of a just Exhibition of the Truths of GOD to their Understandings. I have myself been present, when an Air of Seriousness reigned visibly through a whole Congregation: They were all Silence and Attention; having their Eye fastned on the Minister, as though they would catch every Word that came from his Mouth: And yet, because they did not <hi>cry out,</hi> or <hi>swoon away,</hi> they were unbraided with their <hi>Hardness of Heart</hi> and rank'd among those who were <hi>Sermon-proof, Gospel-glutted;</hi> and every Topic made Use of, with all the <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> the Speaker was Master of, to bring forward a general <hi>Shriek</hi> in the Assembly: Nay, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005151_0141_1018073204108700"/>
to give the People a plain Intimation of what he wanted, this same Preacher sometimes told them of the <hi>wonderful Effects</hi> wrought by the Sermon, he was then preaching; how in <hi>such</hi> a Congregation, they were all melted and dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and in another so over-poured, that they could not help <hi>screaming out,</hi> or <hi>falling down,</hi> as though they had been <hi>struck dead.</hi> Nay one of the Preachers, in this <hi>new Way,</hi> was so open some Months ago, as in plain Words, to call upon the People to <hi>cry out,</hi> and plead with them to do so: This he did <hi>three</hi> several Times in one Sermon, and had upon it so many loud Cries. And 'tis too well known to need much to be said upon it, that the <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> whose preaching has been <hi>most remarkably</hi> accompanied with these <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries,</hi> not only use, in their Addresses to the People, all the <hi>terrible Words</hi> they can get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in such a Manner, as <hi>naturally</hi> tends to put <hi>weaker</hi> Minds out of Possession of themselves. A Friend in the Country, in a <hi>Letter</hi> to me, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these Matters, expresses himself in these Words, <q>Under the Preaching and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of these <hi>Itinerants</hi> and <hi>Exhorters,</hi> (the Manner of which is frequently very boisterous and shocking, and adapted to the best of their Skill to alarm and surprize the Imagination and Passions) 'tis no unusual Thing for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be plunged into the utmost Anxiety and Distress, which is often attended with a <hi>Trembling of the Body, fainting, falling down,</hi> &amp;c. The Preacher now frequently grows more tempestuous, and dreadful in his Manner of Address, and seems to endeavour all he can to increase, and spread the rising Consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Terror of their Souls; which, by this Means, is sometimes spread over a great Part
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005151_0142_10180736A1E108E0"/>
of an Assembly, in a few Minutes from its first Appearance. I have seen the <hi>struck</hi> (as they are called) and distressed brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the several Parts of the Assembly, into the <hi>square Body</hi> by themselves, and two or three Persons at Work upon them at once, <hi>smiting, stamping</hi> and <hi>crying out</hi> to them with a <hi>mighty Voice,</hi> in the <hi>most terrible Manner</hi> and <hi>Language;</hi> the poor Creatures <hi>fainting, screach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and bitterly <hi>crying out</hi> under them. You may easily think, what Terrors of Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Distraction of Passions, and Perplexity of Thoughts, they endur'd. I was last Summer at an <hi>Evening</hi> Lecture, at a neighbouring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, at which, one of the <hi>most famous Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> in the <hi>new Method</hi> carried on. He had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered but a little Way in his Sermon, (which was delivered in a Manner sufficiently <hi>terrible</hi>) when there began to be some Commotion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>young Women.</hi> This inspir'd him with new Life. He lifted up his Voice like a Trumpet, plentifully poured down Terrors up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. About half a Score of young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were presently thrown into <hi>violent histeric Fits.</hi> I carefully observed them. When he grew calm and moderate in his Manner, tho' the Things deliverd were equally Awakening, they by Degrees grew calm and still; when he again assum'd the <hi>terrible,</hi> and spake <hi>like Thunder,</hi> the <hi>like violent Strugglings</hi> immediately returned upon them, from Time to Time. Sometimes he put a mighty Emphasis upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unmeaning Words, and delivered a Sentence of no Importance with a mighty Energy, yet the sensible Effect was as great as when the most awful Truth was brought to View.</q> This Account may be relied on. For it is given
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005151_0143_10180738246B68F8"/>
by one capable of making Observation, and who bears as unblemish'd a Character as most <hi>Ministers</hi> in the Country.</p>
            <p>Agreable whereto is the Account we have printed in the BOSTON <hi>Post-Boy</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb 391.</note>; in which the <hi>Writer,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Itinerant</hi> Preachers, among other Things, observes, <q>Their main Design in preaching, seems not so much to inform Men's Judgments, as to <hi>terrify</hi> and <hi>affright</hi> their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; by <hi>awful Words</hi> and <hi>frightful Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,</hi> to set the Congregation into hideous Shrieks and Out-cries. And to this End, in every Place where they come, they represent that GOD is doing <hi>extraordinary</hi> Things in other Places, and that they are some of the last hardened Wretches that stand out; that this is the last Call that ever they are likely to have; that they are now hanging over the Pit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and just ready, this Moment, to fall into it; that Hell-fire now flashes in their Faces; and that the Devil now stands ready to seize upon them, and carry them to Hell: And they will oftentimes repeat the awful Words, <hi>Damn'd! Damn'd Damn'd!</hi> three or four Times over.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis well known, no Preacher, in the <hi>new Way</hi> has been more noted for his <hi>Instrumentality</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing these <hi>Schriekings</hi> and <hi>Faintings</hi> and <hi>Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings,</hi> than the Rev. Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT of SOUTHHOLD; and yet, one of the Ministers of this Town, (who has always been a great Friend to that which he esteemed, <hi>the good Work of GOD</hi> going on in the Land) having been, one
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005151_0144_101806DAFB6736E0"/>
Night, a Witness to his inexpressible Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the People, and the terrible Effects consequent thereupon in their <hi>Screaming</hi> and <hi>Crying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> and the like, thought himself obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to go to him the next Day, and declare against such a Method of acting: And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went, and told him to his Face (as he himself inform'd me) that in <hi>the Appearance of the last Night,</hi> he was persuaded, there was <hi>no Hand of the</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of</hi> GOD; and that it was no other than might have been expected, if a Man <hi>raving mad from Bedlam, had gone among the People, and behaved as he had done.</hi> And one of the Charges exhibited and prov'd against this Mr. DAVENPORT, when brought before the <hi>General Assembly</hi> of CONNEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICUT, was, <q>That he endeavoured by unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Means to terrify, and affect his Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</q> And that,</p>

By pretending some <hi>extraordinary</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and Assurance of the <hi>very near Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> of the End of the World; and that though he did not assign the very Day, yet that he then lately had it clearly open'd to him, and strongly inprest upon his Mind, that in a very short Time all these Things would be involv'd in devouring Flames.</p>
            </q>
            <p>N. B. This same <hi>Impression,</hi> he told the People at BOSTON, he had lately had upon his Mind, and was as sure the Day of Judgment was at the Door; as of the Things he then saw with his Eyes; and made Use of this accordingly, as an Argument to work upon their <hi>Passions.</hi>

a short Prayer, he called for all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest Persons (which were near twenty) into the foremost <hi>Seats.</hi> Then he came out of the Pulpit, and stripped off his upper Garments, and got up into the Seats, and leapt up and down sometime, and clapt his Hands, and <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out</hi> in those Words, the War goes on, the Fight goes on, the Devil goes down, the Devil goes down; and then betook himself to <hi>stamping</hi> and <hi>screaming</hi> most dreadfully.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And what is it more than might be expected, to see People so affrightned as to fall into <hi>Shrieks</hi> and <hi>Fits,</hi> under such Methods as these? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when they have first been possest of the Notion, that the Persons who make Use of them, are <hi>Men of GOD</hi> in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Sense; as being sent immediately, as it were, to deliver his Messages to them. The Mind is now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive almost any Impression from this Kind of Persons; and 'tis no Wonder, if, by their <hi>terrifying Voice</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> People are thrown into <hi>Agitations</hi> and <hi>Convulsions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I doubt not, but the <hi>divine SPIRIT</hi> often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the <hi>preached Word,</hi> so as that, by <hi>his Influence,</hi> Sinners are awakened to a Sense <hi>of Sin,</hi> and filled with <hi>deep Distress</hi> of Soul: But the <hi>blessed SPIRIT</hi> must not, at Random, be made the Author of all those <hi>Surprises,</hi> operating in <hi>strange Effects</hi> upon the <hi>Body,</hi> which may be seen among People. They may be produced other Ways; yea, I trust, that has been already said, which makes it evident, they have actually been produced, even by the <hi>wild and extravagant Conduct</hi> of some <hi>over-heated</hi> Preachers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:005151_0147_101807442EA59EB0"/>
It will, doubtless, be here said, these <hi>Out-cries</hi> have sometimes arisen, when no other than the great Truths of the Gospel have been urg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Consciences of Sinners; and this, in a <hi>becoming Manner,</hi> and by Preachers who have not been noted, either for the <hi>Loudness of their Voice,</hi> or the <hi>Boisterousness of their Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Reply whereto, I deny not but this may have been the Case: But, at the same Time, think it worthy of Notice, that these bodily <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> were, at FIRST, produced, so far as I can learn, ONLY by <hi>such Preachers</hi> as were <hi>remarkable</hi> for their <hi>terrible speaking,</hi> both as to <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Manner:</hi> Nor do I remember an Instance, in the Country, of <hi>Out-cries,</hi> by <hi>any other Sort of Preachers,</hi> 'till the Noise of such <hi>extraordinary</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as <hi>Arguments</hi> of an <hi>immediate divine Power,</hi> in one Place and another, had alarmed the People, and made many of them think, it was necessary they also should be in like Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
            <p>Besides, when these <hi>Out-cries</hi> have been effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by your more <hi>moderate Preachers,</hi> (which, by the Way, comparatively speaking, has been a rare Thing) have they not begun with one or two only, and from them been propagated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Nay, have not <hi>these,</hi> from whom they took Rise, <hi>usually,</hi> been such as were <hi>before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed</hi> to the Way of <hi>screaming out?</hi> And were they not, <hi>at first,</hi> brought to it, under a more terrible Kind of Preaching? I believe, upon Examination, this will be found to be <hi>nearly</hi> the Truth of the Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:005151_0148_1018074637328610"/>
I shall only add further, that however distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished the Minister who has preached has been, for his <hi>exemplary Piety,</hi> and <hi>shining Gifts;</hi> however agreeable to the Mind of <hi>CHRIST</hi> he has delivered the Truths of the Gospel; and however warmly he may have addrest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the <hi>People's Passions,</hi> if he wan't before known to have been a <hi>Favourer</hi> of these <hi>Outcries,</hi> he has not produced them: Nor do I believe, an Instance can be given in the Country, of their being brought forward by any Minister, of whom the People had a Suspicion, that he did not like them: Which to me, is not the best Argument of their being so wholly owing to the <hi>divine Power,</hi> as some may be too ready to imagine. But to proceed,</p>
            <p>Another Thing that very much lessens my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of these <hi>religious Fears,</hi> with the <hi>strange Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of them is, that they are produced by the <hi>Exhorters;</hi> and this, in all Parts of the Land; and it may be, in more numerous Instances, than by the <hi>Ministers</hi> themselves. And if these <hi>bodily Agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> arise from the Influence of the SPIRIT, when produc'd by the <hi>Ministers,</hi> they are so when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the <hi>Exhorters.</hi> The Appearance is the same in both Cases; the like <hi>inward Distress</hi> is effected, and discovers it self in like <hi>Cryings</hi> and <hi>Swoonings:</hi> Nor is there any Reason to think well, in the general, of the one, and not of the other. And yet, some of the best Friends of <hi>this Work,</hi> both among the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> think ill of these Things, as brought forward by the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horters:</hi> Nay, one of the greatest Friends to the <hi>good Work,</hi> among the Ministers in Town, freely declar'd concerning one of these <hi>Exhorters,</hi> who came into this Place, and began the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:005151_0149_1018740FA2799B78"/>
we were before Strangers to, that he feared the Hand of Satan was in his coming here to throw Disgrace on the Work of GOD; sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting, that the Wonders wrought by the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> were, to all Appearance, like the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by MOSES. I see no Reason for such a Remark. The visible Effects of this young Man's exhorting here, and in the neighbouring Town of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> were just the same that are wrought by the most famous Preachers in the <hi>new Way:</hi> And where there is no discernable Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, there is no Ground, in <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to speak well of the one, and ill of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Such are certainly inconsistent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, who attribute these <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> as bro't forward by the <hi>Exhorters,</hi> to a <hi>Spirit of Delusion,</hi> or <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or any other <hi>inferior Cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> while they can't bear to hear a Word said against them, when they are the Produce of those who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ministers.</hi> For my self, I put them both on the same Foot, as supposing they both arise from the same Cause: Only, the Appearance of these Things, in the same Kind and Degree, when the <hi>Exhorters</hi> are the Carriers on, administers just Ground of Fear, whether they are, in <hi>general,</hi> so much owing to the <hi>extraordinary Influence</hi> of the <hi>divine SPIRIT,</hi> as some may be too ready to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine. If they are not owing to the <hi>wonderful Operation</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, when the <hi>Exhorters</hi> are the Occasion of them, they may easily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, when produced by others: And it can't well be supposed, there should be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Concurrence of the blessed SPIRIT with these <hi>Exhorters.</hi> For who are they but such, concerning whom the <hi>inspir'd Apostle has</hi> said, <hi>Not a Novice lest he be lifted up with Pride, and fall into the Condemnation of the Devil?</hi> Who
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005151_0150_101873EE5141FFD0"/>
are they but such, of whom the same <hi>Apostle</hi> says, <hi>they walk disorderly, working not at all, but are Busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bodies?</hi> With Respect to whom, he gives <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, that with Quietness they work and eat their own Bread.</hi> Who are they but such, as set themselves up in Opposition to their <hi>Pastors,</hi> though <hi>sound in the Faith</hi> and of a <hi>good Conversation,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Order of the Gospel,</hi> and to the <hi>Disturbance</hi> of the <hi>Churches?</hi> And can it be thought, that GOD would countenance the Conduct of this Kind of Persons, by <hi>extraordinary</hi> Testimonies of his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> from Heaven; and this, while they are in a Method of acting that directly contradicts his own Appointments? Besides, may it not be said of these <hi>Exhorters,</hi> in the <hi>general,</hi> that they are very <hi>Babes in Understanding,</hi> needing themselves to be <hi>taught which be the first Principles of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of GOD?</hi> That they are over-forward and conceited; taking that upon them, they have neither a <hi>Call</hi> to, nor <hi>Qualifications</hi> for? Yea, is it not too true of some of them, that they have acted under the Influence of an <hi>over-heated Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;</hi> or what is worse, from <hi>low</hi> and <hi>base Views?</hi> This is now so evident, that there is no Room for Debate upon the Matter. And of all Men, these, I should think, are the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to be distinguish'd with the <hi>extraordinary Presence</hi> of the HOLY GHOST.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Thing that makes it look as though these <hi>Terrors might</hi> arise from a <hi>lower Cause,</hi> than that which is <hi>Divine;</hi> and that is, their happening in the <hi>Night.</hi> I don't mean, that there han't been <hi>Out-cries</hi> in the <hi>Day Time;</hi> but the <hi>Night</hi> is more commonly the <hi>Season,</hi> when these Things are to be seen, and in their greatest
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005151_0151_10187415A8956F50"/>
Perfection. They are more <hi>frequent,</hi> and more <hi>general,</hi> and rais'd to a higher <hi>Degree,</hi> at the <hi>Night Meetings,</hi> when there are but <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Candles in the Place of Worship, or they are wholly in the dark. I have often, in Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, heard this Remark made by those, who have been in the Way of these Things; and the same Observations I find in the <hi>Letters</hi> that have been sent me. Says one, speaking of these <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> "They are more in the <hi>Night</hi> than in the Day:" Another, "They operate most strongly in their <hi>Night Meetings</hi>;" Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther still, "They never happen'd [this must be understood of the particular Place, he is giving an Account of] to any considerable Degree, 'till the <hi>Darkness</hi> of the Night came on." And why should these <hi>strange Effects</hi> be more <hi>frequent,</hi> and <hi>general,</hi> in the <hi>Gloominess</hi> of the <hi>Night,</hi> if they were produc'd by the Agency of the <hi>Divine SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT?</hi> Does he need the Advantage of the <hi>dark</hi> to fill Men's Hearts with Terror? This is certainly a shrew'd Sign, that there is more of the <hi>Humane</hi> in these Things, than some are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to own. We know every Thing appears more dismal in the Night: Persons are more apt to be struck with Surprise and Consternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And as this is a good Reason, it may be the true one, why a <hi>doleful Voice,</hi> and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Managements</hi> may take Effect more in the <hi>Night</hi> than at other Times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Subjects</hi> also of these <hi>Terrors</hi> may lead us to make the like Judgment about them; and these are <hi>Children, Women,</hi> and <hi>youngerly</hi> Persons. Not that others han't been wrought upon. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances there have been of <hi>Men;</hi> and these, both <hi>middle-aged,</hi> and <hi>advanced in Years,</hi> who have
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005151_0152_1018741799138E40"/>
both <hi>cried out,</hi> and <hi>fallen down:</hi> But 'tis among <hi>Children, young People</hi> and <hi>Women,</hi> whose Passions are soft and tender, and more easily thrown into a Commotion, that these Things <hi>chiefly</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. I know, 'tis thus in those Places, where I have had Opportunity to make Inquiry. And from the Accounts transmitted to me from Friends, in other Places, it appears to have been so among them also. The Account I have from one Part of the Country is, "The Operation is principally among <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Girls;</hi>" From an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, "The Persons wrought upon were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi>" From another, "These Effects have been most frequent in <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>young</hi> Persons." And are not these the very Persons, whose Passions according to <hi>Nature,</hi> it might be expected, would be alarmed? If <hi>young</hi> People are, in a moral Sense, more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wrought upon by <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> than <hi>old,</hi> I see not that this is the Case with Respect to <hi>Women</hi> in Distinction from <hi>Men. Men</hi> may as easily be overcome by the <hi>Power</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, as <hi>Women;</hi> and are as likely, in a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> View of the Matter, to be so: And what should then be the Reason that they should be, as it were, overlook'd, and <hi>Women</hi> generally the Persons thrown into these <hi>Agitations</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors?</hi> It certainly looks, as tho' the Weakness of their Nerves, and from hence their greater Lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to be surpris'd, and overcome with Fear, was the true Account to be given of this Matter.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the <hi>Way</hi> in which these <hi>Terrors</hi> spread themselves is a Circumstance, that does not much favour their <hi>divine Origin.</hi> They seem to be suddenly propagated, from one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005151_0153_1018741CE28547C0"/>
other, as in a great Fright or Consternation. They often begin with a single Person, a <hi>Child,</hi> or <hi>Woman,</hi> or <hi>Lad,</hi> whose <hi>Shrieks</hi> set others a <hi>Shrieking;</hi> and so the Shrieks catch from one to another, 'till the whole Congregation is alarmed, and such an awful Scene, many Times, open'd, as no Imagination can paint to the Life. To this Purpose is that in the BOSTON-<hi>Post-Boy</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. 391.</note>, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an Account of the <hi>terrible Language</hi> made Use of by the Itinerants, 'tis added, <q>This frequently frights the <hi>little Children,</hi> and sets them a Screaming; and that frights their <hi>tender Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and sets them to Screaming, and by Degrees spreads over a great Part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: And 40, 50, or an 100, of them screaming all together, makes such an awful and hideous Noise as will make a Man's Hair stand an End. Some will faint away, fall down upon the Floor, wallow and foam. Some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will rend off their Caps, Handkerchiefs, and other Clothes, tear their Hair down about their Ears, and seem perfectly bereft of their Reason.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">I should not have inserted this Account, it looks so <hi>extravagant,</hi> but that I have now by me two <hi>Letters,</hi> from Gentlemen of known <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> who particularly refer to it, and say, 'tis a just one.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Appearances in this Kind, I have often had an Account of from those who have been present at them; and as begun by one or two Persons at first: And where this has been the Case, there is no great Difficulty in finding out the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005151_0154_101873EC17806F08"/>
Cause: 'Tis far more reasonable to look for it in <hi>Nature,</hi> than in <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be amiss to observe still further, that these <hi>Terrors,</hi> with their <hi>Effects,</hi> are <hi>uniform all over the Country;</hi> operating upon all in whom they take Place, much in the <hi>same Way</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> be their <hi>moral</hi> Character what it will. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Subjects of them be <hi>great</hi> or <hi>small</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, whether the Sins they have committed be <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> whether they have continued in Sin a <hi>longer</hi> or <hi>shorter</hi> Time, there is no Difference as to their <hi>Fears,</hi> and the <hi>Operation</hi> of them; but they are all indiscriminately thrown into the like <hi>horrible</hi> Circumstances; which it is not reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think would be the Case, if they were put into this Condition by a <hi>divine Influence:</hi> Whereas, its the very Thing that might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, where <hi>Nature</hi> is suddenly surpris'd, and over-come, as in a Fright.</p>
            <p>In fine, it's a Circumstance no Ways fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the <hi>divine Rise</hi> of these <hi>Out-cries,</hi> that many People now commonly make them, not as urg'd hereto from an <hi>over-pouring</hi> Sense of their <hi>own</hi> Sins, but the Sins of <hi>others.</hi> Having been <hi>converted</hi> themselves, their <hi>Distress,</hi> under the <hi>Preaching of the Word,</hi> is now raised to such a Height for the <hi>unconverted Sinners in the Congregation,</hi> that they can't help <hi>screaming out;</hi> and so <hi>many of them,</hi> sometimes at once, as that the <hi>Worship</hi> is <hi>interrupted,</hi> or greatly <hi>disturb'd.</hi> A <hi>Concern</hi> for others, whom we have Reason to fear, are in a State of Sin, is, no Doubt, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and there will be more or less of it, in the Heart of every sincere Christian. But are <hi>Shriekings</hi> a suitable Expression of this Concern;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005151_0155_10187420E6E07FD8"/>
especially, in the House of GOD? And can it be suppos'd, the <hi>GOD of Order,</hi> would, by the Exertment of his Power, raise this Concern to such a Height, as that his <hi>own Worship</hi> should be broke up upon the Account of it? 'Tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I never heard one <hi>sober, solid</hi> Person speak a Word, in Favour of <hi>these Out-cries;</hi> and am heartily sorry, any Thing has been <hi>printed,</hi> encouraging so gross an Extravagance. I hope none, from the <hi>meer Sound</hi> of some Texts, will justify <hi>this same Distress for others,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins now to discover it self, among some Persons, in <hi>another</hi> Form, in <hi>Travail-Pains and Throws.</hi> Of this, I have now an Account by me, in a <hi>Letter</hi> from a Friend, upon the Evidence of his <hi>own Eyes and Ears;</hi> which yet, I should not have mentioned, but that I have since <hi>personally</hi> conversed with a <hi>Minister</hi> in the Country, who informed me of one, who had been in <hi>Travail</hi> two or three Times successively for him. i. e. Under all the <hi>Signs of Distress,</hi> that appear in <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> upon such Occasions.</p>
            <p>These are the Reasons, why I can't entertain so high an Opinion as some others do, of the <hi>Terrors</hi> appearing in strange <hi>bodily</hi> Effects, which have been so common of late in this Land.</p>
            <p>It will, possibly, be said, I have, in saying these Things, reflected Disgrace upon the <hi>Work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi> If I had had such a Thought of the Matter, I should have suppressed what is here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Those, in my Opinion, do the greatest Dishonour to the <hi>blessed SPIRIT,</hi> and <hi>his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> upon the Hearts of Sinners, in the Business of <hi>Conviction,</hi> who make no Distinction between those <hi>Fears</hi> that are the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>Truth duly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005151_0156_10187423D3A0FE70"/>
upon the Mind,</hi> and those that arise from an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightned Imagination.</hi> And to speak freely, I am clearly in the Sentiment, that the great Stress that has been laid upon <hi>such Terrors,</hi> as have evidently been produced by the <hi>mechanical Influence of aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Words</hi> and <hi>frightful Gestures,</hi> has been a great Disservice to the Interest of Religion: Nay, I am not without Fear, least the tremendous Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of GOD have, by some, been <hi>prophanely</hi> made Use of, while, under the Pretence of Awakening Men's Consciences, they have thunder'd out <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Damnation,</hi> in a <hi>Manner</hi> more fit for the <hi>Stage</hi> than the <hi>sacred Desk,</hi> and so as to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the <hi>Imagination</hi> rather than possess the <hi>Mind</hi> of a <hi>reasonable</hi> Conviction of these awful Truths of GOD. I am not against the <hi>Preaching of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;</hi> but whenever this is done, it ought to be in a Way that may enlighten the Mind, as well as alarm the Passions: And I am greatly mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if this has been the Practice, among some Sort of Preachers, so much as it ought to be And to this it may be owing, that Religion, of late, has been <hi>more a Commotion in the Passions,</hi> than a <hi>Change</hi> in the <hi>Temper</hi> of the <hi>Mind:</hi> Not but that, I think, a lasting Change has been wrought in a Number; though I could wish I had Reason to say, it was so great a Number as some pretend: Nay, I am not without Hopes, that some even of those who have been <hi>frighten'd</hi> into <hi>Shrieks</hi> and <hi>Fits,</hi> are <hi>become new-Men;</hi> but then, I have no other Thought, in the general, of the Surprise they were thrown into, than of the Surprise by a <hi>terrible Clap of Thunder,</hi> or the Shock of an <hi>Earthquake:</hi> They might hereby be awakened to Consideration, and put upon waiting upon GOD in his own Way, 'till a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> has been effected in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:005151_0157_101874255A0FE7D0"/>
I shall conclude this Head with two general <hi>Cautions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is, to beware of being prejudiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>real Work of Conviction,</hi> from the <hi>strange Appearance,</hi> in a Way of <hi>Terror,</hi> there has been lately seen among us. Many, I have Reason to fear, have herefrom been led, both to <hi>think</hi> and <hi>speak,</hi> very unsuitably of this Work of the HOLY SPIRIT: But they are herein greatly to Blame. There certainly is such a Thing as a Sense of Sin, expressing itself in bitter Remorse of Conscience. 'Tis indeed impossible, that Sinners should have upon their Minds a just Apprehension of themselves, and their real Character, as <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> and not be fill'd with uneasy Sensations: Nay, it may be fear'd of all, who have liv'd to adult Years, thoughtless of their Souls, that they know not the Grace of GOD in Truth, if they have had no Experience of the Troubles of an awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened Conscience: Nor is it any Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst either the <hi>Reality</hi> or <hi>Necessity</hi> of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,</hi> that there may be a Resemblance of it in the Workings of that <hi>Fear</hi> which is not excited by the Influence of the HOLY GHOST: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being prejudiced herefrom against the <hi>SPIRIT's Operation,</hi> in convincing Sinners, we should take Occasion to be <hi>wisely cautious</hi> in distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing between those <hi>Fears,</hi> with their <hi>Effects,</hi> that are from the SPIRIT, and those that may have Rise from other Causes.</p>
            <p>Very serviceable for our Direction in this Matter, are the Words of that <hi>experienced Christian,</hi> as well as <hi>noted Divine,</hi> Mr. CHARNOCK. Says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">His Works, Vol. II. Page 584.</note>

               <q>are sudden Frights and Startings, which soon settle again; as in a sudden Fright and Start, Nature is speedily reduced to its former Temper, and the Blood that was put on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den into another Motion, is quickly brought to its former Consistence. They are usually like a <hi>Land-Flood,</hi> which causes an Inundation, but sinks not into the Roots of the Soul.—It is a Work, not so much upon the <hi>Judgment</hi> as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Affections:</hi> Therefore it is like a Fire falling upon Flax and other combustable Matter, which flames and expires; and you see its Death almost as soon as it begins to be: Whereas those Convictions that arise from the SPIRIT, settle upon the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and like a Fire in a Log of Wood, are kept alive in the Soul, eat into the Soul, dive into the Bottom, produce serious and lasting Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Conscience is staggering and unfixt; therefore whatsoever ariseth from it, partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the uncertain Nature of the Cause.

                  <hi>Satan</hi> works <hi>violently</hi> and <hi>suddenly,</hi> and most by the <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Humours of the Body,</hi> rather than by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> but the SPIRIT works upon the <hi>Mind,</hi> therefore he is an <hi>enlightning</hi> SPIRIT. <hi>Satan</hi> works upon the Reason by the <hi>Passion;</hi> the SPIRIT upon the <hi>Passion</hi> by <hi>Reason;</hi> He first

enlightens the <hi>Mind,</hi> and brings Light into the <hi>Heart,</hi> and the <hi>rational</hi> Faculties, the proper Subjects of Light; and by this Means winds up the Passions to what Pitch and Tune he thinks fit. <hi>Satan</hi> first works upon the <hi>Humours of the Body,</hi> as <hi>melancholy,</hi> and the like. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> works <hi>violently,</hi> as upon <hi>Passion,</hi> as he buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted PAUL; boxes a Man to and fro, so that he hath no Time to do any Thing but consider his Misery; whereas the SPIRIT proposeth the <hi>Object,</hi> helps the Soul to consider, and by Degrees leads to a further Knowledge of the Light of the Gospel, from a glimmering to a shining Light, 'till the Knowledge of the Lord break in, in its full Glory.</q> And his first <hi>Inference</hi> from what he had said about <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin</hi> is,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Page ibid.</note> 
               <q>The Gospel doth not destroy <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>rational Proceeding.</hi>—The working of the SPIRIT is according to the Nature of Man, moves not in Contradiction to, but in an Elevation of <hi>Reason.</hi>—He doth not, extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>Reason,</hi> the <hi>Candle of the LORD,</hi> but snuffs it, and adds more Light, reduces it to its proper Manner of Operation, and sets it in its right State towards GOD; brings first Light into the Understanding, and new Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Will: He doth not <hi>dethrone Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Judgment,</hi> but applies it to its proper Work, repairs it, sets it in its true Motion.—The Arguments the SPIRIT uses, are suited to the <hi>Reason</hi> of Men, otherwise Conscience could not <hi>be</hi> mov'd; for Conscience follows <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> IT IS NOT AN ACT OF JUDGMENT, BUT IMAGINATION, THAT REASON DOTH NOT PRECEDE.

As the Service GOD requires, is a <hi>rational</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; so the Method he uses in <hi>Conversion</hi> is a <hi>rational</hi> Method.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other <hi>Caution</hi> I would give is, to take heed of <hi>Mistakes</hi> about the <hi>passionate</hi> Part of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, i. e. The sensible Workings of the Affections. There are two Mistakes, in this kind, People have been ready to fall into.</p>
            <p>Some, and great Multitudes, it may be fear'd, have plac'd their Religion too much in this <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Terror; trusting to it,</hi> and making a <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of it: putting it in the Place of CHRIST, or of that <hi>real Change</hi> of Heart and Life, without which they can't be qualified for an Admission into the Kingdom of GOD. Holy Mr. BAXTER'S Words are very pertinent to such Persons as these. Says he, <q>Think not that you can satisfy the <hi>Justice</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> or merit any Thing of GOD, by the Worth of your <hi>Sorrows;</hi> tho' you should weep even Tears of Blood. It is not true Humiliation, if it consists not in the Sense and Acknowledgement of your <hi>Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,</hi> and Desert of <hi>Condemnation;</hi> and if it do not lead you to look out for Pardon and Life from CHRIST, as being lost and wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient for your selves. And therefore it would be a plain Contradiction, if true <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> should be taken as <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> or <hi>Merit;</hi> or <hi>trusted</hi> on, instead of CHRIST.</q> To the like Purpose are those Words of the pious Mr. BOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON. Says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">In his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions for a right comforting afflicted Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> P. 173.</note> 
               <q>Once for all, take this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005151_0161_1018743255C70320"/>
and Forewarning: If any should think of these precedent Acts, these preparatory Workings of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> which make Way for the Infusion of Faith, as any <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Means to draw on CHRIST; it were a most false, rotten, foolish, execrable, popish, absurd, Luciferian Conceit; and might justly merit, never to obtain Mercy at GOD's boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Hands; not part in the <hi>Merits of</hi> CHRIST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others, from what they have seen, or heard of the dreadful Terrors, some have been in, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in <hi>Shriekings</hi> and <hi>Swoonings,</hi> have been ready to question their good Estate, <hi>meerly</hi> because they han't experienced in this Respect, as they have done. But this is a wrong Way of Judging in the Case. Hear how the famous Dr. OWEN expresses himself upon this Matter. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Work of <hi>Conviction</hi> there will be, says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">In his <hi>Discourse upon the HOLY SPIRIT,</hi> P. 305.</note> 
               <q>disquieting and perplexing Affections in the Minds of Men; nor can it be otherwise, where it is fixt and prevalent. As, (1) <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> for and of what they have done. (2) <hi>Fear of eternal Wrath.</hi> This keeps the Soul in Bondage, and is accompanied with Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (3) Perplexing <hi>unsatisfactory Enquiries</hi> after Means, and Ways for Deliverance, out of this Distress, and from future Misery. What shall we do to be saved, is the restless Inquiry of such Persons.</q> He goes on,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 306.</note> 
               <q>The <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of these Things is <hi>ordinarily</hi> found in those who are converted unto GOD, when grown up unto the Use of Reason, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005151_0162_10187433D78F8268"/>
of Impressions from external Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Especially, are they evident in the Minds and Consciences of such, as have been engag'd in any open sinful Course, or Practice.</q> He then immediately adds, <q>But yet, <hi>no certain Rule</hi> or <hi>Measure</hi> of them can be prescrib'd as <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> in, or unto any, antecedaneously unto Conversion. To evince the Truth whereof, two Things may be observed; (1.) That Perturbations, Sorrows, Dejections, Dread, Fear, are no <hi>Duty</hi> unto any; only, they are such Things as sometimes ensue, or are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Mind, upon that which is a Duty indispensible; namely, <hi>Conviction of Sin.</hi> They belong not to the Precept of the Law, but to its <hi>Curse.</hi> They are no Part of what is required of us, but of what is inflicted on us. There is a <hi>Gospel-Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Humiliation</hi> after <hi>believing</hi> that is a Duty, that is both command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hath Promises annext to it: But this legal Sorrow is an Effect of the Curse of the Law, not of its <hi>Command.</hi> (2.) GOD is pleas'd to exercise a <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in this whole Matter, and deals with the Souls of Men in unspeakable <hi>Variety.</hi> Some he leads by the Gates of Death and Hell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Rest in his Love. And the Paths of others he makes plain and easy to them. Some walk and wander long in Darkness; in the Souls of others, CHRIST is formed in the first gracious Visitation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In a few Pages onwards<note n="†" place="bottom">308.</note>, He speaks of it as an <hi>entangling Temptation</hi> Persons under <hi>Conviction</hi> should beware of; Namely, <q>that they have not
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005151_0163_101873F24594C1B8"/>
                  <hi>attain'd such a Degree of Sorrow for Sin, and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,</hi> as is necessary to them who are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe in JESUS CHRIST.</q> And says up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <q>There was indeed more Reason of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Caution against Temptations of this Kind in former Days, when Preachers of the Gospel dealt more severely, I wish I may not also say more sincerely, with the Consciences of <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> Sinners, than it is the Manner of most now to do: But yet, 'tis possible, that herein may lie a Mistake; seeing no <hi>such Degrees</hi> of these Things, as some may be troubled about, are prescrib'd for any such End, either in the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Gospel.</hi>
               </q> And of the same Mind was the celebrated Mr. SHEPARD, Mr. WILLARD, and others, I have elsewhere mentioned.</p>
            <p>The Words of the pious Mr. BAXTER are so observable, I can't help transcribing them, for the Conclusion of this Head. A Mistake, says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>His Works.</hi> Vol. 2. Page 562, 563.</note> to be carefully avoided is, <q>The placing your Humiliation, either <hi>only,</hi> or <hi>principally,</hi> in the <hi>passionate</hi> Part, or in the <hi>outward Expressions</hi> of the Passions. I mean either in <hi>pinching Grief,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow of Heart,</hi> or else in <hi>Tears.</hi> But you must remember, that the Life of it is in the <hi>Judgment</hi> and the <hi>Will.</hi> It is not the <hi>Measure</hi> of <hi>passionate Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Anguish,</hi> that will best shew the <hi>Measure</hi> of your <hi>sincere Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation;</hi> much less is it your <hi>Tears,</hi> or <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Expressions.</hi> But it is your low Esteem of your selves, and Contentedness to be vile in the Eyes of others; and your Displicency with your selves, and Willingness to mourn,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:005151_0164_101873F3C8615708"/>
and weep for 'Sin as much as GOD would have you, and the rest of the Acts of the <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Two great Dangers are here before you to be avoided. (1) Some there be that have <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Pangs</hi> of Sorrow, and are ready to <hi>tear their own Hair;</hi> yea, to <hi>make away themselves,</hi> as JUDAS, in the <hi>Horror</hi> of their Consciences; and these may seem to have true Humiliation, and yet have none. And some can weep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly at a Sermon, or in a Prayer, or in mentioning their Sin to others, and therefore think they are truly humbled; and yet, it may be nothing so. For it, at the same Time, their Hearts are in Love with Sin, or have not an habitual Hatred of it, and a predominant su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative Love to GOD, their Humiliation is no saving Work.—(2) Another Sort there are, much better and happier than the former, that yet, to their great Trouble, are mistaken in this Point; and that is, they that think they have no <hi>true Humiliation,</hi> because they find not such <hi>Pangs of Sorrow,</hi> and Freedom of <hi>Tears</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have; whereas their Hearts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, even when they cannot <hi>weep a Tear.</hi> Tell me but this, are you vile in your own Eyes because you are guilty of Sin, and that against the LORD, whom you chiefly love? Do you loath your selves because of your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations? And could you heartily wish you had been suffering when you were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? And if it were to do again, would you choose to suffer rather than to sin? Have you a Desire to grieve, when you cannot <hi>pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately</hi> grieve? Do you think meanly of your own Sayings and Doings, and better of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005151_0165_101874355F499908"/>
others, wherethere is any Ground, than of your selves? Do you justify GOD's Afflictions, and Men's Rebukes, and think yourselves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Communion of the Saints, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live upon the Face of the Earth? Yea, would you justify GOD, if he should condemn you? This is the State of an humbled Soul. Find but this, and you need not doubt of GOD's Acceptance, tho' you were unable to shed a Tear. There is more Humiliation in a base Esteem of ourselves, than in a thousand Tears; and more in a <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Desire</hi> to weep for Sin, than in <hi>Tears</hi> that come through <hi>Force of Terror,</hi> or <hi>Moisture of the Brain,</hi> or <hi>passionate Tenderness of Nature.</hi> If the <hi>Will</hi> be right, you need not fear. It is he that most <hi>hateth Sin,</hi> and <hi>is hardliest drawn to it,</hi> that is <hi>truliest hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> for it.</q> He proceeds, a little onwards, to observe, <q>That <hi>that</hi> Part of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> which consisteth in the Acts of the <hi>Understanding,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> can't be too much, as to the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Act. To have too clear an Apprehension of the Evil of Sin, and his own Vileness, this a Man need not fear. And in the <hi>Will</hi> it is more clear: No Man can be too willing to be rid of Sin, in GOD's Time and Way; nor be too much averse from it, as it is against the LORD. But then, the other Part of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which consisteth in the <hi>Depth of Sorrow,</hi> or in <hi>Tears,</hi> may possibly be <hi>too much.</hi>
               </q> And in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Particulars, he directs Persons how to discern when it is so. As, <q>First, When your Sorrow is greater than your <hi>Brains</hi> can bear, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Danger of <hi>Distraction,</hi> or a <hi>melancholly Disturbance</hi> and <hi>Diminution of your Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> then it is certainly too much, and to be restrained. For if you overthrow your <hi>Reason,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:005151_0166_101874381AC345C8"/>
you will be a Reproach to <hi>Religion,</hi> and you will be fit for nothing that's truly Good, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to your <hi>own Edification,</hi> or the <hi>Service of GOD.</hi>
               </q> Again, <q>When Sorrow is so great as to discompose your Mind, or enfeeble your Body, so as to unfit you for the Service of GOD, and make you more unable to do Good, or receive Good, you have Reason then to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and restrain it.</q> Likewise, <q>When the <hi>Greatness</hi> of your Sorrow doth overmatch the necessary Measure of your <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Joy,</hi> or <hi>Thanks,</hi> and keep out these, and take up more of your Spirit than its Part, having no Room for greater Duties, then it is excessive and to be restrained. There are some that will strive and struggle with their Hearts, to wring out a <hi>few Tears,</hi> and increase their <hi>Sorrow,</hi> that yet make little Conscience of other <hi>Affections,</hi> and will not strive half so much to increase their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
               </q> So <q>when your <hi>Sorrow,</hi> by the <hi>Greatness</hi> of it, doth draw you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Temptation,</hi> either to <hi>despair,</hi> or think hardly of GOD, and his Service, or to undervalue his Grace, and the Satisfaction of CHRIST, as if it were too scant and insufficient for you, you have then Cause to moderate and restrain it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next Thing to be considered, as what I can't but look upon to be of <hi>dangerous</hi> Tendency is that <hi>sudden Light and Joy</hi> so many, of late, claim to be the Subjects of. Not that I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether there is such a Thing as <hi>religious Joy.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> often speaks of <hi>rejoicing in GOD,</hi> and in <hi>Hope of the Glory to be hereafter revealed.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> is said to consist in <hi>Joy,</hi> as well as Peace and Righteousness; And Joy is reckon'd among the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the SPIRIT: And
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005151_0167_1018743C8242FEA8"/>
this Joy is said to be <hi>unspeakable, and full of Glory;</hi> yea, his called the <hi>Peace of GOD which passeth all Understanding.</hi> But then, there is a <hi>false,</hi> as well as <hi>true</hi> Joy; the Joy of the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> as well as of the <hi>real Christian;</hi> a Joy that has its Rise in <hi>animal Nature,</hi> as well as from the HOLY GHOST. And though I would hope, a Number, of late, have been made Partakers of <hi>true Joy,</hi> the <hi>Joy there is in Believing;</hi> yet, there may be Reason for bear, lest the Joy that has been so much boasted of, should be no other, in the general, than the Joy, those may experience, who are Christians more in <hi>Appearance</hi> than <hi>Reality,</hi> in <hi>Word</hi> than <hi>Deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall here take Liberty to examine <hi>this Joy;</hi> and shall do it with all the Impartiality I am able, as being a Matter in which 'tis exceeding dangerous for Men to deceive themselves, or be deceived by others. And,</p>
            <p>Three Things are observable with Reference to <hi>true Joy;</hi> the <hi>Foundation</hi> of it, its <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Effects:</hi> And these are the Things by which I shall try the Joy of the present Times.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>true Joy</hi> is always laid in such a <hi>Faith,</hi> as embraces the SAVIOUR upon <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Terms;</hi> a Faith that purifies the Heart, and is a living, active, powerful Principle of all holy O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Commandments of GOD. The <hi>new Creature,</hi> the Man that has upon him the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of CHRIST JESUS, is the Subject of this Joy. A <hi>Stranger</hi> to the Work of the SPIRIT, in <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, intermeddles not with it:</hi> And however he may pretend to it, or seem to be in Transports of it, 'tis nothing more than Pretence, or the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005151_0168_1018743EF6A60168"/>
Effect of a deluded Imagination. And this is a plain Case: For where there is not a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in the Heart, 'tis impossible a Man should think justly of himself, while he thinks there is; and his Joy therefore from the Apprehension of his being a Child of GOD, and in a State of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with him, must be a Delusion.</p>
            <p>And now, can it be pretended of all that have, of late, been in great Light and Joy, that they are among the <hi>Sanctified in</hi> CHRIST JESUS? Would to GOD it were thus! Some have made it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by their after-Lives, that their Joy was only a <hi>sudden Flash, a Spark of their own kindling:</hi> Nay, some have been made sensible, their Joy was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than a meer <hi>sensitive Passion,</hi> and have own'd they were under a Delusion, while they imagin'd it was of a divine <hi>Origin.</hi> And if the <hi>Foundation</hi> of Joy, in the Multitudes who have had the feeling of it, was a <hi>renewed Heart,</hi> this they would have made evident by their <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Newness of Life:</hi> They would have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd <hi>new Men,</hi> being better in their whole <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Conduct,</hi> both towards GOD and <hi>Man,</hi> in all the varying <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> of Life. And has this <hi>generally</hi> been the Case? I believe few will have the Face to pretend it has; and we shall presently see what Reason there is to fear it has not.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> of true Joy is another Thing that must be considered; by which I mean here, the <hi>immediate Occasion</hi> or <hi>Reason</hi> of the Excitement of this Passion. And this is the Man's <hi>Perception</hi> of his being a <hi>true Believer,</hi> a <hi>real Saint;</hi> and as such, interested in the Promises of the Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant. A Man must not only be a <hi>sanctified</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:005151_0169_10187441AA0CE098"/>
Person, but discern that he is so, before he can rationally have the Joy of Religion. The Spring of his Joy, is the View he has of himself as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son qualified, according to the Tenor of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament, for the Forgiveness of Sins, and an Inheritance among the Saints in Light. Hence that Direction of the <hi>Apostle,</hi>

               <hi>This is our Rejoicing, the Testimony of our Conscience, that is Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not by fleshly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the Grace of GOD, we have our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in the World.</hi> The immediate Reason of true Joy, according to the Apostle PAUL, is the <hi>Witness of Conscience</hi> to the <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in our Hearts.

            <p>Is this now the Way in which Persons, in these Times, come by their Joy?

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005151_0170_101873F663063F60"/>
think, it has been the Case with others also. And are there not Multitudes, whose Joy has sprung from <hi>sudden Impressions,</hi> that their State was good, without the Discernment of a <hi>special Work of GOD,</hi> wrought in their Hearts? Has it not been secretly and <hi>strongly suggested</hi> to them, that they are GOD's Children, that CHRIST died for them, and that they are interested in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? And han't they been sure of this, rather from a <hi>direct Light shining in their Minds,</hi> than from the Evidence they have had, from the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> that they were possest of such <hi>Marks of Regeneration</hi> as no <hi>Hypocrite</hi> ever came up to? Nay, is it not an avowed Principle, that <hi>Assurance</hi> is to be had from the <hi>immediate Witness of the SPIRIT,</hi> telling a Man that he is a true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and not from the <hi>Perception</hi> of a <hi>real Work of GOD,</hi> effected in him? Those that don't know, that the Joy of these Times is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Effect of this <hi>sudden Light,</hi> and not of a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>thorow Examination,</hi> and herefrom the <hi>Witness of a Man's own Spirit,</hi> with the <hi>Testimony of the SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> to a Work of <hi>Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> wrought in his Soul, are very much Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the religious State of Affairs in the Land.</p>
            <p>This may seem a glorious Way to <hi>Assurance</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> but 'tis infinitely dangerous for Men to trust to <hi>this Light,</hi> and depend upon the <hi>Joy</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from it, without the concurring <hi>Testimony</hi> of their own <hi>Conscience,</hi> upon clear and full Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005151_0171_10187408626A3228"/>
And in this Sentiment do the most <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced,</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> Divines perfectly agree. Says the pious Mr. BOLTON,<note n="*" place="bottom">See his <hi>general Directions for a comfortable walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with GOD,</hi> Page 328.</note> 
               <q>That which the SPIRIT reveals to our Consciences, we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may collect and conclude out of <hi>GOD's Word,</hi> upon the Conscience of our Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and other saving Endowments and holy Graces, shining in our Souls, and uprightly exercis'd in our whole Conversation. When we by <hi>these Means</hi> have assured our Souls, that we are the Children of GOD, which is the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of our own <hi>renewed Spirit,</hi> the <hi>SPIRIT of GOD,</hi> as another Witness, secondeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth this Assurance by <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> and by sweet Motions and Feelings of GOD's special Goodness, and glorious saving Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and so according to the <hi>Apostle's</hi> Phrase, Rom. 8. 16. <hi>Beareth Witness with our Spirits.</hi> Wherefore, if any Man presumes upon, or pretends any <hi>immediate Suggestions</hi> or <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> for his spiritual Safety, and everlasting Well-being; and yet, wants utterly the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of his <hi>renewed Conscience</hi> to the same Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the <hi>Testimony of Universal Obedience,</hi> of not lying wilfully and delightfully in any one known Sin, of crucifying the Affections with the Lusts; I can give him none but this cold Comfort, he is cursedly coozened by the Devil's counterfeit Glory of an Angel, cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his absurd Imagination such groundless Conceits, which, in Time of Trial, will vanish into nothing, and fly away as a Dream.</q> To the like Purpose are those Words of Mr. BAXTER,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005151_0172_1018744439A67410"/>
               <q>Some I have known, who have wanted <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi> and falling among the ANTINOMIANS, were told by them that they undid themselves by looking after <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Marks</hi> of Grace, and so laying their <hi>Comforts</hi> upon some Things in <hi>themselves;</hi> whereas they should look only to CHRIST for Comfort, and not at any Thing in <hi>themselves at all.</hi> And for <hi>Assurance,</hi> it is ONLY THE WITNESS OF THE SPIRIT, without any <hi>Marks</hi> that must give it them; and to fetch Comfort from their <hi>own Graces</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> was to make it themselves, instead of CHRIST, or the HOLY GHOST, and was a <hi>legal Way.</hi> No sooner was this Doctrine received, but the <hi>Receivers</hi> had <hi>Comfort at Will,</hi> and all was <hi>sealed</hi> up to them presently by the WIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS OF the SPIRIT, in their own Conceit. Whence this came, judge you. Sure I am, that the <hi>sudden Looseness of their Lives,</hi> answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ignorant, loose, ungospel-like Doctrine, did certify me that the SPIRIT OF COMFORT was not their COMFORTER; for he is also a SPIRIT OF HOLINESS, and comforteth Men by the Means of a <hi>holy Gospel,</hi> which hath Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Threatnings, as well as Promises.</q>

            </p>
            <p>The last Thing, is the <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>true Joy;</hi> and it operates in various <hi>Effects</hi> upon those who are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>One of its <hi>Effects</hi> is, a <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Tongue</hi> to <hi>praise GOD.</hi> It expresses itself in fervent Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine Mercy, in thankful Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the GOD of all Grace. And this, it
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005151_0173_101874471C0EC128"/>
must be own'd, is the Operation of the <hi>Joy</hi> of the present Day: But then, is it not just Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Complaint, that <hi>its Praises of GOD</hi> have been too <hi>ostentatious,</hi> too much favouring of a Desire to be <hi>seen of Men?</hi> Has it been content with silent Admirations of the Loving-Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of GOD in JESUS CHRIST; venting it self in secret Breathings of Love, and Returns of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the Father of Mercies? No, but the <hi>Houses of Worship,</hi> the <hi>Places of Concourse,</hi> are those in which it has generally broke forth, in Acknowledgements to GOD: Nay, han't it been common in some Parts of the Land, and among some Sorts of People, to express their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Joy</hi> by <hi>singing through the Streets,</hi> and in <hi>Ferry-Boats?</hi> And has not this Joy almost uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally shown it self in <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Transports?</hi> Nay, in <hi>Swoonings,</hi> and <hi>Out-cries,</hi> and <hi>Screamings,</hi> so like to these same Effects under <hi>Terror,</hi> that it han't been known, whether Persons were in <hi>Joy</hi> or <hi>Sorrow,</hi> but by asking them the Reason of the Commotion their Passions have been in? Yea, has it not been a usual Thing to shew this Joy by <hi>clapping of Hands,</hi> by <hi>jumping up and down,</hi> by <hi>Congratulations in the Way of Kissing,</hi> by breaking out into <hi>hearty loud Laughter?</hi> It may seem like a Banter upon this Joy to speak these Things; but they are the exact Truth of the Case, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Figure: And known to be so; and this, not in a single <hi>Instance</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> but in Multitudes of both; yea, this has been the Appearance, more or less, in all Parts of the Land, where People have been in great <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This of <hi>Laughing,</hi> so far as I am acquainted with the History of the Church, is a Method of expressing <hi>religious Joy</hi> peculiar to the present
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005151_0174_10187449C836DFF0"/>
Times: Nor can I think from whence it should take Rise, unless from Mr. WHITEFIELD and TENNENT. The <hi>former</hi> of these Gentlemen was sometimes observed to speak of the Affairs of Salvation, with a <hi>Smile in his Countenance;</hi> but 'tis generally known of the <hi>latter,</hi> that he could searce hear of a Person's being under the slightest Conviction, but he would <hi>laugh.</hi> And if told of any that were in <hi>great spiritual Distress,</hi> he would fall into a <hi>broad Laugh.</hi> This always appear'd shocking to some who were Witness of it, as I have often heard them say: But as it was the Gentleman's Practice, he might be imitated by others in this Imperfection, and from them by others still, and so the Humour be propagated 'till it became general. I can't, for myself, give an Account of the Rise of this Practice from any other Cause. But from whatever Cause it sprang, 'tis certainly one of the most incongruous Ways of <hi>expressing religious Joy.</hi> It favours of too much Levity, as it has to do with Matters of infinite and eternal Moment. It discovers the Want of a due Reverence towards the <hi>divine Majesty;</hi> and seems inconsistent with that <hi>holy Fear</hi> and <hi>Caution,</hi> which must be thought reasonable, where the Salvation of the Soul is the Thing it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all, but these <hi>Raptures</hi> and <hi>Extasies</hi> have, in too many Instances, come to <hi>Visions,</hi> and <hi>Trances,</hi> and <hi>Revelations.</hi> There are few Places, where this Joy, in all its Height, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, but it has ended, in a greater or less Number of Persons, in these Things. I could fill many Pages with the Accounts I have had of the <hi>Trances</hi> Persons have been in, from different Parts of the Country; but shall confine
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005151_0175_101873F9DC1ABB90"/>
my self to a <hi>double Instance,</hi> and give it in the Words of a Friend, in his Letter to me. Says he, <q>The most remarkable Thing which has happened since Mr. D—T's Departure (from NEW-HAVEN) is <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Trances,</hi> which have befell sundry Persons in this Place. I will endeavour to give Account of two Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who fell into a <hi>Trance</hi> together. It was sometime in <hi>November</hi> last. The beginning of it was at a <hi>Conference Meeting,</hi> or <hi>private Fast,</hi> kept by a Number of the <hi>New-Light</hi> Party (as it was said) to pray that the <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of Ministers,</hi> who were then sitting at GUILFORD, might be restrained from doing any Thing that should be detrimental to the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> or (shall I be too uncharitable, if I say) in other Words, to their <hi>Cause.</hi> At this Meeting, two young Women were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly fill'd with Zeal, and their Affections rais'd very high: They were, in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, depriv'd of their bodily Strength; but yet, were by Turns able to speak, which they did, in Addresses and Exhortations to, and Prayers for, those present, who they supposed were unconverted. Their Minds remained very full of Zeal and Affection that Night, and the next Day. The next Evening, as they were together walking the Street, they were both so overpowered by some Thing or other, that they fell down unable to walk, and so continued, for some Time, lying in the Street like Persons dead or asleep. At length, one recovered herself so far as to be able to go to the next House, which was within a few Rods, and inform'd the People of the Condition of her <hi>Mate,</hi> who thereupon went and brought her into said House; and thus
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:005151_0176_1018744C530A3CB0"/>
they continued in a Sort of Extasie, either lying as though in a Sleep, or uttering extatic Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of Joy, of the Love of CHRIST, and of Love to him; of Concern for the Souls of Sinners, and the like. Many People resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to see them, for whom, and especially for those they suppos'd were out of CHRIST, they would frequently pray with great Earnestness, and, to all Appearance, Engagedness of Mind; to whom they would also address themselves in awful Warnings, moving Perswasions, and pathetic Exhortations, in which they would use some Expressions, from whence it seem'd that they suppos'd themselves to have a <hi>special Commission,</hi> or endow'd with some <hi>special Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> such as <hi>CHRIST has sent me, CHRIST has bid me say, and do, so and so.</hi> And indeed many People, especially those of their Party, seemed verily to believe that they were inspir'd, and did ever pretend to <hi>justify the Separation</hi> from the Authority of their Word, as though <hi>divine.</hi> And they not only us'd many unwarrantable Expressions, but made strange Declarations, <hi>as that they had been to Heaven, had seen the Book of Life, the Names of many Persons of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance wrote in it; that they had seen the Seats of the Blessed, and their own Seats empty,</hi> and the like. Many more Things they said and did of the like kind, which the Time will not allow me particularly to relate. In the Condition described, they remained about a Week, and then they came to themselves, or to their former Condition by little and little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> that has operated in the above <hi>Extasies,</hi> and <hi>Swoonings,</hi> and <hi>Laughings,</hi> and at Length come to <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Trances,</hi> has been
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:005151_0177_101873FE4A3EE108"/>
highly spoken of by some; Nay, it has been thought <hi>prophane</hi> so much as to question its divine Origin: But the most experienced, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Divines have always had other Sentiments of this Kind of <hi>Illumination,</hi> as well as the <hi>Exultings</hi> proceeding from it. They have carefully cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned against it, as what ought not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on; yea, they have esteem'd it a Reproach to have it said, they had a good Opinion of it. Hear the Words of the pious and learned Dr. OWEN. Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>His Discourse concerning the HOLY SPIRIT,</hi> Page 186.</note> 
               <q>The Work of the HOLY SPIRIT, in Regeneration, doth not consist in <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiastical Raptures, Extasies, Voices,</hi> or any Thing of the like Kind. It may be, some such Things have been, by some deluded Persons, apprehended or pretended to. But the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing of any such Imaginations is falsly and injuriously charged on them, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the powerful and <hi>effectual Work</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT in our Regeneration.</q> And in the next Page, <q>The HOLY SPIRIT, in this Work, doth ordinarily put forth his Power in and by the <hi>Use of Means.</hi> He worketh also on Men suitably unto their Natures, even as the Faculties of their Souls, their Minds, Wills and Affections, are meet to be affected and wro't upon. He doth not come upon them with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary Raptures,</hi> using their Faculties and Powers, as the <hi>evil Spirit</hi> wrests the Bodies of them whom he possesseth: His whole Work therefore is <hi>rationally</hi> to be accounted for, by and unto them who believe the Scripture, and have received the SPIRIT of Truth, whom the
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005151_0178_1018744DE07FDEB8"/>
World cannot receive.</q> It follows a few Lines onwards, <q>This great Work therefore, neither in <hi>Part,</hi> nor <hi>whole,</hi> consists in <hi>Raptures, Extasies, Visions, enthusiastic Inspirations,</hi> but in the Effect of the Power of the SPIRIT of GOD on the Souls of Men, by and according to his Word, both of the Law and the Gospel: And those who charge these Things on them who have asserted, declared and reached it according to the Scriptures, do it probably to countenance themselves in their Hatred of them, and of the Work itself.</q> He still adds, <q>Where by Reason of <hi>Distemper of Mind,</hi> Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Fancy, or long Continuance of distress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fears and Sorrows, in and under such <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory Works</hi> of the SPIRIT, which sometimes cut Men to their Hearts in the Sense of their Sin, and sinful lost Condition, any do fall into Apprehensions or Imaginations of any Things <hi>extraordinary</hi> in the Ways before-mentioned, <hi>if it be not quickly and strictly brought to Rule, and discarded thereby, it may be of great Danger to their Souls, and is never of any solid Use of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi> Such Apprehensions for the <hi>most Part</hi> are either <hi>Conceptions of distempered Minds, and discomposed Fancies, or Delusions of Satan trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himself into an Angel of Light,</hi> which the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration</hi> ought not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for.</q> Very observable also are the Words of our famous SHEPARD to the like Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Parable of the ten Virgins,</hi> P. 198.</note>, <q>There may be in a false Heart, a strange Knowledge of CHRIST without Scriptures, which may ravish a Man's deluded Heart strangely, which is usually the first Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

of the <hi>Virgin</hi> Churches, that are of much Knowledge and little Love, 2 Cor. 11. 2, 3, 4. Wherein Satan doth not seek to pull away Men to forsake the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but from the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of the Gospel.—And hence we have heard, that <hi>some have heard Voices; some have seen the very Blood of CHRIST dropping on them, and his Wounds in his Side; some have seen a great Light shining in the Chamber; some wonderfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their Dreams; some in great Distress have had inward Witness, thy Sins are forgiven, and hence such</hi> LIBERTY <hi>and</hi> JOY <hi>that they are ready to</hi> LEAP UP AND DOWN THE CHAMBER.

            <p>Another <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>true Joy</hi> is <hi>Humility.</hi> It abas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a Man in his own Eyes. He is herefrom led into a low Apprehension of himself, and his own Worthiness. He admires the divine Grace dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd towards such a Worm, such a Wretch! With holy PAUL, he is ready to say, <hi>By the Grace of GOD, I am what I am:</hi> And instead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining a high Conceit of himself in Compare with others, he is rather dispos'd to <hi>prefer them in Love;</hi> esteeming himself <hi>less than the least of all Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this now the Influence of the Joy of these Times? I hope it is so in Respect of some; but of how many may the Reverse be justly said? And of those too, who have been in high Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Who more vain and proud than many of the Converts of the present Day? Who more puffed up with a fond Conceit of their own su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Attainments? Why else so forward and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005151_0180_101874541068F938"/>
forth-puting? Why so ready to think themselves fit to be <hi>Teachers,</hi> and to thrust themselves into the Places and Offices of others? And who more apt to despise others, while they trust in themselves that they are righteous? How else should that be so often the Language of their Practice, if not of their Lips, <hi>Stand off, I am holier than thou?</hi> These Things are too well known to be called in Question: They are indeed common all over the Land.</p>
            <p>That wonderful Man, Mr. BAXTER mentions one Thing as an Argument of the want of due <hi>Humiliation,</hi> which I can't help giving a Place here. <q>When you begin, says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">His <hi>Works,</hi> Vol. 2. 565.</note> to be leavened with <hi>Pride,</hi> and think highly of your selves, and have good Conceits of your own <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Performances,</hi> and would be noted and taken for some Body among the Godly, and cannot bear to be overlook'd, or past by; when you think meanly of other Men's <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> in Comparison of your's, and think yourselves as wise as your <hi>Teachers,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to hear them as Judges with a <hi>majesterial Spirit,</hi> and think you could do as well as this your selves; when you are finding Fault with that which should nourish you, and in every Sermon are most nothing the <hi>Defects,</hi> and think that this you could have mended; when you <hi>itch</hi> to be <hi>Teachers</hi> yourselves, and think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves fitter to <hi>preach</hi> than to <hi>learn,</hi> to <hi>rule</hi> than be <hi>ruled,</hi> to answer than to ask for Resolution; when you think so well of your selves, that the <hi>Church</hi> is not <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>pure</hi> enough for your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, tho' CHRIST disowneth it not, and they force you not to sin; when you grow <hi>censorious,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:005151_0181_10187457D08508D0"/>
and aggravate the <hi>Faults</hi> of others, and <hi>extenuate</hi> their <hi>Graces,</hi> and can see a <hi>Mote</hi> in another's Eye, but will discern none of their <hi>Graces,</hi> if they be not as <hi>high</hi> as <hi>Mountains,</hi> and none can pass for <hi>Godly</hi> with you but those of the most <hi>eminent Magnitude;</hi> when you are itching af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Novelties</hi> in Religion, and setting your Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against the present or ancient Church, and affecting <hi>Singularity</hi> because you will be of no common Way; when you cannot hear <hi>this Minister,</hi> nor <hi>that Minister,</hi> though the <hi>Ministers of CHRIST,</hi> and you are harping upon that, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye seperate,</hi> as if CHRIST has called you to come out of his <hi>Church,</hi> when he calleth you to come out of the Company of <hi>Infidels:</hi> All this cries aloud for further <hi>Humiliation;</hi> you have a <hi>Tympany</hi> that must be <hi>prick'd,</hi> to let out the Wind that puffs you up. If you be not for <hi>Perdition,</hi> and to be <hi>forsaken,</hi> and <hi>given over</hi> to <hi>yourselves,</hi> you must be fetch'd over again, and humbled with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. When God hath turned you inside outward, and shewed you that you are <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi> and that you are <hi>empty Nothings,</hi> who thought so well of yourselves, he will then make you stoop to those that you despis'd, and think your selves unworthy the Communion of those that before you thought unworthy of yours. He will make you think you are unworthy to hear those Ministers, that you turn'd your Back upon: and he will take down your <hi>Teaching, talking vain,</hi> and make you glad again to be <hi>Learners:</hi> In a Word, he will make you by <hi>Conversion,</hi> as <hi>little Children,</hi> or you shall never enter into the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </q> This I look upon to be so exact a Description of these Times; yea, and of those
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005151_0182_101874595C34C788"/>
Persons, who have made Pretences to the <hi>greatest Light</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and in the most <hi>extraordinary</hi> Ways, that I can't but think the Consciences of all must fall in with it. Upon which let me add the Words of the same Author that immediately follow, as a Warning admirably suited to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of this Day, <q>This <hi>spiritual Pride</hi> is a most <hi>lamentable Disease,</hi> and the Issue usually exceeding sad. For with many, 'tis the <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner</hi> of <hi>damnable Apostacy,</hi> and GOD gives them over to their <hi>own Conceits,</hi> and the Wisdom which they so esteem, 'till it hath led them to <hi>Perdition.</hi> And those that are <hi>cured,</hi> are many of them cured by the saddest Way of any Men in the World. For its usual with GOD to let them alone, 'till they have run themselves into some <hi>abominable Error,</hi> or fallen into some shameful scandalous Sins, 'till they are made a <hi>Hissing</hi> and <hi>By-word</hi> among Men, that Shame and Confusion may bring them to their Wits, and they may learn to know what it was that they were proud of, and see that they were but <hi>silly Worms.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>true Joy</hi> is a <hi>becoming Modesty</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> in the Affairs of Salvation. If it makes Persons <hi>bold</hi> in their GOD, they are also <hi>jealous</hi> over themselves with a <hi>godly Jealousy:</hi> Their Boldness is tempered with a <hi>holy Fear</hi> that keeps them upon their Guard, and restrains them from being over-positive and confident. They <hi>rejoice in Hope,</hi> but with <hi>Trembling</hi> also; as being aware of the Treachery of their own Hearts, as well as the subtle Devices of Satan.</p>
            <p>And is this <hi>generally</hi> the Character of those who have been in <hi>Joy,</hi> in these Days? Aro

they not rather too certain of their good Estate, too peremptory in their Assurance? Have they not allow'd themselves, some of them at lest, in speaking too unguardedly upon this Head, being as confident of their Title to Heaven, as tho' they were actually in Possession of it? I believe, it will not be pretended, but that many have been wrought up, even to an <hi>Extravagance</hi> in the Opinion they have had of their Interest in CHRIST, and the Purchases of his Blood. And is this the Temper of those in whom the Peace of GOD reigns? It looks more like the Spirit of those who have been remarkable for the Warmth of their Imaginations.</p>
            <p>In fine, 'Tis ever the <hi>Influence</hi> of <hi>true Joy</hi> to make Men <hi>better Christians,</hi> more like to GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, more eminent for their Faith and Holiness; and in a Word, the <hi>real Substance</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Religion: Which does not consist <hi>only</hi> or <hi>mainly</hi> (to use the Words of Mr. BOLTON<note n="†" place="bottom">His <hi>general Direction for a comfortable Walking with GOD,</hi> P. 57, 58.</note>) <q>in outward Shews, Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Talking; in holding strict Points, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending precise Opinions, contesting against the Corruption of the Times; in the Work wrought, external Forms of religious Exercises, set Tasks of Hearing, Reading, Conference, and the like; in some solemn outward extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Abstinences, Forbearances, censuring others, &amp;c. But in Righteousness and Peace, as well as Joy in the HOLY GHOST; in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Tender-heartedness, Love; in Patience, Humility, Contentedness; in Mortification of
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005151_0184_10187406DEC3D2F0"/>
Sin, Moderation of Passion, holy Guidance of the Tongue; in Works of Mercy, Justice, and Truth; in Fidelity, Painfulness in ones Callings, conscionable conversing with Men; in Reverence to Superiors, Love of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, an open-hearted, real, fruitful Affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateness, and Bounty to GOD's People; in Heavenly-Mindedness, Self-Denial, the Life of Faith; in Disesteem of earthly Things, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World, resolute Hatred of Sin; in approving our Hearts in GOD's Presence, a sweet Communion with him, comfortable Longing for the Coming of the LORD JESUS CHRIST, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And is this the <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>Joy</hi> that has been so common in these Days? I cannot suppose, any will venture to say, it has <hi>generally</hi> been so. The contrary hereto is evident to all who have Eyes to see; and if they don't see, 'tis because they shut their Eyes against the Light. This, in Part, has been made to appear already: And 'twill be more undeniable, the further we go on in this Discourse.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, upon the whole, two Passages, which are well calculated for the <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Warning</hi> of those, who pretend to <hi>high Joy</hi> in these Times. The one is from the great Mr. HOWE. Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">His Book, <hi>the Blessedness of the righteous.</hi> P. 444.</note> speaking of the Joy of the true Christian, <q>It is a modest humble Exaltation, a serious severe Joy; suitable to his solid, sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hope. His Spirit is not puffed up, and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005151_0185_1018745FAB5CC0F8"/>
swollen with Air; 'tis not big by an Inflation, or a light and windy Tumor; but 'tis really fill'd with effectual Pre-Apprehensions of a weighty Glory. His Joy exceedingly exerts it self with a <hi>steady</hi> lively Vigor, equally remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>vain Lightness</hi> and Stupidity, from <hi>Conceitedness,</hi> and Insensibleness of his blessed State. He forgets not that he is less than the least of GOD's Mercies, but disowns not his Title to the greatest of them. He abases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to the Dust, in the Sense of his own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but in the Admiration of divine Grace, he rises as high as Heaven. In his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he affects to equal himself with <hi>Worms,</hi> in his Joy and Praise with <hi>Angels.</hi> He is never unwilling to diminish himself, but afraid of detracting any Thing from the Love of GOD, or the Issues of that Love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other is from the celebrated Mr. BAXTER. <q>GOD, says he<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>His Works,</hi> Vol. 3. P. 246.</note>, must give us <hi>Joy itself,</hi> as well as afford us Matter for Joy: But yet withall it must be remembred, that GOD doth work upon us as <hi>Men,</hi> and in a <hi>rational</hi> Way doth raise our Comforts. He enableth and exciteth us to mind and study these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly delightful Objects, and from thence to gather our own Comforts, as the <hi>Bee</hi> doth ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her Honey from the Flowers. Therefore he that is most skilful and painful in this ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Art, is usually the fullest of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sweetness. Where is the Man that can tell me from Experience, that he hath <hi>solid</hi> and usual Joy in any other Way but this, and that GOD worketh it <hi>immediately</hi> on his Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005151_0186_1018746298380320"/>
without the Means of his Understanding and Considering? It is by Believing, that we are fill'd with Joy and Peace, (Rom. 15. 13.) and no longer than we continue our believing. It is in Hope that the Saints rejoice; yea, in Hope of the Glory of GOD, (Rom. 5. 2.) and no longer than they continue hoping. And here, let me warn you of a dangerous Snare, an Opinion which will rob you of all your Comfort. Some think, if they should thus fetch in their Comfort by <hi>believing</hi> and <hi>hoping,</hi> and work it out of Scripture Promises, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it by their own thinking and studying, that then it would be a Comfort only of their own hammering out, (as they say) and not the <hi>genuine Joy</hi> of the HOLY GHOST. A desperate Mistake, raised upon a Ground that would overthrow almost all Duty, as well as this, which is their setting the <hi>Workings</hi> of GOD's SPIRIT, and their <hi>own Spirits,</hi> in Opposition, when their <hi>Spirits</hi> must stand in Subordination to GOD's. They are <hi>conjunct</hi> Causes, co-operating to the Producing of one and the same Effect. GOD's SPIRIT worketh our Comforts by setting our own Spirits a work upon the Promises, and raising our Thoughts to the Place of our Comforts.—GOD useth not to call in our Joys while we are idle, or taken up with other Things. It is true, he sometimes doth it suddenly, but yet usually in the foresaid Order; leading it into our Hearts by our Judgment and Thoughts.—GOD seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his Saints as the Birds do their Young, bringing it to them, and putting it into their Mouths, while they be still in the Nest, and only gape to receive it. But as he giveth to Man the Fruits of the Earth, the Increase of the Land in Corn and Wine, while we plow,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:005151_0187_101874649D026440"/>
and sow, and weed, and water, and dung, and dress, and then with Patience expect his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: So doth he give the Joys of the Soul. Yet I deny not, that if any should so think to work out his own Comforts by <hi>Meditation,</hi> as to attempt the Work in his own Strength, and not do all in Subordination to GOD, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Necessity of the SPIRIT's Assistance, the Work would prove to be like the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the Comfort he would gather would be like both; even meer Vanity: Even as the Husbandman's Labour, without the Sun, and Rain, and Blessing of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next Thing that is amiss, and very much so, in these Times, is that <hi>Spirit of rash, censorious</hi> and <hi>uncharitable Judging,</hi> which has been so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent in the Land. This appear'd, first of all, in Mr.—W D, who seldom preach'd, but he has something or other, in his Sermon, against <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Ministers:</hi> And what he delivered; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, at some certain Times, had an evident Tendency to fill the Minds of People with <hi>evil Surmisings</hi> against the <hi>Ministers,</hi> as tho' they were, for the most Part, <hi>carnal, unregenerate</hi> Wretches. He often spake of them, in the Lump, as <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, Enemies of CHRIST JESUS,</hi> and the <hi>worst Enemies</hi> he had: And in Truth, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his Preaching, upon this Head, was unhappily calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to leaven the Minds of People with Prejudices against the <hi>standing Ministers;</hi> alienating their Hearts from them, and by this Means, in the most effectual Manner, obstructing their Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And as though he had not done enough, in <hi>Preaching,</hi> to beget in People an ill Opinion of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> he expresses his <hi>Fear,</hi> in his <hi>Journal</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">P. 95.</note>
               <pb n="141" facs="unknown:005151_0188_10187469DEDE4478"/>
of NEW-ENGLAND, left <q>
                  <hi>many, nay, the most that preach do not experimentally know</hi> CHRIST.</q> This Reflection he immediately levels against the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> in <hi>this Land:</hi> And its the more rash and uncharitable, as he past through the Country in <hi>Post-Haste,</hi> having neither Opportunity nor Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to know the real Character of one tenth Part of the Ministers, he thus freely condemns. I don't think this <hi>Gentleman</hi> had it in his <hi>Intention,</hi> by his thus <hi>preaching and writing,</hi> to do an Injury to the Interest of Religion in these Churches; but if this had really been his Design, what more effectual Method could he have taken, than to represent the <hi>Body of the Clergy</hi> as <hi>out of CHRIST.</hi> i. e. <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>unconverted?</hi> And if so, as unfit, according to his other Doctrine, to be the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of converting <hi>spiritually</hi> dead Souls, as a <hi>naturally</hi> dead Man is to beget living Children. What is the Tendency of such a Conduct at this, but to set People against their Ministers as not fit to preach to them, and in this Way, to sow among them the Seeds of Contention and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?</p>
            <p>I freely confess, had the Ministers of NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENGLAND lost their Character as <hi>Men of Religion,</hi> by a <hi>Deportment</hi> of themselves contradictory to the Gospel, I should have found no Fault with any Representations of them as <hi>bad Men;</hi> nay, <hi>dangerous Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom of CHRIST:</hi> For I am clearly of the Mind, that a <hi>visibly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Minister</hi> is the greatest <hi>Scandal</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Plague</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>GOD:</hi> Nor is it a Hurt, but a real Service to the <hi>Cause</hi> of CHRIST, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Characters of such, and lessen their Power to do Mischief. But the Case is evidently different, where the <hi>Profession of Ministers,</hi> and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005151_0189_1018746B62F12120"/>
their <hi>Character,</hi> so far as appears, agree with one another: 'Tis now an <hi>Abuse</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and an Injury to the <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, to insinuate <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions</hi> against them; much more, plainly to speak Evil of them. And may it not be said of the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Ministers,</hi> in NEW-ENGLAND, that they are a Set of Men, as <hi>sound in the Faith,</hi> and of as <hi>good a Life,</hi> as any Part of the Christian World are favoured with? Hear the Opinion of that eminent Man of GOD, Dr. COTTON MATHER upon this Head. Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Book entituled, <hi>Quakerism display'd,</hi> P. 92. 93, 96.</note> in Answer to a Slander of GEORGE KEITH'S, upon the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of NEW-ENGLAND, <q>There is not that Spot of Ground upon the Face of GOD's Earth, which can proportionably match NEW-ENGLAND for <hi>Ministers,</hi> that not only have, and use all <hi>true Piety,</hi> but are also most <hi>exemplary</hi> for it. No Man becomes a Minister in our Churches, 'till he first be a <hi>Communicant;</hi> and no Man becomes a <hi>Communicant,</hi> until he hath been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely examin'd about his <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as well as his <hi>Conversation.</hi> If any <hi>Minister</hi> do misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself, he soon hears of it, and becomes either a <hi>Penitent,</hi> or a <hi>deposed Man.</hi> Let this wicked SHIMEI find so much as <hi>one ungodly Man, allow'd as a Minister, in any one of our</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es!—Neighbours, you are blest with <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> that excel in Piety; and you are very unjust, if you do not support and honour them.—You have Reason to be thankful for such holy, humble, able, painful and prayerful <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi> as GOD has <hi>generally</hi> blest <hi>these Churches</hi> with: And I exhort you, as you would
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005151_0190_1018746EA5E917E8"/>
approve your selves worthy to wear the Name that was begun at ANTIOCH, that you do not forget that Command of our LORD, Heb. 13. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they watch for your Souls.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are yet other <hi>Instances</hi> of <hi>uncharitable Judging</hi> in this <hi>Gentleman.</hi> The same Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his <hi>Journals,</hi> which are gone forth into all Parts of the Land; but especially, in <hi>his Letters,</hi> representing Arch Bp. TILLOTSON, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more <hi>true Christianity</hi> than MAHOMET. It would be going too much out of my Way, or I could easily show, wherein he has greatly abused the <hi>A.Bp;</hi> more especially, in some Things he has given the World from Dr. EDWARDS, without care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reading (as I charitably hope) the Passages quoted, as they lie in the <hi>A. Bp's Writings.</hi> But supposing the <hi>A.Bp.</hi> did not in all Things think exactly with Mr. WHITEFIELD, must he at once be as bad as a TURK? As ignorant of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Religion? As much without GOD and CHRIST, and beyond <hi>Hope?</hi> Will Mr. WHITE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD so far assume to himself the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the SON of GOD, as to determine, that the Things contained in the <hi>A.Bp's Writings</hi> are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely</hi> inconsistent with an upright <hi>Heart, a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Desire</hi> to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>do</hi> the <hi>Will</hi> of GOD? And that 'tis impossible, the <hi>all-merciful GOD,</hi> should, according to the Tenor of the Gospel, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to Favour? It appears to me <hi>shocking Boldness,</hi> in any meer Man, thus to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as it were, in the Throne of CHRIST, and denounce the <hi>Anathemas</hi> of GOD against his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Christians: Nor can I conceive how this should be, where there is, in Exercise, a just
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005151_0191_1018747347D95E70"/>
Sense of a Man's own utter Insufficiency to fit in Judgment upon the State of others.</p>
            <p>The only Thing I can say in Excuse for Mr. WHITEFIELD is, that he was <hi>young</hi> in <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Christian Experience,</hi> as well as of <hi>raw Acquaintance</hi> with <hi>Divinity,</hi> when he wrote these <hi>Letters:</hi> And as it has been common for Persons, in these Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, to speak and write with Rashness and Indiscretion, and so as to do Mischief to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest they would serve; so when they have come to riper Years and Judgment, and a better Knowledge of the Difficulties in many Points of Divinity, they have often seen their Error, and repented of their Conduct: And to this, I believe; this Gentleman will be brought, as he has been in some other Instances, if he ever thinks upon the Matter as he ought.</p>
            <p>Let me add here, as a further Representation of that <hi>monstrous Spirit of censorious Judging</hi> that has been let loose upon the World, a few of the Words of Mr. SEWARD; which I the rather chuse to insert, because they are the Words of one of the <hi>dearest</hi> and most <hi>intimate Friends</hi> Mr. WHITEFIELD had, and relate to the Case of the <hi>A.Bp.</hi> Says he in his <hi>Journal</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See the <hi>Boston-Evening-Post,</hi> Numb. 280. where these Passages are extracted from Mr. SEWARD's <hi>Journal.</hi>
               </note>, <q>I wrote se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Letters.—I told him, some few of the Clergy admitted our Brother into their Pulpits, but that most of them were violent Opposers, especially since our Brother has so openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>A.Bp.</hi> TILLOTSON; that, blessed be
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005151_0192_1018740B658813F8"/>
GOD, that DECEIVER was at last discovered, and our Age must have been grosly wicked, or <hi>his Works</hi> could never have passed thus long for <hi>current Gospel;</hi> but that I trusted in the LORD JESUS, he was about to deliver his Church from such BLIND GUIDES.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A little onwards, <q>concerning A.Bp. TILLOT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON I observed, that our Brother had wrote a second Letter against him, which I believed would surprise most People to see such <hi>base Coin</hi> should pass for <hi>Current</hi> for so many Years; but that, blessed be GOD, the TRAITOUR was discovered. JUDAS sold his LORD for <hi>thirty Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Silver,</hi> the <hi>A.Bp</hi> got a better Price, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, THIRTY BAGS OF GOLD, or more: <hi>That's all the Difference;</hi> for the <hi>A.Bp</hi> was actually bred in the Schools of the Prophets, was join'd with many (as I believe) faithful Ministers in the <hi>Morning Lecture</hi> at <hi>Cripplegate;</hi>—But the <hi>Love of Money is the Root of all Evil,</hi> and he CHOSE HIS GOOD THINGS HERE, a TEMPORAL ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an ETERNAL CROWN.</q> And yet again, <q>Inclos'd I sent him our Brother's Letters against that PLAUSIBLE DECEIVER A. Bp. TILLOTSON, whose <hi>Books have so long bewitched the World.</hi>—Blessed be GOD, the IMPOSTOR is discovered; nevertheless our Brother expects for this to suffer many Things, and be set at Nought by the Rabbies of our Church, and perhaps at last be killed by them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I can scarce conceive wherein <hi>rash judging</hi> can be carried to a greater Height than in these Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. The <hi>Gentleman</hi> is not content with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the <hi>Doctrines</hi> the <hi>A.Bp.</hi> preached, but must judge his State, condemn his Person; which
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:005151_0193_101874141A4330B8"/>
is the more surprising, because he was now <hi>dead,</hi> and actually gone to be judged by him, who has said, <hi>Why dost thou judge thy Brother? Or why dost thou set at Nought thy Brother? For we shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe it will not be denied, by the more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Men among us, but that those venerable Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the late Dr. INCREASE MATHER, and the present Dr. BENJAMIN COLMAN, might know as much of the Nature of <hi>real Christianity,</hi> and be as able to make a <hi>true Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Preachers</hi> of it, as either Mr. WHITEFIELD, or SEWARD: I shall therefore subjoin here the Sentiments of these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> concerning A.Bp TILLOTSON; which may serve, so far as <hi>human Judgment</hi> is of Weight in the Case, to wipe off the Reproach that has been injuriously cast upon him.</p>
            <p>The first of these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> Expresses himself in these Words<note n="†" place="bottom">See his <hi>Preface to his Son's Book, Johannes in Eremo.</hi>
               </note>, <q>That EMINENT Person, Dr. TILLOTSON (the late A.Bp of CANTERBURY) did, not above four Years ago, sometimes express to me his Resentments of the Injury, which had been done to the <hi>first Planters</hi> of NEW-ENGLAND, and his great Dislike of A.Bp LAUD's Spirit towards them: And to MY KNOWLEDGE there are <hi>Bishops</hi> at this Day (Anno 1695) of the same CHRISTIAN TEMPER and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with THAT GREAT AND GOOD MAN LATELY DEAD.—Had the <hi>Sees</hi> in ENGLAND, fourscore Years ago, been fill'd with SUCH <hi>A.Bps</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> as those which KING WILLIAM has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005151_0194_101873E80A9142E0"/>
to <hi>Episcopal Dignity,</hi> there had never been a NEW-ENGLAND.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other speaks in that Language,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Preface</hi> to Mr. COOPER'S <hi>Ordination Sermon.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>We have seen the most venerable Men in the <hi>Church of</hi> ENGLAND for Learning, Piety, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, Usefulness, Prudence, Meekness and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, insulted and outrag'd while they lived, pelted to their Graves, and their Names per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted after their Decease, for their Spirit of Moderation, and faithful Services to the Church. So were A.Bp. TILLOTSON and Bp. BURNET, Men of whom the Age was not worthy; of CONSPICUOUS SANCTITY, abundant in Labours, Steady in their Conduct, of UNSPOTTED INTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GRITY, of an APOSTOLICAL SPIRIT, and ready, I believe, to have <hi>died</hi> either for their <hi>Country,</hi> or for CHRIST: Yet these GREAT AND GOOD MEN have been loaded with Obloquy: but their Names must needs live in the History of the Church, if TRUTH do not perish from the Earth.</q> To go on,</p>
            <p>Sometime after Mr. WHITEFIELD's Departure from us, we had the Discovery of the like <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Spirit</hi> in Mr. GILBERT TENNENT. His Preaching in this Town was <hi>censorious</hi> beyond what can be easily imagined. Says the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> in the BOSTON-<hi>Evening-Post,</hi> Numb. 365, <q>I have several Times heard Mr. TENNENT de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the greatest Part, by far, of the Ministers in this Land, were carnal unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Men, and that they held damnable <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Principles; and have heard him pray,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:005151_0195_10187474CAC297C8"/>
that the LORD would either <hi>convert them,</hi> of <hi>turn them out of his Vineyard.</hi>
               </q> I have my self been several Times present, when he exprest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much to the same Purpose: Nay, I have often heard him publickly declare, that those who were the <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> he was carrying on, were the Enemies of GOD, and would have oppos'd the <hi>Apostles;</hi> nay, CHRIST JESUS himself, and stood it our against <hi>all the Miracles</hi> they wro't, had they lived when they were on Earth: Yea, I have sometimes heard him openly say; and this, without any cautionary Limitations, that they were <hi>Blasphemers</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, and in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of committing, if they had not already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that Sin, concerning which our SAVIOUR has said, it shall never be forgiven to Men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this World, nor in the World to come. But the Spirit in which this <hi>Gentleman</hi> preach'd, particularly when he got upon <hi>Ministers,</hi> can't be better conceived of than by reading his <hi>printed Sermon,</hi> entitled, <hi>The Danger of an unconverted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry;</hi> than which I never saw a Piece more filled with <hi>Censoriousness,</hi> or unhappily fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Discord</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi> 'Tis, in the general, a continued Strain of <hi>bitter Reflections</hi> on the <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministry</hi> of the Land. This is plainly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the <hi>Text</hi> placed on the <hi>Title-Page;</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> Jer. 5. 30, 31. <hi>A wonderful and horrible Thing is committed in the Land; the Prophets prophesy falsly, and the Priests bear Rule by their Means, and my People love to have it so: And what will they do in the End thereof?</hi> But the Thing it self is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly exprest in the strongest Language, in the <hi>Improvement</hi> of the Subject; the first Head where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <q>If it be so, that the Case of those, who have no other, or no better than <hi>Pharisee-Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> is to be pitied, then what a Scrole and
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:005151_0196_101874764E733FD0"/>
Scene of Mourning and Lamentation, and Wo, is open'd! because of the <hi>Swarms of Locusts,</hi> The <hi>Crowds of Pharisees,</hi> that have, as <hi>coveteously,</hi> as cruelly, crept into the <hi>Ministry,</hi> in this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Generation! Who as nearly resemble the Character given of the <hi>old Pharisees,</hi> in the doctrinal Part of this Discourse, as one Crow's Egg does another. It is true, some of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Pharisees</hi> have learned to <hi>prate</hi> a little more <hi>orthodoxly</hi> about the <hi>New-Birth,</hi> than their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessor <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who are, in the mean Time, as great Strangers to the feeling Experience of it as he. They are <hi>blind</hi> who see not this to be the Case of the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</hi> And O! that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that we could Day and Night lament, with the utmost Bitterness, the dolefnl Case of the poor Church of GOD upon this Account.</q>—But this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I would hope, is now become more charitable. His <hi>Letters,</hi> in the <hi>publick Prints,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly avow such <hi>Principles</hi> as are a <hi>virtual Retrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of a great Part of <hi>this Sermon;</hi> though I could wish he had mentioned the <hi>Sermon</hi> by Name, and own'd his <hi>over-Zeal</hi> when he wrote it. This he has done to a <hi>private Friend</hi> in this Town; and if he had done it to the <hi>World,</hi> I am sure, he would hereby have honoured himself, and might have given Check to those uncomfortable <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Animosities,</hi> Which this <hi>Sermon</hi> has had some Influence in fomenting, in one Place and another.</p>
            <p>After Mr. TENNENT, there arose a considerable Number of other <hi>Itinerants,</hi> who went forth in the <hi>Spirit of Bitterness,</hi> sowing the Seeds of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> and <hi>Uncharitableness</hi> all over the Land. The
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005151_0197_10187479C073DC28"/>
               <hi>Writer</hi> of the <hi>Letter</hi> in the BOSTON-<hi>Evening-Post,</hi> Numb. 365, observes of them, <q>that the <hi>Engine</hi> which they artfully manage is that of <hi>Detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Accordingly, in every Place where they come, in the Course of their <hi>Perigrination,</hi> their grand Business is to perswade the People, that their Ministers are <hi>unconverted,</hi> to alienate their Affections from them, and thereby utterly to destroy their Usefulness among their Hearers. From which Practice it is very just to infer, that there is a Design carrying on to <hi>subvert</hi> and <hi>eject</hi> the <hi>standing settled Ministers.</hi>
               </q> He goes on in the next Paragraph, <q>The <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>this Land,</hi> I have often said, and continue still of the same Opinion, are a Set of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as <hi>sound in Principle,</hi> and <hi>exemplary in their Conversation,</hi> as any of the like Number, in the Christian World: And I confess, it has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rais'd in me the highest Indignation, to hear them revil'd in so publick and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Manner, even in the Presence of some of the most grave and eminent <hi>Divines</hi> among us.</q> He still adds, <q>It has been no small Surprise to me, when I have sometimes seen in these Assemblies, a Number of grave and serious Men, Members of our Churches, who could hear these <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>hard Speeches</hi> belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out against their <hi>own proper Pastors,</hi> not only with <hi>Patience,</hi> but with <hi>Pleasure.</hi> At the same Time, if you were to ask these Men, they would tell you that they <hi>highly esteem aud value their own Ministers:</hi> But can this be possibly true? Will any one believe them, while they not only <hi>caress,</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Itinerants,</hi> but continually <hi>pamper their Bodies, clothe their Backs, and fill their Pockets.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="unknown:005151_0198_101874112471ECF0"/>
I have my self been Part of a <hi>crowded Assembly,</hi> when one of these <hi>Itinerants</hi> has mention'd the present <hi>Bp</hi> of LONDON by Name, and uttered it with a Voice like <hi>Thunder,</hi> "That if the People of his <hi>Diocess</hi> should come up to all that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes in his <hi>pastoral Letters</hi> to them, and be the <hi>very Persons</hi> he would have them, they would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding as certainly be <hi>damn'd</hi> as the <hi>Bible</hi> he then had in his Hand was the <hi>Word of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal GOD."</hi> At the same Time, I heard him <hi>pray</hi> for the <hi>Ministers</hi> of BOSTON, some of whom he as freely intimated in his <hi>Prayer</hi> to be in an <hi>unconverted State,</hi> as if he had been their <hi>authoris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judge.</hi> And in a <hi>Letter</hi> to me, giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Conduct of this same <hi>Gentleman,</hi> the worthy <hi>Writer</hi> mentions some Things, he was an <hi>Ear-Witness</hi> to, which exprest the <hi>grossest Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness,</hi> not only towards the <hi>Colleges</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but the <hi>Governours</hi> of them in particular: And, at the same Time, he heard him publickly say of A.Bp TILLOTSON, <q>That when he wrote his <hi>printed Sermons,</hi> GOD knew he had not a <hi>Spark of saving Grace:</hi> And if he was not <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted afterwards,</hi> he was <hi>now weltering under the scalding Drops of GOD's Wrath in Hell, there to remain a Monument of his Vengeance throughout Eternity.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But the most remarkable Instance, in this Kind, is the Rev. Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT of SOUTHOLD. <q>He travelled, says the <hi>Letter</hi> to the BOSTON-<hi>Post-Boy,</hi> Number 391, from STONINGTON to NEW-HAVEN, about 80 Miles, and condemn'd almost all the Ministers; particularly, that <hi>shining Example of Piety,</hi> and <hi>Pillar of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> the aged and venerable Mr. ADAMS, and commanded his People to withdraw from him:
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:005151_0199_101808118307A668"/>
And accordingly a Number of the <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> withdrew from him, as being a <hi>carnal, old Pharisee.</hi>
               </q> This was objected to him by the <hi>Ministers</hi> in BOSTON, when he came to this Town, some Months ago, as sent by GOD, to preach here. He own'd the <hi>Fact;</hi> as also, that he had <hi>bad</hi> but a few Minutes Conversation with Mr. ADAMS before he <hi>publickly</hi> exprest his Fears of his being an <hi>unconverted</hi> Man; and that the Ground of his Judgment of him as <hi>unconverted</hi> was, <q>his not finding that he had <hi>bad</hi> Experience of a <hi>Hatred of GOD,</hi> and of <hi>extraordinary Comforts and Joys.</hi>
               </q> When that had been observed to him, by one of the Ministers, which tended much to the Honour of Mr. ADAMS; another took Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to ask him, whether he had felt no Unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness in his Mind, when he reflected on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Effects of his condemning Mr. ADAMS, and advising the People to separate from him, in the <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Division</hi> it had brought forward in NEW-LONDON: His Reply was, <q>That he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thought of the Matter with Thankfulness of GOD, who had made him faithful,</q> and gave Glory to GOD for this his <hi>notorious Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> in the Face of all the Ministers.</p>
            <p>I have now by me Accounts of the <hi>strange Spirit</hi> of <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>uncharitable Judging,</hi> this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> has discovered in many Places where he has been. Some of them I shall think fit to insert here.</p>
            <p>The first is dated, SAY-BROOK, August 25. 1741. And is in the following Words, </p>

                        <p>On this Day, the Rev. Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT of SOUTHOLD, came to the Chamber of WILLIAM HART of SAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROOK, <hi>Pastor</hi> of the <hi>first Church</hi> there, and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:005151_0200_101806E5206E5670"/>
ask'd him, whether he was willing that he, the said DAVENPORT, should preach in his <hi>Pulpit</hi> that Day: Upon which said HART told him, that there were some Things in his Conduct, which he desir'd to inquire and receive Satisfaction about, first of all; to which said DAVENPORT consenting, it was inquir'd of him, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things, whether he had not openly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged sundry of his <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Brethern</hi> in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> as being <hi>unconverted</hi> and <hi>blind Guides?</hi> To which he answered, that he had; and did freely do it, when he judged so of any. It was then further inquired of him, upon what Grounds he did so, and what Evidence he gave the Publick of the Truth of his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures? To which he answered, that he did this with a View to the Purification of the Church, to the Discovery of those that are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,</hi> that they may be avoided, &amp;c. It was further inquired of him, whether he did freely and openly declare to <hi>People,</hi> whose <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> he did judge to be <hi>unconverted,</hi> that they ought not to attend upon their <hi>Ministry,</hi> but advis'd them to go to <hi>other Churches,</hi> where <hi>Ministers</hi> were <hi>converted, to attend Worship;</hi> or if they could not, then to set up <hi>private sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Meetings,</hi> to carry on the Worship of GOD among themselves?

Pulpit could not be granted him, unless he would first retract these Things, declare his Repentance of them, engaging to conduct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly for the Time to come; he reply'd, that he could not do this without pleasing Men rather than GOD: And then, rising to depart, he addrest himself to his Attendants, saying, <hi>Come, let us go forth without the Camp, after the LORD Jesus, bearing his Reproach;</hi> and smiling said, O this is pleasant to suffer Reproach for the BLESSED JESUS <hi>!</hi> SWEET JESUS <hi>!</hi> To the Truth of all which, we whose Names are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, do testify; having been Eye and Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Witnesses to the above Conference.</p>

                        <p>This Day, about half an Hour after eleven, the Reverend Messieurs WILLIAM WORTHINGTON, ABRAHAM NOT, GEORGE BECKWITH, and WILLIAM HART, went to the Rev. Mr. DAVENPORT'S Lodgings in Town, with Design to discourse further with him, upon those Things in his public Conduct, which had been objected to him the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at Mr. HART'S Chamber: Upon their coming in, Mr. DAVENPORT, who was above Stairs, sent Word he would come down, which he presently did; and after sitting a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevented them by beginning a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which he directed to them, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning either of their Names: In
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:005151_0202_10180747D797EAC0"/>
this Discourse he spake of them, and to them, as <hi>unconverted</hi> Ministers, and very freely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them as <hi>Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing, blind Guides, Enemies to GOD</hi> and <hi>his Cause in the World,</hi> and <hi>Persecutors of CHRIST in the Person of himself his Servant;</hi> and compar'd them to GOLIAH, <hi>who prophanely defied the Armies of the living GOD;</hi> said, he wish'd their <hi>Conversion,</hi> should <hi>rejoice</hi> in it, and wish'd to GOD he would strike them through immediately, and convert them, and a great Deal more of the like Kind. During this Discourse, one of the above-mentioned Ministers attempted twice to speak, in order to turn the Discourse to what they came for, but Mr. DAVENPORT would not be interrupted, but went on without regarding them, and addrest himself to his Brethren pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; exhorting them to pray for the <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> Ministers then present, and suddenly took his Chair, and prayed over them a Prayer of some Length, agreeable to his preceeding censorious and vilifying Discourse, both as to <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Spirit.</hi> Sometimes he prayed <hi>for</hi> them, and sometimes <hi>against</hi> them. When this was over, Mr. HART told him, that he and the other Ministers were come down to wait upon him, with a View to discourse freely with him upon those Things in his Conduct, which had been objected to him the preceeding Day; and desir'd to enter into Conference with him about them, that he might justify them if he could; but he declin'd it, saying, there was no Time for it before <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> He being then ask'd, whether he would give them Opportunity for a free Conference, at some other Time, before his Departure from the Town, he answered that he would consider
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:005151_0203_1018074CABC91B40"/>
of it, and that, if it appear'd most for the Glory of GOD he would; but if it should appear more for GOD's Glory for him to spend the Time that might be employed in discoursing on these Matters, in <hi>praying</hi> for him the said HART, that he might be converted, then he would spend it so. After some other Things had past not worth mentioning, he left the Room, and return'd to his Chamber without taking Leave. To the Truth of the above Narrative, we, whose Names are subscribed, do testify, having been Eye and Ear-Witnesses to what past at that Time.</p>

            <p>The Account from another Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as I have it in a Letter to me, is thus, <q>Of all (i. e. the Itinerants) that have been here, Mr. DAVENPORT hath been the most <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>disorderly</hi> in his Conduct. When he came first to Town, he called at my Lodgings, and let me know that some of the People had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd him to preach that Evening, and asked my Consent to his Preaching in the <hi>Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House:</hi> I reply'd, that before I resolv'd him, I must desire of him Satisfaction in two Points; <abbr>viz.</abbr> by what <hi>divine Warrant</hi> he left his <hi>own People,</hi> and travelled through the Country, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Super-Intendant</hi> over the Churches? And how he justified his <hi>censoriously judging</hi> Men, and especially <hi>Ministers,</hi> as he had done? To which Queries, he gave me no satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; and thereupon was denied the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>House.</hi> He then proceeded to inquire
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005151_0204_1018075391E03F88"/>
into my <hi>spiritual State;</hi> but an Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was refus'd him, until he shewed his right to demand it: And thereupon he expressed his Fears that I was a <hi>Stranger to CHRIST;</hi> and said, that my refusing to give <hi>him an Account</hi> was a <hi>dark Sign</hi> thereof. After this, he soon departed the House: And having mounted his Horse, with his Company at the Door, they set a Tune, and rode <hi>singing</hi> through the Town, all the Way to his Lodgings, which was near a Mile. He preached at the Place where he lodged that <hi>Evening,</hi> and the <hi>next Forenoon;</hi> and the following <hi>Evening,</hi> in his <hi>public</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, he declar'd the Minister of the Place <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted,</hi> and prayed for him, sundry Times, that he might be either <hi>converted</hi> or <hi>confounded.</hi> He warned the People to withdraw from my <hi>Ministry;</hi> declaring, that to attend it would be as dangerous to their <hi>Souls,</hi> as <hi>Bowls of Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to their Bodies.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The like Spirit he discovered at NEW-HAVEN. Says the <hi>Letter</hi> in the BOSTON-<hi>Post-Poy,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. 391.</note> 
               <q>Mr. DAVENPORT, in almost every Prayer, vents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against the Minister of the Place, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten declares him to be an <hi>unconverted</hi> Man; says, that <hi>Thousands are now cursing him in Hell for being the Instrument of their Damnation.</hi> He charges all to pray for his Destruction and Confusion: He frequently calls him, a <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,</hi> a <hi>Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing,</hi> and a <hi>Devil incarnate:</hi> And uses such vile and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Language, as that, had it been done by any other Man, he would have been immediately
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:005151_0205_10180756A5B3A838"/>
sent to the Work-House. I think that few or none of his greatest Admirers undertake peremptorily to justify these Things; but they have conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such an extraordinary Opinion of his <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> and <hi>Success,</hi> as that they seem to suppose that he has some <hi>extraordinary Assistance,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> to do that which may'nt be done by any other Man.</q>

<pb n="159" facs="unknown:005151_0206_10180759A5493E08"/>
World. Upon this, Mr. DAVENPORT declar'd, that Mr. NOYES'S saying so, was an Evidence to him that he was an <hi>unconverted</hi> Man; and afterward, in explaining himself upon the Word <hi>Evidence</hi> said, that it gave him Reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it was so.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Another Reason was, because Mr. NOYES assumed an Honour to himself, in the Ministry, which did not belong to him, because a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told him that, some Years ago, she came to Mr. NOYES, and brought a <hi>Relation</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she mentioned the Names of several Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, whom she supposed had been instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of her <hi>Conversion,</hi> and Mr. NOYES ask'd her if he had not also done something towards her Conversion, and ask'd her why his Name was not mentioned: Mr. DAVENPORT also added, that several other Persons had told him, that Mr. NOYES dislik'd their <hi>Relations</hi> because there were so many Names in them besides his. To which Mr. NOYES replied,</p>
                        <p>That he did not remember any such Thing, and was confident that it was a Misrepresenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another Reason was, that Mr. NOYES was not a Friend to this <hi>Work</hi> going on among them; and that he did not countenance <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant</hi> Preachers; and that several Persons had told him that they came to <hi>Meeting</hi> with their Affections rais'd, and that Mr. NOYES'S <hi>Preaching</hi> deadned and discouraged them, and tended to stifle their Convictions. To which Mr. NOYES reply'd,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="160" facs="unknown:005151_0207_1018075B2BD786A8"/>
That his <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> in <hi>these Things</hi> were publickly known, and that every one was capable of Judging without his saying any Thing upon them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That Mr. NOYES, in private Conversation with Mr. DAVENPORT, had said to this Effect, that he had been deeply sensible of the Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Corruption of his own Nature; and that every one that turned his Thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward might easily have such a Sense: and that Mr. NOYES, seem'd to suppose that it was an easy Thing; that Mr. DAVENPORT thence concluded, that he had never experienced it himself. To which Mr. NOYES replied,</p>
                        <p>That he, at that Time, utterly refus'd to give Mr. DAVENPORT any Account of his Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but that they had some Discourse upon some <hi>doctrinal</hi> Points, but he could not think that Mr. DAVENPORT could reasonably under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand him, to mean or intend, that every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man had a Sense of the Vileness and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his Nature, or that it was an easy Thing to have it. Several Things were said upon this Head which could not easily be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuted down; but on the whole, there seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Misunderstanding between them.</p>
                        <p>Upon the whole Mr. DAVENPORT declared, that <hi>these Reasons</hi> were sufficient to justify him in <hi>censuring</hi> and <hi>condemning</hi> Mr. NOYES as he had done: Then, he said he would make a Sort of Acknowledgment; and, without any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given, while divers in the Room were talking loud, and others smoaking, and some with their Hats on, he <hi>began</hi> a <hi>Prayer;</hi> but
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:005151_0208_1018075E6E6F8708"/>
there being so much Noise in the Room, he was hardly heard at first: Many kept on talking, others cry'd out stop him; the Revd. Mr. NOYES spoke once or twice, and said, Mr. DAVENPORT, I forbid your praying in my House without my Leave; but he persisted, and went on in the midst of the greatest Noise, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and Consternation, and declar'd Mr. NOYES an <hi>unconverted Man, and his People to be as Sheep without a Shepherd,</hi> and prayed, that what he had now said might be a Means of <hi>his</hi> and <hi>their Conversion:</hi> Or else, <hi>according to thy Will let them be confounded;</hi> and after <hi>that Manner</hi> went on near a Quarter of an Hour. And when he had done, Mr. NOYES—forbid him ever going into his Pulpit any more; and some declar'd to Mr. DAVENPORT, that his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Manner was a taking the Name of GOD in vain: And so the Assembly broke up in great Consternation.</p>
                        <p>This is the Truth according to the best of our Remembrance; and the Substance of the Conference was minuted down at the Time of it, and publickly read to Mr. DAVENPORT, and the rest immediately after.</p>

            <p>The same <hi>uncharitable censorious</hi> Spirit, this <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> brought with him to BOSTON. I cannot give a better Idea of it then by inserting, at large,

the <hi>Account</hi> in the BOSTON-<hi>Evening-Post,</hi> Number 370. It runs thus. <q>The late Prosecution of Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT, being somewhat <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> (as was also his <hi>Offence</hi> which procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same) has doubtless occasion'd various Speculations, not only in this Town, but thro' the whole Country. And inasmuch as many <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>unjust Censures</hi> have been plentifully bestow'd on the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in that Prosecution, by <hi>weak, ignorant</hi> and <hi>enthusiastical</hi> Persons; it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to publish the <hi>Presentment,</hi> exhibited by the <hi>Grand Jury</hi> to the <hi>Court</hi> against Mr. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENPORT, with the several <hi>Facts</hi> that were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>sworn</hi> to, by the Witnesses before the <hi>grand Jury;</hi> that so every <hi>rational, sober</hi> and <hi>unprejudic'd</hi> Person may see clearly, on what Grounds the <hi>Jurors</hi> (who were 23 in Number, and only 6 of BOSTON) proceeded in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair: Wherein 21 of them were fully agreed; and of the <hi>two</hi> that dissented, one was an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Exhorter,</hi> and the other profest himself of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therefore could not in Conscience vote in such an Affair, but said the other <hi>Jurors</hi> were entirely right in what they did.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It ought also to be observed, that it was <q>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly given in Charge to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> to enquire strictly into Disorders of an <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Nature, and that upon giving in <hi>this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment</hi> they receiv'd the <hi>Thanks of the Court for that particular Service.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>There is one Thing more to be taken Notice of in this Introduction, and that is, a <hi>groundless</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:005151_0210_101807645ED8CA20"/>
and <hi>malicious Calumny,</hi> industriously spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad by Mr. DAVENPORT'S Adherents,—that the <hi>Grand Jurors of</hi> BOSTON <hi>were chose on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to bring on this Prosecution;</hi> than which nothing is, or can be more untrue; for at the Time of the <hi>Choice,</hi> Mr. DAVENPORT was preaching at IPSWICH, and it was given out by his Followers, that he would not return any more to BOSTON.</q>

            <p>Mr. N. T. says, he heard Mr. D—T, at Mr. WELCH'S, say, in his Prayer, <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. A. says, he heard Mr. J. D—T (at Mr. WARDELL'S, <hi>August</hi> 1.) say in his Prayer, <q>
                  <hi>LORD GOD, thou knowest, that the greatest Part of the Ministers of this great Town are in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted State, and leading poor Souls on to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and therefore LORD, we pray thee to turn them out of the Ministry.

               </q> This was LORD'S-DAY Afternoon, about an 100 present to hear him in the <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Shop,</hi> in <hi>Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Time.</hi>

            <p>Mr. R. H. says, he heard Mr. J. DAVENPORT say, at Mr. WARDELL'S House, in BOSTON, on the <hi>Sabbath-Day</hi> in the Forenoon, in <hi>July</hi> last, <q>
                  <hi>He blessed GOD, he had so many come out from among the unconverted Ministers.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And one of the Grand <hi>Jury</hi> declared to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he heard Mr. JAMES DAVENPORT say <hi>last Monday,</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>the Ministers of the Town of</hi> BOSTON <hi>knew nothing of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; <hi>and
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005151_0215_10180770F8C7FAF0"/>

               </q> But this wan't sworn to in Court."</p>
            <p>I may add, that since the Date of the above <hi>Presentment,</hi> and the Oaths relative to it, Mr. DAVENPORT has often spoken of ALL the Ministers in Town, as in a <hi>Combination against the LORD and his Anointed,</hi> meaning, I suppose, himself; And as though this wan't enough, he has, in his <hi>publick Prayers</hi> and <hi>Preachments,</hi> mention'd the <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> of them by <hi>Name,</hi> as <hi>unconverted</hi> Men, and solemnly warned People to <hi>separate</hi> from them, and not dare to attend on their <hi>Ministry:</hi> And this he did, after having the <hi>Vanity</hi> to go to them all, one by one, to enquire into their <hi>spiritual State:</hi> Though I am glad, I am able to declare, that they all, except two or three, were so far from entring into Conversation with him upon <hi>that Head,</hi> that they chastis'd his <hi>Insolence,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely testified against such an unheard of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. 'Tis a <hi>Rule</hi> with this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> if a Man won't give <hi>him</hi> an Account of his <hi>Christian Experiences,</hi> to look upon <hi>that alone as a dark Sign,</hi> if not a <hi>sure Evidence,</hi> of his being in a <hi>carnal State.</hi> No Wonder then the <hi>Ministers</hi> in Town were condemned by him.</p>
            <p>But enough has been said, and some, perhaps, may think, a great Deal too much, upon the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness</hi> of some of the <hi>chief Instruments</hi> of the <hi>religious Stir</hi> there has been in the <hi>Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I go on to observe, that this <hi>same Spirit</hi> has been <hi>generally</hi> propagated all over the Country, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>common People;</hi> insomuch, that I shall not exceed the <hi>literal</hi> Truth, when I say, that there never was a Time, since the <hi>Settlement of</hi>

NEW-ENGLAND, wherein there was so much <hi>bitter</hi> and <hi>rash Judging;</hi> Parents condemning their Children, and Children their Parents<note n="†" place="bottom">I shall, as an Illustration of this <hi>Censoriousness,</hi> insert here some Part of a Letter, wrote to me by a Friend, upon his own Knowledge. Says he, <q>'Tis remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, those, who were said to be struck with Conviction, immediately seem'd to be fill'd with a censuring and judging Spirit against almost all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Children against their Parents, Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Masters; declaring them to be in an unconverted State.—One <hi>Instance</hi> among many others, I shall mention. There was a young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man about 15 Years of Age, who felt under this Conviction, and for about four Hours together she, in this Manner, exhorted. At first, she began with her Father, and told him, she could see the Image of the Devil then in his Face, and that he was going Post-ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Many such Instances there were of Children con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their Parents. And many <hi>old</hi> Persons also, though, as well as the Parents above, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of unblemish'd Characters, a good Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, sober, and Lovers of Religion, were called, and by Children too, old Hypocrites, Heirs of eternal Damnation, going the Road that would lead them to Hell, &amp;c.</q> I have other Letters by me from whence I could transcribe like Accounts, were it needful.</note>; Husbands their Wives, and Wives their Husbands; Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters their Servants, and Servants their Masters;

Ministers their People, and People their Ministers. <hi>Censoriousness,</hi> to a <hi>high Degree,</hi> is indeed the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Appendage</hi> of this <hi>religious Commotion.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it takes Place the <hi>Subjects</hi> of it, too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, are <hi>uncharitable</hi> to <hi>Neighbours,</hi> to <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>same Community,</hi> to Relatives, to <hi>Ministers</hi> in an especial Manner; yea, to all the World that are not in <hi>their Way of thinking and speaking:</hi> And what may be worth a Note, the Places where <hi>this Appearance</hi> has been <hi>most remarkable,</hi> have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been most <hi>filled with Uncharitableness,</hi> in all the Expressions of it.</p>
            <p>It would take up too much Room to relate the <hi>hard Speeches,</hi> the <hi>monstrous Sayings</hi> which have been uttered among us; and this, not in a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Place</hi> only, but in <hi>most Towns</hi> throughout the <hi>Provinces,</hi> where there has been any Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable of <hi>this Commotion:</hi> Nay, to such an <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable Height</hi> have some suffered their <hi>Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness</hi> to rise, that they have declared, they would as soon have <hi>Communion with the Devil,</hi> as with many, both <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> against whom they have yet nothing to say, but that they don't <hi>judge</hi> as they do about the <hi>present Times.</hi> Some of the most valuabe Ministers in the Country, meerly on this Account, have been call'd all the bad Names one can easily think of: Nor have even those escaped, who, for 20, 30, 40 Years, have so caused their Light to shine before others, as that they have seen their good Works, and might have learn't from their good Example to glorify our Father in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>this Spirit,</hi> there is a very <hi>great Appearance</hi> of <hi>Contention</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> which, if GOD don't mercifully interpose, will endanger a

Breach in <hi>all the Churches</hi> in the <hi>Land:</hi> Nay, <hi>separate Meetings</hi> are already begun in <hi>one Place</hi> and <hi>another. Two</hi> have been set up in this Town of BOSTON; another, at NEWBURY; another, at NEW-LONDON; another, at NEW-HAVEN; another at MILFORD; and <hi>others still</hi> in some <hi>other Places:</hi> And there are a Number in CHARLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOWN, in DORCHESTER, in MILTON, and <hi>elsewhere,</hi> who han't <hi>Charity</hi> for their own <hi>Pastors</hi> so much as to hear them <hi>preach;</hi> though they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a <hi>universal good Character,</hi> not only for their <hi>ministerial Gifts,</hi> but for being <hi>Examples</hi> to their Flocks, in <hi>Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity:</hi> Nay, I verily believe, there is not SO MUCH AS ONE MINISTER IN THE WHOLE LAND, but the Minds of many are so <hi>prejudiced</hi> against them, on one Account, or another, as that their Power to do good is hereby greatly lessened.</p>
            <p>The Things I have here mentioned are no <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets:</hi> They are notorious, and must be evident to all who have <hi>Eyes to see,</hi> and <hi>Ears to hear:</hi> And so far will the <hi>more zealous</hi> among our <hi>new Converts</hi> be from disowning them, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>glory</hi> in having it said, that they have <hi>come out </hi> from <hi>unconverted Ministers and Churches;</hi> imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they have herein complied with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of GOD,</hi> which says, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye separate; and ye shall be my People, and I will be your GOD.</hi>

            <p>Some may, if they please, call <hi>this Spirit of Censoriousness,</hi> operating in <hi>Clamour,</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> an <hi>accidental Effect</hi> only of the Revival of a <hi>good Work;</hi> but from what has been said, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptive of the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of the <hi>main

Instruments</hi> in beginning, and carrying on <hi>this Work,</hi> it appears with a <hi>Meridian</hi> Lustre, that it is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their <hi>Spirit,</hi> wherein it was bad, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to others. And <hi>such Effects</hi> may always be expected from <hi>such Causes;</hi> They are no other than their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>genuine</hi> Produce: And 'tis, to me, one of the strangest Things, that any should be at a Loss to determine otherwise.</p>
            <p>But let these Effects be produced how they will, they are certainly very pernicious ones; and must be accounted so by all, who make an Estimate of them from the <hi>Scripture.</hi> Our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR is not more express in cautioning against any Vice whatever, than this of <hi>uncharitable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> JUDGE NOT, is his peremptory Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 7. 1.</note> and weighty is the Argument with which he backs it; <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That if we judge, we shall be judged.</hi> Men will <hi>judge</hi> us, who are seldom want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Kind of Retribution, but dispos'd rather to give full Measure, pressed down and running over. But what is much worse, GOD will <hi>judge us.</hi> And don't we need his Pity and Mercy? Shan't we otherwise be cast in the Judgment? And can we expect any other, while we are hard and severe in our Treatment of our Brother, and ready, without due Allowances, to condemn him? And very solemn is that <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes to all who are given to <hi>rash Censure,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Who art thou that judgest another Man's Servant?</hi> Our <hi>Brother,</hi> we judge, is GOD'S Servant; not <hi>our's.</hi> While therefore we call him to the Bar of our Judgment, we invade GOD'S Prerogative, exercise an unjust Jurisdiction over
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005151_0220_1018077F8BDE8748"/>
his <hi>Servant;</hi> a Power we have no Right, nor Business to use. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another Man's Servant?</hi> What Pretence hast thou to do thus? Who made thee a Judge? Who gave thee this Power over <hi>another Man's Servant?</hi> He <hi>standeth or falleth to his own Master.</hi> He only can acquit or condemn him; the Right of thus judging is his, and belongeth not to another. Thou art therefore <hi>inexcusable, O Man whoever thou art, that judgest thy Neighbour;</hi> for herein thou takest that upon thee, which thou hast no Claim to; herein thou settest thy self up, as it were, in the Room of the Almighty, and art guilty of the Arrogance of acting as tho' thou wast in his Stead.</p>
            <p>I know, in some Cases, it may admit of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, what is <hi>uncharitable Judging:</hi> And so it may, what is <hi>Intemperance,</hi> or <hi>Injustice,</hi> or <hi>Oppression,</hi> and the like. But this does not argue, but that in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Instances,</hi> the Intemperance or Injustice may be so evident, as to leave no Room for Debate upon the Matter. And this is the Case with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Judging</hi> that now prevails. If there is any such Vice, it now takes Place: Nor can it easily be imagin'd, wherein Men could be more <hi>grosly</hi> guilty of it. This <hi>Prohibition</hi> of our SAVIOUR was never, I believe, more outragiously trampled upon, than it now <hi>commonly</hi> is by <hi>Multitudes</hi> of those, who call themselves good Christians. In Respect of many, 'tis as plain, they live in the Breach of this Law of GOD, as that any do in the Breach of the Law of <hi>Temperance</hi> or <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And it ought to be considered with all Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that <hi>uncharitable, censorious Judging</hi> is a Sin as well as <hi>Intemperance</hi> or <hi>Injustice;</hi> and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, as bad a Sin, if not a worse: And it ought
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:005151_0221_1018078167F7E348"/>
not therefore to be excused. The same <hi>Law-giver</hi> and <hi>Judge</hi> who has said, thou shalt not <hi>steal,</hi> or <hi>get drank,</hi> has also said, thou shalt not <hi>judge;</hi> and the Law is guarded with the like <hi>Sanction</hi> of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> 'Tis therefore dangerous to Men's Souls, to speak of this <hi>mischeivous Vice</hi> as a <hi>humane Frailty only, a meer Imprudence,</hi> that will well enough consist with a <hi>Work of GOD</hi> in their Hearts. 'Tis true, <hi>good Men</hi> may be betrayed into <hi>this Sin;</hi> and so they may into <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> or <hi>Injustice;</hi> but if they allow themselves in it, if they live in the habitual Practice of it, it will <hi>as certainly damn them</hi> as if they liv'd in the Practice of any other Sin. And they ought to be told the <hi>plain Truth.</hi> I am sure, the great St. PAUL plainly tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when there appear'd the Want of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> among them, that nothing else, while they were destitute of this, would avail to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He does not tax them with <hi>Imprudence only,</hi> but solemnly assures them, in the Name of the great GOD of Heaven, that all their other Attainments were nothing, that no <hi>Work of GOD</hi> could be wrought in their Hearts, if they were <hi>without Charity;</hi> that Charity, of which he has given a large and beautiful Description, in the 13th <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>first Epistle</hi> to them. And I leave it with the <hi>Conscience</hi> of every Man acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>State of Things at this Day,</hi> whether <hi>this Charity,</hi> the <hi>genuine Effects</hi> of which, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> has here enumerated, is not as <hi>not oriously</hi> want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among us, as it can be suppos'd to have been among the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is there any one Thing, in all the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of GOD, that is more <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly</hi> cautioned against, than this <hi>Uncharitableness,</hi> discovering it self in <hi>Strife, Sedition and Schism?</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:005151_0222_10180784F56D3730"/>

            </p>
            <p>And what is worthy of particular Notice, <hi>this Law of Charity</hi> is the Law of <hi>Christianity</hi> by Way of <hi>Eminence. This is</hi> MY COMMANDMENT (says our SAVIOUR)<note n="*" place="bottom">John 15. 12.</note>

               <hi>By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have Love one to another.</hi> Nay, if Men do not <hi>love one another,</hi> neither do they <hi>love GOD.</hi> The <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> is express in this.<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 John 4. 20.</note>

               <hi>In this are the Children of GOD manifest, and the Children of the Devil: Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of GOD; neither he that loveth not his Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And shall it be thought, after all this, a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of slight Consideration, whether Men, profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves Christians, dwell together in Love and Peace? And if they are hard and cruel in their Censures and Reproaches of one another, and fall into Strife, and carry it to such a Height that they can't have Communion with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, shall this be made <hi>so little</hi> of, that they may notwithstanding be <hi>remarkably good Christians?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There may, 'tis true, be an <hi>Appearance</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, even in the <hi>grossest Uncharitableness;</hi> and Men may pretend a <hi>Zeal for GOD,</hi> while they are trampling upon the <hi>Christian Law of Love:</hi> But their <hi>Zeal</hi> in this Case, is not a <hi>Fire kindled at GOD's Altar;</hi> nor will it atone for their Guilt.

            <p>I cannot better close this Head than in those observable Words of the Apostle PAUL,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 16. 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Now I beseech you, Brethren, mark them which cause Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them. For they that are such, serve not our LORD JESUS CHRIST; but

their own Belly: And by good Words, and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the Simple:</hi> Which are glossed upon, by the <hi>Continuators</hi> of Mr. HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY'S <hi>Expositions,</hi> in a Manner well worth our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in these Times. <q>Those, say they, who introduce and propagate dividing and offending Notions, which are most erroneous, or justly suspected; who, out of Pride, Ambition, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of Novelty, or the like, causelesly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from their Brethren, and by perverse Disputes, Censures and evil Surmisings, alienate the Affections of Christians from one another;—these cause <hi>Divisions and Offences,</hi> contrary to, or different from, the <hi>Doctrines which they have learn'd.</hi> Now, <hi>Mark those that thus cause Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</hi> observe them, the Method they take, the End they drive at. There is Need of a piercing, watchful Eye to discern the Danger we are in from such People: For commonly the Pretences are plausible, when the Projects are very pernicious.

            <p>Another Thing, I can't but think of danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tendency, is, <hi>that</hi> Regard to <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Impressions,</hi> which has prevail'd among too many; their <hi>Aptness</hi> to take the <hi>Motion of their own Minds</hi> for something <hi>divinely extraordinary,</hi> or to put <hi>those Constructions</hi> upon <hi>common Occurrences,</hi> which there is no Ground for but in their <hi>own Imaginations.</hi> Mr. WHITEFIELD had evidently a <hi>Turn of Mind</hi> too much disposing him this Way.

               <q>As I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Night on an <hi>Errand</hi> for my <hi>Mother,</hi> an UNACCOUNTABLE, BUT VERY STRONG IMPRESSION WAS MADE UPON MY HEART, THAT I SHOULD PREACH AND PRINT QUICKLY.—When I came Home, I innocently told my <hi>Mother</hi> what had befallen me.—But she (like JOSEPH'S <hi>Parents,</hi> when <hi>he told them his Dream</hi>) turning short, upon me, cried out, <hi>What does the Boy mean? Prithce, hold thy Tongue,</hi> or something to that Purpose. SINCE GOD HAS SHOWN HER FROM WHOM THESE IMPRESSIONS CAME.</q> A still more surprising (and, as I think, very <hi>sinful</hi>) Account, we have in the 29th Page, in these Words, <q>One Day perceiving an <hi>uncommon Drought,</hi> and a <hi>noisome Clamminess</hi> in my Mouth, and using Things to allay my <hi>Thirst,</hi> but in vain; IT WAS SUGGESTED

TO ME, that, when JESUS CHRIST CRIED OUT, I THIRST, his Sufferings were near over.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, I threw my self upon the Bed, CRYING OUT, I THIRST, I THIRST. Soon after I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Load to go off; a <hi>Spirit of Mourning</hi> was taken from me, and I knew what it was <hi>truly to rejoice in the LORD.</hi> At <hi>first,</hi> after this, I could not avoid <hi>singing Psalms</hi> wherever I was; but my <hi>Joy</hi> gradually became more <hi>settled,</hi> and, blessed be GOD, has abode, and increased in my Soul saving a few casual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions, ever since.</q> There are <hi>numerous</hi> other Instances of this <hi>Turn of Mind,</hi> both in this <hi>History of his Life,</hi> and <hi>all his Journals.</hi> I shall turn to only one or two more.

               <q>Many Months have I kneeled to study and pray over these Books, as tho' I had been sitting at my <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Feet.</hi> The HOLY SPIRIT, from Time to Time, has let me into the <hi>Knowledge of divine Things;</hi> and I HAVE BEEN DIRECTED, by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reading the Scriptures, in this Manner, EVEN IN THE MINUTEST CIRCUMSTANCES, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the JEWS, who consulted the URIM and THUMMIM at the HIGH-PRIEST'S BREAST.</q> The <hi>other</hi> we have in the next Page, <q>At my first coming to GLOUCESTER, being us'd to visit the <hi>Prisoners</hi> at OXFORD, I prayed most earnestly, that GOD would open a Door for me to visit the <hi>Prisoners</hi> here also.—Quickly after, I DREAM'D, that <hi>one of the prisoners came to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by me.</hi>—The DREAM WAS IMPRESSED MUCH UPON MY HEART.—In the Morning, I went to the Door of the <hi>County-Goal,</hi> I knocked, no

I waited still upon GOD in Prayer; and in SOME MONTHS, came a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a Friend at OXFORD, desiring me to go to one PABWORTH, who had broken out of OXFORD-<hi>Goal,</hi> and was retaken at GLOUCESTER.—As soon as I had read this Letter, it was SUGGESTED to me that my Prayer was now ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered.

            <p>I have not transcrib'd the above <hi>Passages</hi> from Mr. W—D with a View to reflect Disgrace upon him; but because I really believe, the <hi>Spirit</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in them (as well as in an hundred others of the like Import, in his <hi>Writings;</hi> more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>his Life</hi> and <hi>Journals</hi>) has been of great Disservice in propagating the like <hi>fanciful Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> to others. I have all along encourag'd a Hope of this <hi>Gentleman</hi> as a <hi>real Christian:</hi> And he has certainly been <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>active</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond most of his <hi>Brethren.</hi> But has he not, thro' the <hi>Inexperience</hi> of <hi>Youth,</hi> and an <hi>Intemperature</hi> of <hi>Zeal,</hi> been betray'd into such Things as cannot but be condemned? I always had, I consess, a bad Opinion of his Conduct in many Articles; as judging it led, in the natural Tendency of Things, to produce Mischief. And, in particular, I was always afraid, lest People, from him, should learn to give Heed to <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Impressions,</hi> and by Degrees come to <hi>Revelations,</hi> and other <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries,</hi> in this Kind. His so frequently <hi>writing</hi> after such a Manner, as to lead People to think, he imagined he was under the <hi>immediate, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> Guidance of the HOLY GHOST, in almost

I doubt not, the SPIRIT <hi>may be felt.</hi> i. e. Christians may have an <hi>inward real Perception</hi> of those Things which are the <hi>Effects</hi> of the <hi>SPIRIT's Influence;</hi> but this quite differs from an <hi>immediate Feeling of the SPIRIT himself,</hi> which, if I mistake not, is the Thing always meant by this Gentleman: And while he insisted upon <hi>this Kind of Feeling,</hi> he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally neglected giving People warning of the Danger of a <hi>deluded,</hi> or <hi>over-heated Imagination;</hi> which I could not but wonder at, considering how many, in all Ages, have impos'd upon themselves, thinking they <hi>felt</hi> the <hi>Divine SPIRIT</hi> acting in them, when it was apparent to every one else, that it neither was, nor could be any other than the <hi>Motions</hi> of their own <hi>Fancies,</hi> or the <hi>Sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Satan;</hi> and herefrom my Fears, from the first, rose high, as to the unhappy Influence of this Conduct upon many Sorts of Persons: Nor are the extraordinary Pretences to the <hi>Spirit</hi> in <hi>Revelations, Impressions,</hi> and the like, which have been common at this Day, any Thing beyond what might have been expected.</p>
            <p>But besides this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> others have paid an undue Regard to <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Impressions,</hi> and given

given too much Heed to the <hi>Fancy</hi> of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in an <hi>immediate</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Manner,</hi> guided and assisted by the HOLY SPIRIT. The Rev. Messieurs BARBER<note n="†" place="bottom">This Mr. BARBER went with Mr. W—D to GEORGIA; and is now at the ORPHAN-HOUSE, and has (as I have lately heard) the chief Care of <hi>instructing</hi> and <hi>bringing</hi> up the <hi>Children</hi> there.</note> and DAVENPORT claim Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence of all others.</p>
            <p>I have received a particular Account of these, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> upon the Head we are considering, from an able and faithful Friend, which I shall gratify the Publick with. It is as follows; <q>—with Regard to Messieurs BARBER and DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENPORT;—When Mr. WHITEFIELD'S Fame, and the wondrous Successes of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ENGLAND, first reach'd us, they receiv'd him in their Minds as an <hi>Angel of GOD</hi> and thought surely the Time was at the Door, when the Glory of the LORD should fill the whole World, and the People be turn'd to him as one Man; not doubting but that Mr. WHITEFIELD was a chosen eminent Instrument in <hi>this Work.</hi> When he first came to NEW-YORK, you know he was receiv'd and admir'd, and what a mighty Influence he had upon the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> of his Hearers. These <hi>Gentlemen</hi> hearing of these Things, were abundantly confirmed in this Thought, that <hi>vital Religion</hi> was beginning to have a <hi>glorious Revival,</hi> and <hi>astonishing Spread</hi> thro' the whole Land; and that Mr. W—D, whom they esteemed a wonderfully <hi>holy Man,</hi> would be an <hi>eminent Promoter</hi> thereof. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they apply'd themselves, in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:005151_0231_1018079EB7D69228"/>
Manner, to seek of GOD the <hi>Out-pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Spirit</hi> upon the <hi>Land,</hi> to bring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the expected happy Day; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that he would please more fully to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> them, what he was about to do, and give them a <hi>great Share of his Spirit,</hi> and improve them as <hi>eminent Instruments</hi> in promoting <hi>this glorious Work,</hi> in the <hi>Expectation</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> of which, their Minds were now <hi>swallowed up.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>After some Time of <hi>waiting</hi> and <hi>seeking</hi> in this Manner, and frequently <hi>communicating their Thoughts to each other,</hi> and <hi>mutually Strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>confirming one the other</hi> in these Expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, those Words, in Habak. 2. 3. <hi>The Vision is yet for an appointed Time, but at the End it shall speak, and not lie: Though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry:</hi> These Words, I say, were IMPRESSED with uncommon Strength upon Mr. BARBER'S Mind, and possest his Imagination and Tho'ts for some Time. By this he understood in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that the SPIRIT confirmed his former Thoughts of GOD's being about to effect a <hi>wonderful Revival of Religion,</hi> and directed him to <hi>wait</hi> for further Discoveries of that Matter, which should, in due Time, be made him. This render'd him much more engaged in <hi>seeking</hi> and <hi>expecting</hi> some <hi>extraordinary</hi> Discoveries, than he was before; and very earnest to know the <hi>Vision:</hi> And this being by him communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Mr. D—T, had the same Influence on him.</p>
               <p>A short Time after this, Mr. BARBER, having been up late one Saturday Night, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time retir'd the next Morning, in <hi>deep Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="unknown:005151_0232_101807A03A55F9A8"/>
on these Things, in earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> for, and <hi>strong Desires</hi> and <hi>great Expectations</hi> of some further Discoveries of this Matter, he at length quitted his Retirement to attend the <hi>Morning</hi> Devotion of the Family; as Part of which, he read the 102 Psalm, in the 13th Verse of which are these Words, <hi>Thou shalt arise, and have Mercy upon Zion: For the Time to favour her; yea, the set Time is come:</hi> At the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, it was POWERFULLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MIND, that <hi>that</hi> was the <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>speaking forth of the Vision.</hi> And by these Words, he suppos'd he had received <hi>certain Intelligence</hi> from him, who has <hi>reserved the Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons before appointed, in his own Hands,</hi> that the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>set Time,</hi> for the <hi>glorious Coming</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom of Grace</hi> was <hi>now fulfilled:</hi> The <hi>Sense</hi> of which, and other concurring Thoughts so over-poured his <hi>animal</hi> Frame, that he <hi>sunk down</hi> in his Chair, and remained for some Time but just alive. At length recovering, though remaining exceeding fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and weak, he went out and attended the publick Service of the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>After this, he spent about a Week, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, in going from <hi>House</hi> to <hi>House</hi> through all his <hi>Parish,</hi> declaring unto <hi>all,</hi> both great and <hi>small,</hi> what <hi>Discoveries</hi> GOD had made to him of what he was about to do, and how he <hi>faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> at the <hi>beholding of the Vision</hi> (which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, as to <hi>his people,</hi> so afterwards to <hi>others,</hi> in other Places, to EZEKIEL'S and DANIEL'S <hi>Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and being <hi>weakened</hi> and <hi>astonished</hi> at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding some of the <hi>Manifestations</hi> of the <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>terrible Majesty</hi> of the LORD) and solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warning and exhorting them to <hi>repent,</hi> for
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005151_0233_101807A1ED71C230"/>
that the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven was at Hand:</hi> And this he did as one <hi>extraordinarily instructed</hi> and <hi>commissioned</hi> for that Purpose. And from this <hi>Time</hi> he openly declar'd that he had an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Call</hi> and <hi>Mission</hi> to go, and publish abroad what GOD had reveal'd to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>wonderful Revival of Religion,</hi> which was now to begin; and to warn and call Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Repentance</hi> under the <hi>immediate Direction</hi> of the HOLY GHOST. Whether he founded his <hi>Call</hi> upon the above mentioned Texts alone, or on some others with them I know not.</p>
               <p>After this, he left the OYSTER-PONDS, (the Place where he had been Preaching) and went forth to publish and preach the same Things unto others; and came first to SOUTHOLD, where he found Mr. D—T fully in his Sentiments as to these Things, absolutely believing that the <hi>LORD had spoken to him;</hi> which he might be the rather dispos'd to do, as he had <hi>himself</hi> much about the same Time, STRONG IMPRESI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, and, as he believed, PARTICULAR INTIMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS FROM THE HOLY GHOST, of the <hi>same Things,</hi> in those Words of the 115 Psalm, the 12th, 13th, 14th Verses, <hi>The LORD hath been mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of us, he will bless us; he will bless the House of</hi> Israel; <hi>he will bless the House of</hi> Aaron; <hi>he will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great. He shall increase you more and more, you and your Children.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Accordingly, Mr. DAVENPORT call'd an <q>
                  <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of the People, in which Mr. BARBER declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same Things, which he had done before at the OYSTER-PONDS; and exhorted them in like Manner. From thence he went forward
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005151_0234_101807A39D05AC18"/>
through all the <hi>Parishes</hi> of that Town, saying, for Substance, every where the same Things.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>N. B. When he went from the OYSTER-PONDS upon this Business, as he counted his <hi>Mission</hi> somewhat like that of our LORD's <hi>Disciples,</hi> who were sent forth before him into every City, whither he himself would come, so he suppos'd himself oblig'd to follow the <hi>Directions</hi> given them on that Occasion; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, took <hi>no Money with him,</hi> neither <hi>Change of Apparel,</hi> nor <hi>Shoes,</hi> but was shod with <hi>Boots:</hi> And as he past along through the Several <hi>Parishes</hi> of SOUTHOLD, he publickly declar'd that he <hi>had laid aside all Study</hi> and <hi>Fore-thought</hi> of what he should deliver in his <hi>publick Speeches</hi> to the People, (some who heard him thought so) and depended wholly on the IMMEDIATE DIRECTION OF THE HOLY GHOST, and that 'twas <hi>given him in that Hour,</hi> from Time to Time, <hi>what he should speak:</hi> Also, that he knew nothing <hi>where he was to go next</hi> beforehand; but was IMMEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATELY INSTRUCTED as to that by the SPIRIT, from Day to Day. From this Time likewise, he took it upon him to <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> the <hi>Spiritual State</hi> of People with great Assurance; in all which Things Mr. DAVENPORT concerted with him, and has ever since, in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, professed and acted accordingly.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>West-End</hi> of SOUTHOLD, Mr. BAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BER'S <hi>Spirit</hi> led him to an obscure Place about <hi>twenty</hi> Miles forward, call'd the OLDMANS; where, at his Coming, he call'd the People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and spake to them the <hi>same Things</hi> he had all along declar'd. Here he abode some
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005151_0235_101807A966E85F78"/>
Months, refusing for a long Time to preach to them any more, though often desir'd as I was inform'd about that Time: Neither could he be perswaded to remove thence, or return to OYSTER-PONDS, though much importun'd there to by some of his best Friends, who went from thence for that Purpose; but led an inactive idle Life, 'till he was grown very <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;</hi> alledging in his Justification, that he had received NO DIRECTION FROM THE SPIRIT TO RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOVE THENCE, and must remain <hi>stationed</hi> there, so long as the <hi>Cloud abode upon the Tabernacle.</hi> At length, after some Excursions, he return'd to OYSTER-PONDS, and from thence, over a while, went to RHODE-ISLAND to see Mr. W—D, and join'd himself to him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Before I go on with my <hi>Friend's Narration,</hi> I would just remark, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> brought <hi>this same Spirit</hi> along with him to RHODE-ISLAND. Mr. WHITEFIELD relates,<note n="†" place="bottom">See his <hi>Journal</hi> at NEW-ENGLAND, Page 42.</note> 
               <q>that he told him, he came to RHODE ISLAND, under a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that he should see him there, and had been waiting for him eight Days; for he said, these Words were MIGHTILY IMPRESSED ON HIS HEART, <hi>Is not</hi> AARON <hi>the</hi> Levite <hi>thy Brother? I know he can</hi> SPEAK WELL; <hi>and also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee, and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his Heart: And I will be with thy Mouth, and with his Mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</hi>
               </q> But what is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Notice is the <hi>Letter</hi> he sent to Mr. WHITEFIELD, which concludes with this unheard of Paragraph.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. <hi>Journal,</hi> Page 41.</note> 
               <q>I shall omit writing any Thing,
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005151_0236_101807AC0359D190"/>
and only hereby present my hearty Love; and let you know, that I am now <hi>waiting at the Post of your Door for Admission.</hi> Tho' I AM UNWORTHY, MY LORD IS WORTHY, IN WHOSE NAME, I TRUST, I COME.</q> How Mr. WHITEFIELD could think so well of <hi>this Part</hi> of the <hi>Letter,</hi> as to publish it to the World, I am at a Loss to conceive. It appears to me to be an Act <hi>of downright gross Idolatry.</hi> He makes Use of the GREAT SAVIOUR as a <hi>Medium</hi> of <hi>Approach</hi> to a frail mortal Man. I trust Mr. W—D did not see it in this Light; but it's the <hi>genuine Construction</hi> of the Thing: And I wish it may be blotted out of every one of these <hi>Journals,</hi> as not fit to be seen among Christians. I now proceed,</p>
            <q>
               <p>From the Time of Mr. B—R'S passing thro' SOUTHOLD, in the Manner above-mentioned, which was, as I remember, in <hi>March</hi> 1740, Mr. D—T betook himself to much the same Method of addressing and exhorting his People, with incredible Zeal and Earnestness, persuaded as he was, that the SPIRIT HAD REVEALED TO HIM, that the <hi>Kingdom of GOD</hi> was now coming among them with Power, and that he had an EXTRAORDINARY CALL to labour in the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
               <p>Particularly, at a <hi>Meeting</hi> of many of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at his Lodgings, he continued his Speech to them for almost <hi>twenty four Hours</hi> together, 'till he was <hi>quite wild,</hi> and so spent and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, that he did not recover his <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>Cahnness of Thought</hi> and <hi>Passions,</hi> 'till after some Days Confinement to his Chamber; all which, was, with him, the pure Effect of the <hi>mighty Energy of the Spirit</hi> upon his Mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:005151_0237_101807ADF10AB000"/>
At this Time, also, he began to make an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Difference between his <hi>Communicants,</hi> such as he judged <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>others;</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one BROTHER, the other NEIGHBOUR, both in speaking to them, and of them: Which, at length, proceeded so far, that he <hi>publickly forbid the</hi> NEIGHBOURS <hi>to partake of the Sacrament,</hi> some of whom were accounted as <hi>substantial</hi> and <hi>valuable</hi> Christians as any among them. By this <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange</hi> Method of Conduct, ushur'd in as it was, the People's Minds were presently thrown into mighty Tumults. Some believed this <hi>Gentleman's Fancies</hi> to be REVELATIONS OF THE SPIRIT; and his <hi>Words,</hi> ORACLES: But the most Part were astonished and confounded in their Thoughts. Many were soon thrown into a <hi>tumultuous Concern</hi> and <hi>Terror,</hi> and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers over a little while pronounced Converts.</p>
               <p>I must acquaint you with one Thing more, worthy of Notice which happened the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following. There was a poor Woman liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the next <hi>Parish</hi> to Mr. DAVENPORT'S, counted religious, who had been <hi>totally distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> of a long Time, and <hi>dumb</hi> for a Season. Mr. DAVENPORT, possest with a Notion, that he could <hi>pray her</hi> into her right Mind, and to the Use of <hi>her Tongue,</hi> though the <hi>philistines</hi> could afford her no Relief, spent a Day of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> for that Purpose, with a Number of his admiring Brethren. At this Meeting (I think it was) he set a <hi>certain Day,</hi> by which Time, if not before, he was <hi>assured,</hi> she would be delivered, and <hi>recover her Speech.</hi> On that very Day, the Woman died, without having spoken a Word, or discovering any Signs of being in her right Mind. When this was
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:005151_0238_101807B161286B28"/>
objected to him, he said, his <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>verfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>Prayers answered,</hi> in the Event; for that she was delivered that very Day by being received to Heaven.</p>
               <p>I was my self at SOUTHOLD sundry Days, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six Weeks after the first beginning of these Things; and <hi>then</hi> and <hi>there</hi> received the <hi>Substance</hi> of this Account, so far as it relates to Things transacted before my being there, <hi>partly</hi> from Mr. D—T'S <hi>own Mouth,</hi> and partly from a Gentleman of his <hi>Parish</hi> of undoubted Credit, who had the greatest Advantages to know these Things, perhaps, of any Man in the Place; Mr. D—T then <hi>lodging</hi> at his House. And all the other Parts of it have been so credibly related to me, and <hi>so often confirmed,</hi> that I know no Reason to doubt their Truth.</p>
               <p>When Mr. D—T came to SAY-BROOK, which was the latter Part of <hi>August,</hi> 1741, he had raised Expectations of making many <hi>Converts</hi> there. I had heard, sundry Times, before he came from the ISLAND, of his Design to come to this Place, and that he had exprest a strong <hi>Belief,</hi> that the <hi>LORD had much People to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of</hi> SAY-BROOK. And while he was at LYME, where he tarried some Time, I heard frequently of his expressing an Expectation of doing Wonders here. Some of his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and <hi>intimate Friends,</hi> and of the <hi>Chief</hi> of that <hi>Way,</hi> his <hi>own Parishoners,</hi> who came over to this Town, from him, when at LYME told some of the People, that the LORD HAD RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARKABLY SIGNIFIED TO MR. DAVENPORT, that he had a GREAT WORK to do at SAY-BROOK; and that some of the BRETHREN had <hi>had</hi> the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:005151_0239_101807B3DA98D680"/>
like INTIMATION, and that <hi>they themselves</hi> were FULL OF THIS FAITH: And <hi>this</hi> seems to have been the <hi>general Expectation</hi> of his <hi>Adherents</hi> so far as I can learn.</p>
               <p>I suppose, while his <hi>Imagination</hi> was fired with the Prospect of doing Wonders here, he either read, or happened to recollect in his Mind, the <hi>Story of</hi> JERICHO, whereupon it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd to his Thoughts, that the <hi>Conquest</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to make of SAY-BROOK, was well repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereby: Upon which, his <hi>Imagination</hi> took the Hint, and painted out a most pleasing Comparison, which raised his Passions, gladdened his Heart, inflam'd his Zeal, and increas'd his Confidence of Success, and so beguil'd him into a <hi>fond Belief,</hi> that the SPIRIT OF GOD HAD RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEALED AND CONFIRMED to him what WONDERFUL THINGS were to be done, in <hi>this Place,</hi> by <hi>his Hands,</hi> before <hi>hidden under the Disguise</hi> of that Piece of <hi>Scripture</hi> History.</p>
               <p>My Reason for this Supposition is, the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of his speaking of <hi>this People,</hi> and <hi>himself,</hi> when here, both in his <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Preaching.</hi> JERICHO, according to his Representation of the <hi>mystical</hi> Sense of that Piece of History, is SAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BROOK; the <hi>Walls of it,</hi> the <hi>People's Opposition</hi> to his Spirit, or according to his Sense of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the SPIRIT OF GOD; The KING OF JERICHO, is the MINISTER of the Place; the <hi>Priest's compassing the Walls,</hi> and <hi>sounding Rams-Horns,</hi> is his <hi>compassing the Town about, and preaching the Word</hi> here; the <hi>seven Days</hi> that they <hi>compassed the Walls,</hi> before they <hi>fell,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a <hi>set Time</hi> for the <hi>People's falling from their Opposition</hi> to his Ways, to GOD and <hi>Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:005151_0240_101807B663D26130"/>
according to him; and that, at <hi>that Time,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Minister</hi> should be <hi>slain,</hi> and the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> made <hi>willing Captives</hi> to him. This <hi>set Time,</hi> he had a great Mind should not exceed the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of <hi>seven Days,</hi> and exprest himself <hi>pubick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> some of the <hi>first Days</hi> of his being here, as <hi>strongly expecting</hi> that, in <hi>that Time,</hi> they should be brought over; though so far as I can learn, he was so cautious as never to declare <hi>positively,</hi> that this would be effected within the Compass of the <hi>seven Days.</hi> However, he had the Mortification to carry <hi>his Days,</hi> and was obliged, at last, to leave the <hi>Walls standing</hi> more firmly than when he came to demolish them.</p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>last Days</hi> of this <hi>Gentleman'</hi>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Place, he declar'd that the SPIRIT HAD NOT TOLD HIM, when the Work should be accomplished, but only that it should be in the APPOINTED TIME; and that he was <hi>assured,</hi> it would be, when the SET TIME was come, which, whether it would be, <hi>this Year</hi> or <hi>next,</hi> he knew not.</p>
               <p>Mr. D—T came to this Town on <hi>Tuesday.</hi> On <hi>Thursday,</hi> or <hi>Friday,</hi> of the same Week, Capt. JOHN LEE, of the <hi>east Parish</hi> in LYME came over, and brought the following Story. A Number of <hi>little Children,</hi> of <hi>that Parish,</hi> held a <hi>private Meeting</hi> among themselves, one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after Mr. D—T'S being at SAY-BROOK; in which, among other Things, they <hi>prayed</hi> very earnestly, that Mr. DAVENPORT might have <hi>great Success</hi> in that Place, using the <hi>Phrases,</hi> he was so very fond of; <abbr>viz.</abbr> that at the <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Rams-Horns, the Walls of</hi> JERICHO <hi>might
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:005151_0241_101807B7E6CDA3B8"/>
fall.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> were, to Appearance, under a <hi>great and strong Impression;</hi> many of them <hi>falling down.</hi> One of them ran and called Capt. LEE, who, coming to the <hi>Meeting,</hi> found them exceeding full, and <hi>wonderfully transported.</hi> 'Twas represented, and received by Mr. DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENPORT'S <hi>Adherents</hi> as a very <hi>remarkable</hi> Thing, that the <hi>Children,</hi> at the Distance of a dozen Miles, should be mov'd to <hi>pray for Success</hi> to Mr. DAVENPORT'S <hi>Preaching</hi> in SAY-BROOK, in the <hi>same Phrases</hi> which he <hi>himself</hi> used in the Place, when they could not be supposed to know that he used the like; and as a clear Proof, that he was guided by a <hi>good SPIRIT,</hi> and as a <hi>certain Earnest,</hi> that by the <hi>sounding of his Rams-Horns,</hi> the <hi>Walls</hi> of the Town should be <hi>shaken to the Ground.</hi> It was remark'd by others upon the Occasion of this Story, that Mr. D—T had publickly us'd the <hi>same phrases,</hi> while yet at LYME, with Regard to SAY-BROOK; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, at the Sound of his <hi>Rams-Horns,</hi> the <hi>Walls of</hi> JERICHO might fall: And therefore, that the <hi>Children</hi> might well know, that he had used <hi>these Expressions,</hi> and use them themselves, in Imitation of him, without any EXTRAORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARY dictating of the HOLY GHOST.</p>
               <p>'Twas also remark'd, that this Story came very <hi>seasonably</hi> for Mr. D—T, his <hi>Rams-horns</hi> beginning, by this Time, to grow into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt among the People. And indeed, so sunk was their Reputation, that <hi>this Story,</hi> with all the Colourings that could be given it, could not procure them any Credit. Some were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant as even to imagine, that this look'd very like a <hi>Romish Miracle,</hi> and to suspect some
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:005151_0242_101807B97B0E9F30"/>
                  <hi>pious Fraud</hi> in the Matter.—The <hi>Impartial</hi> will doubtless judge reasonably of this Affair.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Account I received from the Revd. Mr. WILLIAM HART of SAY-BROOK, who stands ready to justify every Article contained in it. It may seem indeed to some like a <hi>Romance,</hi> and be scarce thought worthy of the least Credit. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to give Countenance to it, present the <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> with <hi>some Part</hi> of Mr. D—T'S Conversation with the <hi>Body of the Ministers</hi> in <hi>this Town,</hi> and the <hi>Ministers</hi> of CHARLESTOWN, who, upon his coming here, sent to him to desire to have some friendly Discourse with him: In which Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, will be seen (if I mistake not) the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> operating in the <hi>same Manner,</hi> as has been above described, however extravagant it may appear to the World. It is as follows,</p>
            <q>
               <p>Mr. D—T, being present with the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> was ask'd by the Rev. Dr. COLMAN, in the <hi>Name</hi> of his <hi>Brethren,</hi> to give them an Account of his <hi>Opinion,</hi> with Respect to the <hi>Operation</hi> and <hi>Influence</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD on the Minds of Believers; because they had heard, that he laid too much Weight upon <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Impressions.</hi> Mr. D—T, after lifting his Eyes and Face to Heaven, and <hi>praying to GOD</hi> as if he expected immediate Direction from him, said, that he would answer as the LORD <hi>should assist him:</hi> And then began to talk as if he meant to give the <hi>Doctor</hi> a <hi>direct Answer;</hi> but having talk'd it may be, a Quarter of an Hour, without coming to the Point, or giving the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters any Satisfaction, the <hi>Doctor</hi> stopt him, and desired him to give a <hi>catagorical</hi> Answer to the Question proposed: Upon which, he said,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005151_0243_101807BDAED51708"/>
he would give them an Account of his <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and <hi>GOD's Dealings with his Soul;</hi> and then <hi>prayed</hi> again to GOD for Direction. When one desired him to be short, he answered, he would be as short as possible, but that he would not <hi>stint the SPIRIT of GOD neither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Account he gave of his <hi>Conversion,</hi> and <hi>GOD's Dealings with his Soul,</hi> or his <hi>Experiences,</hi> as he at other Times exprest it, lasted from <hi>nine to eleven at Night:</hi> and <hi>for an Hour and half next Forenoon,</hi> with but little Interruption. Among a great many other Things he told us the two following Stories.</p>
               <p>The first was occasioned by his being ask'd why he call'd his <hi>Fellow-Traveller</hi> his <hi>Armour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bearer?</hi> In Reply whereto, he said, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he commenc'd <hi>Itinerant,</hi> this <hi>Brother</hi> that was <hi>now</hi> with him, and had been his <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Traveller</hi> from the beginning, propos'd to him to go and preach the Gospel beyond the Bounds of his <hi>own</hi> Congregation; to whom he gave no Answer, <hi>as not knowing the Will of the</hi> LORD <hi>concerning that Matter.</hi> But after some <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon it, and <hi>Prayer</hi> to GOD, as he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Bible</hi> to read, the <hi>Story of</hi> JONATHAN <hi>and his Armour-Bearer</hi> cast up to him, without his having the least Thought of turning to it. He read, and <hi>saw</hi> (as he said) <hi>every Line, every Word in a new Light;</hi> and the LORD caused it to make a STRONG IMPRESSION upon him. As JONATHAN and his <hi>Armour-Bearer</hi> went to the <hi>Garrison</hi> of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> so he thought the LORD CALLED HIM and the <hi>Man that was with him</hi> to <hi>go</hi> and <hi>preach</hi> to the People in EAST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAMPTON. He communicated this IMPRESSION
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:005151_0244_101807C06B3A1DC8"/>
to the <hi>Man,</hi> who answered as JONATHAN'S <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour-Bearer</hi> did, <hi>do all that is in thine Heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I am with thee.</hi> Then they <hi>prayed</hi> to the LORD, and the IMPRESSION upon his Mind to go to EAST-HAMPTON was so <hi>strong,</hi> that he was <hi>as sure the</hi> LORD SENT HIM <hi>as he was of his own Existence.</hi> Moreover, the LORD TOLD HIM, that he should <hi>convert as many</hi> of the People at EAST-HAMPTON to CHRIST JESUS, as JONATHAN and his <hi>Armour-Bearer slew of the Philistines.</hi> But then, he told the MAN, that as the <hi>Philis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</hi> called to JONATHAN and his <hi>Armour-Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> to come up to them, so <hi>they</hi> must wait, till they should receive a <hi>Call</hi> from the People of EAST-HAMPTON. Accordingly, some of the People, in a few Days, signified to Mr. D—T, that they would be glad, he would come and preach to them. Away they travelled, <hi>he</hi> and the <hi>Man,</hi> up to their <hi>Knees in Snow;</hi> which he compared to JONATHAN'S and his <hi>Armour-Bearer's climbing up, upon their Hands and upon their Feet, to the Garrison of the Philistines.</hi> And according to the <hi>Faith which GOD had wrought in him,</hi> he said, he <hi>slew twenty Persons in</hi> EAST-HAMPTON. i. e. He <hi>converted twenty to JESUS CHRIST. </hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The other <hi>Story</hi> he told was this. <q>The LORD COMMANDED him to go to a Town, the Name of which I have forgot, to preach to the People. As he rode along, he became very uneasy and troubled in his Thoughts, because he knew not what he should say to the People, to whom he was going. He <hi>prayed</hi> to the LORD, and these Words were brought to his Mind, and made a <hi>strong Impression</hi> on him, <hi>Take no Thought what you shall say, for it shall be given you in that Hour.</hi> Upon this his Trouble vanished, and he was
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005151_0245_101807C1F107B648"/>
                  <hi>as firmly perswaded GOD would assist him, as he was of the Truth of his own Existence.</hi> [This Way of speaking he generally us'd in such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses] When he began to preach, he had neither <hi>Words</hi> nor <hi>Thoughts</hi> enough to go on; but very soon, <hi>GOD all at once darted a great Light into his Mind,</hi> so that for one <hi>Thought he</hi> was able to utter (and he said he spoke very flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently too) <hi>GOD put ten into his Heart.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>It may be remark'd when he told the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of his having <hi>done any Thing,</hi> or <hi>gone to any Place,</hi> he always exprest it in some such Language as that, GOD CALL'D ME, or GOD COMMANDED ME, or GOD IMPRESSED IT UPON MYMIND; and particularly he told them, that GOD SENT HIM TO BOSTON. Being ask'd, if by <hi>GOD's Calling,</hi> or <hi>commanding,</hi> or <hi>sending him,</hi> or <hi>impressing it upon his Mind,</hi> and such like Ways of speaking, he meant that GOD IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPIR'd HIM as he did the <hi>ancient Prophets;</hi> he answered, that they might call it INSPIRATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON, or by what other Name they pleased.</p>
               <p>From which, and many such like Things. <hi>all</hi> the Ministers concluded, (as may be seen in their <hi>printed Declaration</hi>) that he had upon him a STRONG TINCTURE OF ENTHUSIASM.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Fellow-Traveller</hi> was of the Same Stamp, for being desir'd to give an Account of some Things, which he knew better than Mr. D—T, he talk'd just as he had done. The LORD CALLED me, the LORD MADE A STRONG IMPRESSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON ON MY MIND, I was as sure of it as of my own Existence, and the like.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="199" facs="unknown:005151_0246_101807C4FA12E9B0"/>
N. B. This <hi>Fellow-Traveller</hi> is a <hi>Lay Man,</hi> of no Education, and but small Capacity. We had often heard of him before he came to Town with Mr. D—T: And though he was always spoken of in the Style of his <hi>Armour-Bearer,</hi> it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to be only in a Way of <hi>Ridicule.</hi> But when Mr. D—T came to Town, it was soon seen to be the real Truth of the Case; for he went no where without <hi>this Man,</hi> and he so far regarded the SOUND of his <hi>Character</hi> as his <hi>Armour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bearer,</hi> that, wherever he walk'd with him, he would have him <hi>under one of his Arms,</hi> to be, as it were, a Support to it. And in <hi>this Form</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways went to the Place where he was to <hi>preach,</hi> and in like Manner returned from it: And all, no Doubt, in his own <hi>Imagination,</hi> by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> of the SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>I have said so much about this Mr. D—T, that I fear, I have been too tedious. But I chose to be thus particular, as he has all along had <hi>so great</hi> a Hand in the <hi>religious Stir,</hi> as it has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, more especially, in most Places in CONNEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICUT, and LONG-ISLAND. 'Twas <hi>he</hi> that began the <hi>Out-cries, Swoonings, Raptures,</hi> and the like <hi>Extraordinaries,</hi> in those Parts: Nor has any Man been more successful this Way than he. He ought indeed to be always mentioned as the <hi>most noted Instrument,</hi> in the Production of those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markables,</hi> which have made so much Noise in the Land. And he has been as well spoke of by some of the <hi>famous</hi> Men in the <hi>new Way,</hi> as any among them all. Mr. CROSSWELL says, Mr. WHITE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FIELD declar'd it as his Tho't of him,<note n="*" place="bottom">BOSTON <hi>Post-Boy,</hi> Numb. 392.</note> "That of <hi>all Men living</hi> he knew of <hi>none,</hi> who kept a <hi>closer
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005151_0247_101807CB474B8208"/>
Walk with GOD;"</hi> and that "Mr. TENNENT, in his Hearing, gave him the character of being one of the <hi>most heavenly Men</hi> he was ever acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with." And for himself, "he prays GOD to bless and prosper <hi>this wondrous Man,</hi> whom he hath <hi>made strong for himself."</hi> And giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Preaching at STONINGTON, he says,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Post-Boy</hi> Ibid.</note> 
               <q>The first Day he preach'd, he believed, near a <hi>Hundred</hi> were struck with deep Distress almost in a Moment, <hi>enquiring what they should do to be saved?</hi> Many of his <hi>Opposers,</hi> among the rest, came trembling, and asking Forgiveness of GOD, and him, for all their <hi>hard Speeches, which they, ungodly Sinners, had ungodly spoken against him.</hi> The <hi>Hand of the LORD</hi> was with him also, the <hi>following Days,</hi> so that a <hi>considerable Number</hi> believed, and turned to the LORD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He adds, <q>To be brief, the Number of those who were thought to have received the KING of GLORY into their Souls, in <hi>eight Days,</hi> in three Towns, was computed to be about <hi>one Hundred;</hi> among which, some were <hi>Negroes;</hi> and, I think, about <hi>twenty Indians;</hi> besides a <hi>vast Multitude,</hi> who were left under <hi>hopeful Convictions.;</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But from the Accounts I have given of Mr. D—T is it possible, these Gentlemen should think justly of him, or of his Success in Preaching. And if the <hi>Converts</hi> of his making are of the <hi>like Spirit</hi> with himself, (as is commonly the Cafe) what must be the Opinion of the World concerning them? I believe, in <hi>general,</hi> they will entertain a just Thought of them, while they imagine them
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:005151_0248_101807CCCB7E6200"/>
to be <hi>such Sort of Persons</hi> as Mr. D—T has himself been described to be.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding these <hi>high Encomiums</hi> of <hi>this Gentleman,</hi> by Mr. W—D, T—T, C—L, and others that might be mentioned, he has been actually pronounced <hi>non compos mentis</hi> by the whole <hi>Government</hi> of CONNECTICUT.<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Account at large, in the BOSTON <hi>News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paper,</hi> Numb. 1997.</note> The same Opinion 12 <hi>Men,</hi> under <hi>Oath,</hi> had of him, here at BOSTON.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Evening-Post,</hi> Numb. 370.</note> And the <hi>Ministers</hi> in <hi>this Town</hi> and CHARLESTOWN have declared it to the World as their Judgment,<note n="§" place="bottom">Their <hi>printed Declaration.</hi>
               </note> 
               <q>That he is a Gentleman much acted by <hi>sudden Impulses,</hi> upon such Explications of the Holy Scriptures to himself and his particular Friends, Designs and Purposes, as they can by <hi>no Means</hi> approve of, or justify; but must needs think <hi>very dangerous</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> to the <hi>Interest</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
               </q> For which Reason, among others, they were united to a Man in refusing him their Pulpits.</p>
            <p>After all, I deny not, but that Mr. D—T may have been the Means of <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>Souls.</hi> i. e. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally,</hi> and as the <hi>Tendency</hi> of his <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> may have been <hi>overruled</hi> in GOD'S <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the World; for in the <hi>natural Course</hi> of Things, it led <hi>directly</hi> to <hi>Confusion</hi> and <hi>every evil Work;</hi> And this has, in Fact, been the <hi>Effect,</hi> more or less wherever he has gone.</p>
            <p>I pass now to some other <hi>Preachers</hi> of the <hi>same Spirit</hi> I have been describing; among whom, if I should again mention Mr. D—T, I hope the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:005151_0249_101807CE83598F28"/>
Reader will forgive me; especially, when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Gentlemen</hi> I have in View, besides Mr. D—T, are Messieurs POM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROY, WHEELOCK, ALLEN, BLISS; all of whom, it is generally known, are of <hi>one Soul,</hi> and have gone into the <hi>same Method</hi> of Conduct: Tho' I believe Mr. D—T has outdone them all. These are the <hi>Ministers</hi> (excepting Mr. BLISS whose Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence <hi>now</hi> is in these Parts) who have had the <hi>chief Hand</hi> in raising the <hi>Commotions</hi> in CONNECTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CUT; where <hi>sudden Impulses</hi> and <hi>extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to the Spirit,</hi> have been more <hi>general</hi> (in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion) and <hi>Extravagant,</hi> than in any of the other <hi>Governments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been at no small Pains to trace <hi>this Spirit</hi> in <hi>these Gentlemen</hi> up to its <hi>true Origin:</hi> And as, I think, it will reflect great Light upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>religious State</hi> of Things in the Land, and be of <hi>publick Service,</hi> to communicate the <hi>Informations</hi> I have received upon this Head, I shall here do it, without any further Apology.</p>
            <p>I shall first transcribe a <hi>Letter</hi> from NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILFORD, dated Nov. 16. 1742. This may seem at first View to be remote from the Business in Hand; but the Close of the <hi>Letter,</hi> together with what may follow, will open its Design, and evidently shew forth the <hi>Rise</hi> of the <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> of the abovenamed <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> It is as follows,</p>

and various <hi>Tenets,</hi> and <hi>present State,</hi> of those People among us commonly called, QUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERS; a Task very difficult, almost as much so as that of the whole Affair of the NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGHTS, as they are called; yet, for your Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I shall undertake the Business, and give a short, general, and faithful Account, to the best of my Ability; though the doing of this will be a renewing of Grief.</p>
                  <p>Take the Account in the following Order.</p>
                  <p>Some Time in the Year 1726 there appeared a <hi>flaming Zeal</hi> for Religion, among a Number of our People; the Occasion of which (as was said) was the <hi>dying Counsel</hi> of a loose young Man to his Companions. They set up <hi>Private Meetings,</hi> which they carried on by praying, reading good Books, singing, &amp;c. The <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> were chiefly of the <hi>younger Sort</hi> of People; of CHILDREN about FIVE or SIX Years of Age, and so upwards to about <hi>twenty one,</hi> or <hi>two:</hi> And there were among them two or three of <hi>thirty</hi> Years, or more; tho' they were mainly of the more <hi>youngerly Sort.</hi> There seem'd to appear so much of a Spirit of <hi>real Religion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, that we were greatly encouraged with the Hope, that true Christianity was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd among us; and we were strengthened in this Hope by their <hi>abundant Zeal and Warmth</hi> in religious Things, which was <hi>as great</hi> as you may any where behold at this Day. After a while, they multiplied their <hi>Meetings</hi> to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e or four in a <hi>Week,</hi> and I my self frequently met with them, and some elder Persons; and were ready to rejoice with them in the <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Appearance of Religion.</hi> The Town was then
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:005151_0251_101807D4E5C0E6D8"/>
but small, I suppose under the Number of <hi>forty Families;</hi> and yet, there was such a <hi>religious Progress,</hi> that there was <hi>added to the Church,</hi> FIFTY, or upwards, in about the Space of 17 or 18 Months.</p>
                  <p>About the Space of a Year after they set out, as I remember, Things evidently appear'd with another Face. They first discover'd a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>spiritual Pride,</hi> which wonderfully grew and increased in them, and evidenc'd itself by its <hi>Fruits;</hi> especially, a <hi>Spirit of discerning and judging the State of others,</hi> so that there were scarce any that escap'd their Censure, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Living</hi> or the <hi>Dead,</hi> in their Memory. Upon this they began to <hi>purge their Meetings,</hi> (to use their Language) and disallow the <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> (as they termed them) to meet with them; for they gave out, that there were <hi>false Brethren</hi> and <hi>Betrayers:</hi> And they shifted from Place to Place that they might have none but <hi>Converts</hi> among them. By this Time, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be much alarmed, elder Persons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from their <hi>Meetings,</hi> and restrain'd their Children; yet notwithstanding, there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>wonderful Itch</hi> in many to be with them, and sundry did follow them; and they allow'd them so to do, in Hope of <hi>proselyting</hi> them.</p>
                  <p>Soon after this, they began to correspond with the <hi>Opinionists</hi> in the Country, and to be the Occasion of <hi>Talk</hi> and <hi>Noise.</hi> The <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> wrote to them from RHODE-ISLAND; and so did the ROGERS'S <hi>Crew,</hi> who afterwards made them a <hi>Visit,</hi> and brought them <hi>Books,</hi> with which they were very much pleas'd and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. Now it was that the <hi>Spirit of Pride
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:005151_0252_101807D669415338"/>
and Error</hi> began more openly and daringly to appear in them. They speak very slightily of the <hi>Psalms of</hi> DAVID, and some other of the <hi>Books of sacred Canon;</hi> not to mention many <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>human</hi> Composure, which they treated with Contempt; tho' highly esteem'd by others as <hi>orthodox</hi> and <hi>judicious:</hi> Nor did it end in this only, but they proceeded further, even to <hi>condemn Gospel-Ministers in general,</hi> and the <hi>civil Magistrate</hi> also. To our <hi>civil Rulers</hi> they gave no better Style than the BEAST.—These Things, with what followed, threw the Town into great Confusion, (as you may well suppose) which is so well known, that I need only speak it: They were indeed generally lamented and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved by the venerable Ministers about us, as the <hi>Effects</hi> of a <hi>Spirit of Error.</hi>—But to go on,</p>
                  <p>Upon their <hi>professing,</hi> and using Endeavours to <hi>spread</hi> these Things, with <hi>other Errors,</hi> and discovering at the same Time great <hi>Rancour of Spirit,</hi> those, who were before <hi>ensnared</hi> by their <hi>fair Shew,</hi> were brought to consider; and many left them, forsaking their <hi>Meetings.</hi> Upon this, the <hi>principal</hi> Persons in this Affair, to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of about <hi>fifteen</hi> or <hi>sixteen</hi> in all, Men and Women, young and old, SEPARATED themselves, went out from us, and were no more of us; setting up and meeting by themselves, on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and also on the <hi>Thursday,</hi> which were their chief and constant <hi>Meeting-Days.</hi> Tho' they met on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> yet they held no <hi>Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in that Day more than in any other Day.</hi> They also chose a <hi>Speaker</hi> (as they termed him) whom they principally depended on; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, <hi>any one preached that was moved by the SPIRIT,</hi> whether <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Woman;</hi> tho' not
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:005151_0253_101807D7EB2CA878"/>
without they were thus <hi>moved by the SPIRIT:</hi> And so they went on managing; yet, as I am credibly informed, some Years ago, there was a Time when the SPIRIT fail'd them, and they had none but <hi>silent Meetings</hi> for a Year or more. Besides their <hi>Speaker,</hi> they had another Kind of <hi>Officer</hi> among them, whose Business it was to take Care of their <hi>Cloathing,</hi> as to its Colour, Fashion, Make, &amp;c. But his <hi>Title</hi> I have forgot. However, this is remarkable, that as they began with <hi>spiritual Pride,</hi> so this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them; for it was their <hi>Contention</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their <hi>Officers</hi> that <hi>divided</hi> them. Part are returned to their <hi>own Sheepfold,</hi> Part gone over to the <hi>Church of</hi> ENGLAND, and about <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi> still remain under the Influence of the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> and in the same Errors, unless (as in the Case of all Error) there may be a Variation in some Things: Though I must add, that even these <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi> seem'd, of late Years, to be more <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>sociable,</hi> and there was a Prospect of their returning back to us, before the Appearance of the NEW-LIGHT; for now they seem to think, <hi>They are the Stone cut out of the Mountain, that shall fill the whole Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for their particular <hi>Tenets,</hi> it is difficult, they are so much given to change, to describe them; yet, in general, (besides their Notion of the SPIRIT'S <hi>being in, and sensibly, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately leading them,</hi> as I above said) their <hi>Opinion</hi> may be collected from the following Account.</p>
                  <p>At their <hi>first setting out,</hi> as they strongly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and asserted <hi>Assurance in Believers,</hi> yea, <hi>all Believers;</hi> so they themselves had the <hi>Faith of Assurance,</hi> and were not <hi>in Doubt,</hi> in the <hi>least
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:005151_0254_101807DC48BF3A30"/>
Measure,</hi> for the Space of a Year; Nay, they affirm'd it to be a <hi>Sin,</hi> a <hi>great Sin,</hi> in any Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to <hi>doubt of their good Estate:</hi> And they had an <hi>Assurance</hi> (as they themselves said) of the Salvation of <hi>other Persons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They deny the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>human Learning,</hi> as a Qualification for the Work of the <hi>Ministry.</hi> If Men are <hi>converted, that</hi> they think is <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient:</hi> Nor may any <hi>but such</hi> take upon them the Business of <hi>Preaching.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They likewise hold, that none are <hi>converted,</hi> but such as <hi>conform to them;</hi> and therefore they <hi>join</hi> with none else in <hi>religious</hi> Affairs.</p>
                  <p>They us'd to deny and despise the <hi>external Ordinances</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> and the <hi>LORD's Supper;</hi> though they pretended a Regard to them according to some <hi>spiritual</hi> Sense and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But of late they have somewhat altered their <hi>Principles</hi> upon these Points, and say they could receive the <hi>Ordinances,</hi> if administred by a CONVERTED Man. And since the <hi>late Stir</hi> in the Country, some of them have said frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they wish'd they could see Mr. W—D, or T—T, they could receive the <hi>Ordinances</hi> from them.</p>
                  <p>And, as <hi>spiritual Pride</hi> seems to have been the Ground of all their other <hi>Errors,</hi> so from this <hi>Root of Bitterness</hi> has sprung the vain Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence they make to <hi>sinless Perfection:</hi> For this absurd and wicked Opinion they assert and hold.</p>
                  <p>They also declare as well as judge, that none of our Ministers are fit to <hi>preach,</hi> or adminster
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:005151_0255_101807DF04936AD0"/>
the <hi>Ordinances;</hi> and that <hi>none</hi> ought to <hi>hear</hi> them: They have likewise an Opinion of our <hi>civil Rulers</hi> as not fit to set at the Helm of Government, being <hi>unconverted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must not omit observing to you, that as several of these Persons have, at Times, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced their <hi>Errors,</hi> and confest the <hi>Spirit of Delusion</hi> they were under, so some of each of the <hi>three Parties.</hi> i. e. of those who have <hi>return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us,</hi> or <hi>gone over to the Church,</hi> or still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their <hi>former Spirit,</hi> do, to my Knowledge, assert, that <hi>much of the Spirit</hi> that is produced by the ITINERANTS and their <hi>Preaching,</hi> is the SAME WITH THEIR'S: And some of the <hi>standing</hi> QUAKERS, particularly (for such are the small Remnant of this <hi>Sect</hi> remaining) will <hi>gladly hear</hi> some of these <hi>Itinerant Preachers;</hi> and say, they have the <hi>same Spirit, they have, but don't know it; for they themselves did not know at first, whither they were going.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for DAVID FERRIS, of whom you desire an Account in <hi>particular;</hi> what I can say is this, <abbr>viz,</abbr> That as he was one of the NUMBER and FAMILY that were <hi>strongly attach'd to,</hi> and <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ting'd</hi> with, the Things above spoken of, so he had also a strong Inclination to attain some <hi>humane Learning.</hi> He began his <hi>Grammar</hi> with <hi>me.</hi>—I had a great many Debates with him.—At length, he told me, in some Heat, that <hi>I</hi> and <hi>this Church</hi> were such <hi>Beasts</hi> as PAUL fought with at EPHESUS: Upon which I dismist him. From hence he went to Mr. Moss at DERBY; but being uneasy there, went from thence to MILFORD, where he scatter'd some of his Errors. From MILFORD he went to COLLEGE, where,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:005151_0256_101807E278FCE9B8"/>
it is said, he kept somewhat hid for a Time; though I plainly told the RECTOR of his <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> and the Danger of his <hi>poisoning the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</hi> After some Time he appear'd active, and with his <hi>plausible Craft,</hi> and <hi>insinuating Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour,</hi> and <hi>his Books, corrupted</hi> and <hi>led away</hi> sundry; especially, WHELOCK, POMROY, BLISS, DAVENPORT, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus, <hi>Sir,</hi> I have given, as you desired, a Succinct, and short Account of our long Affair. I only add, as to the <hi>Facts,</hi> they are the <hi>Truth.</hi> No more at present, but that I rest your's &amp;c.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Gentleman</hi> to whom this <hi>Letter</hi> was sent, in his Letter conveying it to me, speaks of the <hi>Author</hi> as the Minister of the Place where these Things happened, and a <hi>worthy, honest, valuable</hi> Person; and adds, that he desir'd him to write nothing but what might appear in <hi>public,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that I may, if Need be, affix his <hi>Name</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Offence: For which Reason I have ventur'd to do it.</p>

                  <hi>Quakers,</hi> came to NEW-HAVEN in the Year 1729, and was admitted into <hi>College</hi> about <hi>June,</hi> or <hi>July,</hi> in that Year; pretending to have forsaken his <hi>quakerish and enthusiastick</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: But all was <hi>false,</hi> for though he at first did not think proper to own them, yet he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to lay a Foundation to propagate them, and instil his <hi>Poison</hi> into <hi>all</hi> as far as he could; which he did by acting under a <hi>Shew of Zeal</hi> and <hi>Sanctity,</hi> where by some were <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>snared</hi> by him, who have since been the <hi>Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of his Doctrines and Tenets.</hi> This FERRIS was the greatest <hi>Enthusiast</hi> I ever knew. I believe it was partly owing to his <hi>Constitution,</hi> and partly to his ignorant, superstitious and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate NEW-MILFORD <hi>Companions.</hi> By his <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> he was led into such wild Errors and Absurdities, that a Man, who was guided by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> would be amazed at his Folly; for when he found his <hi>Mind strongly engaged</hi> in any Thing, although inconsistent with <hi>Reason or Revelation,</hi> yet he would confidently affirm THOSE IMPULSES to be from the SPIRIT OF GOD; and that he <hi>could not be mistaken,</hi> any more than when the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shines and he sees it, it may all be a Decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was impossible, under this strong Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of his being inspir'd, to convince him; and it was to little Purpose to reason with him, for that <hi>Internal Light</hi> was his <hi>sole Guide;</hi> and by it he was led into all Manner of Errors.</p>
               <p>I cannot better describe the Man, than by relating what he said to me. He told me, he was <hi>certain, not one in ten of the Communicants in</hi> NEW-HAVEN <hi>Church would be saved; but would go directly down to Hell when they died.</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:005151_0258_101807E5B861F1D8"/>
He said, it was a Call from Heaven, his coming to <hi>College;</hi> that it was <hi>reveal'd</hi> to him, when he was sick, that he should recover; that when he died, he knew he should have a <hi>higher Seat</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> than MOSES, which <hi>Knowledge</hi> was from the <hi>Illumination</hi> of GOD's SPIRIT; that he knew GOD's <hi>Will</hi> in all Things, and liv'd agreeable thereto to that <hi>Perfection,</hi> that if he were to die that Night, he would not desire to have an Alteration made in <hi>one Article</hi> of his Life for <hi>six Years,</hi> for he had not been <hi>guilty of any Sin</hi> in that Time. He was, to be short, filled with <hi>imaginary Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> He had a proud and haughty Spirit, and appear'd strongly desirous of <hi>Applause.</hi> He was blind to his own Faults, and other Men's Virtues; but quick to spy out some Things amiss in his Neighbours, and would <hi>judge</hi> and condemn all but his own <hi>Party,</hi> and <hi>enthusias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Zealots</hi> like himself. He would do all in his Power to advance his own Opinions, and lov'd to <hi>head a Party,</hi> to whom he could dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and on whom he could impose his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> as <hi>Certainties:</hi> And as he would have it, so it happened; for by <hi>hiding</hi> himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Cloak of Zeal,</hi> some gloomy Persons among the <hi>Students</hi> were ensnared by him, who having mixed something of <hi>Devotion</hi> with their <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly</hi> Tempers, became his <hi>Admirers,</hi> and had his <hi>Person</hi> in <hi>Admiration</hi> to that Degree, that they believed all he said to be true, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd such an Opinion of his Worth, that they drank in all his Errors without Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His <hi>Word</hi> to them was <hi>Demonstration.</hi> Verily, they seemed to think, he could neither deceive, nor be deceived. They endeavour'd to imitate him in all Things as far as they could.

Mr. DAVENPORT, WHELOCK, POMROY, and others, were those who <hi>liv'd with this</hi> FERRIS <hi>most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly,</hi> and have since divulg'd his Errors, and fill'd Places where they have preach'd with the <hi>Superstitions</hi> and <hi>groundless Opinions,</hi> they learn'd from him, who was their FATHER and DICTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOR as to their <hi>Belief.</hi> This FERRIS liv'd with us until <hi>March,</hi> 1732; and then he returned back to NEW-MILFORD to his old Friends the <hi>Quakers, before, and without ever taking his Degree at College.</hi>

I thought sure, the Arm of the LORD is not shortened, and therefore that I WANTED NOT HUMAN LEARNING, in order to <hi>declare the Will of GOD to the World, which I see perishing by Heaps all around me;</hi> and I desire not to come to Men with <hi>Excellency of Speech which is of Man's Wisdom, which it seemed to me I was heaping up Treasures of.</hi> But I think, I have found out to be contented here, until GOD shall <hi>call</hi> me in the best Way; and I am not now concerned what GOD shall do with me. <hi>I am fully perswaded, he designs me to get Glory to his Name,</hi> and to do <hi>much Service for him</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.

But leaving this Head of <hi>Impulses,</hi> and <hi>Immediate divine Revelations,</hi> as the <hi>Instruments</hi> in the <hi>late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion</hi> are concerned in it; I proceed to observe,</p>
            <p>That the same Things are become prevalent among the <hi>common People,</hi> in one Place and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all over the Land. After the Example of the Preachers they admire, they too commonly mistake the Motions of their <hi>own Minds</hi> for <hi>divine Suggestions,</hi> and look for those Communications from the HOLY SPIRIT, which are proper only to INSPIRED Persons. They talk not of the SPIRIT's <hi>Instuence</hi> in the Language good Christians have been us'd to; but more in the Strain of those, who, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> Days, were under his <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, extraordinary</hi> Guidance. They have many of them, a low Opinion of <hi>studied Sermons,</hi> as not savouring of the SPIRIT's Help; while they will gladly hear any who will venture to speak to them without <hi>previous Preparation,</hi> whether <hi>learned</hi> or <hi>unlearned</hi> (if converted); imagining they are wonderfnlly assisted by the SPIRIT, as to <hi>Matter</hi> as well as <hi>Manner:</hi> Nay, to such a Height have many got, that they not only see <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>hear Voices;</hi> but are enabled to such a <hi>Discernment</hi> of the <hi>internal</hi> State of others, that, in a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, they will six their Character, whether they are <hi>Ministers,</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> and speak of them, and act towards them, accordingly. And what is still of more dangerous Consequence, the Notions many entertain of the SPIRIT's <hi>Influence</hi> are such, as reflect great Dishonour on the <hi>written Word.</hi> Their Expressions, on this Head, have been strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>extravagant;</hi> as we may have Occasion to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve in another Place: And so numerous are the Persons who give Heed to <hi>Impulses</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi> and such have been the evil Consequences
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:005151_0264_101807F8C0825730"/>
hereof, that some of the warmest Contenders for the <hi>good Work,</hi> have been alarmed publickly to speak against <hi>this Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I am glad, they begin to see the Necessity of such a Conduct. For this <hi>enthusiastical</hi> Spirit, it appears to me, is one of the most <hi>dangerous</hi> ones that can take Place in a Land. 'Tis indeed the true Spirit of QUAKERISM; the <hi>Seed-Plat of Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and has all along been found to be so.</p>
            <p>Not that I would be tho't to insinuate a Word against the <hi>genuine Operations</hi> of the HOLY SPIRIT. There certainly is such a Thing (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Bible</hi>) as the Christian's being <hi>led, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, taught, anointed,</hi> by the SPIRIT: And this is as true of the <hi>present</hi> as of the <hi>apostolic</hi> Times; though not in the <hi>same Sense:</hi> And the Want of Care to distinguish properly here has been the Occasion of <hi>sinful Mistakes,</hi> touching the <hi>SPIRIT's Influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>first Days</hi> of the Gospel, the <hi>Apostles</hi> and many of the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> were under an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Influence from the SPIRIT. They were <hi>supernaturally</hi> help'd to speak without taking Tho't before-hand what they should say, to utter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Languages they did not understand, to cast out Devils, heal Diseases, and do many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Things. But besides this, there was, even in <hi>that</hi> Day, <hi>another Sort</hi> of Influence from the SPIRIT, forming Men to a Resemblance of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being</hi> in <hi>moral Holiness,</hi> and so a <hi>Meetness</hi> for the Glories of the <hi>heavenly</hi> World. And this is <hi>that Influence</hi> which is <hi>common</hi> to <hi>all Ages,</hi> and may be expected by Christians <hi>now,</hi> as well as in the <hi>first Times</hi> of the Gospel. And hereby it is,
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:005151_0265_101807FB8CADBE28"/>
that <hi>Faith, Hope, Charity, Meekness, Humility,</hi> and all those other <hi>gracious Dispositions</hi> are wrought in Men's Hearts, wherein the <hi>Image of GOD,</hi> the <hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> and the <hi>Life of Christianity</hi> do truly consist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Influence</hi> of the SPIRIT does not consist in <hi>sudden Impulses</hi> and <hi>Impressions,</hi> in <hi>Visions, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, extraordinary Missions,</hi> and the like; but in working in Men the <hi>Preparations</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> by <hi>humbling</hi> them for Sin, and shewing them the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a SAVIOUR; then by effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>such a Change</hi> in them, as shall <hi>turn them from the Power of Sin and Satan,</hi> and make them <hi>new Creatures;</hi> and in fine, by carrying on this <hi>good Work</hi> begun in them, enabling them to grow in Grace, and patiently <hi>continue doing well,</hi> 'till of the Mercy of GOD, thro' CHRIST, they are <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eternal Life:</hi> All which he does in a Way agreable to our <hi>Make</hi> as <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, by his Blessing on the <hi>instituted Means</hi> for the Accomplishment of these Purposes of Mercy.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of Christians does not lie in <hi>secret Whispers,</hi> or <hi>audible Voices,</hi> or <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Appearances;</hi> it does not lie in the Use of more <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Phrases than are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among sober and good Christians; it does not lie in <hi>immediate Revelations</hi> of Men's <hi>good Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi> without the <hi>Testimony of Conscience</hi> upon <hi>thorow Examination,</hi> nor in <hi>such extraordinary Teachings</hi> of the SPIRIT as set them above the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or their <hi>own Endeavours,</hi> in an Attendance on <hi>appointed Means:</hi> I say, the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of Christians does not lie in such Things as these; but in their being <hi>Partakers</hi> of a spiritual <hi>Likeness</hi> to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, in <hi>Faith;</hi> in <hi>Purity;</hi> in <hi>Lowliness,</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:005151_0266_101807FDFB2B08A0"/>
and <hi>Humility;</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> to GOD, and our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;</hi> in <hi>Patience, Meekness</hi> and <hi>Gentleness;</hi> in <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

This is the Way in which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to be <hi>one Spirit</hi> with CHRIST; and by <hi>this Spirit</hi> it is we know, <hi>that we dwell in him, and be in us:</hi> And in this Sense it is, <hi>if any are led by the SPIRIT of GOD, they are the Sons of GOD; and if any have not the Spirit of CHRIST they are none of his.</hi> Such, in whom is found the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit, Love, Joy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance,</hi> are, properly speaking, <hi>spiritual</hi> Christians: And as <hi>this Fruit</hi> abounds more or less in them, so are they <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less spiritual.</hi> And this ought always to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of Judgment in this Matter.</p>
            <p>It may be common in <hi>these Times,</hi> for <hi>Christians</hi> to think themselves <hi>spiritual,</hi> not so much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>spiritual Change</hi> of their <hi>inner Man,</hi> in a Conformity to the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of CHRIST, as on Account of some supposed <hi>extraordinary Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of the SPIRIT,</hi> by <hi>open Vision,</hi> or <hi>secret Impulse,</hi> or <hi>immediate Perception.</hi> But 'tis a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Thing for Men to judge themselves to be <hi>spiritual</hi> from <hi>these Things,</hi> which if they really experience, they may not be at all the <hi>better Men.</hi> And the Danger is the greater, because when they once come to entertain <hi>high-flown</hi> Notions of the SPIRIT's Influence, and expect to be <hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>extraordinarily</hi> instructed by him, 'tis great Odds but, by Degrees, they are led aside into <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Delusion.</hi> 'Twould be no Wonder, if their <hi>Imaginations</hi> soon brought them into some Kind of <hi>Equality,</hi> with the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> of

                     <p>The <hi>Separatists</hi> at NEW-LONDON sent a Boat over to LONG-ISLAND to invite the grand Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siast D—T over to Organize their Church, (as they term'd it). He arrived on, or about the second Day of <hi>March:</hi> He was no sooner come to Town, than he began to rectify some Disorders, he supposed were prevailing among the Children of God: He published the Messages which he said, he received from the Spirit in Dreams and otherwise, importing the great Necessity of Mortification and Contempt of the World; and made them believe that they must put away from them every Thing that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, to avoid the hainous Sin of Idolatry, that Wigs, Cloaks and Breeches, Hoods, Gowns, Rings, Jewels and Necklaces must be all brought together into one Heap into his Chamber, that they might, by his solemn Decree, be committed to the Flames; together with certain Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, &amp;c. which he determined to be unsafe to be in the Hands of the People. Accordingly, they seem'd to be in a Strife who should be first in this meritorious Action, and then was presently made a Pile of Men's and Women's Apparel and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which the grand Director added a Pair of Plush Breeches which he wore to Town, and which now he would greatly want, were he not confined in Bed by a Distemper for which I want a Name.</p>
                     <p>The Books which were committed to the Flames were as follows, BEVERIDGE'S Thoughts on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, part of FLAVEL'S Works, one piece of Mr. HENRY'S, RUSSEL'S seven Sermons, DYER'S Golden Chain, the Whole Duty of Man, one piece Dr. INCREASE MATHER'S, one of Dr. COLMAN'S, one of Dr. SEWALL'S, and Dr. CHAUNCY'S Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon against Enthusiasm, Mr. ADAM'S Sermons, all that could be had; FLYNT'S 20 Sermons, BARNARD'S, HOOPER'S, HART'S, SAMUEL RUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEL'S, BECKWORTH'S, TODD'S SEABERRY'S and BLISS'S Sermons, with a Book of WILLIAMS and WADSWORTH; these being called over, were with much Noise and Outcry burnt on the Town Wharf in the Afternoon of the Sabbath Day, <hi>March</hi> 6th, just as People were coming from Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who ran to see if Murder, or some other Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was not about to be done, and so were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of this their horrid Delusion, and heard them sing <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> and <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> over the Pile, and heard them with a loud Voice declare, <hi>That the Smoak of the Torments of such of the Authors of the above said Books, as died in the same Belief, as when they set them out, was now ascending in Hell in like Manner, as they saw the Smoak of these Books rise.</hi> The next Day sundry other Books (to me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) were burnt; and the Cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were ready in a Pile for that Purpose, would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been consumed, but that one of the Fraternity who lov'd the World better than the rest, and was more apprehensive of the ill Aspect this Transaction would have on their Scheme and Party, came running and diverted them from it for that Time.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>New-Light</hi> Ministers round about are at a loss how to conduct themselves, and how to make a Plaister for this Sore.—</p>
                     <p>We are ready to hope, that God, who brings Good out of Evil, Light out of Darkness, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of Confusion, by Means of these extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Things, will open the Eyes of People, and put a Stop to the Growth of Error and Enthusiasm in this Land.</p>

an <hi>erratic Spirit</hi> that usually carries Men <hi>out of their Place and Calling.</hi> I confess (says he) there is an <hi>Heroicus Impetus,</hi> an <hi>Impulse,</hi> which some of the <hi>Servants of GOD</hi> have had from Heaven, to do Things <hi>extraordinary,</hi> as we read in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of MOSES, GIDEON, PHINEHAS, and others. But it is <hi>dangerous</hi> to pretend to the like, and <hi>unlawful</hi> to expect such <hi>immediate Commissions</hi> from Heaven <hi>now,</hi> when he issueth them out in a more <hi>ordinary</hi> Way, and gives <hi>Rules</hi> for the same in <hi>his Word.</hi> We may as well expect to be <hi>taught extraordinarily,</hi> without using the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means,</hi> as to be <hi>called so.</hi> When I see any <hi>miraculously gifted,</hi> as the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> then I shall think the <hi>immediate Calling</hi> they pretend to is <hi>authentic.</hi> To be sure, we find in the <hi>Word, extraordinary Calling,</hi> and <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teaching,</hi> go together. Well, let us see what that <hi>erratic Spirit</hi> is, which carries many out of their <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Calling.</hi> It is not always the same; sometimes its <hi>Idleness. First,</hi> Men neglect what they <hi>Should do,</hi> and then are easily perswaded to meddle with what they have <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> intimates this plainly, 1 Tim. 5. 13. <hi>They learn to be idle, wandring from House to House, and not only idle, but Busie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bodies.</hi> An idle Person is a <hi>Gadder;</hi> he hath his Foot on the Threshold, easily drawn from his <hi>own Place,</hi> and as soon into <hi>another's Diocess,</hi> He is at Leisure to hear the <hi>Devil's Chat.</hi> He that will not serve GOD in his <hi>own Place,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> rather than he shall stand out, will send him on his Errand, and get him to put his <hi>Sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle</hi> into <hi>another's Corn. Secondly,</hi> Its <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Discontent</hi> that makes Persons go out of their Place. Some Men are in this very unhappy, their Spirits are too big and haughty for the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:005151_0277_1018081D0C86A658"/>
                  <hi>Place</hi> GOD hath set them in. Their <hi>Calling,</hi> may be, is mean and low, but their Spirits high and towring; and whereas they should labour to bring their Hearts to their Condition, they project how they may bring their Condition to their proud Hearts. They think themselves very unhappy, while they are shut up in such straight Limits. Shall they be hid in a Croud, lie in an obscure Corner, and die before they let the World know their Worth? No, they can't brook it; and therefore they must get on the Stage, and put forth themselves one Way or other. It was not the <hi>Priest's Work,</hi> that CORAH and his <hi>Complices</hi> were so in Love with, but the <hi>Priest's Honour</hi> which attended the Work: This they desir'd to share, and liked not to see others run away with it from them: Nor was it the <hi>Zeal</hi> which ABSALOM had to do <hi>Justice,</hi> which made his Teeth water so after his <hi>Father's Crown,</hi> though this must silver over his Ambition. These Places of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> are such fair Flowers, that proud Spirits, in all Ages, have been ambitious to have them set in their own Garden; though they never thrive so well as in their proper Soil. In a <hi>third,</hi> 'tis <hi>Unbelief.</hi> This made UZZAH stretch forth his Hand unadvisedly to stay the <hi>Ark</hi> that shook, which, being not a <hi>Levite,</hi> he was not to touch. Alas! good Man, it was his <hi>Faith</hi> shook more dangerously than the <hi>Ark:</hi> By fearing the Fall of this, he fell to the Ground himself. GOD needs not our Sin to shoar up his Glory, Truth, or Church. <hi>Lastly,</hi> in some it is <hi>misinformed Zeal.</hi> Many think they <hi>may</hi> do a Thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>can</hi> do it. They <hi>can</hi> preach, and so they <hi>may.</hi> Wherefore else have they Gifts? Certainly the Gifts of the Saints need not be

lost, any of them; though they be not laid out in the <hi>Minister's</hi> Work. The <hi>Private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> hath a large Field, wherein he may be serviceable to his Brethren. He need not break the Hedge GOD hath set, and thereby occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>such Disorders</hi> as we see to be the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this. We read, in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Law, Exod. 22, that he who set a Hedge on Fire, and that Fire burnt the Corn standing in the Field, was to make Restitution, though he only fired the Hedge (may be not intending to hurt the Corn); and the Reason was, because his firing the Hedge was the Occasion of the Corn's being burnt, though he meant it not. I dare not say, that <hi>every private Christian,</hi> who hath, in <hi>these Times,</hi> taken upon him the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister's</hi> Work, did intend to <hi>make such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion in the Church, as hath been, and still sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is among us.</hi> (GOD forbid I should think so!) But O that I could clear them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>accessary</hi> to it, in that they have <hi>fired the Hedge which GOD hath set between the Minister's Calling and their's.</hi> If we will acknowledge the <hi>Ministry a particular Office</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST (and this I think the <hi>Word</hi> will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us to do) then we must also confess, it is not <hi>any one's Work,</hi> though never so able, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>called to the Office.</hi>

               <p>I cannot doubt, but many a sincere Christian may be drawn into such Employment, which puts him in a Capacity of honouring GOD in a more eminent Way, which is a Thing desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an honest and zealous Heart; and that the Temptation may be greatly strengthened upon their, by the <hi>plausible Suggestions of cunning Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi> who tell them, that <hi>those Ministers</hi> who oppose and <hi>condemn this Practice,</hi> do it as Men concerned for their <hi>own Interest,</hi> as desirous to <hi>monopolize the Work to themselves,</hi> and as <hi>envying the LORD's People;</hi> and that CHRIST hath given them <hi>grater Liberty</hi> in this Case, than those Men will allow them.

            <p>Another <hi>bad</hi> Thing, I must not omit to menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, the <hi>Confusion</hi> that has been so common, of late, in some of our <hi>Houses</hi> for <hi>Worship;</hi> I mean not only on Account of the <hi>Screamings</hi> and <hi>Shriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the People, but their <hi>talking,</hi> and <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>exhorting,</hi> and <hi>singing,</hi> and <hi>laughing,</hi> and <hi>congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating one another</hi> by <hi>shaking Hands,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>kissing;</hi> and all at the <hi>same Time,</hi> and in the <hi>same Assembly:</hi> On which Things their Hearts have been zealously set, that the <hi>same Houses</hi> have scarce been emptied for a <hi>Week</hi> together, <hi>Night</hi> or <hi>Day.</hi> It may seem incredible simply to relate these Facts; but they are the real Truth. Says a Friend, in giving an Account of some Things, he was himself a <hi>Witness</hi> to,—<q>Half a Score of them would be <hi>exhorting all together,</hi> and more many Times; and some would be <hi>praying;</hi> some again would do nothing but <hi>sing,</hi> and that for an Hour, or more: And thus there would be <hi>exhorting, praying, singing,</hi> all at the <hi>same Time</hi> by those different Persons; whereby the Noise was so confused and loud, that a Person could scarce speak to another so as to be heard.</q> And a little onwards,—<q>The Meeting was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with what appeared to me great Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; some <hi>screaming</hi> out in Distress and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; some <hi>praying;</hi> others <hi>singing;</hi> some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <hi>jumping up and down</hi> the House, while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were <hi>exhorting;</hi> some <hi>lying along</hi> on the Floor, and others <hi>walking</hi> and <hi>talking:</hi> The whole with a very great Noise, to be heard at a

                  <hi>Mile's</hi> Distance, and continued almost the whole Night.</q> And yet again, <q>Many of the <hi>young Women</hi> would go about the House <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>exhorting;</hi> then they would separate themselves from the other People, and get into a Corner of the House to <hi>sing</hi> and <hi>rejoice</hi> together; and then they would break forth into as <hi>great a Laughter as could be,</hi> to think, as they exprest it, that they should go Hand in Hand to Heaven. Then they would speak it over again, and shout out into a <hi>great Laughter, laughing</hi> and <hi>singing, jumping up and down,</hi> and <hi>clapping their Hands</hi> together; and some would be so filled with <hi>Joy,</hi> as they pretended, that they could not <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>walk:</hi> And all this, when, at the same Time, there were <hi>threescore</hi> Persons lying, some on the Floor, some across the Seats, while others were held up and supported in great Distress.</q> And, after some other Things upon the Times he adds, <q>Thus they spent more than <hi>seven</hi> Days. The Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-House was scarce empty, but some or other were there, the whole of the Time, both <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>Day.</hi>
               </q> Agreable whereto is another Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from another Part of the Country, <q>—They had a publick Exercise <hi>every Day,</hi> and for <hi>nine Nights</hi> successively. Numbers of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple continued the greatest Part of the Night, in the utmost Disorder. They were <hi>groaning, crying out, fainting, falling down, praying; exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, singing, laughing, congratulating</hi> each other, which they did by <hi>shaking Hands</hi> and <hi>Embraces.</hi> (the latter was commonly practised by <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sexes</hi>) and by the <hi>fifth</hi> Night, there were almost <hi>three Hundred</hi> thus affected, who were acting their different Parts at the <hi>same Time;</hi> which occasioned inexpressible Confusion, and render'd it impossible to make a just Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

upon all that passed; but I evidently found.</q>—To the like Purpose is what we have printed in the BOSTON <hi>Post-Boy,</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Numb. 391.</note> 
               <q>He (Mr. D—T) and some other Ministers, and young gifted Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, held forth every Day on the <hi>Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> Week, and generally continued 'till <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>eleven</hi> at <hi>Night,</hi> and then a great Part of their Carryings on was, not by <hi>praying, singing,</hi> and <hi>Preaching upon a Text</hi> as usual; but one would make a <hi>short Prayer,</hi> then another give a <hi>Word of Exhortation:</hi> Then one would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a <hi>Psalm,</hi> then another a <hi>Prayer,</hi> then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Word of Exhortation,</hi> and so on, without any certain Order, or Method; so that in one Meeting of two or three Hours, there would be, it may be, 20 or 30 distinct Exercises car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, by 5 or 10 distinct Persons; some standing in the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> some in the Body of the <hi>Seats,</hi> some in the <hi>Pews,</hi> and some up <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery;</hi> and oftentimes, <hi>several of them would speak together:</hi> So that some <hi>praying,</hi> some <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,</hi> and <hi>terrifying,</hi> some <hi>singing,</hi> some <hi>scream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> some <hi>crying,</hi> some <hi>laughing,</hi> and some <hi>scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> made the most amazing Confusion that ever was heard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I could go on with Accounts of this Nature, as I have had them from Numbers of Persons, upon the Evidence of their <hi>own Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears;</hi> but 'tis needless in so plain a Case. There are few Places, where the <hi>late Commotion</hi> has been; especially, where it has been spoken of as <hi>remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> but there has been <hi>this Appearance</hi> also in a less or greater Degree: Yea, and so high were the People in their Opinion of it, as a <hi>Sigh</hi> of
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:005151_0289_1016C78946F474E0"/>
the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Presence of the SPIRIT with them, that if you talk'd with them to shew them the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> of such Carryings on, they would only pity you, and speak of you, as poor <hi>carnal Sinners,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the SPIRIT, and in the <hi>broad Way to Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To such as may still be of this <hi>Temper</hi> of Mind, I have nothing to say, as not thinking them fit Persons to be reasoned with; and as to others in the <hi>sober Exercise</hi> of their <hi>Understanding,</hi> the bare Relation of such <hi>Extravagancies</hi> is enough to expose them; especially, when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the like <hi>Disorders</hi> in the Church of CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINTH, condemned by the Apostle PAUL,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 14. 23, 26.</note> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this eternal Maxim of Truth, That <hi>GOD is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The last Thing I shall mention as of <hi>dangerous Tendency,</hi> is that <hi>Spirit of Error</hi> which is gone forth into the Land. And here it will be necessary to descend to Particulars, under each of which I might easily enlarge, but find my self oblig'd to contract, lest this Volume swell beyond its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Size.</p>
            <p>The first <hi>Error</hi> I would take Notice of, is that which supposes <hi>Ministers,</hi> if not <hi>converted,</hi> unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being the <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>spiritual Good</hi> to Men's Soals. Mr. WHITEEIELD very freely vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Error. I have myself been present, when he delivered that from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> upon this Head, which I could not but think very unsafe; and, in what he has wrote, his Language is such as 
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:005151_0290_1016C78B265FA778"/>
evidently tends to lead People into <hi>wrong Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> about the <hi>Preaching</hi> of Ministers, if thought to be <hi>unconverted.</hi> His Words are these,<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <q>The Reason why Congregations have been so dead, is because they have <hi>dead</hi> Men preaching to them.—For how can <hi>dead Men beget living Children?</hi> Its true indeed, GOD may <hi>convert</hi> People by the <hi>Devil,</hi> if he pleases; and so he may by <hi>unconverted</hi> Ministers. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he seldom makes Use of <hi>either of them</hi> for this Purpose.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. TENNENT'S Language upon this Head of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Ministers is much the same. In his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> at NOTTINGHAM, P. 8. He has these Words, <q>Is a <hi>dead</hi> Man fit to bring others to <hi>Life?</hi> Sad Experience verifies the Unprofitableness of the Ministry of unconverted Men.—What if some Instances could be shewn of unconverted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters being instrumental in convincing Persons of their lost Estate? The Thing is very rare and extraordinary. And for what I know as many Instances might he given of <hi>Satan's</hi> convincing Persons by his Temptations. Indeed, its a Kind of <hi>Chance-Medley,</hi> both in Respect of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Children, when any such Event happens.</q>

               <q>I insisted much, in my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon the Doctrine of the New-Birth, and also the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a Minister's being <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> before he could <hi>preach CHRIST aright.</hi>—<hi>Unconverted</hi> Ministers are the <hi>Bane</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church.</q> And in his <hi>Sermon</hi> at GLASGOW,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:005151_0291_1016C78DC6B262D0"/>
on <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18, 19. <q>It is absolutely necessary before a Minister undertake to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that he have an experimental Acquaintance with JESUS CHRIST.</q> Page 6. <q>It is indeed impossible in the very Nature of Things, that a Man should preach CHRIST who doth not know him.</q> Page 8. <q>I believe GOD doth not convert others by unconverted Men.</q> P. 12.</p>
            <p>I don't observe, in these Passages, any Distinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Ministers in a <hi>private Capacity as Christians,</hi> and as <hi>Officers in the Church of</hi> CHRIST. In the first Sense, Conversion is as <hi>necessary</hi> for <hi>Ministers</hi> as People; nor can they, except they be <hi>converted,</hi> enter into the Kingdom of GOD. But <hi>Conversion</hi> does not appear to be <hi>alike necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> for <hi>Ministers</hi> in their <hi>public Capacity,</hi> as <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> in the Church. That they should be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> is, no doubt, a Matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; nor will it be denied, that <hi>converted</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, <hi>coetcris paribus,</hi> are much the best qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons to serve the great Ends of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, in forming Men to Holiness, and building them up through Faith unto Salvation: But that this is <hi>necessary</hi> to their being <hi>true Ministers,</hi> we no where find in the <hi>Word of GOD;</hi> much less that they can no more <hi>beget</hi> (i. e. as <hi>Instruments</hi>) <hi>Children</hi> in the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> than <hi>dead Men</hi> can in the <hi>natural</hi> Sense: Nor are they, any where in the <hi>Bible,</hi> compar'd to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and put upon a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi> him in Respect of <hi>Unfitness,</hi> as <hi>Instruments</hi> in the Business of <hi>Conversion,</hi> or the Likelihood of GOD's making Use of them as <hi>Instruments</hi> in this Work. Suggestions of this Nature are the Fruit of Men's <hi>own Imaginations,</hi> and not what they have fetch'd from that <hi>unerring Rule,</hi> the <hi>Scripture of Truth.</hi>

Neither does this <hi>Gentleman</hi> distinguish between <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>real Conversion;</hi> which is a very <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Distinction</hi> in this Case. 'Tis readily own'd, VISIBLY <hi>unconverted Men</hi> are <hi>unfit</hi> to be <hi>Ministers,</hi> and ought not to be so. That is to say, Men who are <hi>visibly unsound in the Faith,</hi> or of a <hi>bad Life,</hi> should, upon no Terms, be <hi>admitted</hi> into the <hi>Ministry;</hi> or if, after they have been in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, this should appear to be their Character, they ought to be <hi>turn'd out of it.</hi> But can this be truly said of those who are <hi>visibly,</hi> though not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> the Men it is required they should be? By no Means. The LORD JESUS CHRIST has given his Church no <hi>Rule</hi> by which they can discover <hi>secret Hypocrisy:</hi> And notwithstanding the closest Adherence to <hi>Scripture</hi> Directions, <hi>Hypocrites</hi> may be <hi>admitted</hi> into the <hi>Ministry;</hi> and being admitted, can't but on <hi>visible Evidence</hi> be <hi>excluded;</hi> nay, as the Case may be, it would be an <hi>open Violation</hi> of the Laws of JESUS CHRIST to displace them from their <hi>Office.</hi> And would CHRIST have suffered it to be thus, if Persons <hi>visibly holy,</hi> tho' not <hi>really</hi> and <hi>inwardly</hi> so, might not be employ'd in the <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Ministry?</hi> If such were as <hi>unfit</hi> as the <hi>Devil</hi> for this Employment, and as <hi>unlikely</hi> to be us'd as <hi>Instruments</hi> for Good to Men's Souls, is it possible the <hi>compassionate</hi> JESUS should leave his Church without some <hi>certain Criterion,</hi> by which they might know, who were <hi>inwardly hypocritical</hi> when their <hi>outward Appearance</hi> was good, and who were not? And for Want of <hi>such a Mark,</hi> must not the Minds of serious, well-dispos'd People, be in eternal Perplexities about their Ministers, as <hi>not being able to know</hi> whether they are <hi>really converted,</hi> and not having <hi>sufficient Means to k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Truth of the Matter, in short, is this; VISIBLE <hi>Holiness</hi> is that <hi>alone,</hi> the Laws of JESUS CHRIST will allow us to judge by; and if <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> are <hi>holy</hi> in <hi>this Sense,</hi> they are to be treated as the <hi>Ministers of CHRIST;</hi> and People may in <hi>Faith</hi> attend their <hi>Preaching,</hi> hoping for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Blessing:</p>
            <p>Nor is it reasonable to think a merciful GOD would withhold his Blessing, meerly because the <hi>Preacher</hi> is not the Man <hi>inwardly,</hi> he professes to be <hi>outwardly.</hi> 'Tis indeed a downright <hi>popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> to make the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of <hi>Ordinances</hi> depend on the <hi>unknown secret Holiness</hi> of the <hi>Administrators</hi> of them.</p>

            <p>The Words of Bp BURNET, in his <hi>Exposition</hi> of this Article will come in pertinently here. Says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">His <hi>Exposition of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> P. 295, 296.</note>

was the Heat of some in the Beginnings of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> who being much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the public Scandal which was given by the <hi>enormous Vices</hi> that were, without any Disguise, practised by the <hi>Roman Clergy,</hi> did from thence revive the Conceit of the DONA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISTS, who thought that not only <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> did invalidate sacred Functions, but that <hi>personal Sins</hi> did also make them void.</q> Upon which he thus argues, <q>Sacraments are to be considered as <hi>public Acts</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and though the Effect of them, as to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them, depends upon his Temper, his Preparation and Application, yet it cannot be imagined, that the Virtue of those foederal Acts, to which Christians are admitted in them, the <hi>Validity</hi> of them, or the <hi>Blessings</hi> that follow them, can depend on the <hi>secret State</hi> or <hi>Temper</hi> of <hi>him</hi> that <hi>officiates.</hi> Even in the Case of <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Scandals,</hi>—we must distinguish between the Things which the Ministers of the Church do, as they are <hi>public Officers,</hi> and what they do as they are <hi>private Christians.</hi> Their Prayers and every Thing else that they do, as they are <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians,</hi> have their Effect only according to the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> they are in, when they offer them up to GOD; but their <hi>public Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> are the Appointments of CHRIST in which they officiate: They can neither make them the better, nor the worse by any Thing that they join to them.</q> He therefore concludes. <q>This Opinion which was taken up, perhaps, from an <hi>inconsiderate Zeal</hi> against the Sins and Scandals of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> is without all Foundation, and must needs cast all Men into <hi>chidless Scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which can never be cured.</q>

I shall only add, this Error, which, among us, took <hi>Rise</hi> from Mr. W—D, has been propagated to so many, that 'tis now the <hi>prevailing</hi> Opinion among our <hi>new Converts,</hi> and I wish I could not say, among some of their <hi>Leaders</hi> also: And to such a Height are they grown in it, that the <hi>worst Names</hi> are not thought too bad to bestow upon many <hi>Ministers,</hi>

in their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or <hi>Conversation,</hi> but because they are pleas'd, in open Violation of the Christian Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> to look upon them as <hi>unconverted:</hi> And as to <hi>all</hi> such, however <hi>exemplary</hi> they may have been for the <hi>Purity</hi> of their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> and this, for a Course of Years, they are so far from owning them as <hi>true Ministers,</hi> that they freely speak of them, as <hi>Pharisees, blind Guides, Wolves in Sheep's Cloathing, Ministers</hi> of <hi>the Devil,</hi> and what not. Which leads me to mention another Error naturally springing from this, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>That which justifies People in a <hi>Withdraw</hi> from those Ministers they look upon as <hi>unconverted,</hi> though <hi>sound in the Faith,</hi> and of a <hi>visible good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation.</hi> The many <hi>separate Meetings</hi> in the Land are a Proof of the general Spread of this Error: Nor are the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> unknown, who have gone up and down the Country, preaching this Doctrine, and spiriting People to <hi>Schism</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis pretended, <q>they ought not to <hi>hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Ministers.</hi>
               </q> If so, they ought surely
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:005151_0298_1016C7A104175148"/>
to be well satisfied, that they are <hi>unconverted:</hi> Nor will evil Surmisings, or unchristian Jealousies suffice in this Case. There must be <hi>good Proof, visible Evidence;</hi> or, the Gospel of CHRIST will never justify them in their <hi>Withdraw.</hi> And can this be justly pleaded, in Respect of <hi>any one Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> in the Land? Will any venture to speak it out, in plain Words, of any of the Ministers who are withdrawn from, that they are <hi>unsound in the Faith,</hi> or of <hi>a bad Life?</hi> How then can it be proved, that they are <hi>unconverted?</hi> They may be so, 'tis true, notwithstanding the most goodly Appearance; but 'tis not evident to the World, that they are: And 'tis contrary to the Gospel to judge ill of a <hi>private Brother,</hi> much more of a <hi>public Officer,</hi> but upon <hi>visible Evidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But suppose they are <hi>unconverted,</hi> and this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by what is <hi>visible.</hi> Is <hi>separating</hi> from their Ministry the <hi>first</hi> Thing necessary? Even a <hi>self-condemned Heretick</hi> is not to be <hi>rejected,</hi> till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second Admonition.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> Thing to be done is, to enter a Process against them, according to <hi>Gospel-Rule.</hi> They are CHRIST'S <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,</hi> 'till the <hi>Discipline of his Kingdom</hi> has been exercis'd upon them: And 'till then, they ought not to be <hi>separated</hi> from, (unless it can't be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) though we should think, and upon good Grounds too, that they are <hi>unconverted:</hi> And this is the Method prescrib'd in the ORDER of these Churches, and of <hi>every other Church</hi> in the whole <hi>Protestant</hi> World.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But their Preaching is <hi>bad,</hi> and tends to <hi>lead Souls to Hell.</hi>
               </q> But does this necessarily follow upon their being <hi>unconverted?</hi> They may not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding preach the <hi>Truth as it is in JESUS;</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:005151_0299_1016C7D39D39F6D0"/>
and, if they are Men of <hi>superior</hi> Attainments, may set it in a clearer and stronger Light, than others of <hi>smaller Gifts,</hi> though <hi>converted.</hi> And can it be any other than the Fruit of gross Prejudice to say, that the Truths of the Gospel <hi>lead to Hell,</hi> only because preach'd by Ministers suppos'd to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted?</hi> Are the same Truths <hi>saving</hi> or <hi>damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as delivered by <hi>converted,</hi> or <hi>unconverted</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters? 'Tis impossible the differing Characters of Men should make such a Difference in the <hi>moral</hi> Effects of the same Truths. Or, if these Ministers, who are called <hi>unconverted,</hi> preach <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines</hi> inconsistent with the Gospel, and in the <hi>Nature</hi> of them destructive to Men's Souls, let it be made to appear: Nothing would be more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to put them to Silence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But 'tis seen there is no <hi>good Effect</hi> of the Preaching of <hi>unconverted</hi> Ministers.</q> If by <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted</hi> Ministers be mean't such, as have been guilty of the most <hi>filthy Uncleanness,</hi> under the <hi>highest Aggravations,</hi> the Preaching of such han't been without <hi>good Effect,</hi> even according to the Mind of those who make this Objection. For 'tis generally known of a famous Preacher, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly guilty in this Kind, and prov'd to have been so, and depos'd from the Ministry on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the <hi>Effect</hi> of his Preaching, in the <hi>Extraordinaries</hi> of the present Day, equal'd, for a Time, all that the most noted among our <hi>new Preachers</hi> could pretend to. He so preach'd as to be flock'd after by Multitudes of all Sorts; and so far as <hi>shrieking,</hi> and <hi>screaming,</hi> and <hi>falling down,</hi> and being in <hi>Agonies of Distress,</hi> or <hi>Raptures of Joy,</hi> are a Sign of the <hi>good Effect</hi> of Preaching, he might compare with any for the Evidences of it: But he was a <hi>converted</hi> Minister, in the Opinion of
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:005151_0300_1016C7A91B6277B0"/>
the People; and there han't been, 'tis true, these <hi>Extraordinaries</hi> following the Word preach'd by those called <hi>unconverted;</hi> though they hope not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, they have not laboured altogether in vain. Other <hi>Effects</hi> they could speak of, which they think a Sign of some Success; though they desire not to boast, and would lament that they have seen no more <hi>real Fruit</hi> of their Endeavours. But if their Preaching had been attended with less Success, 'tis no Argumeut, either that they are <hi>unconverted,</hi> or that People should not own them as the Ministers of CHRIST. <hi>The Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it listeth.</hi> The <hi>best</hi> Ministers in all Ages have complain'd for Want of Success: Even that mournful Lamentation of the Prophet,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Isa. 53. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Who hath believed our Report? And to whom is the Arm of the LORD revealed?</hi> The great SAVIOUR of the World applies to <hi>himself,</hi> and the <hi>Unsuccess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of his <hi>own Labours</hi> for the Good of Souls.<note n="§" place="bottom">John 12. 38.</note> And 'tis observable, when the Prophet ISAIAH had said,<note n="*" place="bottom">Chapt. 49. 4.</note> 
               <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have spent my Strength for Nought and in vain,</hi> he not only adds upon it, <hi>yet surely my Judgment is with the</hi> LORD, <hi>and my Work with my GOD;</hi> but the LORD <hi>that formed him from the Womb to be his Servant,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced declaring,<note n="†" place="bottom">Verse 5.</note> that <hi>he should be glorious in the Eyes of the LORD, and his GOD should be his Strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, 'tis pleaded these <hi>unconverted</hi> Ministers are to be <hi>withdrawn</hi> from, <q>because there is no <hi>Validity</hi> in their Administrations.</q> This is more easily said than prov'd. And People should be
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:005151_0301_1016C7AAAB1D9900"/>
careful how they advance such a Principle as this; for they may not be aware what it will end in. GOD only knows who, among Ministers, are really <hi>converted;</hi> and if the Administrations of such <hi>only</hi> are <hi>valid,</hi> who can with Safety ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to sit under the Preaching of any Minister living? But this is not all; if <hi>real Conversion</hi> is necessary to the <hi>Validity</hi> of ministerial Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, who can say they have been <hi>validity</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, or admitted into the Church? It must forever remain a Perplexity to a Man's Mind: and the same Difficulty would return, if he was to be baptised, and admitted into the Church ten Times over: Yea, so destructive a Principle is this, that no Man can know whether there is any <hi>true Church,</hi> or <hi>valid Ordinances,</hi> in the Town, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, or Kingdom, he belongs to. The plain Truth is, the <hi>Validity</hi> of Gospel-Administrations, (as has been said) does not depend upon the <hi>real Conversion</hi> of the Minister, nor upon our Opinion of him in this Respect, but upon his being CHRIST'S <hi>Officer,</hi> improved by him to dispense the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Kingdom, which he may be, though he is <hi>inwardly</hi> another Man than he appears to be <hi>outwardly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pertinent to this Purpose are the Words of Mr. JOHN STILLINGFLEET. Says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">See his <hi>Demonstration of the Divine Presence in the Places of religious Worship,</hi> Page 132, 133, 134, 135.</note> 
               <q>If the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be <hi>bad,</hi> yet if he preaches the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, we must receive the Word, because we are not so much to regard the <hi>Man preaching,</hi> as the <hi>Word preached.</hi>—'Tis not the <hi>Person,</hi> but
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:005151_0302_1016C7ADB18B3658"/>
the <hi>Office;</hi> not the <hi>Man,</hi> but his <hi>Ministry;</hi> not his <hi>Life,</hi> but his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we are to look to.—When CHRIST sent out his <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> to preach, of <hi>all</hi> of them he saith, <hi>He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivetb you, receivetb me;</hi> yet, one of these was JUDAS ISCARIOT, <hi>who also betrayed him.</hi> We plainly see by CHRIST'S own Words, we may receive CHRIST by the Ministry of JUDAS, a <hi>Traytor,</hi> I might say, a <hi>Devil.</hi> The Expression, 'tis true, is harsh; but our SAVIOUR fears not to speak thus of one, whom he had personally sent to preach the Gospel, <hi>one of you is a Devil,</hi> meaning JUDAS: Nay, the Scripture makes no Difference between JUDAS, and the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in the Success of the Ministry. They <hi>all</hi> twelve were sent out, they <hi>all</hi> did Miracles, they <hi>all</hi> returned to CHRIST, and gave him an Account of their Success. To them <hi>all</hi> CHRIST said, he had <hi>ordain'd they should go out,</hi>
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> in preaching, and <hi>bear much Fruit,</hi>
                  <abbr>viz.</abbr> in their Ministry. And Philip. 3. there were <hi>false Apostles</hi> who <hi>preached CHRIST out of Envy,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to add more Affliction to PAUL; which must needs be an high Degree of Malice and Wickedness: Yet, PAUL said, <hi>he rejoiced that CHRIST was preached</hi> however; which could not be, if their preaching did no Good.</q> And a little onwards, <q>If this Principle once prevail, <hi>that a Minister ought not to be heard that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,</hi> though he preaches nothing but <hi>sound Doctrine,</hi> it would lay a certain Foundation for SEPARATION from the outward Means and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, at lest, from the Administration of them, as now they are enjoyed. For the Case would presently return hither, as it is with MANY ALREADY, not whether the Minister be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ungodly or no, but whether he seems so
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:005151_0303_1016C7B11C02F5A0"/>

Such <hi>sad Works</hi> do <hi>bad Principles,</hi> and <hi>erroneous Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> make in the Church of GOD. A sad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this may be seen among the QUAKERS, who, upon the fore-mentioned Principle, reject and throw off <hi>all the now Ministers of</hi> ENGLAND, making no Difference. —How much better may we determine thus, the Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry is sacred, tho' <hi>Ministers</hi> may be <hi>ungodly.</hi> The Promise of CHRIST'S <hi>Presence</hi> is made to Persons for the OFFICE SAKE, and not to the Office for the <hi>Persons;</hi> so to the Office <hi>more</hi> than to the Persons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A third <hi>Error</hi> of the Times is, a <hi>presumptuous Dependance</hi> on the <hi>blessed SPIRIT.</hi> I say a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Dependance,</hi> because I mean not to blame in any a true <hi>Gospel-Reliance.</hi> For the <hi>Divine SPIRIT</hi> is the <hi>great Operator</hi> in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi> 'Tis he that begins a Work of GOD in Men's Hearts; 'tis he that must car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it on; and by his Power only can they be kept from falling, and preserv'd blameless to the heavenly World. And we are not only allow'd, but requir'd, to place our Dependance on him for these Things: Nor can we, in any other Way, expect to be form'd to a Meetness for the Favour of GOD here, or the Enjoyment of him hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But instead of <hi>depending,</hi> Men, may <hi>presume</hi> upon the <hi>blessed SPIRIT:</hi> And this is the <hi>Error</hi> of the <hi>present Day;</hi> and it appears in the following Instances.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> is, their <hi>so</hi> depending on the Help of the SPIRIT as to <hi>despise Learning.</hi> To this it
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:005151_0304_1016C7B36ECA8BD0"/>
is owing, that so many speak <hi>slightily</hi> of our <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colleges;</hi> discovering a Good-Will, were it in their Power, to rase them to their Foundations.<note n="†" place="bottom">It may not be amiss to remark here, that <hi>the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> in this Province, assembled together by their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Messengers,</hi> particularly mention it as a <hi>necessary Expedient</hi> in order to a <hi>Reformation,</hi> "that good and effectual Care should be taken, respecting <hi>Schools of Learning."</hi> And they reason upon it in the following Manner. "The Interest of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>good Literature</hi> have been won't to rise and fall together. We read in the <hi>Scripture</hi> of <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Scholars,</hi> and of <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colleges.</hi> 1 Chron. 25. 8. Mal. 2. 12. Acts 19. 9. and 22. 3. And the most eminent <hi>Reformers,</hi> among the LORD's People of old, thought it their Concern to erect and uphold them. Was not SAMUEL (that great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former) PRESIDENT of the <hi>College</hi> at <hi>NAJOTH,</hi> 1 Sam. 19. 18, 19; and thought to have been one of the <hi>first Founders of Colleges?</hi> Did not ELIJAH and ELISHA restore the <hi>Schools</hi> erected in the Land of ISRAEL? And JOSIAH (another great Reformer) shew'd Respect to the <hi>College</hi> at JERUSALEM, 2 Kings 22. 14. <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Story informs, that great Care was taken by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and their immediate Successors, for the settling of <hi>Schools</hi> in all Places, where the Gospel had been preached, that so the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion</hi> might be preserv'd, and the <hi>Truth</hi> propagated to succeeding Generations. It is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as one of the greatest Mercies that ever GOD bestowed upon his People ISRAEL, that he <hi>raised up of their Sons for Prophets,</hi> Amos 2. 11. Which had Respect to their <hi>Education</hi> in <hi>Schools of Learning.</hi> And we have all Cause to bless GOD, who put it into the Hearts of our <hi>Fathers</hi> to take Care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter. For <hi>these Churches</hi> had been in a <hi>State most deplorable,</hi> if the LORD had not blest the <hi>College,</hi> so as from hence to supply most of the Churches as at this Day. When NEW-ENGLAND was poor, and we were but few in Number comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there was a Spirit to encourage <hi>Learning,</hi> and the <hi>College</hi> was full of <hi>Students.</hi> whom GOD hath made Blessings, not only in this, but in other Lands; but it is <hi>deeply to be lamented,</hi> that <hi>now,</hi> when we are become many, and more able than at our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, that <hi>Society,</hi> and <hi>other inferior Schools,</hi> are in such a low and languishing State. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> as we desire that <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> should flourish, it concerns, us to endeavour that both the <hi>College,</hi> and <hi>all other Schools of Learning,</hi> in every Place, be duly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected and encouraged. See the Result of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> assembled Sept. 10. 1679. under the <hi>Answer</hi> to their <hi>second question.</hi>
               </note>
               <pb n="258" facs="unknown:005151_0305_1016C7B504B6D920"/>
To the same Cause it may be ascrib'd, that such <hi>Swarms</hi> of <hi>Exhorters</hi> have appear'd in the Land, and been admir'd and run after, though many of them could scarce speak common Sense, under the Notion of <hi>immediate Impressions</hi> from the SPIRIT, and that <hi>his Assistance</hi> would more than supply the <hi>Want of Learning.</hi> And to the same Cause still it must be attributed, that so many <hi>Ministers</hi> preach, not only without <hi>Book,</hi> but without <hi>Study;</hi> and justify their doing so, left, by <hi>previous Preparation,</hi> they should <hi>stint</hi> the SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>But what is this better than <hi>Presumption?</hi> 'Tis not <hi>now</hi> as it was in the <hi>first Days</hi> of the Gospel Men were then assisted in a <hi>miraculous</hi> and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Manner; but they have <hi>now</hi> no Reason to expect the <hi>SPIRIT's Help,</hi> only in the Way of <hi>Means;</hi> upon the due Use of their own <hi>Powers,</hi> by attending to <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="259" facs="unknown:005151_0306_1016C7B696BA63D0"/>
This same <hi>Error</hi> was common in the <hi>Country,</hi> in former Times. It was then said, they needed <hi>no Books</hi> but the <hi>Bible;</hi> and instead of <hi>using Learning,</hi> they must <hi>rely on the SPIRIT. Private Men's Prophesying</hi> became too much the Practice, to the <hi>Neglect</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the <hi>Ministry.</hi> They pleaded, there was no Need of <hi>Learning</hi> in <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that one of them could by the SPIRIT do better, than the Minister by his <hi>Learning;</hi> as if the SPIRIT and <hi>Learning</hi> were Opposites: which is so far from being the Truth, that <hi>Learning</hi> is a <hi>special Instrument,</hi> the SPIRIT uses in the Business of <hi>Preaching.</hi> I have elsewhere shown at large, the Sentiments of <hi>our Fathers</hi> upon this Head, and with what Faithfulness they testified against <hi>such Notions</hi> of the SPIRIT, as render'd <hi>Learning</hi> a Thing useless.</p>
            <p>I shall only add here, some Words from the celebrated Mr. BAXTER, wonderfully adapted to the present Case. <q>It is (says he<note n="†" place="bottom">His <hi>Works.</hi> Vol. 2. Pag. 286</note>) a desperate and destructive Conceit in any Man, to think, that because he hath the SPIRIT, he is therefore more able to expound Scripture, or teach it to the People, or understand Controversies, than <hi>learned</hi> Men who have not the <hi>Spirit of Holiness,</hi>—And upon this Account, Men cry down <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Learning,</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> for esteeming it, and cry up the SPIRIT, to a Use that GOD doth not intend it. I have no Mind, the LORD knows, to set up any Thing of <hi>Man</hi> against GOD; nor GOD's <hi>common Gifts,</hi> above his <hi>special;</hi> not to draw any Soul into an undue Esteem of any Thing that is in their Guides, but only to shew them the naked Truth. I
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:005151_0307_1016C7B84DE5A1E8"/>
would intreat therefore all poor deluded Souls, that are carried away with these foremention'd Mistakes, to lay by their Prejudice and Passion a while, and to weigh impartially the following Things.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Can you understand any <hi>Scripture,</hi> without the Help of <hi>Learning</hi> in <hi>yourselves,</hi> or <hi>others?</hi> The SPIRIT delivered it to the World in GREEK and HEBREW: Can you understand it before it is translated? If not, then the Knowledge of those <hi>Tongues</hi> is <hi>necessary</hi> in the <hi>Translators.</hi> And would you have us so wholly take up all on Trust from them, from Age to Age, ever after, as not to know, whether they translate it true or false? Or, whether there be any such Thing as they tell us? If you <hi>yourselves</hi> must take it upon <hi>Trust,</hi> from those who do understand it, when you do not methinks, you should so much the more honour and reverence them, whom you are fain to be so much behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to, and whom you must trust in a Matter of such Concernment to your Salvation; as whether any of this was ever in the Text of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> which you find in the <hi>English.</hi> Sure, that which is so laudable in the <hi>Translators,</hi> is not to be contemn'd in your <hi>Teachers!</hi> What if the <hi>Rhemist Papists</hi> tell you, that the <hi>Bible</hi> is falsly translated, I pray you, what Answer will you give them, if none of <hi>your Teachers</hi> knew it to be otherwise, whose Words you must take as <hi>credible</hi> Persons? Send a <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Bible into WALES or IRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, and when that <hi>converteth Souls</hi> without an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> then I will begin to think <hi>Learning</hi> less necessary.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="unknown:005151_0308_1016C7BF4EA6E290"/>
Consider, your very learning to <hi>speak,</hi> or <hi>read</hi> or <hi>write,</hi> is as much <hi>human Learning,</hi> as the Learning to know the <hi>Nature of Creatures,</hi> and <hi>Sense of strange Languages.</hi> And if you renounce these (which you neither have by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Grace</hi>) what Persons would you be? You may as well say therefore, that the SPIRIT will serve without Learning to <hi>write,</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> or <hi>speak;</hi> for the Difference in the Cases is only in <hi>Degree,</hi> and not in <hi>Kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider well, that there are <hi>several Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> that GOD hath for Men in the <hi>World,</hi> and in the <hi>Church;</hi> and accordingly, there are <hi>several Gifts</hi> of the SPIRIT. For <hi>Salvation,</hi> he giveth the <hi>Spirit of saving Grace,</hi> which shall teach Men effectually their Need of CHRIST, the Evil of Sin, and the like; but not every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truth. Those whom he will employ as <hi>Interpreters of Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi> to others, he will furnish with <hi>Gifts</hi> that are <hi>necessary</hi> for such Employments. And a Man may teach others, that may not be sanctified or saved himself; and many are sanctified and saved, that are unfit to teach others. <hi>Are all Prophets?</hi> Is all the <hi>Body</hi> an <hi>Eye,</hi> or <hi>Hand?</hi> GOD may give <hi>Teachers</hi> a Spirit of <hi>Teaching,</hi> as he gave SAUL a Spirit of <hi>Government,</hi> and deny it to <hi>better Men,</hi> because he intendeth not them to the same Use. <hi>Public Gifts</hi> are for <hi>Public Uses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, whether, under Pretence of <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> the SPIRIT, you do not bewray most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Pride,</hi> in the <hi>magnifying</hi> of <hi>your selves,</hi> and the <hi>Contempt</hi> of those, whom you are bound to <hi>learn</hi> of? Is it not <hi>palpable Pride,</hi> for you
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:005151_0309_1016C7C1E1B8B890"/>
that never bestow'd the twentieth Part of the <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Pains,</hi> as the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel have done to understand the Scripture, to be conceited that you understand it as well as they?—Is not the SPIRIT, and <hi>diligent Study</hi> together, like to do more for Increase of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, than the SPIRIT will do without such <hi>Studies?</hi> Why should you, in proud Censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, think, that <hi>godly Teachers</hi> have not the SPIRIT as well as you? They value it as much; they pray as hard for the SPIRIT; they confess their Need of it as much as you: They have the same GOD, the same CHRIST, and the same <hi>Promise</hi> as you: They shew forth the Fruits of it in Holiness, as much as you: And yet, proud Men dare lift up themselves in <hi>boasting</hi> of the SPIRIT, and <hi>despising</hi> their godly, painful <hi>Teachers,</hi> as being without the SPIRIT! Not only saying, as CORAH and his Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Ye take too much upon you; are not all the</hi> LORD'S <hi>People holy?</hi> But also saying, <hi>It is only the People are holy, and the Priests are unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.—</hi> You will confess, that a Man that hath studied <hi>Physick</hi> all his Days, is likely to be a <hi>better Physician</hi> than you that never studied it; and a Man that hath studied the <hi>Law,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be a <hi>better Lawyer;</hi> and that he were a proud Man that would say, though I never studied these Things, yet by the SPIRIT I know them as well as you. And you would see your Pride as well in this Case of <hi>Theology,</hi> if you did but know and consider, that the SPIRIT work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Man's Industry;</hi> and that the Gift of Interpretation, understanding Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, and the Creatures, is not a Gift of <hi>sanctification;</hi> but such as is common to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Men, and especially to make Men
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:005151_0310_1016C7C426FD04A0"/>
useful to others, and publickly serviceable to the <hi>Godly</hi> where they live.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly</hi> consider, whether it be not a most <hi>vile Abuse</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD, to make it a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> and Shelter of <hi>Idleness.</hi> GOD sets Men to search the Scriptures, to seek, and cry, and dig, for Knowledge; to inquire of Teachers, and one another; to meditate, and study the Scripture, Day and Night, that their profiting may be known to all: And these wretched Souls will not only disobey GOD, and indulge the Flesh by Ease and Idleness; thinking these laborious Studies too dear a Price to pay for Knowledge, or too hard a Means to use in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency to the SPIRIT: But besides this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Contempt of the Light, they will reproach those that are more diligent and studious than themselves, and most impudently lay their own <hi>Fault</hi> on their Teachers, calling them <hi>Lazy Drones and idle,</hi> because they spend their life and Strength in most laborious Studies, and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scripture:—And which is the very Top of their Wickedness, they dare <hi>father</hi> all this upon the SPIRIT; as if Labour and Study were needless, because they have the SPIRIT. Is it not enough for you to despise GOD and his <hi>Word</hi> by your fleshly Ease and Idleness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to study and meditate on Scripture, Day and Night, but you must also blame them who are at more Pains than yourselves; yea, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently blame them for your Fault of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; yea, and pretend the SPIRIT for all this Wickedness. No Wonder if GOD be aveng'd on such Dealings by giving you up to a <hi>Spirit</hi> that doth indeed be friend, and own your Course.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="unknown:005151_0311_1016C7C69676D2F0"/>
Another Instance of <hi>undue Dependance</hi> on the SPIRIT, is that which <hi>opposes</hi> a diligent Use of <hi>appointed Means.</hi> And such too commonly is the <hi>Dependance</hi> of <hi>these Times.</hi> It has been declared from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and by one of the famous Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers too, in the new Way, that "for Ministers to advise Persons under Concern to <hi>Pray to GOD</hi> and apply themselves to the <hi>reading the Scriptures for Light and Direction,</hi> is the <hi>worst Advice</hi> that could be given; nay, <hi>as bad as the Devil himself could give."</hi> And if a celebrated <hi>Minister</hi> could venture publickly to speak after this Manner, 'tis no Wonder, if some of the <hi>Exhorters</hi> have been heard, in Discourse with Persons under Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to advise them, <hi>not to pray.</hi> I know the Plea is, that the Thing mean't by this Advice, is, "That People should not <hi>rest</hi> in their Prayers, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances of the Means of Religion." But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (as Mr. TURELL justly remarks<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>his Dialogue,</hi> 2 Edit. P. 16.</note>) <q>Those who deliver such unsafe Paradoxes are always careful (at the Time of it) to distinguish and interpret, may be questioned. Some worthy Gentlemen (now in these Parts) who have been discoursed with by me and others, say, they are wanting.</q> And 'tis too well known to need a labour'd Proof, that some <hi>Preachers</hi> as well as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horters,</hi> have exprest themselves in a <hi>most unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Manner</hi> upon this Point; and so as to lead People into an unhappy Mistake, as to their <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Divine Appointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis certainly a Mistake, and a dangerous one too, for any to <hi>depend</hi> on the SPIRIT, so as to neglect an <hi>Attendance on Means.</hi> No one that
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:005151_0312_1016C7C914C95D88"/>
has the <hi>Bible</hi> in his Hands, and will look into it without Prejudice, can be at a Loss to know, that GOD has <hi>appointed</hi> certain <hi>Means</hi> to be attended in Order to the <hi>Obtainment</hi> of that <hi>Help</hi> from the SPIRIT which is needed: such as <hi>Prayer, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>hearing</hi> GOD's Word, and the like. And these being Duties of <hi>divine Institution,</hi> it can't be supposed, when we are call'd to <hi>depend</hi> on the SPIRIT, it is in such a Sense as to <hi>exclude</hi> these Duties, or render an Observance of them insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant. This would be to <hi>oppose the SPIRIT's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> to the <hi>Appointments of GOD,</hi> and make one Part of the Scripture <hi>contradict</hi> another; which is grosly absurd.</p>
            <p>Some may imagine, it is more for the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>blessed SPIRIT</hi> to ascribe the <hi>Sinner's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> to him <hi>absolutely,</hi> and in <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>all Means;</hi> but this is to be <hi>wise above what is written;</hi> yea, <hi>contrary</hi> to what is written. 'Tis to set the SPIRIT OF GOD, and the INSTITU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS OF GOD at variance with each other; which can never be for the Honour of the <hi>divine</hi> SPIRIT. 'Tis true, <hi>GOD may be sought of them who asked not for him, and may be found of them who sought him not:</hi> But this is not the <hi>ordinary</hi> Method, in which he gives his SPIRIT to effect a <hi>Work of Grace</hi> in the Hearts of Sinners. The <hi>common</hi> Way is in the <hi>Use of appointed Means:</hi> Nor is there Ground of Hope, in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of GOD, to be saved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Way. 'Tis indeed <hi>Presumption</hi> to expect GOD will be <hi>sought of us,</hi> if we don't <hi>seek to him.</hi> He may manifest himself to us; but we have no Reason to hope that he will; yea, all Hopes of this Kind are <hi>unscriptural,</hi> as having no Bottom in the <hi>Word of GOD:</hi> And notwithstanding any such Hopes, we may perish in our Sins; and
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:005151_0313_1016C7CBB588F0D8"/>
what is more, the Hazard will be infinite, lest this should be our unhappy Case.</p>
            <p>The last Instance of this <hi>undue Dependance,</hi> is that which reflects <hi>Dishonour</hi> upon the <hi>written Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of GOD.</hi> And who is ignorant, how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon it has been, in the past Months, to throw Contempt on the <hi>Scripture,</hi> under the Pretence of being <hi>guided by the SPIRIT?</hi> The Talk of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, upon this Head, has been just like that of <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi> Says the <hi>Letter</hi> to Mr. TURELL,<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>his Dialogue,</hi> 2 Edition.

               <q>
                  <hi>Many</hi> assert, that the <hi>Bible</hi> is of no Service to the <hi>unregenerate;</hi> and tho' they should read it, while in a State of Nature, they understand no more of it than a <hi>Stone.</hi>—They likewise maintain, that the receiving Light and Comfort is a sufficient Evidence of a Man's good Estate: And he may depend upon it, without examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it be agreable to the <hi>written Word.</hi>
               </q> And in another <hi>Letter,</hi> in the same Book, among the <hi>Irregularities</hi> of the Times, this is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note n="†" place="bottom">Page 20.</note>

               </q> And it has been too often suggested, <q>as tho' the <hi>Word of GOD was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to such as have the SPIRIT.</hi>
               </q> And what indeed is the Language of those <hi>inward Whispers,</hi> and <hi>extraordinary spiritual Motions,</hi> which so many pretend to in these Days, but that they are <hi>above the Scripture,</hi> as having a better and more safe Guide, even the SPIRIT himself? And no Wonder, if, with them, the Scripture is held in <hi>Contempt.</hi>

It may, perhaps, seem to such as though they magnified the <hi>blessed SPIRIT,</hi> while they <hi>so</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on <hi>his Suggestions</hi> and <hi>Influences,</hi> as to make <hi>these</hi> their <hi>chief Guide</hi> in all Things. But what if the <hi>Influences</hi> they take to be from the SPIRIT, are the <hi>Fancies</hi> of their <hi>own Minds,</hi> or <hi>Suggestions</hi> of <hi>Satan transforming himself into an Angel of Light?</hi> Who is their Guide now? And instead of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> is not <hi>horrid Reproach</hi> reflected on the <hi>Divine SPIRIT?</hi> And is there no Danger of such a Mistake? Han't it been common in the World? What Age has there been, since the Times of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> wherein many have not, in this Way, deluded themselves? And may not this always be expected to be the Case, when <hi>suppos'd Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> of the SPIRIT are set up in the Room of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and made, instead of <hi>that,</hi> the Guide in Matters of Salvation?</p>

'Tis a great Error, when Men have their <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations</hi> warmed, or feel within themselves <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>unusual Impressions,</hi> at once to conclude they are under a <hi>divine Influence,</hi> and to think and act accordingly, without examining their <hi>inward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Suggestions,</hi> by the SPIRIT's <hi>Declarations</hi> in the <hi>Scripture:</hi> And 'tis this that exposes them to <hi>Delusion;</hi> to deceive themselves, and to be deceived by the <hi>grand Enemy</hi> of Souls: Nor is there any one Thing that has led on to <hi>more</hi> or <hi>wilder</hi> Extravagances, both in <hi>Principle</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi>

This is the Master-Plot the Devil hath us'd, in late Times, to lay Gospel Ordinances under the Brand of the grossest Contempt. Oh! its an <hi>easy</hi> Way to be <hi>spiritual,</hi> to say the SPIRIT teaches; and then we can condemn all for <hi>carnal</hi> that stick to <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and call these outward Forms, beggarly Elements.—It is an endless Delusion, and grosly uncertain in the very Foundation, that such give themselves up to, who wait for the SPIRIT's <hi>Teaching, without the Word.</hi> For what Rule have I to try the SPIRIT by, but the <hi>Word revealed,</hi> and written in the Scriptures? When as CHRIST says, <hi>Search the Scriptures;</hi> and St. JOHN, <hi>Try the Spirits, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of GOD or no.</hi> But how shall I know, whether I am taught of the SPIRIT, or no, unless the Word direct me? As for those who are deluded out of GOD's Way into this endless Path of Error, I look upon their Case as sad and miserable; and yet, it calls for the Prayers of all their Friends, Relations and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.</q> See his <hi>Divine Presence in the Places of religious Worship,</hi> Page 222, 223, 224.

For the Pretence of the SPIRIT in its Dictates of Truths, <hi>besides and above the Word,</hi> will fetch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the same Spirit to maintain them (though the grossest Delusions); and so, the <hi>Word,</hi> and all ordinary Means of reducing such Souls to their right Wits again, become wholly useless and unprofitable.

            <p>'Tis therefore exceeding dangerous for any to trust to any <hi>supposed Influences, Dictates,</hi> or <hi>Sugges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> from the SPIRIT, to the <hi>Neglect</hi> of the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> much more in Opposition to it.

            <p>I say, with needless Fears, because the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Time</hi> of Conversion is a <hi>Circumstance</hi> only, and therefore <hi>separable</hi> from the <hi>Change</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: And it actually is separated from it in many Instances, or there will be no Room for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Charity, in Respect of some of the best of Christains, so far as we are able to judge.—But I have elsewhere spoken largely upon this Head, and therefore go on to say,</p>

I have myself been present, in a large Assembly, when the <hi>Preacher</hi> (and he would take it ill not to be tho't a first-rate one too) spake of <hi>good Works,</hi> with a loud and vehement Voice, in that Style, <hi>your abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, filthy, cursed good Works:</hi> At the same Time, assuring the People, "that if they did <hi>good Works</hi> they would be <hi>damned;</hi> and the <hi>more of them</hi> they did, the <hi>more</hi> they would be damned:" And this, without explaining himself upon the Matter, and so as that I could not but judge, the <hi>Tendency</hi> of what he said, was to lead People into a mistaken contemptuous Thought of <hi>good Works.</hi> And the Preaching of <hi>some other Ministers</hi> has been too much in the same Strain; insomuch, that those <hi>weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith,</hi> are become <hi>low</hi> in the Esteem of many: Nay, to such a Height are Numbers, among our <hi>new Converts,</hi> grown in their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Spirituality,</hi> that they can scarce bear to hear a Sermon upon the Subject of <hi>good Works:</hi> And the Minister that dares practice upon the <hi>inspired Command</hi> of the Apostle PAUL,<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. 3. 8.</note> 
               <hi>In affirming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, that they which have believed in GOD might be careful to maintain good Works,</hi> may be sure of being branded with the opprobrious Name of an ARMINIAN: Nay, the Apostle JAMES himself is too <hi>legal</hi> for these <hi>spiritual</hi> Christians; and if they an't very much abus'd, they have some of them, given <hi>him</hi> the Character of an ARMINIAN, and voted his <hi>Epistle</hi> not worthy a place in the <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Canon.</hi>

Times, reflected so much Disgrace on Religion, and was the great Obstacle in the Way of it's Progress. The <hi>old</hi> ANTINOMIANS began, at first, with much the same Language about the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>good Works,</hi> that is now in Use: And it was gradually that they arriv'd at those Heights of Extravagance, for which they have justly been stigmatised.

The Danger is greater than we may be aware of.—Some are already grown quite wild; and, if the Mistakes of many others are not in Time rectified, they may increase in their Malignity, and be of fatal Consequence to the Interest of Christianity in these Churches.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but a Number of those, who have spoken, in a very unguarded Manner, of <hi>good Works,</hi> are serious, honest Persons, having at Heart the Honour of GOD and the REDEEMER.

               </q> And there is always Danger of thus running from on Extream to the other: And this is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Satan</hi> has commonly gain'd an Advantage, to
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:005151_0326_1016C7EB96E4EE70"/>
the Hindrance of the flourishing of Truth and Holiness.</p>
            <p>I fault none for a Care to distinguish between good Works in a <hi>Gospel-Sense,</hi> and such as may be so term'd, only because the <hi>Matter</hi> of what is done is <hi>good.</hi> Let Men speak as strongly as they please, against those Works as <hi>evangelically good ones,</hi> which proceed from a View to the Applause of the World, or the Prospect of some temporal Advantage; or, that are only the <hi>meer outward Acts</hi> of Piety, Honesty, Generosity, Charity, and the like; or, that have no higher Rise than <hi>carnal Nature,</hi> however civilised and polished. These are not <hi>good Works</hi> in a <hi>religious</hi> sense; and Men ought to be plainly told so: Nor can <hi>Works</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> (in the Sense I am now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) only as they proceed from a Principle of <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST, and such a <hi>Temper of Soul</hi> as will argue Men to be the <hi>Children of</hi> GOD, and <hi>born from above.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither would I be understood to blame any for their Christian Endeavours, that the <hi>Grace of GOD,</hi> and <hi>Merits</hi> of CHRIST, might have the <hi>whole Honour</hi> that is due to them in the great Affair of Man's <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that we are <hi>Sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Grace.</hi> To <hi>Grace</hi> do they always lead up our Thoughts, as the original eternal <hi>Source of Man's Salvation.</hi> To this do they always ascribe <hi>Salvation,</hi> ANTICEDENT to all <hi>other Causes</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations,</hi> of whatever Nature, or Kind; and in a Sense so glorious and exalted, that had it not been for <hi>this,</hi> we never should, never could have been saved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="unknown:005151_0327_1016C7EF9ED24DF8"/>
'Tis plain likewise from the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that we are <hi>saved by</hi> CHRIST. He was the glorious Person who lay, in the Counsels of GOD, as the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the Scheme of Man's Redemption; He it was that, in the Fulness of Time, appear'd in the World, in Fashion as a Man, and <hi>did,</hi> and <hi>suffered,</hi> all that was necessary in Order to make Way for the Recovery of undone Man; and 'tis with a View to HIM, for HIS SAKE, and on HIS ACCOUNT, that the Sinner is <hi>justified</hi> and <hi>saved.</hi> These Blessings are made over to him, only in <hi>Consideration</hi> of the mediatorial <hi>Performances</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the LORD JESUS CHRIST: This is the <hi>true Reason</hi> of their Bestowment, in <hi>Opposition</hi> to <hi>all Works of Righteousness,</hi> that he ever did, or was capable of doing, to <hi>recommend</hi> him to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of GOD.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as plain from the <hi>same Scriptures,</hi> that Salvation <hi>by Grace, through CHRIST,</hi> is in the <hi>Way</hi> of <hi>Obedience;</hi> such an Obedience as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a <hi>Heart purified by Faith,</hi> and <hi>purged from dead Works to Serve the living GOD.</hi> This is evidently the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the BIBLE.—It makes no Provision of Mercy for <hi>Sinners continuing such;</hi> but positively excludes them the Kingdom of Heaven, notwithstanding the <hi>Grace of GOD,</hi> and the <hi>Merits of the REDEEMER.</hi> The Texts to this Purpose are scattered all over the Writings of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> and <hi>Apostles:</hi> Nor is there any, Room for Dispute upon the Matter.</p>
            <p>Nor is there the least <hi>Inconsistency</hi> between these <hi>Scripture-Doctrines;</hi> and we may be sure, we mistake their Meaning, if we interpret them so as to make them clash with one another.

take away the <hi>Necessity</hi> of a <hi>holy Life,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Precepts of the Gospel: And 'tis so far from honouring the <hi>Grace of GOD,</hi> or the <hi>Merits of the</hi> REDEEMER, to suppose such a Thing, that it casts Reproach upon them both. 'Tis to <hi>Separate</hi> between those Things, which GOD has join'd together.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Worthy of Notice are the following Words of Mr. BAXTER. Says he, <q>If you set up the <hi>Duties</hi> of the Gospel in <hi>CHRIST's Stead,</hi> you err. CHRIST hath his <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Work;</hi> DUTY hath its <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> too. Set it but in its <hi>own Place,</hi> and expect from it but its own <hi>Part,</hi> and you go right; yea more, (how unsavoury soever the Phrase may seem) you may <hi>so far</hi> as this comes to, <hi>trust</hi> to your <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> i. e. for <hi>their own Part.</hi> For if Duty have no Share, why may we not <hi>trust CHRIST</hi> in a Way of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience as well as of <hi>Duty.</hi> In a Word, you must both use, and trust Duty in <hi>Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to CHRIST; but neither use it, nor trust it in <hi>Co-ordination</hi> with him. So that this dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates nothing from CHRIST; for he has done, and will do all his Work perfectly, and enableth his People to do <hi>their's:</hi> Yet, he is not properly said to do it himself. He <hi>believes</hi> not, <hi>repents</hi> not, &amp;c. but worketh these in them. i. e. enableth and excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to do it.

            <p>Men may, 'tis true, place <hi>good Works</hi> in the <hi>Room</hi> of CHRIST, or of <hi>divine Grace;</hi> and so they may, under Pretence of <hi>exalting</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>Grace,</hi> entertain the Notion as tho' <hi>good Works</hi> were <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.</hi> And in either of these Cases, Dishonour is
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:005151_0329_1016C7F4C43AEA90"/>
done to the REDEEMER, and that <hi>Grace of GOD,</hi> which 'tis impossible should give Countenance to a Neglect of the Duties of Religion. What tho' <hi>good Works</hi> are not the <hi>Motive</hi> to Salvation, but the <hi>free, unmerited Mercy of GOD?</hi> What though 'tis not for the <hi>Sake</hi> of <hi>good Works,</hi> that we are <hi>justified,</hi> but on Account of the <hi>Righteousness of</hi> CHRIST? Does this argue that <hi>good Works</hi> are not necessary in other Respects? They are so in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the <hi>Appointment</hi> of GOD: Nor was this Appointment a meer <hi>arbitrary</hi> Thing, but plainly founded in the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>divine Government.</hi> 'I was not fitting that GOD should save Men in their <hi>Sin;</hi> that he should receive them to Heaven, While going on in <hi>Rebellion</hi> against his <hi>sovereign, rightful Authority:</hi> Yea, it would be repugnant to all the Conceptions we have of GOD, as a Being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise, and just, and holy, for him to grant it to <hi>this Kind</hi> of Persons, to sit down with the LORD JESUS in his Kingdom. In this View of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what must we think of his Holiness and Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? What would become of his Authority as Governour among the Nations? What more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Method could be taken to lead Men to think, there was no Difference between <hi>moral Good and Evil.</hi> That <hi>Virtue</hi> was of no Account in the Eye of Heaven, and that the Distinction between <hi>that</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> was not worthy to be regarded in Men's Conduct of themselves? And indeed, what would they have to fear, either from the <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> of GOD? And instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Restraint from Sin, would they not be very much at Liberty to follow their own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to live and act just as they were mov'd by carnal Nature? But far be it from our Tho'ts to suppose, that the alwise and good GOD would allow of such a State of Things. He never would,
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:005151_0330_1016C7F654166138"/>
he never could: He has a greater Regard to his own Honour, and the Welfare of Man.</p>
            <p>But besides all this, that <hi>Temper of Mind</hi> which always was, and will be, a never-failing Source of <hi>good Works,</hi> is previously necessary, in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things, in Order to a Meetness for the Happiness of the heavenly World. This is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, rational Kind of Happiness; consisting in the Contemplation of the divine Perfections, ardent Love to the blessed GOD, and a perpetual Employment in his Service. But can those take Pleasure in contemplating the Glories of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect Being, the Temper of whose Souls is so <hi>carnal,</hi> as to have the <hi>highest Relish</hi> for the Things of Time and Sense? Can they Place their intire Delight in GOD, who have so fond an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for that abominable Thing which his Soul hates? Or, is it possible they should be happy in <hi>serving GOD,</hi> Night and Day, without Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forever, the <hi>Bent</hi> of whose Minds is turned quite another Way? <hi>Light</hi> can as well have <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with <hi>Darkness,</hi> or CHRIST with <hi>Belial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let not any imagine, that CHRIST, by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law in our <hi>Stead,</hi> has made void the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations we are under to conform to it, in our <hi>own Persons,</hi> as a <hi>Rule of Life.</hi> The BIBLE, that <hi>sacred Test</hi> of all religious Truth, gives not the least Encouragement to any such <hi>licentious Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> On the contrary, it every where repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents our Obligations to <hi>Obedience</hi> as mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, on Account of CHRIST, and what he has <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> for sinners. Nor is there so strong an Argument to enforce <hi>religious Practice,</hi> as that which is fetcht from the <hi>bleeding</hi> and <hi>dying</hi> of the SON of GOD, when he stood in the Place of miserable,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:005151_0331_1016C7FA2210BFB8"/>
sinful Man. 'Tis indeed the great <hi>Gospel-Argument</hi> to <hi>Repentance</hi> and a <hi>good Life;</hi> and of most weight and persuasive Influence to this Purpose. And so far were the <hi>Apostles</hi> of our LORD, from thinking Men discharged from their Obligations to obey the Law, on the Account of CHRIST, or any Thing he has <hi>done,</hi> or <hi>suffered</hi> for them, that they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mention it, as one of the great Ends of his <hi>giving himself for us,</hi> that<note n="†" place="bottom">Titus 2. 14.</note> 
               <hi>he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Zealous of good Works:</hi> Nay, the Reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly given, why he had the Name JESUS called upon him was that,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>For he shall save his People from their Sins.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,<note n="*" place="bottom">I John 3. 8.</note> it was <hi>for this Purpose the Son of GOD was manifested, that he might destroy the Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi> 'Tis therefore a base Reflection on CHRIST, and the great Design of his Undertaking for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to entertain a Thought, as tho', by <hi>his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> he had taken away the <hi>Necessity</hi> of <hi>our's.</hi> The inspir'd PAUL was quite of another Mind.

               <hi>That a Man is justified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law;</hi> yet to prevent all Mistakes, he adds those observable Words in the Verse, or two following, <hi>Do we when make void the Law thro' Faith? GOD forbid! Yea, we establish the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Grace of GOD</hi> is so far from encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Neglect of good Works,</hi> that it is one of the strongest Excitements to the Performance of them. It applies to our <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> and is wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to soften the Heart, and render the most stubborn Will pliant and yielding. And if 'tis the

Temper of any to take Occasion from the <hi>Grace of GOD</hi> to <hi>Sin</hi> against him, rather than <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, they, of all Men, have the least Right to be look'd upon as <hi>good Christians.</hi> The Tho't of <hi>continuing in Sin,</hi> under the Pretence of <hi>exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free Grace,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> rejects with a GOD FORBID! And well he might, for it argues a <hi>most accursed Frame of Mind.</hi> 'Tis a vile Abuse offered to the gracious and merciful GOD.

            <p>The <hi>last</hi> Error I shall mention is that, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries <hi>Sanctification</hi> as an <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>justification.</hi> None, I believe, will deny, that this is a common Tenet, in these Times.

            <p>"A Man cannot evidence his <hi>Justification</hi> by his <hi>Sanctification,</hi> but he must needs <hi>build</hi> upon his <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> and <hi>trust</hi> to it," was one of the Principles of the <hi>Opinionists</hi> in that Day; which the <hi>Synod</hi> confute thus.<note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>History of the Rise, &amp;c. of Antinomianism &amp;c. in this Country.</hi> Page. 15.</note>

18, 19. Where the HOLY GHOST faith, <hi>that by unfeigned and hearty Love, we may have Assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> and yet, neither there, nor any where else, would have us <hi>trust</hi> to our <hi>Sanctification:</hi> So Verse 7. <hi>He that doth Righteousness is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as he is righteous.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another of their Principles was, That it is a <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and <hi>Soul-damning</hi> Error, to make <hi>Sanctification</hi> an <hi>Evidence</hi> of <hi>Justification:</hi> Upon which the <hi>Synod</hi> express themselves thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. P. 16.</note> 
               <q>This is contrary to these <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Rom. 8. 11. <hi>They that walk after the SPIRIT, are freed from Condemnation, and are in CHRIST,</hi> and so <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> So. 1 John 3. 10. <hi>In this are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD manifest, and the Children of the Devil: Whosoever doth not Righteousness is not of GOD.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another of their Notions was, "That the SPIRIT giveth such full and clear Evidence of my good Estate, that I have no Need to be tried by the Fruits of <hi>Sanctification:</hi> This were to light a Candle to the Sun:"; To which the <hi>Synod</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.

            </p>
            <p>Another of their unaccountable Fancies was, "That <hi>Sanctification</hi> was so far from <hi>evidencing</hi> a good Estate, that it <hi>darkens</hi> it rather; and a Man may more clearly see CHRIST, when he seeth no <hi>Sanctification,</hi> than when he doth: The <hi>darker</hi> my <hi>Sanctification</hi> is, the brighter is my <hi>Jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification."</hi> The Reply is,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.

For the HOLY GHOST concludes, as from a clear and infallible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and Proposition, that if we <hi>walk in the Light, as he is in the Light,</hi> then doth the <hi>Blood of CHRIST cleanse us from all Sin;</hi> meaning, that <hi>then,</hi> and <hi>thereby,</hi> it appeareth, that it is done: As on the contrary, <hi>Unholiness,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Walking,</hi> is like <hi>Darkness,</hi> which obscureth all the goodly Presumption, Flourishes, and Hopes, of an unregenerate Man, Verse 6. For this Purpose, (1 John 5. 8.) The <hi>Water of Sanctification</hi> is made a <hi>Witness:</hi> Now the Nature of a Witness is not to <hi>darken</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Matters in Question, but to <hi>clear</hi> them.

And when DAVID (Psalm 51. 10, 11, 12.) saw his Heart so unclean, and his Spirit so altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Order, his <hi>Justification</hi> was not <hi>then brighter;</hi> for then he should have had the Joy of his Salvation more full, and not so to sink, as that he begs it might be restored to him; as implying, that his Joy, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, was wanting to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And one of the <hi>Sayings</hi> in <hi>that Day</hi> was, <q>Here is a great Stir about Graces, and looking to <hi>Hearts;</hi> but give me CHRIST. I seek not for <hi>Graces,</hi> but for CHRIST; I seek not for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> but for CHRIST; I seek not for <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> but for CHRIST; Tell me not of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> but tell me of CHRIST.</q> To which the <hi>Synod</hi> subjoin,<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.

               <q>This Speech seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to make a <hi>flat Opposition</hi> between CHRIST and his <hi>Graces,</hi> contrary to that, in John 1. 16. <hi>Of his Fulness we all received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> And between CHRIST and his <hi>Promises,</hi> contrary to Gal. 3. 13, 14. CHRIST <hi>was made a Curse, that we might receive the Promise of the SPIRIT;</hi> And, Luke 1. 70. with 74. And betwixt CHRIST and all <hi>holy Duties,</hi> contrary to Tit. 2. 14. And therefore holds forth Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not agreeing to <hi>wholsome Doctrine.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, another of their <hi>Sayings</hi> was, "If CHRIST be my <hi>Sanctificatiou,</hi> what need I look to any Thing in <hi>my self,</hi> to <hi>evidence</hi> my <hi>Justification."</hi> Upon which the <hi>Synod</hi> observe,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. P. 22.</note> 
               <q>This Position is therefore unsound, because it holds forth CHRIST to be my <hi>Sanctification,</hi> so as that I need not look to any <hi>inherent Holiness</hi> in my self; 
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:005151_0336_1016C808B1B528A0"/>
whereas CHRIST is therefore said to be our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> because he works <hi>Sanctification in us;</hi> and we daily ought to grow up in him, by receiving new Supply and Increase of Grace, from his Fulness, according to 2 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>Grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</q>

            <p>But as this is an <hi>Error</hi> unhappily <hi>spreading</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong People, and of fatal Tendency, I shall, as a further Guard against the Infection of it, be at the Pains to lay before the Reader, what two <hi>Divines,</hi> of great Repute, in these Churches, have said in Confutation of it.</p>
            <p>The first is Mr. SHEPARD. He liv'd in the Times, when this <hi>Error</hi> was rise in the Country; and he has strongly testified against it, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his <hi>Parable of the ten Virgins.</hi> Says he,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. P. 130, 137.</note> 
               <q>The <hi>Testimony</hi> of the SPIRIT does not make a Man a Christian, but only evidence it: As 'tis the Nature of a <hi>Witness,</hi> not to make a Thing to be true, but to clear and <hi>evidence</hi> it. And therefore, whether the SPIRIT, in the <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>second</hi> Place, clears GOD's <hi>Love,</hi> I dispute not; because 'tis doubtful: Yet be sure you find out the Difference; <abbr>viz.</abbr> SOME WORK IN YOU, that no Hypocrite under Heaven has: Else what Peace can you have?</q> And a little on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <q>The great Doubt of GOD's People is not only, am I elected? Am I justified, and accepted? But am I <hi>called?</hi> Am I <hi>sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> Are not my Desires, my Faith, my Love, counterfeit; which I may have, and yet go to Hell? Now, the SPIRIT, when he comes,
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:005151_0337_1016C80A4629CDF8"/>
clears up all Doubts, not fully, but gradually; for 'tis the most clearing <hi>Witness:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, John 14. 18, 19, 20. <hi>At that Day, you shall know, that I am in you, and you in me, and I in the Father.</hi> The SPIRIT does not only say, CHRIST is <hi>out of you</hi> in Heaven, preparing and interceeding; but <hi>in you,</hi> sanctifying, prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee for Glory, who art a Vessel of Glory; and <hi>you in me</hi> by Faith, by Love, Desire, &amp;c. Now, when a Man shall say, <hi>I look to no Work, but only for the SPIRIT to reveal the LORD'S Love; in seeming to desire the SPIRIT, he doth resist the SPIRIT of GOD.</hi>
               </q> And in a few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraphs following. <q>If you look to the SPIRIT without a <hi>Work,</hi> whilst you do seek <hi>Consolation</hi> from the SPIRIT, you cannot avoid the <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> You say, the SPIRIT has given Peace to you: But do you love CHRIST? I look not to <hi>that,</hi> but to the SPIRIT; why, the <hi>Word</hi> says, <hi>he that loves not him, let him be Anathema.</hi> So, is the League between your <hi>Sins</hi> and your <hi>Souls</hi> broken? I look not to that: Why, JOHN faith, <hi>he that committeth Sin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 9. 8, 9. Are you new Creatures? I look not to that: Why, the <hi>Word</hi> faith, <hi>Unless you be born again, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> And the LORD knows, but on your Death-beds, thus <hi>Satan</hi> may assault you; and then the LORD will say, nay, look to your self. The Word shall be BELSHAZZAR'S Terror. Consider Psalm 32. 1. 2.</q> And yet more plainly a Page or two further, <q>A Man is first a Believer, and in CHRIST, and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, called, sanctified, before the SPIRIT does <hi>witness</hi> it: Else the SPIRIT should witness to an Untruth, and a Lie. For Unbelievers are under Wrath. If the SPIRIT does not witness

this <hi>peculiar Work</hi> to be in you, and clear it up to you, tell me, how you can escape Anguish of Conscience, and the Terrors of Hell in your Heart, unless Conscience be seared, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? When the LORD shall set Conscience to ask, and say, I <hi>chuse</hi> none but whom I <hi>call;</hi> I <hi>call</hi> none but whom I <hi>justify;</hi> I <hi>justify</hi> none but whom I <hi>sanctify,</hi> and that not with a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> but <hi>peculiar Work;</hi> is it so with you? If it be dark, or doubtful, can you but think all your JOYS have been DREAMS; and your WITNESS, DELUSIONS: Therefore look to this.—If you do not, you have no Peace. For the LORD'S Sake, do it before Fire try you, or you stand scorching before the Tribunal of GOD.—If you despise <hi>Work,</hi> you despise Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, and so despise CHRIST; and the LORD knows what Use you may have of them before you die.</q>

by our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is a Work that meets with great and manifold Difficulties; which are the Things that most Christians complain of. (3) I also grant, that the <hi>Evidence</hi> of our <hi>Justification</hi> in this, or any other Method, is not <hi>essential,</hi> and absolutely necessary, to the <hi>being</hi> of a Christian. A Man may live in CHRIST, and yet not know his Interest in him, or Relation to him, Isa. 50. 10. Some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, like Children in the Cradle, live, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not that they live; are born to a great Inheritance, but have no Knowledge of it, or present Comfort in it. (4) I will further grant, that the Eye of a Christian may be too intently fixt upon his <hi>own gracious Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and being wholly taken up in the <hi>reflex</hi> Acts of Faith, may too much neglect the <hi>direct</hi> Acts of Faith upon CHRIST, to the great Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Soul.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>But all this notwithstanding, the Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our <hi>Justification</hi> by our <hi>Sanctification,</hi> is not only a <hi>lawful,</hi> and <hi>possible,</hi> but a <hi>very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Work and Duty. 'Tis the Course that Christians have taken, in all Ages; And that which GOD hath abundantly blest to the Joy, and Encouragement of their Souls.</p>
               <p>He hath furnished our Souls, to this End, with noble self-reflecting Powers, and Abilities. He hath answerably furnished <hi>his Word</hi> with Variety of <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs,</hi> for the same End and Use. Some of these Marks are <hi>exclusive,</hi> to detect and bar bold presumptuous Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, 1 Cor. 6. 9. Rev. 21. 8. 27. Some are <hi>inclusive</hi> Marks, to measure the Strength and Growth of Grace by, Rom. 4. 20. And others
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:005151_0340_1016C8136DFE46D8"/>
are <hi>positive</hi> Signs, flowing out of the very <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> or the <hi>new Creature,</hi> 1 John 4. 13. <hi>Hereby we know, that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his SPIRIT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He hath expresly commanded us to examine and prove ourselves; upbraided the Neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that Duty, and enforc'd their Duty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by a thundering Argument, 2 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves: know ye not your own selves, how that JESUS CHRIST is in you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be R. probates.</hi> In a Word, for this End and Purpose, among others, were the Scriptures written, 1 John 5. 13. <hi>These Things have I written to you that believe on the Name of the SON of GOD, that ye may know that ye have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life.</hi> And therefore, to neglect this Duty are exceeding dangerous; but to deny and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride it, intolerable. It may be justly feared, such Men will be drown'd in Perdition, who fall into the Water, by making a Bridge over them with their own Shadows.</p>
               <p>For my own Part, I verily believe, that the sweetest Hours Christians enjoy in this World, is, when they retire into their Closets, and fit there conceal'd from all Eyes, but him that made them: looking <hi>now</hi> into the BIBLE, <hi>then</hi> into their own HEARTS, and <hi>then</hi> up to GOD; closely following the grand Debate about their <hi>Interest in</hi> CHRIST.

            <p>And now, if it be <hi>Fact,</hi> as I have given too much Reason to believe it to be, that these BAD THINGS have prevail'd in <hi>all Parts</hi> of the Land, and among <hi>all Sorts</hi> of Persons, the <hi>Answer</hi> is, at once, ready to what has been said, whether in <hi>Vindication</hi> of some <hi>particular Disorders,</hi> or in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi> of the <hi>whole taken together.</hi>

            <p>Some <hi>particular Irregularities</hi> have been vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated as Things right and good. But how? Why, by stripping them, in a great Measure, of <hi>those Circumstances</hi> which rendered them <hi>bad,</hi> and setting them forth, not as they <hi>really are,</hi> but as they ought to be, or are wrongly supposed to be; and in this Way, reflecting Blame upon the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainers</hi> of these Things, instead of fixing it where it justify belong'd, upon the <hi>Things themselves.</hi> To illustrate this in a few Instances.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> of addressing to the <hi>Passions</hi> of People, in these Times, has often been complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: But the Complaint, it is said,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. EDWARDS'S <hi>Thoughts on the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of Religion in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND. P. 149.</note> "has been

               <hi>without</hi> or <hi>beyond</hi> just Cause." And in order to make this appear, a deal of Pains has been taken<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. P. 149. and onwards.</note> to represent the <hi>Propriety</hi> of applying to People with <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>Earnestness</hi> about eternal Things; and not in a <hi>dull, cold,</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> Manner. And who are the Persons that ever thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? I know of none, among those called <hi>Opposers</hi> but were always in the Sentiment, that the Passions were planted in the human Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>very valuable Uses;</hi> that it was <hi>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> they should be excited; and that it was one Part of a Minister's Business to <hi>stir them up</hi> to a suitable Exercise. But what is all this to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Case? The Question is, whether it be'nt a <hi>plain, stubborn Fact,</hi> that the <hi>Passions</hi> have, <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> in <hi>these Times,</hi> been apply'd to, as though the <hi>main Thing</hi> in Religion was to throw them into Disturbance? Can it be denied, that the <hi>Preachers,</hi> who have been the <hi>Instruments</hi> of the <hi>Commotions</hi> in the Land, have endeavoured, by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Arts, and in <hi>all Manner of Ways,</hi> to raise the <hi>Passions</hi> of their Hearers to such a Height, as really to unfit them, for the present, for the Exercise of their <hi>reasonable</hi> Powers? Nay, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to alarm Men's <hi>Fears,</hi> has it not been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, among <hi>some Sort of Preachers,</hi> to <hi>Speak</hi> and <hi>act</hi> after such a <hi>wild Manner,</hi> as is adapted to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighten</hi> People out of their <hi>Wits,</hi> rather than pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess their Minds of <hi>such a Conviction</hi> of Truth, as is proper to Men, who are endow'd with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Understanding?</hi> And under the Notion of speaking to the <hi>Affections,</hi> were the Things of GOD and another World, ever preached with more Confusion of Thought; with greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherence; with the undue Mixture of more
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:005151_0350_1018A7D100252F88"/>
rash, crude, unguarded Expressions; or with Conceit to a higher Degree, appearing in fulsome Self-Applauses, as well as unheard of Contempt of others? These are Things of too publick a Nature to be denied: They have been too often practised, and in Places of too great Concourse, to admit of Debate. So that it's only reducing this Article of <hi>addressing to the Passions of People,</hi> to the <hi>Test</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and it won't bear a Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Nor can those who have complained of it be faulted, unless by placing their Complaint in a wrong Light.</p>
            <p>Another Thing that has been complained of is, <q>The Speaking Terror to them that are already under great Terror, instead of comforting them.</q> But this Complaint also is said to be "unjust;"<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. P. 156.</note> and in Order to show it to be so, the Way in which Terror ought to be dispenced to this Kind of Persons has been opened,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. Ibid. and onwards.</note> with the Restrictions under which it should be done. I am far from thinking, that what is here said is unexceptionable; but supposing it to be so, what is it to the Point? The Matter in Debate is, whether Terror has not, in <hi>Fact,</hi> been heaped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Persons already distracted almost with Terror, in a Manner that justly deserves to be blamed? And will any, pretending to be acquainted with the late Managements in the Land, calmly deny this? Has no Method, but that of a faithful Representation of the Truth of the Case of such Persons, been used to heighten their Fears? Has not <hi>Voice</hi> and <hi>Action,</hi> even to an extravagant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, been too often repaired to? Have no poor distressed Creatures been practised upon, and this
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:005151_0351_1018A7D29A7AF610"/>
by Numbers at a Time, and in Ways unfit to be mentioned, whereby their <hi>animal Nature</hi> has been thrown into the most horrid Confusion? I could mention a Plenty of Instances in this Kind, but that I rather chuse they should be buried in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Oblivion. So that if this Article also be brought to the <hi>Truth of Fact,</hi> it may still be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of with great Justice.</p>
            <p>It has still been mentioned as an Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Times, "that there has been too great a Frequency of religious Meetings, and too much Time spent in an Attendance on these Externals of Religion." But the Objection, it is said, is in the general groundless. † And why? Because <q>'tis fit, that, at such an extraordinary Time, when GOD appears unusually present with a People, in wonderful Works of Power and Mercy, that they should spend more Time than usual in religious Exercises, to put Honour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that GOD that is then extraordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and to seek his Face<note n="*" place="bottom">Page Ibid.</note>
               </q> And suppose this be allow'd; is there notwithstanding just Ground of Complaint? Is it not <hi>undoubted Fact,</hi> that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have generally, through the Land, gone into an <hi>Excess</hi> upon this Head of <hi>attending</hi> Meetings, either <hi>public,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> or both? Han't there been too many Instances of Houses of Worship, that have been scarce empty, Night or Day, for many Days together? Han't it been common, among those who have been wrought upon, in these Times to devote themselves, as it were, to the Business of attending <hi>Lectures</hi> and Meetings, either to <hi>speak or hear,</hi> as though herein lay the Sum of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And han't this been done by great Numbers of
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:005151_0352_1018A7DBD7E92F70"/>
Persons, to the Neglect of their <hi>Callings,</hi> and the real <hi>Damage</hi> of their <hi>Families?</hi> And while People have expended so much of their Time, in attending the <hi>Preachings</hi> and <hi>Exhortations</hi> of <hi>all Manner</hi> of <hi>Preachers,</hi> and <hi>Exhorters,</hi> what has been their Care about those Laws of GOD, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their Conduct, in the <hi>several Relations</hi> and <hi>Capacities of Life?</hi> Have they been, in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, zealous to be better <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives,</hi> better <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Servants?</hi> Have they been as <hi>remarkably forward</hi> to speak the Truth every Man to his Neighbour, to do Justice, and love Mercy, and walk humbly with GOD? These are Duties to be attended, as well as <hi>religious Meetings:</hi> But han't the Zeal of People to attend the <hi>latter,</hi> been so great, as to leave little Room for the <hi>observable</hi> Practise of the former? This, I believe, few will venture to deny. The plain Truth is, People have generally behaved, in these Times, too much as though they thought Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion consisted, <hi>chiefly,</hi> if not <hi>only,</hi> in an Attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on <hi>Meetings</hi> for <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>exhorting,</hi> and <hi>singing</hi> and the like; which is certainly a Fault, and will remain so, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that can be said to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Way in which Out-cries, Faintings, and other bodily Effects, have been spoken of as sure Arguments of a <hi>divine Influence</hi> accompanying the Word, has likewise been complained of. And what is the Answer? Why,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 172.</note> "that, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>probable Tokens</hi> of GOD's <hi>Presence;</hi> and when excited by preaching the <hi>important Truths of GOD's Word,</hi> urg'd and enfore'd with PROPER Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:005151_0353_1018A7E0BB904E68"/>
and Arguments, or are consequent on <hi>other Means that are GOOD,</hi> that they may be spoken of, and rejoiced in as such. For that <hi>Cryings out,</hi> in <hi>such a Manner,</hi> and with <hi>such Circumstances,</hi> is as much an Evidence of their <hi>general Cause</hi> as <hi>Language.</hi> The Meaning of it has been learn'd the same Way that Persons learn Language; <abbr>viz.</abbr> by <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi>" But what is all this to the Purpose of <hi>those Out-cries,</hi> and <hi>Swoonings,</hi> and <hi>bodily Agitations,</hi> that are not effected <hi>so much by Truth</hi> as by <hi>other Things,</hi> or not by Truth PROPER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY urg'd and enforc'd, nor yet by <hi>any other Means that are GOOD?</hi> And have there been no such Out-cries in the Land? Yea rather, have not the <hi>Out-cries</hi> too generally been of <hi>this Kind?</hi> Han't they been prov'd to be so in these Papers? And this, I know, is the Tho't of a very great Number of as wise, and pious, and judicious Christians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, as any we have in the Country; and they have been led into this Sentiment, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of their Excitement, which have been such as to leave them at no loss to judge of the Cause, any more than others may be at a loss to judge of the Meaning of Language. And what is the Way, in which these <hi>Out-cries</hi> have been spoken of as <hi>Tokens</hi> of an <hi>extraordinary divine Presence?</hi> Has it been <hi>commonly</hi> in Words expressive of a <hi>Probability</hi> only? Or, have they been delivered with an Air of <hi>Modesty,</hi> and as became those who might possibly be mistaken? So far from it, that the most <hi>positive, peremptory Affirmations</hi> have been us'd; and these, accompanied with <hi>bitter Language</hi> against those who could not bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to think, and speak after the same Manner with them. So that if this Complaint likewise be considered as it relates to Fact, there is just Ground
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:005151_0354_1018A7E4597A2FB0"/>
for it, notwithstanding all that has been offered to make it appear unjust.</p>
            <p>I might, had I Room, have mentioned many other Instances; tho' indeed there is no real Need of it, for 'tis only doing by <hi>them</hi> as I have done by <hi>these,</hi> that is, reducing them to the <hi>Truth of Fact,</hi> and they'll appear at once not to have been vindicated; nor could they have been, but by uncloathing them of such <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> as are unalterably bad, and will be judged to be so as long as there are any remains of true Sense and Reason in the World.</p>
            <p>But besides a <hi>Vindication</hi> of some <hi>particular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> considered in the <hi>Lump</hi> have been <hi>excus'd;</hi> but with such Arguments, as I can't suppose will be thought to carry in them much Weight. To illustrate this also by a brief Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion on some of these <hi>Excuses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been suggested concerning the <hi>bad Things</hi> of the present Day, taken <hi>collectively,</hi> that they are <hi>only accidental Effects of a good Work</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. EDWARDS'S <hi>Thoughts on the late Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Religion in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, P. 33.</note>. But how do we distinguish between <hi>accidental</hi> Effects, and those that are <hi>natural?</hi> Is it not by the <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency,</hi> and <hi>Uniformity</hi> of their Production? If such and such Effects are found, in Experience, to be the common and <hi>general</hi> Attendants of such and such Causes, at one Time and another, in this Place and the other, don't we always speak of them as <hi>natural,</hi> and never as <hi>accidental only?</hi> Yea, is not the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi>
               <pb n="308" facs="unknown:005151_0355_1018A7E61F081398"/>
wholly founded on this <hi>Kind of Observation</hi> and <hi>Experience?</hi> And if, in this Way, we judge of the <hi>bad Things</hi> prevailing in these Times, can it be thought they was nothing more than <hi>accidental Effects</hi> of a good Cause? Will any pretend, that they are <hi>rare</hi> Productions? Or, that they have been <hi>peculiar</hi> to <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there a Person,</hi> in <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there</hi> a <hi>particular</hi> Place? Is it not a known, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Fact, that they have appear'd in <hi>all Parts</hi> of the Land; yea, in every Place upon the <hi>whole Continent,</hi> in a greater or less Degree; and this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Persons of all <hi>Ranks, Ages, Sexes,</hi> and <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> who have been wrought upon in these Days? And have not <hi>these Effects</hi> been most remarkably visible in those, who have been spoken of as the most <hi>remarkable</hi> Subjects of the <hi>present Operation?</hi> These are Truths that can't b disown'd. They are as evident as the Light shining at Noon-day. And is it possible, if <hi>these Effects</hi> were <hi>meerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental,</hi> that they should be thus uniform, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>universal?</hi> We must give up our <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> before we can entertain such a Tho't of them.</p>
            <p>It has been said,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. Ibid.</note> 
               <q>more has been look'd for from Persons under the <hi>Operations</hi> of the SPIRIT, in these Days, than is reasonable; that, when any profess to have received Light, and <hi>Influence,</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> from Heaven, and so have had sensible Communion with GOD, many are ready to expect that <hi>now</hi> they appear like <hi>Angels,</hi> and not like poor, feeble, blind and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Worms of the Dust.</q> For my self, I know of none who ever had such Expectations; but if any were so weak and ignorant, they have seen that which is abundantly sufficient to show
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:005151_0356_1018A8EA93583988"/>
them their Mistake. 'Tis readily own'd, it ought not to be expected of Persons under the <hi>saving Operations</hi> of the SPIRIT, that they should appear like <hi>Angels;</hi> but yet, it may, with all Reason, be expected, they should appear like <hi>Men who have been renewed after the Image of GOD, in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Righteousness, and true Holiness.</hi> 'Tis not enough that they have <hi>Heat</hi> in their <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but they must have <hi>Light</hi> in their <hi>Minds;</hi> 'tis not enough that they <hi>talk speciously,</hi> and <hi>profess highly,</hi> but they must be really possest of a truly <hi>Christian Temper:</hi> And this they must discover by <hi>putting away from them all Bitterness, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and evil-speaking, with all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice;</hi> and not only so, but by living in the habitual Practice of that <hi>Piety</hi> towards GOD, and <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards <hi>Men,</hi> in all the genuine Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them, which are required in the Gospel. 'Tis not too much to expect this of those, who have been changed, by the Grace of GOD, into <hi>New-Creatures.</hi> 'Tis true, they are far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>perfectly holy,</hi> notwithstanding this <hi>Change;</hi> but 'tis as true, because the <hi>Bible</hi> affirms it, that they are not worthy to be spoken of as those who have been <hi>turn'd from the Power of Sin and Satan to GOD,</hi> unless they are such Persons as have been describ'd. And has this <hi>generally</hi> been the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of those, who have been highly spoken of in the late Times? It cannot reasonably be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while <hi>so many,</hi> and <hi>such gross Disorders</hi> have been prevalent among them.</p>
            <p>It has been pleaded,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 35.</note> 
               <q>so careful are some Persons lest this Work should be defended, that

                  <hi>now</hi> they will hardly allow, that the <hi>Influences</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD on the Heart, can so much as <hi>indirectly</hi> and <hi>accidently</hi> be the <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Exercise of <hi>Corruption,</hi> and Commission of Sins.</q> I don't believe, among the whole Number of those called <hi>Opposers,</hi> one can be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, who ever made the least Difficulty of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this: Though they have always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so high an Opinion of the <hi>real Influences of the Divine SPIRIT,</hi> that they can't suppose, these should GENERALLY be the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the Comissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, and in repeated, bare-fac'd Acts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those who are the <hi>Subjects</hi> of these <hi>Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and in a <hi>remarkable</hi> Degree. If <hi>great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of Persons, of <hi>all Capacities, Tempers,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducations,</hi> and in most Places throughout a Land, are betray'd into such a Conduct as is plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the most express, and peremptory Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Gospel</hi> of CHRIST, and go on in such a Conduct; and this, in Contempt of Advice, and all Means of Conviction: I say, when this is the Case, I must think better of the <hi>Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD;</hi> especially, when they are <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> beyond what they were ever known to be before, than to suppose they should be the <hi>Occasion</hi> of such Breaches of the Christian Law: Nor do I esteem it an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of that Respect, which is due to the <hi>blessed SPIRIT of Grace,</hi> to make him the <hi>Cause,</hi> though it be only in the Way of a <hi>sine qua non,</hi> of those Effects, which are visibly owing to the <hi>Lusts of Men,</hi> venting themselves without any tolerable Restraint, either from <hi>Reason</hi> or Religion, and so as is not known among Multitudes, even of those who are thought to deserve no better a Name, than <hi>Children of the Devil.</hi> And I have a worse Thought of this Excuse for the <hi>bad Things</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Tempers, Educations, Customs and Manners of Life, are so generally and variously affected; especially, in a State of Things so uncommon, and where the Degree, Extent, Swiftness and Power of Operation is so very extraordinary, and so new, that there has not been Time and Experience enough to give Birth to Rules for People's Conduct, and so unusual in Times past, that the Writings of Divines don't afford us Rules to direct us in such a State of Things.</q> To all which it is obvious to reply, if Multitudes of all Sorts of Persons were affected, and the Disorders to be seen, were among only a few of them, comparatively speaking, there would then be no just Occasion of Offence: But, if they prevail among <hi>Multitudes,</hi> and these Multitudes are of <hi>all Kinds of Capacities, Tempers,</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> how does the <hi>Number</hi> of Persons affected, or the <hi>Variety</hi> of their Characters, remove away the Ground of Exception? The Difficulty, in this Case, remains just the same.—Nor is the State of Things in the Land, so <hi>new</hi> and <hi>unusual,</hi> as has been said. 'Tis true, there never was such a Scene of Things before, in our Day; but there has seldom an <hi>Age</hi> past, since the Days of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> but this has been the State of Things: And the <hi>Degree, Extent, Swiftness</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Operation,</hi> has often before been as <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;</hi> yea, in all these Respects, it has been far exceeded. The <hi>Operation,</hi> its granted, has been <hi>swift;</hi> but not so swift, but <hi>Birth</hi> has, in <hi>Fact,</hi> been given to many excellent <hi>Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;</hi> which, if they had been received in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, and acted upon with the Temper of Christians, would have made these Times happy, in Compare with what they now are. And 'tis so far from being a just Remark,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:005151_0360_1018A8F90AE65438"/>
that the Writings of Divines don't afford Rules to direct in this State of Things, that they are full of them. There are no Disorders prevailing in the Land, but the most pious, and orthodox, and well-approv'd Writers have (as we may see in these Papers) expresly taken Notice of them, and laid down the wisest, and most effectual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, whether for the Prevention, or Cure of them. The same Imprudences, Irregularities, Extravagancies, or whatever other Name any may chuse to call them, which <hi>now</hi> appear among us, were <hi>common</hi> in ENGLAND, no longer ago than the <hi>last Century,</hi> lower down than the Middle of it; and they were freely wrote against by some of the best Men that were then upon the Stage, and such <hi>Cautions, Directions, Admonitions,</hi> and <hi>Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> given, as would have been effectual, if duly regarded, to have prevented much of the <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the present Day: Nay, some of the worst Things that have been complained of, were <hi>general</hi> even in this Land once before; and the <hi>Rules of Conduct</hi> then given by our <hi>Fathers,</hi> are as well suted to the <hi>present State</hi> of Things, as any could now adapt them had they ever so much Time to do it in; as may be seen in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Pages. It could not therefore be from Want of <hi>good Rules of Conduct,</hi> already prepared for the Use of People, in the Writings of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that they have been thrown into Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Only the <hi>practical Works</hi> of that <hi>single</hi> Man, Mr. BAXTER (which I heartily wish were in every Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily throughout the Country) afford every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection needful at this Day; and are the more worthy of Notice, because form'd upon long Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and Experience.—But if there were no <hi>Rules,</hi> in the <hi>Writings of Divines</hi> suted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Day, why need People "abound in Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences

            <p>It has been hinted,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 40.</note> 
               <q>That the Weakness of human Nature has always appeared in Times of great Revival of Religion, by a Disposition to run to Extremes, and get into Confusion; especially in three Things, <hi>Enthusiasm, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> and <hi>intemperate Zeal.</hi> So it appear'd in the Time of the Reformation, very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and also in the Days of the Apostles.</q> 'Tis very true, there was in the Time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, the Prevalence of <hi>Enthusiasm, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>intemperate Zeal,</hi> in all the <hi>Wildness and Extravagance,</hi> that can be conceived of: But who were the Persons among whom these Things prevailed? Were they generally the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of GOD? Those who were under the special Guidance of the HOLYGHOST? 'Tis a Dishonour to the SPIRIT of <hi>Grace</hi> to suppose such a Thing. They were rather vain Pretenders to the SPIRIT; Men, who were spiritual only in their own fond Imaginations. And so far were they from being

Instances of the Work of <hi>Reformation,</hi> that they were a Scandal to it, and the greatest Obstacle in the Way of its Progress. And the same may be said of the <hi>Times of the Apostles.</hi> There was then among those <hi>called Christians,</hi> the Appearance of Pride, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Schism, and many other evil Works. But among what <hi>Sort of Christians</hi> did these Things appear? Were they those, upon whom the HOLY GHOST had been poured out in his <hi>saving Graces?</hi> It may, perhaps, upon Trial, be found a very difficult Task to prove this. There were many, in <hi>those Days,</hi> who could claim the Character of Christians, only in <hi>Appearance</hi> and <hi>Profession;</hi> yea, among those who had the Spirit sent down upon them in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Manner, i. e. in miraculous Powers, so as that they could speak with Tongues, and shew Signs, and work Wonders: I say, even among these, there were many, concerning whom our SAVIOUR himself has said, that they shall be bid to depart away from him, at the last Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And who will venture to affirm, that the Disorders complained of, in <hi>these Days,</hi> were not prevalent, <hi>chiefly,</hi> among <hi>this Kind</hi> of Christians? There was a Number, in this and the other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, no Doubt, who were truly <hi>spiritual</hi> Men, making it evident that they were so, by their bringing forth the Fruit of the SPIRIT, in all Righteousness, and Goodness, and Truth: But at the same Time, there was a Number, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a greater Number, of meer <hi>nominal</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, puffed up with Pride, and in a Temper to be led aside either by <hi>Satan,</hi> or their own Lusts. And are not these the Persons, among whom it is most likely Disorders should prevail? Those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, which are gross, and seem to argue a Spirit unmortisied to Sin and Lust.</p>

               <pb n="316" facs="unknown:005151_0363_1018A9002BDABAF8"/>
The Language in which the inspir'd PAUL speaks of the <hi>false Teachers</hi> in this and the other Church, and those who were led aside by them, if fairly examin'd, would, I am apt to think, import thus much. And 'tis true, in Fact, (as we shall see in its proper Place) of <hi>many,</hi> in <hi>these Times</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they fell into Errors in <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> as well as <hi>Practice,</hi> inconsistent with the <hi>Being</hi> of real Christianity; and this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they had "infallible Apostles to guide and direct them, to rectify Disorders, and reclaim them when they were wandring."</p>

               <q>If the Affair be seriously weighed in its Circumstances, it will be no great Difficulty to account for it, supposing the Work, in general, to be from a great Outpour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the SPIRIT of GOD, that many have run into great Errors, and just such Errors as they have.</q> And in order to account for it,</p>
            <p>It is said,<note n="*" place="bottom">P.

in this Work were <hi>very young,</hi> and had but little Acquaintance with Divinity, and were but <hi>newly</hi> brought to a Sense of the Importance of eternal Things, they were, for these Reasons, very unfit to be employed as <hi>Instruments;</hi> and it may be feared, whether great Dishonour han't been done to the Cause of GOD, and <hi>Religion,</hi> by not checking their <hi>Forwardness</hi> to engage in the <hi>ministerial</hi> Work, for which they were so evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unqualified. 'Tis observable, the Apostle PAUL, in his Directions to TIMOTHY about intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Men into the Ministry, particularly gives such a Caution as that,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Not a</hi> NOVICE <hi>left being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> The <hi>Original</hi> Word, answering to the <hi>English</hi> one, NOVICE, is <hi>Neophuton;</hi> which properly signifies, a <hi>raw young Christian,</hi> one who has but "<hi>newly</hi> been waked out of Sleep, and had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his View, the Reality and vast Importance of spiritual Things:" And 'tis the express Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an inspir'd <hi>Apostle,</hi> that <hi>such an one</hi> should not be employ'd in the <hi>Ministry.</hi> And the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> he subjoins is very solemn and weighty, <hi>lest being puffed up with Pride, he fall into the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Devil;</hi> obviously implying that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons <hi>newly</hi> brought over to Religion, and not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instructed in it, are in great Danger, if em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as Ministers, of falling into <hi>Pride,</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Sin,</hi> and hereby exposing themselves to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> the <hi>Devil's Punishment.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> certainly judged right in this Matter.

<pb n="318" facs="unknown:005151_0365_1018A906D9040998"/>
               <hi>Newness</hi> of their Acquaintance with <hi>spiritual</hi> Things, they are <hi>young, very young in Years.</hi> It's vast Odds, whether the encouraging <hi>such Novices</hi> to act as <hi>Ministers,</hi> won't be the Means of their falling into such Mistakes, both in <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> as may be destructive to themselves, and the Interest of CHRIST too. It's <hi>natural</hi> to expect Confusion, when <hi>meer Youths</hi> in <hi>Age,</hi> as well as Christian Knowledge and Experience, are invited into the Pulpit, and admir'd for their bold and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant speaking of Things they little understand. And shall the Want of <hi>Years,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and <hi>Experience,</hi> in these Persons, be pleaded in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse for the wretched Mistakes and Follies they run into? It ought rather to be urg'd as one of the strongest Reasons, against their taking upon them the Business of the <hi>Ministry;</hi> which would, at once, prevent all this Mischief.</p>
            <p>The Plea goes on, and in <hi>Substance</hi> is thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 44, 45.</note> 
               <q>That as the Influences of the SPIRIT, upon those who have lately had Experience of them, are what they were unacquainted with, and had never felt before, its no Wonder they don't so well know how to distinguish one <hi>extraordinary new</hi> Impression from another, and so (to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves insensibly) run into <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> taking every strong Impulse to be divine. As Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of <hi>illiterate</hi> People (most of whom are in their Youth) are brought into such <hi>new,</hi> and before (to them) unheard of Circumstances, its natural to suppose they should pass wrong and strange Judgments both of Persons, and Things, beholding them in such a <hi>new Light.</hi> And as they scarce ever heard of such a Thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:005151_0366_1018A9099461AAA8"/>
as the <hi>Out pouring of the SPIRIT,</hi> or had no Notion of it, its nothing strange that they don't know how to behave themselves in such a new and strange State of Things: Nor is it unaccountable, that they should be ready to hearken to those, who have been the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>this Work,</hi> in them and others, or that they should receive every Thing they say, and drink down Error as well as Truth from them.</q> To which I would return Answer, as follows. The Influences of the SPIRIT are always <hi>new</hi> and <hi>unknown</hi> to Persons, in <hi>Experience,</hi> 'till they are the happy <hi>Subjects</hi> of them: And why should they, at this Day, be more apt to run ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally into Mistakes about them, than at other Times: The Pretence, that they are <hi>now</hi> more powerful and extraordinary, won't do; for the more powerful these Influences are, when real and from the <hi>Divine SPIRIT,</hi> the less liable Persons are to Mistakes, and the fewer of them, and of smaller Moment, they will fall into. The true Account to be given of the <hi>many</hi> and <hi>great</hi> Mistakes of the present Day, about the <hi>SPIRIT's</hi> Influence, is not the <hi>Newness</hi> of the Thing, the not having <hi>felt it before;</hi> but a <hi>notorious</hi> Error generally prevailing, as to the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of judging in this Matter. People, in order to know, whether the Influences they are under, are from the SPIRIT, don't carefully examine them by the <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> and view the <hi>Change</hi> they produce in the <hi>moral State</hi> of their <hi>Minds,</hi> and of their <hi>Lives,</hi> but hastily conclude such and such <hi>internal Motions</hi> to be <hi>divine Impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> meerly from the <hi>Perception</hi> they have of them. They are ready, at once, if this is <hi>unusual,</hi> or <hi>strong,</hi> to take it for some Influence from above, to speak of it as such, and to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:005151_0367_1018A90D9150C510"/>
This is the Error of the present Day; and 'tis indeed the <hi>proton Pseudos,</hi> the first and grand Delusion: And where this prevails, we need not be at a loss to know the <hi>true Spring</hi> of other Errors.—As to the <hi>Multitudes</hi> who are bro't into such <hi>new,</hi> and (to them) <hi>unheard of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi> 'tis true, they are <hi>illiterate,</hi> and <hi>young</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but this notwithstanding, if the <hi>Newness</hi> of their Circumstances is such as is proper to <hi>new Creatures,</hi> they will, in their <hi>general Behaviour,</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>true Spirit</hi> and <hi>Genius</hi> of this Sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. 'Tis a great Mistake to think, that the <hi>new Nature,</hi> or those <hi>Influences</hi> that produce it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever extraordinary, are apt to put Men upon making <hi>wrong</hi> and <hi>strange</hi> Judgments, either of <hi>Persons</hi> or <hi>Things:</hi> They have a contrary Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency: and 'tis a Reproach to them both, to suppose otherwise. A meer <hi>passionate</hi> Religion, 'tis true, has always led to this, and always will; but not that, which enlightens the Understanding, renews the Will, and makes the Heart good and honest.—How far 'tis a Truth, that <hi>this People</hi> have <hi>scarce</hi> heard of such a Thing as the <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT of GOD, or had <hi>no Notion</hi> of it, may admit of Dispute; but that the <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT should introduce <hi>such a State of Things,</hi> as that those <hi>upon whom</hi> he has been <hi>poured out,</hi> should <hi>not know how to behave,</hi> will, I think, admit of no good Plea in its Defence. 'Tis a plain Case, one of the <hi>main Ends</hi> of the <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT, is to dispose and enable People to behave as <hi>Christians,</hi> in their various <hi>Stations, Relations</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of Life; and if instead of this, they are thrown into such a <hi>strange State,</hi> as that they can't behave as they ought to do, not in here and there a perplext Case, but in some of the most <hi>obvious</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Points of
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:005151_0368_1018A7C9C1E175E8"/>
Practice; let who will call this an <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT, 'tis not such an one as the <hi>Bible</hi> knows any Thing of. And 'tis nothing short of a gross Reflection on the <hi>blessed SPIRIT,</hi> to speak of <hi>him</hi> as <hi>wonderfully</hi> poured out upon a People, and, at the same Time, to suppose such a State of Things arising therefrom, as that People may run into <hi>very ill Conduct,</hi> and it not be thought <hi>strange,</hi> if they do so.—What is observ'd of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's <hi>Readiness</hi> to hearken to those, who have been the <hi>Instruments</hi> of bringing them into their present Circumstances, I own, is no other than might be expected: Nor have I any Doubt, upon my Mind, whether the <hi>Disorders,</hi> so <hi>general</hi> in this Land, had their <hi>Rise</hi> from these Persons. But <hi>Schism,</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> and other <hi>evil Works,</hi> won't change their Nature, be their <hi>Origin</hi> in <hi>People</hi> themselves, or their <hi>Leaders.</hi>

            <p>It is still urged,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 45.</note> 
               <q>That when Persons are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily</hi> affected with a recent Discovery of the Greatness and Excellency of the divine Being, the Certainty and infinite Importance of eternal Things, the Preciousness of Souls, and the dreadful Danger and Madness of Mankind, together with a great Sense of GOD's distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing Kindness and Love to them; no Wonder that now they think they must exert themselves, and do something extraordinary, for the Honour of God, and the Good of Souls, and know not how to forbear speaking and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with uncommon Earnestness and Vigour.

them, 'tis a Wonder, if they don't proceed without due Caution, and do Things that are irregular, and will, in the Issue, do more Hurt than Good.</q> 'Tis readily granted, Persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a just and strong Sense of divine Things, will exert themselves with an awaken'd Activity in the Business of Religion. 'Twould be no Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if those who had <hi>extraordinary</hi> Discoveries of GOD, were, to an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Degree, filled with Lowliness and Humility, and such an Awe and Reverence of the divine Majesty, as would make them <hi>eminently</hi> circumspect in their whole Deportment towards him; if from the <hi>uncommon</hi> View they had of his Perfections, they were, in an <hi>uncommon</hi> Manner, transformed into his Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, appearing in the World <hi>lively Images</hi> of that Goodness, Righteousness, Faithfulness, Kindness, Mercy, Patience and Long-suffering, which are the <hi>moral Glory</hi> of the infinitely perfect Being. 'Twould be no Wonder, if those, who had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Minds an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Sense of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness of Souls,</hi> discovered extraordinary Care and Pains in working out the Salvation of their <hi>own Souls;</hi> if they were observably <hi>diligent</hi> in <hi>adding to their Faith, Vertue; to Vertue, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; to Knowledge, Temperance; to Temperance, Patience to Patience, Godliness; to Godliness, Brotherly-Kindness; and to Brotherly-Kindness, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: For they that lack these Things are blind</hi> to the Worth of their <hi>own Souls;</hi> whereas, they <hi>that do them</hi> make it evident that they regard their Souls: <hi>For so an Entrance shall be ministred to them abundantly, into the everlasting Kingdom of our</hi> LORD <hi>and</hi> SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.

those who neglect their Souls, were <hi>proportionably</hi> active, within their <hi>proper Sphere,</hi> in Endeavours to do them all the Service they could; if they were ready with their Advice, their Counsel, their Prayers, their Intreaties, to beget in them a just Concern about Salvation: Nor would they be "worthy of <hi>Indignation,</hi> and be beyond <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi>" if, through an <hi>indiscreet Zeal</hi> they should, now and then, be betray'd into Weaknesses and Excesses.

But the Wonder is, how an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Discovery of the Greatness and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, the Importance of eternal Things, and the Preciousness of Souls, and the Danger of their perishing, should make Men vain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, full of themselves, and apt to throw Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on others; how it should loosen Men's Tongues to utter such Language as would not be seemly, even in those who profess no Sense of GOD, or divine Things; how it should lead them into wrong Sentiments in Religion, blind their Eyes as to some of the most plain Points of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and in a Word, dispose them to such Things as are called in Scripture, the <hi>Works of the Flesh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These don't look like the Fruit of <hi>extraordinary</hi> Discoveries of GOD; but they are the very Things which may be expected, where Men's <hi>Passions</hi> are rais'd to an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Height, without a proportionable Degree of Light in their Understandings.</p>
            <p>Such <hi>high Affections,</hi> I know, are freely spoken of as owing to the Influence of the SPIRIT of GOD; and this, when there is not given <q>

The Government of a <hi>sanctified Understanding:</hi> And 'till this is effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may be called <hi>New-Creatures,</hi> but they are far from deserving this Character. <hi>Reasonable</hi> Beings are not to be guided by <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> though the Object of it should be GOD, and the Things of another World: They need, even in this Case, to be under the Government of a <hi>well instructed Judgment:</hi> Nay, when Men's <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> are raised to an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Height, if they have not, at the same Time, a due Ballance of have and <hi>Knowledge</hi> in their Minds, they are so far from being in a more desirable State on this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

are liable to be hurried into it; there is no Temptation. but they are expos'd to be drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by it: Nor has the Devil ever greater Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against them, to make a Prey of them, and lead them captive at his Will. And this has often been verified by sad Experience. Who can boast of greater Transports of Affection, than the wildest Enthusiasts?

                  <p>Observable to this Purpose is the following Story, in the Book entitled, <hi>The Frauds of the Romish Monks, and Priests, set forth in eight Letters.</hi> The Author speaking of a particular Sort of Romish Missionaries mostly <hi>Capuchins,</hi> tells us, that <q>after they have furnished themselves with a good Stock of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon different Subjects, they send to ROME and demand a Mission from the POPE; that is, leave to go and preach their Sermons in certain Towns and Provinces.—The full, saith he, that ever I saw of this Sort, was at MONTEFIASCON, two Days Journey and an half from ROME. These were <hi>Capuchins,</hi> who, besides their Habit which was very odd and antick, with their great Beards, had on their Heads great red <hi>Calots,</hi> or <hi>these Caps</hi> to <hi>signify their Zeal, and the red hot A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I entred the Church where I saw one of them in the Pulpit, with a great Rope or Cord about his Neck, and a Crucifix in his Arms, who did his utmost Endeavour, to excite sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Affections in the Hearts of his Auditors. The chief Aim of these Preachers is to <hi>make the People weep;</hi> if they can once effect this they are happy, and this is all they desire; for this procures them the Reputation of being great Missionaries, and Men of a truly <hi>apostolick Spirit.</hi> To this End they make Use of the most tender melting and affectionate Expressions they can think of, to draw Tears from their Hearers.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The Preacher I heard at this Time, was paraphras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the History of the Passion of our SAVIOUR, and after he had employ'd his utmost Skill in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth our SAVIOUR as the most lovely, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of Men; he on the other Hand represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed those pitiless Tormentors, who with great Cords tied his fair Hands, white as the driven Snow, and beat his lovely Countenance where the Lilly and the Rose did urge for Mastery. He added to all these Expressions a most lamentable and affecting Tone, with Gestures very proper, and according to the Subject. I perceived that this Father was an excellent Declaimer, when on a sudden some good Women wholly melted into Tenderness and Compassion (as were those Women of JERUSA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM, who wept seeing JESUS CHRIST carrying his Cross to Mount CALVARY, and whom out SAVIOUR bad not to weep for him, but for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) caus'd their Sighs to be heard aloud; and a few Minutes after, all that Quarter where the Women sat, being all in Tears, the Emotion soon caught amongst the Men also; so that the whole Church was filled with Groans, Sighs and Sobs. Whereupon, the <hi>Capuchin</hi> resolved to prosecute his Conquest, cast himself down upon his Knees, and fixing his great Crucifix upon the Pulpit, he lifted up both his Hands to Heaven; and with a mournful and terrible Voice, twisting the Cord about his Neck as if he had a Mind to strangle himself, he cried out, <hi>Mercy, Mercy;</hi> and continued in the same Manner to repeat the same Word about 40 or 50 Times, 'till he had made all his Auditory cry so after him. Then there was a most dreadful Noise heard in the Church, which continued for a good Quarter of an Hour, 'till their Breaths being spent, the Noise began to lessen by Degrees, and at last ended in Silence; which gave Occasion to the Father to resume his Discourse, which he continued with the same tender Affections to the End.</q> Vid. Vol. 1. Page 261. This Author says of himself, <q>That he was once a <hi>secular Priest</hi> in the Church of ROME.</q> Vid. Pres. 5th Edit. printed 1725.</p>
                  <p>He adds to what is before said, <q>I don't pretend in the least to blame here the Sensibleness and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of Men's Hearts, with Respect to our SAVIOUR'S <hi>Passion;</hi> I am so far from that, that I wish it were in my Power to make a most deep Impression thereof in the Hearts of all Men: But withal, this shall never hinder me from owning, that these Affections do ordinarily pass away like Lightning; and that good solid Motives laid down in a Sermon, to engage People to a truly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Life, make a longer Stay in a Man's Mind, and are there ready upon Occasion to move the Will; and this is what <hi>these Missionaries wholly neglect.</hi> Accordingly we don't find that the <hi>Italians</hi> (after all these Missions) are yet a whit the better Men.</q>

                  <p>I have the rather inserted this Account, because agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to another I receiv'd, some Time ago, from a Gentleman in NEW-ENGLAND, known to many among us, and of an establish'd Reputation; who being in a <hi>Romish</hi> Country, went from the high Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he had given him of a certain <hi>dignified</hi> Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Man to hear him preach. He observ'd there was a beautiful <hi>Image</hi> of our SAVIOUR <hi>hanging on the Cross,</hi> near the Desk. He could not at first tell the Use of it; but presently saw how very serviceable it was; for as the Gentleman was preaching, though what he said was in <hi>Latin</hi> (a Language unknown to most of the Assembly); yet by the rapturous Manner in which he hug'd and kiss'd the Image, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was thrown into a general Scream; and when he had several Times produced this Effect by repeating this farce, the People were dismiss, no doubt, greatly edified.</p>

The 
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:005151_0374_1016C834B621E518"/>
plain Truth is, an <hi>enlightened Mind,</hi> and not <hi>rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Affections,</hi> ought always to be the Guide of those who call themselves Men; and this, in the Affairs of Religion, as well as other Things: And it will be so, where GOD really works on their Hearts, by his SPIRIT. 'Tis true, "the End of 
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:005151_0375_1016C838691E4A78"/>
the Influence of the SPIRIT of GOD is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease Men's natural Capacities:" But 'tis to fit their Powers for religious Exercise, and preserve them in a State of due Subordination. 'Tis as much intended to <hi>open the Understanding,</hi> as to <hi>warm the Affections;</hi> and not only so, but to keep the <hi>Passions</hi> within their proper Bounds, restraining them from usurping Dominion over the <hi>reasonable</hi> Nature. 'Tis true likewise, "GOD has not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd himself immediately to increase <hi>civil Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> in Proportion to the Degrees of <hi>spiritual Light."</hi> But if it shall please GOD to visit Men with the Influences of his SPIRIT, it may justly be expected, that he should increase their <hi>moral</hi>
               <pb n="329" facs="unknown:005151_0376_1016C83AC1AB0468"/>
or <hi>religious</hi> Prudence; that, if he should give them <hi>spiritual Light,</hi> it should be for their Instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Knowledge of what is <hi>Sin,</hi> and what is <hi>Duty:</hi> Nor can it be supposed, that those who are favoured with <hi>extraordinary</hi> Measures of Light from the SPIRIT of GOD, should be in <hi>gross Darkness</hi> as to the Knowledge of some of the most <hi>important</hi> Points of Christian Practice: Which yet, may be truly said of many in these Days; unless they are allow'd to be under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>vitiated Will,</hi> which is much worse.</p>
            <p>But besides what has been offered in Excuse of the Errors of the present Day, from Man and his Infirmity, it is further observ'd, that if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 49.</note> "in Respect of GOD, and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Permission, they are not strange, supposing the Work, as to the Substance of it, to be his." To which, nothing more need be said than only this, that these Errors are as easily to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, in Respect of the blessed GOD, supposing they are as <hi>many,</hi> and as <hi>great,</hi> as any have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them to be. The holy GOD may have wise Ends in suffering such a Scene of Disorder to take Place in the Land."</p>
            <p>If he intended it as a <hi>Punishment,</hi> 'tis no more than we justly deserve: Nor is it a Punishment different in <hi>Kind,</hi> from what other professing, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People have, often before, been visited with. False Pretensions to <hi>extraordinary</hi> Communications from the SPIRIT; over-heated Imaginations; vain Boastings of high Degrees of Sanctity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond other Men; Contempt of the standing Ministry; Animosities, Contentions, Schisms and
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:005151_0377_1016C83C5516BE20"/>
Separations, have often been the Scourges of GOD upon sinful <hi>Churches.</hi> No new, nor strange Thing has happen'd to us:—It has been a <hi>frequent Dispensation,</hi> in GOD's righteous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World.</p>
            <p>And the Dispensation is such, as is capable, in the Wisdom of GOD, of being over-rul'd to great spiritual Advantage. Hereby Occasion has been given for great Talk about Religion; and many by this Means, may have been brought into an Acquaintance with it, who might otherwise never have made any Enquiries about it.—Hereby Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion has been given for the setting forth some of the great Truths of the Gospel, in a clearer and stronger Light, than might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if it had not been for such Errors.—Hereby Occasion has been given for many to look more critically into the Ground of their Hope, than they might have done, if it had not been for that Spirit of <hi>rash Judging,</hi> which has been so generally prevalent.—Hereby Occasion has been given for an eminent Display of many Christian Graces, in those who have been reviled, and had all Manner of Evil salsly spoken against them, for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness Sake; and by the frequent Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have had for the Exercise of these Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they may have been more firmly rooted and fixed in them. In a Word, hereby Occasion has been given for a more particular and faithful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to Multitudes of Persons, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of CHRIST, both in <hi>public</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> than otherwise there might have been Opportunity for; which may, in Time, appear in the Fruits of Righteousness.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="331" facs="unknown:005151_0378_1016C83EE953AE70"/>
But whatever the Aim of GOD might be, in the <hi>Permission</hi> of these <hi>evil Things;</hi> or, whatever Good they may be capable of being over-rul'd to; there is no Unrighteousness with him. Clouds and Darkness may be about him, but Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne. His Mercy is in the Heavens, and his Faithfulness reacheth to the Clouds. His Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness is like the great Mountains, and his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are a great Deep.</p>
            <p>In fine, 'tis remark'd, in Excuse for these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 50, 52.</note> 
               <q>That we have no Cause to wonder at them, if we consider them, with Regard to the Hand of <hi>Satan;</hi> who, because the <hi>Out-pouring</hi> of the SPIRIT is <hi>greater,</hi> than has ever been in NEW-ENGLAND, is now alarm'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and exerts himself more powerfully to tempt and mislead those, who are the <hi>Subjects</hi> it, or it's <hi>Promoters.</hi>
               </q> Whatever may be the Reason, 'tis generally believed, <hi>Satan</hi> has been very busy in these Times.

us, it ought not to be wondered at, when these are so <hi>many,</hi> and of such <hi>dangerous</hi> Tendency (as has been largely represented), if there are those who think they shall serve CHRIST, while they <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> the Devil, in doing what they can to give Check to such <hi>Disorders,</hi> and in opening the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations</hi> all are under to do so; which is the <hi>next</hi> Part of the Work I have undertaken.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have purposely omitted taking Notice of the large Description, which has been given of <hi>the Work of GOD</hi> said to be going on in the <hi>Land;</hi> partly, because the whole of what has been hitherto offer'd, may be look'd upon as a <hi>just Correction</hi> of the <hi>Excesses</hi> of it; but <hi>principally,</hi> because 'tis little else (excepting the 16 Pages which are taken up with the Character of a <hi>single Person,</hi> who yet was not an Instance of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> in these Times) but a Repetition of the Account before publish'd to the World, which has lately receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Answer,</hi> and particularly upon this Head.

            <head>Representing the Obligations which lie upon the Pastors of these Churches in particular, and upon all in general, to use their Endeavours to suppress the Disorders prevailing in the Land; with the great Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their Neglect in so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Matter.</head>
            <p>WERE the <hi>bad Things,</hi> accompanying the present <hi>religious Commotion,</hi> no other than a <hi>few accidental Imprudences,</hi> it would not be worth while to expend much Pains to guard People against them: Neither would it look like Friendship to the Cause of CHRIST, if any were "abundant in insisting on, and setting forth such Blemishes;" especially, if it were so done as to "manifest that they chose rather, and were more forward, to take Notice of what is amiss, than what is good and glorious." But the Case is
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:005151_0381_1016C847918002D0"/>
widely different, when the Disorders, which may justly be complained of, are <hi>generally prevalent,</hi> and such as tend to the Destruction of <hi>Peace,</hi> with <hi>Truth and Holiness.</hi> And as this is the real State of Things in the Land, at this Day, (if any Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit is due to the foregoing Pages) 'tis certainly Time, high Time, to appear openly and boldly for GOD, and lay ourselves out to the utmost, in all proper Ways, to give Check, if possible, to the Irregularities, which have so mingled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Religion, as to "eclipse the Glory of it, and beget Jealousies and ill Thoughts in the Minds of many, about the whole of it."</p>
            <p>The <hi>Obligations</hi> to this are solemn and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And they are binding upon the <hi>Pastors of these Churches</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> and upon <hi>all</hi> in <hi>general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We, who have been made <hi>Overseers</hi> of the <hi>Flocks</hi> in this Land, are <hi>peculiarly</hi> oblig'd to use our Endeavours, in all <hi>sutable</hi> Ways, within our <hi>proper Sphere,</hi> to suppress <hi>these Disorders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to CHRIST requires this of us. We are his Servants by <hi>Office:</hi> And our Business, as such, properly lies, in doing all we can to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Interest of his Kingdom. This is what we have been called to, and set apart for: And the Vows of GOD are upon us; and wo be unto us, if we are unfaithful! And is this a Charge we shall be able wholly to escape the Guilt of, if we can behold the <hi>Rise</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi> in Opposition to the <hi>Truth as it in JESUS;</hi> and the <hi>general Spread</hi> of <hi>Disorders,</hi> in various Kinds, in Contradiction to the plain Precepts of the <hi>Gospel;</hi> and yet sit still, and hold our Peace? Who will stand up for CHRIST, if we don't? Who
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:005151_0382_1016C84925198348"/>
are called hereto, if not his <hi>authorised Officers?</hi> This Matter <hi>belongeth to us.</hi> 'Tis the proper Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Station; and we shall neglect our Duty, and be faithless to the Charge committed to us, if we are <hi>meer Lookers on,</hi> and insert not ourselves in the Cause of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> which is the Cause of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we shall do well to cease <hi>from Strife about Words to no Profit:</hi> And as for <hi>foolish and unlearned Questions,</hi> they ought to be <hi>avoided,</hi> lest they <hi>increase to more Ungodliness.</hi> But when the <hi>Order of the Gospel</hi> is openly broke in upon; the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi> grosly misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, to the <hi>subverting of Souls;</hi> and many evil Practices, in Consequence hereof, are <hi>generally</hi> gone into: I say, when this is the Case, where is our <hi>Fidelity</hi> to our MASTER and LORD, if we stand by unconcerned? Or, what is as bad, if we fold our Hands together, and do nothing?

An't we very <hi>Cowards</hi> in the Cause of CHRIST? Don't we discover a Want of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness towards him, who has put us into the Ministry?</p>
            <p>We may preach often, and profess a great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> and have it perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in our Mouths; but if, at such a Day as this, when <hi>Error</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, and Practice,</hi> covers the Face of the Land, we are silent about the Matter, or mention it only after such a Manner, as to make it evident we are not in earnest in what we say, how can we be any other than cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably defective in our Duty to CHRIST? 'Tis for the Honour of his Name, and the Interest of his Kingdom that we cry aloud and spare not. The Errors of the Times are not <hi>speculative Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> nor Matters of <hi>doubtful Disputation,</hi> but evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Breaches upon the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Rule of Duty,</hi> and in Instances of high Importance. The Gospel severely testifies against them, and Faithfulness to the REDEEMER should put <hi>his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> upon doing so likewise.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to our <hi>People</hi> as well as CHRIST obliges to this. The Oversight of them has been committed to our Charge; and we have so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engag'd before GOD, and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, <hi>who shall judge the quick, and the Dead, at

his Appearing, and his Kingdom,</hi> not only to <hi>preach the Word</hi> to them, being <hi>instant in Season, and out of Season;</hi> but to <hi>reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all Long-suffering and Doctrine.</hi> And how shall we be able to fulfill this Engagement, if, when the <hi>Time is come that they will not endure sound Doctrine, but after their own. Lusts heap to themselves Teachers, having itching Ears, and turn away their Ears from the Truth, and are turned unto Fables:</hi> I say, how shall we approve ourselves faithful, if we are <hi>now</hi> wanting in our Care to warn them of their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and put them under the Guard of heedful Caution? When can we more seasonably, or pertinently, apply to our People for their <hi>Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Admonition</hi> and <hi>Rebuke,</hi> than at a Time when they are either led into <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Delusion,</hi> or are in Hazard of being so? We are set as <hi>Watchmen</hi> to our Churches; and whose Business is it to espy Danger, and give Warning, if not our's? Or, if, when we see Danger, we neglect to give Warning where is our Faithfulness? We are called <hi>Shepherds;</hi> and shall we behave as such, if, when the <hi>Wolf</hi> comes to devour the Flock, we don't <hi>watch in all Things</hi> that we may be their Defence? Or, if they should wander out of the Path of Truth and Holiness, we don't use our Endeavours to reduce and bring them back?</p>

We may think it enough, if we preach good Doctrine, and are laborious therein; <q>but, at such a Day as this, if we don't shew to our People a hearty Disaffection to the <hi>abounding Disorders</hi> in the Land, but seem rather doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and suspicious of their <hi>evil Tendency,</hi> we shall probably be the Occasion of <hi>Hurt</hi> instead of <hi>Good.</hi>
               </q> People will take Advantage from what they observe in us, and be likely to make an ill Use of it: Nor would it be any Wonder, if, through the Subtilty of Satan, they should be led into Error. <q>We, who are in the <hi>sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> had Need to take Heed what we do, and how we behave at this Time. A less Thing in a Minister will encourage <hi>Disorders</hi> than in other Men. If we are silent, or say but little, in our publick Prayers and Preachings, about the <hi>bad Spirit</hi> appearing in so <hi>many evil Effects,</hi> or seem carefully to avoid speaking of it in <hi>Conversation,</hi> it will, and justly may, be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by our People, that we, who are their <hi>Guides,</hi> and to whom they are to have their Eye for spiritual Instruction, have no ill Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; and this will tend to produce the same Sentiments in them, and what may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, as the Consequence, but the Increase of Confusion?</q> And may it not be feared, that the <hi>Extravagancies,</hi> which are <hi>now</hi> so <hi>general</hi> are very much owing to the want of <hi>ministerial Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> in testifying against them, in Time? Are there none of the <hi>Pastors of these Churches,</hi> who, instead of condemning the Things that were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hurtful to the Cause of CHRIST, have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Behalf? Or, at lest, palliated and excused them? Nay, have none daubed and flattered, beyond all Measure, the known Promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the worst, Things prevailing in the Land?
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:005151_0387_1016C855FB4F9418"/>
And is it any other than might be expected, when this has been their conduct, that the People should be thrown into such a State of <hi>Disorder?</hi> Had we, who are intrusted with the Care of Souls, been generally careful, in the Beginning of these Times, to point out the Things that were amiss; and had we, upon their <hi>first</hi> Appearance, used our faithful Endeavours to discourage their Growth, we should have seen, I doubt not, a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Face of Things: And if we would now give Check to the <hi>Evils,</hi> which have gain'd Strength by being let too much alone, it must be by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out boldly, and speaking plainly. And is it not Time to do so? There are few of our Churches, but <hi>Disorders</hi> are to be seen in them: And as to some of them, are they not broke to Pieces with Strife and Schism? Were ever poor Churches in a State of more doleful Confusion? And shall we still remain silent? <hi>Faithfulness</hi> to our <hi>People</hi> calls upon us to stir up our selves, no longer standing by as <hi>idle Spectators,</hi> nor yet <hi>halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> betwixt two.</p>
            <p>And this is what we are <hi>further obliged</hi> to, from the <hi>Example</hi> of those <hi>holy Men of GOD,</hi> who have gone before us in a bold an d open Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against the like <hi>evil Things</hi> in their Day, which appear in our's. Soon after the Settlement of this Country, there was (as we have already seen) the Rise of a <hi>Spirit</hi> very like to <hi>that</hi> which now prevails: And it occasioned like <hi>Disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to the Churches. And what was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, our <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>Ministry,</hi> took for the Preservation of Religion, in a Time of such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders? Were they afraid to speak freely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them? Were they dispos'd to make a meer nothing of them? Did they strengthen the
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:005151_0388_1016C8579FF92A58"/>
Hands of those who fomented them, by sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing undue Honour to them? So far from it, that they did, in all the Ways they could devise, lay themselves out to put a Stop to the Growth of them. They pray'd and preach'd against the Errors of their Day; they privately convers'd with the <hi>Opinionists,</hi> using their best Endeavours to enlighten and convince them; they consulted with one another and with their Churches; and at length, there was a <hi>general Assembly</hi> of all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Province,</hi> by their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates,</hi> who not only declared to the World their <hi>Disapprobation</hi> of these Errors, but laboured to show the People that they were <hi>Errors,</hi> by the Light of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>"And when the <hi>same Spirit,</hi> which now troubles us, appear'd in ENGLAND the last Century, what was the Behaviour of those who were esteemed the most pious, and eminently faithful Ministers of CHRIST? Why, they lifted up their Voice like a Trumpet, testifying against the <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> which was crumbling the Church into numberless Sects, and threatning to over-run the Nation. Many now approv'd themselves <hi>Champions</hi> for the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> of GOD; and their Names, on this Account, have been handed down to Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity with Honour. There has not appear'd among <hi>us</hi> any Error in Principle, any Wildness in Imagination, any Indecency in Language, any Irregularity in Practice, but we might have learn'd how to testify against it, from what they, in Faithfulness to CHRIST, and the Souls of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have left in their Writings."</p>
            <p>And the same Method was taken by the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> when <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> began to

For there are many of the Brethren, who, when they did not know <hi>what Kind of Men these were,</hi> thought whatever was said against them, was too harsh and bitter: But now, when <hi>their Flocks begun to be destroyed by them,</hi> they then, by Letters and Cries, have called upon us, confessing those Things to be more than true, which before they had heard.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am sensible, these were but frail fallible Men, even the best of them, and not worthy, on that Account, to be set up as perfect Patterns: Nor are we obliged, by an implicit Faith, to do as they did. I therefore go on to observe,</p>
            <p>That this Conduct of theirs, was the very same, the <hi>inspir'd Apostles</hi> went into, upon the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Irregularities</hi> in their Day. This is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly evident, in what we find recorded of the <hi>Practice</hi> of the great St. PAUL. There never was a more bold and faithful Servant of JESUS CHRIST. He readily ventured his Name, his Interest, his Life, in bearing Testimony against every Thing that reflected Disgrace on the Gospel, and tended
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:005151_0392_1016C865692080E0"/>
to introduce Disorder and Confusion into the Church.</p>
            <p>When the Christians at CORINTH, had got into Parties, some crying up one Minister; others, another, to the Disturbance of the common Peace; what is the Behaviour of the Apostle? Does he say a Word that might give Encouragement to this <hi>Party</hi> Spirit? Does he stand by as a silent Spectator of the <hi>Envying,</hi> and <hi>Strife,</hi> and <hi>Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that were among them? So far from it, that he severely chastises their Ignorance; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully points their View to the true Source of these Disorders, the undue Prevalence of <hi>carnal Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> and solemnly gives it in Charge to them, <hi>Not to glory in Men.</hi>

Does he lead them into a Consideration of such Instances of rash Judging as might be met with in Scripture, to reconcile this Practice of their's with the Truth of a <hi>Work of GOD</hi> in their Hearts?

            <p>But besides the Danger in Respect of ourselves, great will be the Danger of <hi>our Churches,</hi> if we don't faithfully warn them.

            <p>The Churches in this Land, upwards of an Hundred Years ago, were almost ruined with their religious Disturbances.

And in the <hi>English</hi> Nation, no longer ago than the last Century, to what a monstrous Degree did Error, Faction and Confusion prevail, in a little Time? Says Mr. BAXTER, in the <hi>Dedication</hi> of his <hi>Saints everlasting Rest</hi> to the People of his Charge, <q>Do not your Hearts bleed to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the State of ENGLAND? And to think how few Towns or Cities there be (where is any Forwardness in Religion) that are not cut into Shreds, and crumbled as to Dust, by Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and Divisions? To think what a Wound we have hereby given to the very Christian Name? To think how we have har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd the ignorant, confirm'd the doubting? And are our selves become the Scorn of our Enemies, and the Grief of our Friends? And how many of our dearest, best esteemed Friends are fallen to notorious Pride, or Impiety; yea, some to be worse than open Infidels? These are <hi>Pillars of Salt:</hi> See that you remember them.</q> Yet more observable to our Purpose, are the Words of Mr. EDWARDS, in his Address to <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> assembled in <hi>Parliament</hi>

               <q>Things now are grown to a strange Pass (tho' nothing is now strange) and every Day they grow worse and worse, and you can hardly conceive and imagine them so bad as they are. No Kind of Blasphemy, Heresy, Disorder, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, but is found among us, or a coming in upon us: For we, instead of a <hi>Reformation,</hi> are grown from one Extreme to another, fallen from <hi>Scylla</hi> to <hi>Charibdis,</hi> from popish Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

and Superstitions to damnable Heresies, horrid Blasphemies, Libertinism and fearful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. Our Evils are not removed and cured, but only changed; one Disease and Devil hath left us, and another as bad is come in the room; yea, this last Extremity, into which we are fallen, is far more high, violent and dangerous in many Respects.—You have most noble <hi>Senators,</hi> done worthily against <hi>Papists,—</hi> you have made a Reformation; but with the <hi>Reformation</hi> have we not a <hi>Deformation,</hi> and worse Things come in upon us than any we ever had before?—Many among us have put down the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> slighting, yea, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming them.

and the Rejoicing of the common Enemy? The Scandal of the weak, and the blazing-Star of the Times?</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Book</hi> to which these Passages are prefixt, we are presented with a most awful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Power of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> in such Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Wildness,</hi> both in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> as are enough to make one stand aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish'd. No less than 172 <hi>Errors</hi> in <hi>Doctrine</hi> are particularly noted down, with many <hi>blasphemous Speeches,</hi> and <hi>strange Actions;</hi> all which, there is Reason to think, are Charges justly made against these Times: And they bespeak the dangerous State of the Churches, when Men's Passions are over-heated, and, as the Effect hereof, Disorders begin to make Discovery of themselves in one Place and another.</p>
            <p>I might go on and shew, that, in the Times of the <hi>first Reformers,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Error</hi> wrought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter just the same Manner; proceeding from one Thing to another, 'till it had deluded Multitudes with <hi>extatic Raptures, Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations;</hi> and, at last, prepared them, by <hi>false</hi> and <hi>danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles</hi> in Religion, for <hi>Actions</hi> grosly <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and <hi>carnal.</hi>—But I forbear; and only add,</p>

               <hi>false Teachers</hi> to the very <hi>Apostles;</hi> yea, they were, at length, brought to entertain such Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices against them, as actually to withdraw Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, both from them, and the <hi>Churches</hi> under their Inspection. THEY WENT OUT FROM US, says the Apostle JOHN.<note n="§" place="bottom">I John 2. 10.</note> And <hi>these are they,</hi> as JUDE expresses it,<note n="†" place="bottom">Verse 19.</note> WHO SEPARATE THEMSELVES.

The <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> began to work, while the <hi>Apostles</hi> were yet alive.—<hi>Damnable Heresies</hi> were broach'd in their Day;—the main Doctrines of Christianity, either wholly denied, or explained away, or so corrupted with <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Mixtures, as that they were removed from the Religion of CHRIST to another Gospel. The <hi>Doctrines of Grace</hi> were abus'd then, as they have been since, into an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of LASCIVIOUSNESS;—yea, the <hi>Quakerish</hi> Notion of <hi>sinless Perfection</hi> began to take Place, in those Days, and almost every other bad <hi>Tenet,</hi> or <hi>disorderly Practice,</hi> which has plagued the Church of GOD, in other Ages.</p>

We may see, from these Hints, the pernicious Tendency of <hi>Delusion,</hi> and what a sad Effect it has on the Well-Being of the Church. And can it then be too carefully guarded against? 'Tis true, it may do a great Deal of Mischief, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our most faithful Endeavours to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it. It has often made sad Havock in the World, as we have seen. But how much more fatal would have been its Influence, if it had not been restrained and check'd? What would have become of the poor <hi>Church</hi> of GOD, if it had not been for the faithful Care of the <hi>Apostles</hi> in their Day, and of other eminent Servants of CHRIST in their's, to guard People against the Infection of it? This, under GOD, is the only Way to stop its Progress. And shall we, who are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, let it alone to take its Course? What can be more dangerous to the Churches? How should it be, but they should be filled with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion? And can we suffer our selves to sit still, and not exert our selves to prevent the coming on of such a State of Things? We are oblig'd to nothing, if not to the Use of our most faithful Endeavours for the Preservation of our Churches, when in such Danger.</p>
            <p>These now are the <hi>Obligations,</hi> we are under to appear against the <hi>Disorders</hi> of the Times: They are thus solemn and weighty. And yet, what little Influence have they had upon those, from whom better Things might have been expected, in such a Day as this? What a strange Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness have some, in the Ministry, discovered to speak plainly and freely, in the Cause of Truth and Holiness? How ready have they been to excuse themselves? How easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:005151_0403_1016C87CDDD9C110"/>
to Silence, upon one Consideration or another?—</p>
            <p>Some have been <hi>unsettled</hi> in their Thoughts, not knowing what Judgment to make about the State of Things in the Land. This was, at first, I believe, the real Truth of the Case, as to many; and to this it might be owing, they said so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, either one Way, or 'tother. But they have now had sufficient Opportunity to form their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And 'tis indeed high Time, for all to <hi>know their own Minds,</hi> and act <hi>steadily</hi> according to some <hi>fixt</hi> Principles or other. Nor may it be supposed there are any, unless such as are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently carried away with their Imaginations, but must be convinced there have been <hi>horrid Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies</hi> acted in the Land: And however they behave in other Things, can they be excus'd, if they don't con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>emn these, and endeavour in all proper Ways to guard People against the bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them, whether on the right Hand, or the left?</p>
            <p>Some, I doubt not, would have appeared against the <hi>Irregularities</hi> of the Times, but that they were fearful, lest, if they spake against what was <hi>bad,</hi> they should discourage what was <hi>good.</hi> They saw the coming on of some Things they could not but disapprove, yet dare not express, their Sentiments with Freedom lest they should <hi>damp</hi> the <hi>good Work,</hi> they were in Hopes GOD was beginning to carry on in the Land. This was, at first, the true Reason, and may be so still, in Respect of some, why they have said and done so little, to the Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even of such Things as they would be glad were suppressed. But 'tis certainly an Error they have fallen into. For how shall Religion
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:005151_0404_1016C87E744CE698"/>
suffer by pointing out such Things as are <hi>real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil,</hi> and endeavouring in reasonable Ways to give Check to them? 'Tis true, the most Christian Methods of Conduct may be abused by the Lusts of Men, and made an Occasion of Sin: But if this is a good Reason, why we should sit still, and do nothing for the Suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Disorders,</hi> we may, for the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be excus'd from ever exerting our selves in the Cause of GOD; for we can neither say, or do any Thing, but it may be turn'd to an ill Use. The only Question is, whether 'tis not <hi>reasonable,</hi> when Disorders arise, all sutable Care should be taken for the Suppression of them? And if it is, the Fear lest an ill Improvement should be made of our <hi>faithful</hi> Endeavours to this End, is no sufficient Excuse for the Non Use of them. This indeed should make us cautious; putting us upon our Guard against all Methods of acting, but such as are just, and wise, and good: And while <hi>these</hi> are the only ones we use, we are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in the Way of our Duty: And as there is no other Way prescribed by the <hi>Law of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity</hi> to keep Things from running into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; so neither will any other be effectual to this Purpose: And we have seen enough, one would think, fully to satisfy us of this. What has been gain'd by <hi>Silence,</hi> and doing nothing? Has Religion been at all served? Have Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders abated? Have they not rather increased? Han't they spread themselves all over the Land, and got such Head as to defie Opposition? Han't they broke many of our Churches to Pieces, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most dreadful Shock to the Interest of CHRIST in them? And will any be still afraid to rise up against them?

the <hi>working of Satan,</hi> or <hi>Men's own Lusts,</hi> and faithfully testifying against it, has, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, been a Means of giving the <hi>Devil</hi> as great an Advantage over us, as any one Thing in these Times: Nor unless it be taken out of his Hands, may we expect but that he will baffle us in all our other Attempts.</p>
            <p>Some, again, have been restrained from speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through that <hi>Fear of Man which bringeth a Snare.</hi> And, if I may be free to declare my Thoughts, this I take to have been the great <hi>Fault</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in these Days. Have we not too generally conniv'd at some Things, we were clearly, satisfied were much amiss? Han't we betray'd a Want of Courage openly to speak our Mind, and make a Stand, in Time, against that which has prov'd very mischievous? Some, it may be, were afraid of hurting their Usefulness among their People, and upon this Account kept their Thoughts to themselves, instead of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating them for the Good of their Flocks; not having Faith enough to leave the Affair of their further Serviceableness with their <hi>Master</hi> and LORD.—Some, perhaps, may have been under an undue Influence, thro' Fear of a Removal from their People, and being turn'd out into the wide World, without the Prospect of any Means for the Support of themselves and Families; not duly considering, that their <hi>heavenly Father fced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Fowls of the Air,</hi> and that he has taught them to argue herefrom, <hi>are not ye much better than they?</hi>—Others might be too much in Fear of the Breath of frail, fallible, mortal Man.

            <p>And 'tis remarkable, the Slanders which have been cast upon such as have ventured openly to stand up for the <hi>Truths,</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of CHRIST, at this Day, are the very same, for Kind, with those which have been thrown upon the <hi>like Discourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> and <hi>Disorder,</hi> in all Ages of the Church.

               <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves were spoken of with great Contempt, by some bold Pretenders to Religion, in those primitive Times.

            <p>Let me add here two or three Things from Mr. BAXTER, well worthy the serious Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such of us, as may over-value the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> or <hi>Censure</hi> of Man, and herefrom be under Temptation to fall into the base Sin of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Consider, says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 1. of <hi>his Works,</hi> P. 176. and onwards.</note> what a Slavery you chuse when you thus make your selves the Servants of every Man, whose Censures you fear, and whose Approbation you are ambitious of. What a Task have <hi>Man-pleasers?</hi> How needlesly do they enthrall themselves? They have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Masters as Beholders! No Wonder, if it take them off from the Service of GOD.—Remember, what a pitiful Reward you seek. O miserable Reward! The Thought and Breath of mortal Men! instead of GOD, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Heaven, this is their Reward!—If nothing else will cure this Disease, at lest let the Impossibility of pleasing Men, and attaining
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:005151_0411_1016C88FF7CE6468"/>
your Ends, suffice against so fruitless an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And here I shall shew you, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible it is, or, at lest, a Thing which you cannot reasonably expect. (1.) Remember, what a Multitude you have to please, and when you have pleased some, how many more will be still unpleased, and how many dipleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when you have done your best.—(2.) You will have many <hi>factious Zealots</hi> to please, who are ruled by the Interest of an <hi>Opinion</hi> or a <hi>Sect;</hi> and those will never be pleased, unless you will be one of their <hi>Side</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> and conform your self to their <hi>Opinions.</hi> If you be not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them,</hi> but set yourselves to <hi>reconcile the Differences</hi> in the Church, they will hate you as not promoting their Opinions.—If you will be <hi>Neuters,</hi> you shall be us'd as Enemies. If you be never so much for CHRIST, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and common Truth, all is nothing, unless you be also <hi>for them,</hi> and their <hi>Conceits.</hi> (3.) You have Men of great <hi>Mutability</hi> to please: That may one Hour be ready to worship you as <hi>Gods,</hi> and the next to stone you, or account you as <hi>Devils;</hi> as they did by PAUL and CHRIST himself. What a Weather-Cock is the Mind of Man? especially, of the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and the <hi>Temporanious?</hi> When you have spent all your Days in building your Reputation on this Sand, one Blast of Wind, at last, does tumble it down, and all your Cost and Labour is lost. Serve Men as submissively and carefully as you can, and, after all, some Accident, or failing of their unrighteous Expectations, may make all that you ever did forgotten. If ever you put such Confidence in a Friend, as not to consider it is possible, he may one Day prove your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, you know not Man; and may, perhaps,
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:005151_0412_1016C8949FAB50A8"/>
be better taught to know him to your Cost. (4.) There is, among Men, so great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Judgments, and Dispositions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, that they will never agree among themselves; and if you please one, the rest will be thereby displeased.—Church Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Sects have been found in all Ages: And you cannot be of the Opinion of every Party; and if you be of one Party, you must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the rest.

                  </gap>, they will expect that you should change as fast as they; and whatever their contrary Interests require, you must follow them in: Whatever Cause or Action they engage in, be it ever so devilish, you must approve of it, and countenance it, and all that they do, you must say is well done. In a Word, you must teach your Tongue to say any Thing, and you must sell your Innocency, and hire out your Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or you cannot please them. MICHAIAH must say with the rest of the Prophets, <hi>Go and prosper;</hi> or else he will be hated, as not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying Good of</hi> AHAB, <hi>but Evil,</hi> I Kings 22. 8. And how can you serve all Interests at once? It seems, the Providence of GOD hath, as of Purpose, wheeled about the Affairs of the World to try, and shame <hi>Man-pleasers,</hi> and <hi>Temperisers</hi> in the Sight of the Sun. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then, that if you will please all, you must at once both speak and be silent, and verify

Contradictions, and be in many Places at once, and be of all Men's Minds, and for all Men's Ways. For my Part, I mean to see the World a little better agreed among themselves, before I will make it my Ambition to please them. If you can reconcile all their Opinions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, and Complexions, and Dispositions, and make them all of one Mind and Will, then hope to please them.</q>

            <p>He was Abundance more upon this Head, which we may, some of us, do well to consider, as what is well adapted to our Case at this Day.</p>
            <p>I have hitherto considered <hi>Ministers</hi> as the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, more especially obliged to discountenance the bad Things, prevailing in the Land; and now go on to observe.</p>
            <p>That this the Duty of <hi>all in general.</hi> Not that I would put any upon acting out of their <hi>proper Sphere.</hi> This would tend rather to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion than Reformation.—Good Order is the Strength and Beauty of the World.—The Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> depends very much upon it. And can there be Order, where Men transgress the Limits of their Station, and intermeddle in the Business of others? So far from it, that the only effectual Method, under GOD, for the Redress of <hi>general Evils,</hi> is, for <hi>every one</hi> to be faithful, in doing what is <hi>proper</hi> for him in his <hi>own Place:</hi> And even <hi>all</hi> may <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> bear a Part, in <hi>rectifying the Disorders</hi> of this Kind, at this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> may do a great deal, not only by their <hi>good Example,</hi> but a wise Use of their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>

in their various Places, for the Suppression of every Thing hurtful to Society, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of whatever has a Tendency to make Men happy in the Enjoyment of their Rights, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>Christian.</hi> And herein chiefly lies, (as I humbly conceive) the Duty of Rulers, at this Day. 'Tis true, as <hi>private Men,</hi> they are under the same Obligations with others, to make their Acknowledgments to CHRIST; and doubtless, if HE was <hi>visibly</hi> and <hi>externally</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom among <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi>) to make his solemn Entry into the Land, as their SAVIOUR and LORD,<q>it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they should, as <hi>public Officers,</hi> make their Appearance, and attend him as their <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> with sutable Congratulations, and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festations of Respect and Loyalty; and if they should stand at a Distance, it would be much more taken Notice of, and awaken his Displeasure much more, than such a Behaviour in the common People.</q>

Strife and Faction, I know of no Persons more sutable to be taken in Hand by <hi>Authority:</hi> And if they suffer, 'tis for their own Follies; nor can they reasonably blame any Body but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Nor am I asham'd, or afraid, to prosess it as my Opinion, that it would probably have been of good Service, if those, in these Times, who have been publickly and out-ragiously reviled, had, by their Complaints, put it properly in the <hi>Magistrates</hi> Power, to restrain some Men's <hi>Tongues</hi> with <hi>Bit</hi> and <hi>Bridle.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Private Christians</hi> also, of all Ranks and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may do something towards the Suppression of these <hi>Errors,</hi> by mourning before the LORD the Dishonour which has hereby been reflected on the Name of CHRIST, and Injury done to Souls; by being much in Prayer to GOD for the Out-pouring of his SPIRIT, in all desirable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Light, and Love, and Peace; by taking good Heed that they ben't themselves drawn aside, avoiding to this End, the Company and familiar Converse of those, who, by <hi>good Words</hi> and <hi>fair Speeches,</hi> might be apt to deceive their Hearts, but especially an Attendance on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exercises, where the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Ministry</hi> are freely declaimed against by those who have gone out from them, under the vain Pretence of being more holy than they; and in fine, by a faithful Performance of those Duties, which arise from the various Relations they sustain towards each other: As thus, if they are <hi>Children,</hi> by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to the Advice of their <hi>Parents,</hi> and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and honouring them in the LORD; and if they are <hi>Parents,</hi> by counseling, reproving, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, restraining and commanding, their <hi>children,</hi> as there may be Occasion: If they are <hi>Servants,</hi>

by pleasing their <hi>Masters</hi> well in all Things, not defrauding them of their Time or Labour, but accounting them worthy of all Honour, that the Name of GOD be not blasphemed; and, if they are <hi>Masters,</hi> not only by providing for their <hi>Servants</hi> Things honest and good, but by keeping them within the Rules of Order and Decorum, not suffering them to neglect the Religion of the Family at home, under Pretence of carrying it on elsewhere; especially, when they continue abroad 'till late in the Night, and so as to unfit themselves for the Services of the following Day.</p>

World, which is pointed out in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of GOD for the Place, where this glorious Scene of Things, "will, probably, first begin?" How often, at other Times, and in other Places, has the Conceit been propagated among People, as if the Prophecies touching the Kingdom of CHRIST, in the <hi>latter Days,</hi> were NOW to receive their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishent? And what has been the Effect, but their running wild? So it was in GERMANY, in the Beginning of the Reformation. The <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> and <hi>wonderful</hi> Things in that Day, were look'd upon by the Men then thought to be most under the <hi>SPIRIT's immediate</hi> Direction, as "the Dawning of that glorious Work of GOD, which should renew the whole World;" and the Imagination of the Multitude being fired with this Notion, they were soon perswaded, that the Saints were now to reign on Earth, and the Dominion to be given into their Hands: And it was under the Influence of this vain Conceit, (in which they were strengthened by <hi>Visions, Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> and <hi>Revolutions</hi>) that they took up <hi>Arms</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the lawful <hi>Authority,</hi> and were destroy'd, at one Time and another, to the Number of an HUNDRED THOUSANDS.<note n="§" place="bottom">Vid.

            <p>It was owing to the same Delusion, propagat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the following Century, by KOTTERUS, DRABRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIUS, and PONIATOVIA, under the pampous Shew of <hi>immediate Revelation</hi> from GOD, that great

Disturbances were again revived. The learned COMENIUS was carried away with this Dream; verily believing, that the happy State of the Church was NOW to take Place. And 'tis well known, that this same Pretence of the near Approach of the MILLENNIUM, the <hi>promised Kingdom of the</hi> MESSIAH, was the <hi>Foundation-Error of the French Prophets,</hi> and those in their Way, no longer ago than the Beginning of this Century: And so infatuated were they at last, as to publish it to the World, that the glorious Times they spake of, <hi>would be manifest over the whole Earth, within the Term of</hi> THREE YEARS. And what Set of Men have ever yet appear'd in the Christian World, whose Imaginations have been thorowly warmed, but they have, at length, wrought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to a <hi>full Assurance,</hi> that NOW was the Time for the Accomplishment of the Scriptures, and the Creation of the <hi>new Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>new Earth?</hi> No one Thing have they more united<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concurred in, to their own shameful Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and the doing unspeakable Damage to the Interest of Religion.—A sufficient Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one would think, to keep Men modest; and restrain them from Endeavours to lead Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a Belief of that, of which they have no sufficient <hi>Evidence;</hi> and in which, they may be deceived by their <hi>vain Imaginations,</hi> as Hundreds and Thousands have been before them.</p>
            <p>There are unquestionably many Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning CHRIST, and the <hi>Glory of his Kingdom,</hi> still to be fulfilled; and it may be of good Service to labour to beget in People a Faith in these Things; or, if they have Faith, to quicken and strengthen it: But it can answer no good End to lead People into the Belief of any <hi>particular</hi>
               <pb n="375" facs="unknown:005151_0422_1016C8AE80E0E250"/>
Time, as the Time <hi>appointed</hi> of GOD for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of these Purposes of his Mercy; because this is one of those Matters, his Wisdom has thought fit to keep conceal'd from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Man. Our own Faith therefore upon this Head can be founded only on <hi>Conjecture;</hi> and as 'tis only the like <hi>blind Faith</hi> we can convey to others, we should be cautious, lest their Conduct should be agreeable to their Faith. When they have imbib'd from us the Thought, as if the <hi>glorious Things,</hi> spoken of in Scripture, were to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their Day, they will be apt (as has often been the Case) to be impatient, and from their <hi>Officiousness</hi> in tendring their Help where it is not needed, to disserve the Interest of the Redeemer. Pertinent to the present Case, and to these Times, are the Words of Mr. WILLIAM ALLEN, with which I shall finish this Part of our Discourse. Says he,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>His Works,</hi> P. 676.</note> speaking of CHRIST, <q>He stands in Need of no unrighteous, or irregular Help from Men, to give him Possession of his Kingdom in the World. He who hath given Laws to his Subjects, to direct and govern them in their Actions, will never take it well from any of them, if they shall break any of his Laws, in Zeal for him, or to advance his Kingdom in the World.—The Scripture faith, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, doth not make haste,</hi> Isa. 28. 16. He doth not use any indirect Means to hasten that, which GOD hath promised, as being impatient of his Delay to fulfill and perform it. And therefore all irregular Practices of Men to hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the setting up of CHRIST's Kingdom in the World, are an Argument rather of Diffidence and Distrust in CHRIST, as King of his Church;
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:005151_0423_1016C8B43ACFFC08"/>
either of his Power, as if he could not set up his Kingdom without such <hi>human Helps</hi> as they deem necessary to that End; or, of his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as not regarding the best Time, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Season to do it in; Or, of his Care of his Church, in not hastening more to her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and Deliverance from all powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. When Men will take <hi>Christ's</hi> Work out of his own Hands, and lead the Way, and go before him in it, as if they expected he should second them, and assist them in it, it is never like to prosper in their's, who so usurp that Authority.—And when they find themselves entangled with insuperable Difficulties, its very likely they will thereupon entertain hard and unbecoming Thoughts of CHRIST himself, as if he had deserted his own Cause, in leaving them to themselves in their rash Undertaking. And its well if they do not thereupon bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under a strong Temptation, either to Disobedience, or to question whether those Grounds, upon which judicious and sober Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians expect the Churches great Deliverance from the Hands of her Enemies, be true or no; Nay, its well if they don't thereby bring themselves to question the Truth of the other great Doctrines of Christianity, and slip into <hi>Atheism,</hi> as its certain some have done, upon the Miscarriage of their rash Undertaking. Let none then out of a hastly and mistaken Zeal, and under Pretence of ushering the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of CHRIST into the World, attempt any Thing in Order thereto, that tends to disturb the public Peace.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will not be supposed, unless by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons evidently weak, or prejudiced, that I have it in View, in this Part of my Discourse, to plead for those who have appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Disorders of the Times, in <hi>every Thing</hi> they have said, or done: Nor will any imagine, I am so unbounded in my Charity, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the gross, a good Opinion of ALL, who cry out of Irregularities, as though they must needs be true Converts, because they speak against such Things as ought to be condemn'd.</p>
            <p>There are, no Doubt, both secret Hypocrites, and open Sinners, among those, on the one Hand, who have an ill Thought of many Things going on in the Land, as well as among those, on the other, who speak of the <hi>present Commotion</hi> as, in the main, a <hi>marvellous Work of divine Grace:</hi> And on either Side, some may have conducted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a Manner not to be justified.

judge amiss at this Day, have acted unworthy their Character <hi>as Men</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> let their Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our be fairly pointed out, and all the Blame fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened on them they deserve. I have nothing to object against this.—But what I think injurious is, the <hi>wrongfully</hi> and <hi>indiscriminately</hi> accusing those who complain of the Times; or the doing this in an <hi>unchristian Manner,</hi> and so as to reflect an unjust Odium on them.</p>
            <p>To come to Instances; in mentioning of which, I shall not trouble my self about Order, but set Things down as they may occur to my Mind.</p>
            <p>The Discouragers of the <hi>bad Things</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Day, have been publickly faulted as to their <hi>Method of Judging</hi> about the "religious Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the Minds of Men, that has been carried on of late in NEW-ENGLAND:" And "so far as the Ground of their Error has been in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and not in the Disposition," it has been said, "Fundamentally to lie in three Things."</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are said <q>to have greatly erred in the Way, in which they have gone about to try this Work, whether it be a Work of the SPIRIT of GOD, or no; <abbr>viz,</abbr> in judging of it a <hi>Priori,</hi> from the Way it began, the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been employed, the Means that have been made Use of, and the Methods that have been taken and succeeded, in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on</q> If by this Remark, the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who makes it, intends, that they have form'd a<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. EDWARDS'S <hi>late Book,</hi> Page 2. and onwards.</note>
               <pb n="379" facs="unknown:005151_0426_1016C8BAA5AAF1C0"/>
Judgment from the SOLE consideration of any, or all these Things, he grosly misrepresents them to the World. I never yet heard of one, among the whole Number of those, who think differently from him about the present religious Affair, who settled his Opinion, in the Way he speaks of. If he knew of any, he should have named them; and not charged this <hi>partial Manner</hi> of judging upon all in general. But if he means <hi>only,</hi> that, in Order to judge fairly of the State of Religion, in our Churches, they take into Consideration the Things he has mentioned, among many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they own the Charge, and think they should act below their Character as <hi>Men,</hi> if it could not be made good upon them.</p>
            <p>They are as willing as he can be to leave it with the alwise GOD, to use what <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> he pleases, in beginning and carrying on his own Work, in the Hearts of Men; and can heartily join with him in subscribing to the Truth of every <hi>Text</hi> he has brought to View; though not to the Pertinency of any one of them, to the Purpose to which has adduc'd them. For can it, with Justice, be called "a directing the SPIRIT of the LORD, or a Being his Counsellor," to make the best Inquiry we are able into a <hi>Work</hi> said to be <hi>his,</hi> and to fetch in Light in all the Ways proper to be made Use of by reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures? 'Tis true, if a <hi>Work</hi> has before been proved to be a <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> and nothing can be objected against it, but only that the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> employed in it, are such as the <hi>Wisdom of Man</hi> would not have pitched upon, this is so far from being a just Ground of Exception, that it would be to <hi>reply against GOD,</hi> to insist upon it; and it might be proper
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:005151_0427_1016C8BE3747AC20"/>
in such a Case, to say, <q>God gives no Account of his Matters; his Judgments are a great Deep: He hath his Way in the Sea, and his Path in the great Waters, and his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps are not known: And who shall teach GOD Knowledge, or enjoin him his Way, or say unto him what doest thou?</q> But what is this to the Affair under Consideration? Is it not the great Question of the Day, how far, and in what Respects, the Work, going on in the Land, is the Work of GOD? And are there not great and numerous Difficulties attending it, if consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a <hi>Posteriori?</hi> Are not the <hi>Effects</hi> such, as the best and wisest Men in the Country have tho't themselves oblig'd to testify against? And in an Affair so circumstane'd, should not we be justly chargeable with partial Neglect, if we did not fairly consider every Thing that might give Light into it? Is not this the Expectation of GOD concerning us? And can we otherwise acquit our selves as Beings endowed with Reason and Understanding?</p>
            <p>Besides, it ought to be remembred, tho' GOD may use what <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> he <hi>pleases</hi> in carrying on his own Work; yet, he will <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver please</hi> to make Use of those which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unfit and improper. And may not the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments,</hi> employed in a Work <hi>said</hi> to be his, be of this Sort? Is this impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Han't it often been the Case in Fact? And how shall we know but the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,</hi> said to be used by GOD, are unsutable in their Nature, or such as would reflect Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Institutions</hi> of GOD, if we may not, in the regular Exercise of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, judge of them? What greater
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:005151_0428_1016C8C0B8666290"/>
Arrogance is it to judge of <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> said to be employed by GOD, than of a Work said to be <hi>his?</hi> If we may judge of the <hi>one</hi> without "directing the SPIRIT of the LORD," we may with as much Propriety judge of the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> Nor can we, in many Cases, form a just Judgment of the <hi>latter,</hi> without duly considering the <hi>former;</hi> and if any have attempted to do this in the present Case, "they may not wonder if they are perplext in their Thoughts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded." Perhaps, no one Thing will better enable serious, well-dispos'd Persons, to make a true Judgment of the late Operation upon the Minds of People, than an impartial and thorow Inquiry into the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of it's Rise and Progress: Nor can I conceive, why any should object against so reasonable a Method of Judging unless they are apprehensive, if <hi>these</hi> should come under a strict Examination, the Use, at lest of some, of them would appear to be inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the <hi>Perfections</hi> of GOD, or the <hi>standing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of his Will in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sensible, with this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> that "this Work has been carried on by the <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish."</hi> and I may add, the <hi>sinful</hi> Things of this World: And if the Work it self has, in many Instances, partook of the <hi>Weakness,</hi> and <hi>Foolishness,</hi> and <hi>Sinfulness,</hi> of the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments,</hi> these Things will mutually illustrate each other, and mightily help in forming a true Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the State of our religious Affairs. And if this <hi>Gentleman</hi> has erred, in any material Points, in the Sentiments he has expressed, upon this Head, one Reason may be, his throwing out of his Mind those weighty Considerations, that might have been suggested to him, had he duly thought
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:005151_0429_1016C8C3D7C76318"/>
upon the <hi>Means,</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Instruments,</hi> of carrying on the present Work: Nor must he take it amiss, if notwithstanding all that he has offered, others still think, these Things require a distinct and full Examination.</p>
            <p>I am sensible also, that "the Ministers who have been chiefly employ'd, some of them have been <hi>meer Babes</hi> in Age and Standing." Nor do I deny, that "GOD has suffered their Infirmities to appear in the Sight of others:" Nor that "he has made Use of their Infirmities and Sins for the Chastising;" yea, the doing real Service to others: But then, it ought to be considered, the Good that may arise out of <hi>these Evils,</hi> is no Argument, either that GOD approbates them, or that we should: And though we ought to make a wise and holy Use of all GOD's Dispensations; yet, we may warrantably look upon those Things in Providence as <hi>Evils,</hi> which really are so, and deprecate them, and do whatever is proper to suppress them; and this, notwithstanding the Wisdom of GOD may know how to make them work for good, to them that love him, and are the Called according to his Purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>II.

Things, diverse and wide from it, to judge of this Work by.</q> Who could have thought to have met with such a Charge as this against those, who have ventured their Characters to stand up for the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> in Opposition to <hi>Impulses;</hi> and publickly pleaded for them as the <hi>one only Rule,</hi> by which to try all Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> as well <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Whispers</hi> and <hi>sudden Impressions?</hi>—Are there any who have done more Honour to the <hi>Bible,</hi> in these Times, by calling Men to <hi>the Law and to the Testimony,</hi> both from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Press,</hi> than the Persons here reflected on as making an undue Use of this sacred Book? Was it not by Men of this Character, that a famous Instrument in the late Extraordinaries, was deposed from the Ministry, for the Contempt he had cast upon the <hi>inspir'd Writings?</hi> And shall they, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be condemn'd, and by the Lump too, as pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>greater Regard</hi> to other Things, than even the <hi>Bible,</hi> in judging of the State of Religion in the Land? I cannot but look upon this Charge, in the Manner in which it is levelled, as a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Abuse; and would hope, the <hi>Gentleman,</hi> upon second Thoughts, will be sensible of it himself. But he goes on to Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>I. Some make <hi>Philosophy,</hi> INSTEAD of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures their Rule of Judging of this Work; particularly, the <hi>philosophical</hi> Notions they entertain of the Nature of the Soul, it's Faculties and Affections.</q> There is an evident Difference between using <hi>Philosophy</hi> as an <hi>Help</hi> in order to understand the Scripture, and the placing it in the ROOM of Scripture. In the former Sense, I suppose this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will not deny, but <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi> may very well consist toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—If no Use might be made of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
               <pb n="384" facs="unknown:005151_0431_1016C8CA2B252698"/>
in explaining the Scripture, how monstrous must our Conceptions of the infinite GOD be, while he is represented, according to the <hi>Letter</hi> of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berless <hi>Texts,</hi> as having <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> and <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Feet;</hi> and as being subject to the various Passions of <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Hatred; Joy</hi> and <hi>Grief; Anger, Wrath, Revenge,</hi> and the like? We must be allow'd the Exercise of our <hi>Reason,</hi> (which is but another Name for what is here meant by <hi>Philosophy</hi>) or we shall be liable to be wretchedly impos'd on by our Imaginations: Nor is there any Error, however extravagant, but we shall be in Danger of falling into it. If we give up our Understandings, how shall we be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ascertain the Sense of any one Text of Scripture? What should hinder our running in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Wilds of Delusion?—But this Use of <hi>Philosophy,</hi> I conclude this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject against. If he does, I see not but he will be self-condemn'd; for he has himself, under this very Head, made Use of more <hi>Philosophy</hi> (and in a Manner not altogether unexceptionable, as we may see afterwards, if I can find Room) than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one that I know of, who has wrote upon the Time.—And as to the other Sense of using <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi> the placeing it in the <hi>Room</hi> of Scripture, who among all those who are differently minded from this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> about the present Work, have ever made such a Use of it? Can a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Instance be produced?

the Connection between these Things? Persons may undoubtedly be of the Opinion, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the present Day consists <hi>chiefly</hi> in a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion in the Passions,</hi> and yet pay all due Honour to the <hi>Bible.</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <q>2.

Or, whether they han't, all along, been united to a Man in saying, as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> here does, <q>I can't see which Way we are in Danger, or how the Devil is like to get any notable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against us, if we do but thorowly do our Duty with Respect to those two Things, <abbr>viz,</abbr> the <hi>State of Person's Minds,</hi> and their <hi>moral Conduct;</hi> seeing to it, that they be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an <hi>Agreeableness to the Rules that CHRIST has given us.</hi>
               </q> Is not this the very Thing they have always spoken? And if some others had been alike <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> in urging upon Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a Conformity to the Gospel, in the <hi>moral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> of their <hi>Minds,</hi> and <hi>Course</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> as a more <hi>scriptural</hi> Evidence of the Reality of a <hi>Work of Grace,</hi> than that which arises from a <hi>Commotion in their Passions,</hi> we had probably been in better Circumstances at this Day.</p>
            <p>I shall only add, if the "<hi>Effects</hi> that the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> have upon the <hi>Body,</hi> do in NO WISE belong to the <hi>scriptural-Rule</hi> of judging of this Work," there was no great Need of the Labour of five or six Pages in their Vindication; and we may hope for an easy Pardon, if we forbear remarking upon what is there offered.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. Another Thing that some make their <hi>Rule</hi> to judge of this Work by, INSTEAD of the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> is <hi>History,</hi> or <hi>former Observation.</hi>
               </q> It may be here said of <hi>History,</hi> as of <hi>Philosophy</hi> under
<pb n="387" facs="unknown:005151_0434_1016C8D0A4B53F50"/>
the former Head, that, in Subordination to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it may be of good Service. And this is the Thought of this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> or he condemns that in others, which he practises himself; for in this very Place, where he is speaking against the <hi>Use of History,</hi> he has made as free with it as those he finds Fault with. I conclude therefore, 'tis not <hi>meerly</hi> the <hi>Use of History</hi> he objects against, but the using it INSTEAD of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And if any, in these Times, have gone into <hi>such a Use</hi> of it, they are certainly to Blame: But then, Care should be taken not to fasten Blame publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on them, without Evidence that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally chargeable with it. It is not sufficient to say, <q>If there be any Thing new and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, in the Circumstances of this Work, that was not observ'd in former Times, <hi>that</hi> is a <hi>Rule</hi> with them to reject this Work, as not the Work of GOD.</q> This is nothing more than a Repetition of the Charge, by Way of <hi>meer Affirmation;</hi> which ought to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as of no Weight, in a disputed Point. Nor does it much mend the Matter to go on <hi>affirming,</hi> 
               <q>Another Way that some err in making <hi>History</hi> and <hi>former Observation</hi> their <hi>Rule</hi> to judge of this Work, INSTEAD of the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> is comparing some accidental, external Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this Work, with what has appear'd sometimes in <hi>Enthusiasts;</hi> and as they find as Agreement in some such Things, so they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the whole Work, or, at lest, the Substance of it, concluding it to be <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi>
               </q> This is only <hi>asserting</hi> what others deny, and are firmly perswaded cannot never be prov'd. Some shew of Proof, 'tis true, is here offered. <q>So, great Use has been made, to this Purpose, of many Things that are found among the QUAKERS.—
<pb n="388" facs="unknown:005151_0435_1016C8D2FAC59010"/>
So, to the same Purpose, some <hi>external Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> that were found among the FRENCH PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHETS, and some other ENTHUSIASTS, in former Times, have been, of late, trump'd up with great Assurance and Triumph.</q> If instead of <hi>roundly affirming</hi> (which is the easiest Thing in the World) this <hi>Gentleman</hi> had condescended to show, wherein the Persons, he here blames, had made Use of any Thing, either among the QUA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERS, or FRENCH PROPHETS, or other ENTHUSIASTS, as their <hi>Rule</hi> in judging of this Work, INSTEAD of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> he might have done something towards confirming his Point; but what he has offered, as it now stands, can't be thought to be of any Force, unless it be taken for granted (which is so unreasonable, I can't suppose, this Gentleman will desire it) that <hi>no Use</hi> may be made of the <hi>History</hi> of ENTHUSIASTS, with Relation to the present Work, but to the Dishonour of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and so as to place the <hi>former</hi> in the ROOM of the <hi>latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4. I would propose it to be considered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no, some, INSTEAD of making the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> their <hi>only Rule</hi> to judge of this Work, don't make their <hi>own Experience</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> to reject such and such Things as are now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and experienced, because they never <hi>felt them themselves.</hi>
               </q> As this is a Matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be considered, I have accordingly taken it into Consideration, and thereupon think, there is a very great Difference between making Use of <hi>Experience</hi> with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and in <hi>Subservi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> to it, and the setting it up as a <hi>Rule</hi> INSTEAD of the <hi>Scripture.</hi> The <hi>former,</hi> this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I I am satisfied, will not object against: And for the <hi>latter,</hi> 'tis so great a Fault, that none ought
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:005151_0436_1016C8D6CFB7BE20"/>
to be publickly charged with it, unless upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Evidence than that of meer <hi>Insinuation</hi> by Way of <hi>Query.</hi> I will not say but some, among those, who are Enemies to the present Disorders, may have made an undue Use of <hi>Experience;</hi> though I know not of one who ever set it up as a <hi>Rule</hi> INSTEAD of the <hi>Bible.</hi> This is not the Fault of the Persons, this <hi>Gentleman</hi> is here speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, but of the <hi>Friends</hi> to that which is called without Discrimination, the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> going on in the Land. I don't query, whether, among these, there are not some, who make this Use of their <hi>Experience,</hi> but affirm that there are; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon my own personal Conversation with them, and partly by Information from others of known Judgment and Integrity. 'Tis with them a sufficient Reason to think, and speak of a Man as <hi>carnal and unconverted,</hi> if he han't <hi>felt</hi> the like <hi>Extraordinaries</hi> they have <hi>experienced:</hi> Nor has it been an uncommon Thing for them, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce others <hi>pharisaical</hi> and <hi>unregenerate,</hi> upon this Ground <hi>solely;</hi> as though what they had <hi>experienced</hi> was a sure Test to try the State of their Neighbour by. And how this <hi>Gentleman</hi> came to charge the known Fault of some of the <hi>Zealots</hi> of this Day, upon those who have ever appear'd against it, I am at a loss to conceive.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>III. Another Foundation Error of those that reject this Work, is their not duly <hi>distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>bad.</hi>
               </q> I can't but think this <hi>Gentleman</hi> spake more from a <hi>speculative</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Matter, than the <hi>Reality of Fact,</hi> when he wrote this. For who are the Persons chargeable with not <hi>duly distinguishing</hi> in the late religious Commotion? Are they not those, who have accustomed themselves to speak of it, both
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:005151_0437_1016C8D862B9A9E8"/>
publickly and privately, as an <hi>extraordinary Work of GOD,</hi> in the gross, and without Distinction? And have they not often been faulted for this <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discriminate</hi> Way of speaking upon the Matter? Han't they been openly call'd upon, yea, seriously and solemnly argued with, to distinguish and separate between the good and bad? And have they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done it to this Day? Do they not rather go on in the same general, indiscriminate Way of speaking? Whereas, the Persons, this <hi>Gentleman</hi> blames, have plainly said, at lest some of them, over and over again, what the <hi>bad Things</hi> of the present Day are, which they condemn: And this indeed is that for which they have been so basely treated. They are certainly in an ill Case; for they are misus'd for pointing out the bad Things prevailing in these Times, and at the same Time <hi>blam'd</hi> for not doing that, for the doing of which all Manner of Evil has been spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to the great Detriment both of their Reputation, and Usefulness in the World. To proceed,</p>
            <p>Another Thing charg'd upon those, who have spoken against the Disorders of the Times is,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. EDWARDS'S late Book, P. 189.</note> 
               <q>That they have watched for the halting of the Zealous, and catch'd at any Thing that has been wrong, and have greatly insisted on it, made the most of it, and magnified it; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, that they have watched for Errors in zealous Preachers, that are much in reproving and condemning the Wickedness of the Times.</q> I never imagined, but, among those who have manifested a Dislike to the present Commotions,
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:005151_0438_1016B8067601BAB8"/>
there might be some of a prophane Character; and how far the Temper and Conduct of this Kind of Persons may be pointed out in these Words, I dispute not: But the Charge is very unfair as laid against those, in general, who are for keeping Things from running into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and the more so, as the just Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Offence have, of late been so frequent and numerous. This Gentleman must be strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with the State of Affairs in the Land, if he does not know, that the late Zealots, and the Preachers among them too, have, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Instances, behav'd after such a Manner, that others could not help observing the Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies they fell into; and instead of "catching at any Thing wrong," they were rather moved with Pity and Grief, to behold the Mischief that was doing to the Cause of Religion: And so far were they from "magnisying real Errors," that, I scruple not to say, they have never yet set them in their full Light; nay, as to same of the Disorders of the Times, I don't think it is in the Power of the worst Opposer of them all to describe them to the Life. This Gentleman may further suggest, "that Disorders have been too much insisted on;" but others, as much concern'd for the Honour of GOD, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Christianity,</hi> are of Opinion, they have not been <hi>insisted on enough:</hi> To be sure, they were not at first; if they had, much of the present Confusions would, I believe, have been prevented. I shall add, there are as awful Texts of Scripture, as well worthy a serious Consideration as that, this Gentleman has here particularly mentioned: Such as that, Prov. 17. 15. <hi>He that justifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Just, even they
<pb n="392" facs="unknown:005151_0439_1016C8DD653CE9C8"/>
both are Abomination to the LORD.</hi> And that, in the 24th Chapter, the 24th and 25th Verses. <hi>He that faith unto the Wicked, thou art righteous; him shall the People curse, Nations shall abhor him: But to them that rebuke him shall be Delight, and a good Blessing shall come upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Thing injuriously reflected upon those who have spoken against the Disorders of the Times is, "That they are OPPOSERS of the WORK of GOD:" Nor have they been thus charged by the <hi>Vulgar</hi> and <hi>Illiterate</hi> only, which is no Wonder; but by those who would take it ill, not to be accounted Men of another Character. And to this, as much as any one Thing, may be owing, the Alienations, Contentions and Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are now common in the Land.</p>
            <p>But why must they be spoken of, in the harsh Language, of <hi>Opposers of the Work of GOD?</hi> Is this their real Character? 'Tis true, they don't think the Work of the Spirit lies in <hi>Impulses, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Revelations;</hi> they don't think, that <hi>Screamings,</hi> and <hi>Shriekings,</hi> and <hi>Swoonings,</hi> are sure Marks of a genuine Conviction of Sin; they don't think, that <hi>extatic Raptures</hi> are an infallible Sign of saving Faith: Nor have they any great Opinion of the Exhortations of weak, illiterate Men, Women, or Labs, and other Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are common at this Day. And shall they, upon these Accounts, be called <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> of GOD? Will any, from hence, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a mature Consideration of the Matter, fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them this Character, and in such a Sense too, as that they must be Enemies to the REDEEMER, and <hi>his Kingdom?</hi> Are not many of those, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Opposers,</hi> Men of the best Character in the
<pb n="393" facs="unknown:005151_0440_1016C8DEF4579CC8"/>
Country, so far as can be judged? Han't they always been so accounted, 'till these Times? And is there not the same Reason to think well of them now as formerly, save only that they have testified against the bad Things of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Day?</p>
            <p>The Gentlemen, who are most free in speaking of others as <hi>Opposers</hi> of <hi>GOD's Work,</hi> seem to look upon themselves as the only Friends the LORD JESUS CHRIST has in the Land: But will their own Conceit of themselves make it true, that they really are so? And if those, who think they are mistaken in the Judgment they form of themselves, should follow their Example, and go into their extravagant Way of speaking, what would be their Opinion of it? How would they like to be call'd <hi>Opposers of CHRIST,</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of GOD and Religion? Would they not esteem themselves shamefully reviled? And yet, I believe, it will not be pretended, but some of them have so acted, as to bring as great Reproach on CHRIST, and the Divine SPIRIT, and the Ways of true Religion, as many of the worst <hi>Opposers</hi> (as they are term'd) put together.</p>
            <p>It has been remarked, those, who call others <hi>Opposers of the Work of GOD,</hi> don't care to explain themselves upon the Matter: Nor has any one of them yet done it that I know of, unless the Gentleman, I have so often refer'd to, may be supposed to have attempted something of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He thinks it not enough for Persons to say,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. EDWARDS'S <hi>Tho'ts on the late Revival of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               <q>they believe there is a good Work going
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:005151_0441_1016C8E166745C40"/>
on in the Country; and that they sometimes bless GOD, in their publick Prayers, in general Terms, for any Awakenings, or Revivals of Religion, there have lately been in any Parts of the Land.</q> Notwithstanding this, <q>Some (as he goes on) are so far from acknowledging, and rejoicing in the infinite Mercy of GOD, in causing so happy a Change in the Land, that they look upon the religious State of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, take it in the whole of it, much more sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful than it was ten Years ago.</q> And, <q>if it be manifestly thus with us, (he adds) and our Talk and Behaviour with Respect to this Work be such as has (though but) an indirect Tendency, to beget ill Thoughts and Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in others concerning it, we are <hi>Opposers of the Work of GOD.</hi>
               </q> What is the plain English of all this, but that those who don't speak upon the Times just as this Gentleman would have them, are <hi>Opposers of the Work of GOD.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, it may, in a Sense, be said even of all who either do, or say, any Thing that has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a remote Tendency to disserve the Cause of GOD, that they are <hi>Opposers of GOD's Work:</hi> And just the same Thing may, with as much Truth, be affirm'd of those, who neglect what is proper for them to do, to remove away that which hinders the flourishing of Religion. And should those, upon this, whose Talk and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with Respect to the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Disorders</hi> in the Land, have been such as tend (though but) indirectly to beget favourable Thoughts, in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of the <hi>bad Things</hi> among us, or not so ill Thoughts of them as they really deserve: I say, should such as these be represented to the World as <hi>Opposers of GOD's Work;</hi> and this, though "they sometimes speak against Disorders
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:005151_0442_1016C8E358121FE8"/>
in their <hi>public Prayers,</hi> in general Terms," would it not be highly resented? Especially, if it was before known, that the applying this Style of <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers</hi> to them, would be understood by Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as giving them no better a Name than that of the Enemies of GOD and CHRIST, and the Cause of Truth and Religion in the World. And if such a Representation would be unjust on one Side, 'tis equally so on the other.</p>
            <p>I am sensible, this Gentleman professes more Charity for Opposers than many who give them this Name. He speaks of it as a difficult Thing,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 300.</note> 
               <q>to determine <hi>how far,</hi> and <hi>how long,</hi> some Persons of good Experience in their Souls,</q> may be <hi>Opposers</hi> of this <hi>Work;</hi> and owns, <q>that he has seen that which abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinces him, that the Business is too high for him, and that he can leave it wholly in his Hands, who is infinitely fit for it, without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at all with it himself.</q> This is well said; and who that reads it would expect to find this Gentleman declaring, in this very Page, <hi>against any Men's obliging him to set under the Ministry of one be there marks out for an Opposer?</hi> Who would think to see him ranking <hi>Opposers</hi> with <hi>Deists?</hi> As he does, when he proposes it to Confiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 337.</note> any good Medium can be found, where a Man could rest with any Stability, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween owning this <hi>Work,</hi> and <hi>being a Deist?</hi> Who could suppose, that he should, in all Parts of his <hi>Book,</hi> speak of <hi>Opposers</hi> in the most severe and bitter Language?—If a Collection was to be made of all the hard Speeches he has freely made
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:005151_0443_1016C8E4EABCB838"/>
Use of, few, perhaps, would appear to have carried their Uncharitableness to a greater Height.</p>
            <p>And what is the true Reason of this Out-cry against Persons, as <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> of GOD? Is it not this, and only this, that they don't think of the <hi>Work going on in the Land,</hi> at this Day, just as some others do? And shall they, on this Account, be stigmatised as <hi>Opposers</hi> of <hi>GOD's Work?</hi> Is there no Difference between <hi>this Work,</hi> as the Phrase is vulgarly and indefinitely used, and a <hi>Work of GOD</hi> in the Sense of the Gospel? May not Persons entertain a just Idea of <hi>Faith, Conversion,</hi> the <hi>New-Creature,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else the Scripture means by a <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> and yet differ from others in their Sentiments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Work</hi> that has, of late, been so much the Subject of Conversation? Even the Friends to <hi>this Work</hi> vary in their Thoughts about it. Some think it has a greater Mixture of <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order;</hi> others a less: Some think the Disorders accompanying it, are of a very pernicious Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; others look upon them as rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Nature of Frailties and Infirmities: Some have a higher Opinion of the good that has been done; others a lower. Perhaps, there are no two Friends to this <hi>Work,</hi> but they differ in their Thoughts about it: Nay, have not the same Persons conceiv'd a very different Opinion of it, at different Times? Yea, han't they chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Sentiments in Respect of those very Things, for <hi>opposing</hi> of which they once condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed others as <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Work</hi> of GOD?—And if those, who are called Friends to <hi>this Work,</hi> may differ from one another, and from their own selves too; why may not the same Liberty be
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:005151_0444_1016C8E96671C430"/>
given to others, without pointing them out by a Name of Odium and Disgrace?</p>
            <p>In a Word, If any must be called <hi>Opposers of GOD's Work,</hi> they ought to be particularly told, why they are spoken of in this Style: And then it will be seen, whether it be, because they real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppose any Thing that the <hi>Bible</hi> makes the <hi>Work of GOD</hi> to consist in, or only because they are faithful to testify against such <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,</hi> as are a Dishonour to true Religion, and tend to hinder its Progress in the Land. This has often been desired; and 'tis a Request, I can't but think, those Gentlemen are oblig'd, in all Reason and Conscience, to give a plain, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Answer to, who have publickly advis'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to separate from <hi>Opposers;</hi> as they would not incur the Guilt of encouraging <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Schism,</hi> by the Use of certain <hi>loose, general</hi> and <hi>indefinite</hi> Words, which People may put a Meaning to, just as they are led by their Imaginations.</p>
            <p>Another Thing mentioned to the disadvantage of those, who han't so good a Thought of the Times as some of their Brethren is,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Mr. MCGRECORY'S <hi>Sermon on the Trial of the Spirits.</hi>
               </note> "That they are Men of ARMINIAN, PELAGIAN and DEISTICAL Principles." It is conceded indeed, "that there are some weaker Brethren, both of <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> who are led in to oppose this Work, who are yet no <hi>Arminians:</hi>" But for the "most <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>inveterate</hi> Opposers, they are Men of ARMINIAN and PELAGIAN principles; and those others are only <hi>Deputy,</hi> or <hi>second-band</hi> Opposers."
<pb n="398" facs="unknown:005151_0445_1016C8EBF65F01A0"/>
The Idea here conveyed to the World is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently this, that the Gentlemen of most <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Significancy,</hi> in the Opposition to the Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Land, are known to be of bad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And is this the real Truth of the Case? So far from it, that a more <hi>palpable Mistake</hi> could not have been publish'd to the World; and the Man who publish'd it, must be either grosly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Characters of those he undertook to write against, not knowing whereof he affirm'd; or otherwise, must be look'd upon as acting a very dishonest Part. For 'tis notorious to all, in any tolerable Measure, acquainted with <hi>Men,</hi> or Things, at this Day, that the <hi>principal Opposers</hi> are among those of an establish'd Reputation for their Orthodoxy. CALVINISTS in Principle, now are, and always have been from the Beginning, the <hi>principal</hi> and most <hi>inveterate</hi> Enemies to our grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confusions: Not such CALVINISTS as are <hi>weak,</hi> and fit only to be made <hi>Tools</hi> of by Men of other Principles; but Men of as good Parts and Learning as any we have in the Land, and universally acknowledged to be so. I could wish it were here proper to mention Names: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would so effectually tend to wipe off this Reproach, which has been publickly reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some of the <hi>greatest Men,</hi> and <hi>best Friends to Religion,</hi> we have in the Country.</p>
            <p>There are, no doubt, among those who speak against Disorders, some of bad Principles; yea, of no Principles at all: [The Number of these <hi>latter,</hi> instead of being diminished, has, perhaps, of late, been greatly increased] But to give it as the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>principal</hi> Gentlemen, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevent Confusion in the Church of GOD, that they are ARMINIANS and PELAGIANS,

because this may be true of some, who an't much concerned about Religion, nor pretend that they are, is very Abusive: 'Tis especially so, to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest such a Thing of the <hi>Ministers;</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because they are generally in a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Way of thinking. As for PELAGIANISM, 'tis a base Slander, to publish it to the World, as if any Ministers in the Country entertain'd a favourable Opinion of it: Nor can I suppose, there are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as some suggest, who think with ARMINIUS. But if they were more numerous, yea, if they were generally ARMINIANS, (which is far from the Truth) how would this justify the <hi>Disorders</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of? These may be as <hi>bad</hi> in their Nature and Tendency, and as of great Extent, as if they were strong CALVINISTS. And to speak freely, the raising a popular Clamour against <hi>Ministers,</hi> by giving them a Name of <hi>Odium,</hi> carries with it no reasonable Ground of Conviction: Nor can it be of any real Service. It may obstruct their Usefulness; but has no Tendency to clear up the Truth: It may excite their Passions, and provoke to Wrath, and seldom fails of doing so, to the great Hurt of Religion; but it can never instruct their Understandings, or alter their Sentiments.—It would discover a much better Spirit, if they have oppos'd any Thing that is really good, to show plainly, and distinctly, wherein they have done so, from the <hi>Bible,</hi> that sacred and only Test, in all Matters pertaining to Conscience and Salvation.—This would be to speak to the Purpose, and to argue like Men and Christians.—</p>
            <p>In fine, The Discouragers of the Things amiss, at this Day, have been represented, <q>as Men destitute of all serious Sense of Religion, as loose
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:005151_0447_1016C8F04593CBA0"/>
in their Lives, and no real Friends to the Power of Godliness.</q> And if this should be allowed to be the Truth as to <hi>some,</hi> why must others be tho't the worse of upon their Account? Have none, among the <hi>Friends</hi> to the <hi>Extraordinaries</hi> of the present Day, made it evident to the World, that they were the basest of Hypocrites? Have none of them been guilty of Wickedness, aggravated to a far greater Height, than can be proved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the worst Opposer in the Land? And would it be fair, because of the Hypocrisy and Vileness of some, to speak, in general, of the Rest, as meer Pretenders to Religion? Would not this be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as horribly unjust? And if 'tis so on one Side, must it not be so on the other?</p>
            <p>I know, the <hi>Instruments</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> of the <hi>present Work,</hi> do, many of them, make high Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Sanctity above other Men; while those, who have testified against the Disorders prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Land, have not, in like Ways, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended themselves. They have not indeed tho't it decent to proclaim their own Goodness, so as to despise others, and it may be, their <hi>Betters?</hi> But they may be good Men notwithstanding And, perhaps, if a strict Scrutiny was to be made, as eminent Christians, both <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> would be found among <hi>these,</hi> as are to be met with any where in NEW-ENGLAND. Comparisons (as the Vulgar phrase it) are odious; otherwise the Men might be called for, who should equal <hi>many</hi> who are spoken of as <hi>Opposers.</hi> We know indeed the Persons that would be pitch'd upon: And what are their Characters, in Compare with a <hi>very considerable Number</hi> of those who have been evil-spoken of, in these Times? Have the Men, through whose Means, a Clamour has been rais'd
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:005151_0448_1016C8F44B923438"/>
against them, ever given the World, one tenth Part of the Evidence, either of their <hi>Goodness as Christians,</hi> or <hi>Diligence and Fidelity</hi> as <hi>Pastors to the particular Flocks committed to their Charge?</hi> Are not the Gentlemen, who have been most admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, generally young in Years, and Christian Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as well as of small Attainments in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And is it possible, they could have given such Proof of a <hi>good Character</hi> as those, who, for a Course of Years, have said fully preach'd the Truth as it is in JESUS, and set an Example to their People of all the Virtues and Graces of the Christian Life? And may not this be justly said of many who have been injuriously reflected on, for not falling in with the Times? The plain Truth is, as valuable Men, in all Respects, as any we have in the Country, are in the <hi>Opposition</hi> to the <hi>bad Things</hi> prevailing in it; and the ranking them with Persons of loose Lives, and no Religion, is basely to reproach them.</p>
            <p>Other Instances, wherein Blame has been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly thrown upon the faithful Witnesses against the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Disorders</hi> of the Day, might have been mention'd; but as they are of smaller Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I must leave them, to make room for what yet remains to come under Consideration.</p>

            <head>Shewing what Things ought to be corrected, or avoided, in testifying against the Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the present Day.</head>
            <p>SOME, perhaps, of all Characters, have found Fault with the Disorders prevailing in the Country, at this Day: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such various Sorts of Persons, it may not be thought strange, if there are those who have conducted themselves in a Manner liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Wherein any have been faulty, 'tis rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable they should submit to Correction, and take Care to avoid the like Mistakes for the Time to come.</p>
            <p>Some, it may be, have been too free with their Complaints against the Times, who have had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Opportunity to know the real State of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the Land, and not a sufficient Capacity to form and adequate Idea of it.—This, it must be own'd, is a Fault, and ought to be corrected.—'Tis a Disservice to the Cause of Truth and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for Persons of weak Minds, and small Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:005151_0450_1016C8F9895534B8"/>
with Matters in Agitation, to speak of them with Assurance and Confidence, as though all Knowledge would die with them. And this may be worthy the Consideration of those, who would be thought the best <hi>Friends</hi> to the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> as well as others; for I can't suppose it will be denied, that those among them, whose Capacities and Advantages to know the Truth, have been smallest, have yet been confident and out-ragious in their <hi>Speech,</hi> as well as <hi>Behaviour:</hi> Whereby, instead of serving any good End, they have rather excited the Pity, and expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Contempt of others.</p>
            <p>Some, it may be, have exprest themselves with too much Warmth, and in Language savouring rather of Anger and Wrath, than that Meekness of Wisdom, which is the Glory of Christians, as discovering in them a near Resemblance to the lovely JESUS.—Wherever there has been such a Spirit of Bitterness, appearing in unkind harsh Words, it ought to be corrected, and, for the Time to come, avoided.—<hi>A soft Answer turneth away Wrath, but grievous Words stir up Anger.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some, it may be, have spoken of the Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies they have seen others running into, with an Air of Levity: Instead of being inwardly concerned for the Dishonour reflected on GOD, and the Hurt done to Religion, they have rather made merry with the unadvis'd Conduct of the Zealots of the present Day; taking Notice of it only for their Diversion.—Wherein this has been the Manner of any, they will not, in calm Tho'ts, go about to justify themselves.—'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a Fault they are chargeable with; and it may disserve the Interest of CHRIST, if it be not amended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="404" facs="unknown:005151_0451_1016C8FC1D7CB0D8"/>
Some, it may be, have been severe in censur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mistakes of others, who order their own Conversation, rather by fleshly Wisdom than the Grace of GOD; who live according to the Course of this World, rather than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law: And though they cry out of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities, they have no View herein to the Honour of the REDEEMER, and the flourishing of his Kingdom. Such are faulty in the main Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their Minds.—They cannot more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be applied to, than in our SAVIOUR'S Words, <hi>Why beholdest thou the Mote that is in thy Brother's Eye, but considerest not the Beam that is in thine own Eye?—Thou Hypocrite, first cast out the Beam out of thine own Eye; and then sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Some, it may be, have taken Occasion, from what they have seen in some <hi>enthusiastical</hi> Persons, to speak flightily of the blessed SPIRIT, if not to decry his <hi>Office,</hi> and ridicule <hi>his Influences</hi> upon the Minds of Men: Than which there is scarce a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

their own Minds, or the Suggestions of Satan, for divine Impressions. But an ill Use may be made of such Mistakes: And it may be feared, whether this han't been too much the Case, in these Times. If any, from the <hi>Wildness</hi> and <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasm</hi> they have seen, have had Prejudices ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in them against the SPIRIT, as the <hi>appointed Dispenser</hi> of GOD's <hi>Grace;</hi> or been led to express themselves in an unbecoming Manner of those <hi>Influences,</hi> by which the Work of GOD is begun, and carried on, in the Souls of Men, they have much to be humbled for, and correct: Nor can they be too much upon their Guard, for the Time to come; for 'tis only by the <hi>Operations</hi> of the Divine SPIRIT, that they can be form'd to a Meetness for the Favour of GOD here, or the Enjoyment of him hereaster: And, of all Men, they will be the most unlikely to be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him, if they suffer themselves to think or speak contemptuously of his Operations, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> they were nothing more than Delusion and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
            <p>In fine, some, not sutably distinguishing between Religion in its own Nature, and as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in the Conduct of some over zealous Persons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of entertaining an ill Thought only of that which is ill, may have condemned Religion in the whole, as a wild imaginary Thing.

It is just Matter of Lamentation, thus any have set Religion in such an <hi>ugly Light</hi> by their extravagan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> behaviour, as to excite Prejudices in the Minds of others against it: Though Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in itself, is not really the worse, nor should it suffer in the Opinion of any, because of the Impeadences and Follies of those, who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:005151_0453_1016C9010462AA58"/>
it's very good Friends. This is unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.—It ought not to be mentioned to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of Religion, that some, who have made high Pretences to it, have set it forth, in their Conduct, as something wild and fanciful. Is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion accountable for the Madness of those, who say they have a Regard to it? Is it fit, any should speak of it as a phrensical Business, because Men of an <hi>enthusiastical</hi> Turn have given, in their Lives, such an Idea of it? In judging of the Truth, or Sobriety of Religion, the Question ought not to be, what is it as exemplified by its Professors? But what is it as contained in the <hi>Revelation of GOD?</hi> If, as 'tis here exhibited, it approves itself to the Understanding and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, appears worthy of GOD, and in the best Manner calculated to promote the Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it ought to be received, and submitted to, as the great Rule of Faith and Practice; and this, notwithstanding its forbidding Aspect, from the Copy of it, by Men of heated Fancies.—We ought to be upon our Guard, that we don't take up Prejudices against Religion; especially at a Time, when such Things pass for high Flights in it, which rather argue some Degree of Disturbance in the Imagination: And our Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be the greater, because of the bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a wrong Biass on the Mind.—It will strangely tend to blind our Eyes, and prepare the Way to our treating Religion with Neglect, or Contempt; than which, nothing can be more dangerous to our Souls, or put their Salvation to a greater Risque.</p>
            <p>These are the chief Things (so far as my Knowledge extends) that need Correction, among the Complainers of Irregularities in the Land:

Not that I would insinuate as if all were faulty in these Articles; or, indeed any considerable Number, unless among the loose and prophane, of which Sort, it must be own'd, there are too many: And it has unhappily been an Occasion of unkind Reflections on those of a very different Character.—On both Sides of the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, which is become general, there are, no doubt, <hi>bad</hi> Men as well as <hi>good;</hi> but they ought to be denominated one, or 'tother, from their known <hi>habitual Temper</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> and not from their being on this, or the other Side of the Question in Debate. This, is very unfair; and would certainly be complained of as such, if those, who would be thought Friends to the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> should be spoken of as a Parcel of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, because some among them have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this to be their true Character.—It were to be wish'd, that all who call themselves the Friends of CHRIST really were so, and that all who complain of <hi>Disorders</hi> had upon their Minds a just. Sense of the Importance of eternal Things. This would have a good Aspect on Religion; and we might hope soon to see a new Face of Things in the Land.</p>

            <head>Directing more positively to what may be judged the best Expedients to promote the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion at this Day.</head>
            <p>THIS is an important Head of Discourse, and would have required Enlargement, but that many Things are well said upon it by Mr. EDWARDS, in his late Book; which, if He, and I, and Others, would carefully attend to, it might do much towards putting an End to our present Difficulties.</p>
            <p>He is certainly right in saying,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 328.</note> 
               <q>That a great deal need to be done at confessing of Faults, on both Sides;</q> though, perhaps, none are so proper to make a beginning, as some among the <hi>chief Instruments</hi> in the late Commotion: For they are the Persons, who have openly injur'd their Brethren, by exciting Prejudices in the Minds of People against them, to the great Hurt of their Reputation and Usefulness in the World: Nor
<pb n="409" facs="unknown:005151_0456_1016C909A8FA95D8"/>
can I see, how they will answer it to their own Consciences, or GOD, unless, in this Way, they repair the Damage they have done their Character. And wherein those called <hi>Opposers</hi> have, in like Manner, publickly done that which is a Dishonour to GOD, or an Injury to their Neighbour, they also are equally oblig'd to make public Satisfaction.—But if Retractations are made, it may be hoped, they will be different from some that have been published of late, which seem rather calculated to qualify the Persons who made them to do still more Mischief, than to take the Shame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that is their just Due.</p>
            <p>I heartily join with him likewise in calling Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to<note n="†" place="bottom">330.</note> 
               <q>the Exercise of extraordinary Meekness and Forbearance</q>—the contrary whereto, <q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">332.</note> is each Party's stigmatising one another with odious Names, as is done in many Parts of NEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENGLAND; which tends greatly to widen and propagate the Breach. Such distinguishing Names (as it follows) do, as it were, divide us into two Armies separated and drawn up in Battle-array, ready to sight with one another; which greatly hinders the <hi>Work of GOD.</hi>
               </q> I could wish this <hi>Gentleman</hi> had wrote more under the habitual Influence of this Advice: He would not then, so often in his <hi>Book,</hi> have spoken of those, who may'nt think just as he does upon the Times, as <hi>Opposers</hi> of the <hi>Work of GOD,</hi> and under some other Names of known Disgrace. And as he has here taken Liberty<note n="‡" place="bottom">337.</note> "to intreat those that oppose this Work, to leave off concerning themselves so much about others, and look into their own Souls, and see that they are the Subjects
<pb n="410" facs="unknown:005151_0457_1016C90B3A383C60"/>
of a true, saving Work of the SPIRIT of GOD" I would, in the Spirit of Love and Meekness, return back the same Intreaty to those, who call themselves the Friends of <hi>GOD's Work,</hi> begging that they would look more narrowly into the State of their own Hearts, and not censure and condemn others. Nor will it be thought, that this Advice is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable, so long as 'tis a known Fact, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable censorious Judging is <hi>a Fault</hi> that has generally prevailed, and to a high Degree of Guilt, among those who would be thought the best Wishers to the Interest of CHRIST, at this Day.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Prayer</hi> also with <hi>Fasting</hi>" is an excellent Means to be attended at such a Time as this; though I see not of what peculiar Advantage it would be,<note n="‡" place="bottom">363.</note> 
               <q>if there could be some Contrivance that there should be an Agreement of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are in AMERICA, that are well affected to this Work, to keep a Day of Fasting and Prayer, wherein they should all unite in humbling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves before GOD,&amp;c.</q> A warm Imagination may conceive of great Things from such a Fast; but I know not that it would be more acceptable to GOD, or to better Purpose, than one of less Extent.</p>
            <p>Nor will it be denied,<note n="†" place="bottom">349.</note> 
               <q>That Care should be taken, that our <hi>Colleges</hi> should be so regulated, that they should be <hi>Nurseries</hi> of <hi>Piety,</hi>
               </q> as far as is possible; tho' some take it amiss, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> has here said that which is capable of being interpreted as an Insinuation of a Want of due Care in this Respect; especially at a Time,
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:005151_0458_1016C90DC6367828"/>
when the Prejudices of many, against the <hi>Colleges,</hi> are strong, and operate much to their Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.—I can't but think we have Reason for Thankfulness, that these Societies are under so good a Regulation; having those at their Head, who are so capable and well-spirited to serve the great Ends of their Constitution. I have known the general State of the <hi>College</hi> in this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upwards of 20 Years; And, if it might not be thought assuming too much, I would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to say, that it was never, in that Time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der better Circumstances, in Point of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, good Order,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> than at this Day. There are those, I am sensible, who have said that which has a Tendency to hurt the Credit of the <hi>Colleges;</hi> but they notwithstanding still flourish as our chief Glory: And I pray GOD they may go on to do so, as long as the Sun and the Moon shall endure.</p>
            <p>Another Thing I concur with this Gentleman in mentioning as of very great Importance, at this Day; and that is, People's<note n="†" place="bottom">367. and onwards.</note> 
               <q>taking Heed, that, while they abound in external Duties of Devotion, such as praying, hearing, singing, and attending religious Meetings, there be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Care to abound in <hi>moral Duties,</hi> such as Acts of Righteousness, Truth, Meekness, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness and Love towards our Neighbour; which are of much greater Importance in the Sight of GOD, than all the Externals of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.—They are abundantly more insisted on by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> in the old Testament, and CHRIST and his <hi>Apostles</hi> in the new. When these two Kinds of Duties are spoken of together, the <hi>moral</hi> ones are
<pb n="412" facs="unknown:005151_0459_1016C911E5A9EC08"/>
ever-more greatly preferred. Often, when the Times were very corrupt in ISRAEL the People abounded in <hi>external</hi> Duties, but were at such Times always notoriously deficient in <hi>moral</hi> ones.—Hypocrites and self-righteous Persons do much more commonly abound in the <hi>former Kind</hi> of Duties, than the latter; as CHRIST re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the <hi>Pharisees, Matth.</hi> 23. 14, 15, and 34. When the Scripture directs us to <hi>shew our Faith by our Works,</hi> it is <hi>principally</hi> the <hi>latter Sort</hi> that are intended.—And we are to be judged at the last Day, especially by these <hi>latter Sort</hi> of Works.—These <hi>latter Sort</hi> of Duties put greater Honour upon GOD, because there is greater Self-Denial in them. The <hi>external</hi> Acts of Worship, consisting in bodily Gestures, Words and Sounds, are the cheapest Part of Religion, and least contrary to our Lusts: The Difficulty of thorow Religion don't lie in them. Let wicked Men enjoy their Covete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and their Pride, their Malice, Envy, Revenge, and their Sensuality and Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in their Behaviour among Men, and they will be willing to compound the Matter with GOD, and submit to <hi>what Forms of Worship you please,</hi> and <hi>as many as you please;</hi> as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the JEWS of old, in the Days of the PROPHETS, and the PHARISEES in CHRIST'S Time, and the PAPISTS and MAHOMETANS in this Day.</q>

            <p>Several Things, further offer'd to Consideration by this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> re well calculated to promote the Interest of Religion, in this Day of Disorder: But instead of repeating these, I shall add a few <hi>Expedients</hi> of another Nature, a due Regard to which, I cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="413" facs="unknown:005151_0460_1016C9137AC78FC8"/>
from our present Difficulties, and greatly serve the Cause of CHRIST and his <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first is, the putting a Stop to <hi>Itinerant Preaching.</hi> This, I doubt not, is the true Cause of most of the Disorders, we have seen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And 'till this be removed, other Attempts to bring us into a better State, will be likely to prove ineffectual. I know, it will be said, Good has been done by this Way of Preaching; why then should it be discouraged? And don't the same Men who say, Good has been done by the preaching of <hi>Itinerants,</hi> allow that Good also has been done by the <hi>Exhorters,</hi> whether <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male?</hi> And yet they are now made sensible, even the most <hi>zealous</hi> among them, that <hi>Exhorters</hi> ought to be put down. And why not <hi>Itinerants?</hi> If they have been instrumental in doing Good, have they not also been a Means of doing Hurt?—If this <hi>Itinerancy</hi> is in it self a <hi>disorderly</hi> Practice, (as has, I trust, been made evident in these Pages) it ought, though some Good should have followed upon it, to be discouraged: Nor otherwise may it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, Things will be reduced to an orderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular State in the Land. And it should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged <hi>universally,</hi> if at all. The doing it in respect of some, while others are encouraged in the Practice, is downright <hi>Partiality.</hi> If the Thing it self is bad, 'tis so in one as well as another.—No one, let his Character be what it will, ought to be countenanced in this vagrant Way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where Churches are already formed, and have <hi>Pastors</hi> fixed in them.—If any Man thinks he may do more abundant Service by <hi>Itinerating,</hi> let him go where he won't invade other Men's Rights, and promote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and there will then be no Ground of Complaint.—Let him go 
<pb n="414" facs="unknown:005151_0461_1016C91622B865B0"/>
among the <hi>Natives</hi> to the <hi>East,</hi> or <hi>West;</hi> or, if he don't chuse that, let him go into VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GINIA, or rather NORTH-CAROLINA, where (as I have lately had Information that may certainly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be depended on) there is scarce a <hi>Bible</hi> to be met with, in Multitudes of their Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or a <hi>Minister</hi> for a <hi>hundred Miles</hi> together. I can't indeed learn, that there are above two or three Ministers within the Confines of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>But how shall a Stop be put to this <hi>Itinerant Preaching?</hi> To which, if it might not be thought taking too much upon me, I would say, that, if the <hi>Ministers,</hi> in their <hi>several Associations,</hi> would come into an Agreement among themselves to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>Itinerant</hi> into their Pulpits, and propose their Agreement to their <hi>respective Churches</hi> that they might strengthen them in it; I can't but think, it would have a powerful Tendency to give Check to this Practice, which has occasioned so much <hi>Alienation</hi> in the Minds of Ministers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, and of People towards Ministers. I am sensible, <hi>all</hi> would not be pleas'd with such an Agreement; but if I am not exceedingly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the Sentiments of by far the greatest Part of the <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> in this PROVINCE, they would not act in Contradiction to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by coming into something of this Nature. But whether this, or any other Method, may be judged most effectual to discourage the <hi>Itinerancy,</hi> the Discouragement of the <hi>Thing it self</hi> appears to me to be a Matter of no small Importance to the <hi>Well-being of these Churches:</hi> And if the <hi>Ministers,</hi> at their <hi>Association Meetings,</hi> would seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of some Way, in which this might be best done, it would not be Time ill-spent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="415" facs="unknown:005151_0462_1016C917EF556E80"/>
It might also be of good Tendency, at this Day, if the <hi>Pulpits,</hi> in our several Churches, were so guarded, as that no raw unqualified Persons might be suffered, upon any Terms, to go into them: And if the <hi>Candidates of the Ministry</hi> were obliged to pass other Tryals than have as yet been in Use, before they might preach, we should, I believe, in Time, see the good Effect of it. The Want of proper Caution, in this Respect, has long been complained of; though the Inconveniencies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising herefrom have not been so sensibly perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in the late Times. I can think of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy more sutable in this Case than that, which, about 40 Years ago, was provided by a <hi>Convention of Ministers at</hi> BOSTON, and published in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words.<note n="†" place="bottom">See Dr. COTTON MATHER'S <hi>Account of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Churches of</hi> NEW-ENGLAND, Page 118, 119, 120.</note>

                        <p>It is a thing of Great Consequence to the Safety and Welfare of our Churches, and the Interests of our Holy Religion are not a little concerned in it, That the <hi>Candidates of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Ministry,</hi> from time to time arising a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, should still be offered unto the Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Churches, under the Advantage of their having undergone a due TRAIL of their <hi>Qualifications,</hi> for so solemn, and sacred a Service. And it hath long been the Wish of
<pb n="416" facs="unknown:005151_0463_1016C9198E50CF68"/>
prudent Men, who wish well to the Interests of Religion, That none of our Christian <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may countenance any, who shall set up for publick Preachers of the Gospel, until they can produce a <hi>Testimonial</hi> of their having been duely proved and approved, as <hi>Qualified</hi> for so Weighty an Undertaking.</p>
                        <p>Therefore,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is proposed, that every <hi>Candidate of the Ministry,</hi> be furnished with a TESTIMONIAL, under the Hands of at least <hi>Four</hi> or <hi>Five settled Pastors</hi> in our Churches, of his having been <hi>Tried,</hi> upon the EXPECTED ARTICLES, and of his being upon <hi>Trial</hi> found competently <hi>Qualified,</hi> for the Encouragements of a <hi>publick Preacher</hi> among the Congregations of GOD in the Land.

                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. It is proposed, That the EXPECTED ARTICLES on which the <hi>Candidates of the Ministry</hi> shall be <hi>Tried,</hi> shall be these:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. He shall be one of a <hi>Blameless Life;</hi> and therefore one that hath actually joined unto a <hi>particular Church,</hi> for Communion in all <hi>special Ordinances.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. He shall give the <hi>Triers</hi> an Account of the <hi>Principles</hi> that act him, in his Desire to Preach the Gospel; which may satisfy their Judicious Charity, that he is acted by the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Principle</hi> of Love to CHRIST and Souls, in his Intentions.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="417" facs="unknown:005151_0464_1016C91BDA48AB10"/>
3. He shall be <hi>tried,</hi> how far he is acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Three learned Languages,</hi> and with the <hi>Sciences</hi> commonly taught in the <hi>Academical Education:</hi> And so much Acquaintance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal shall be required, as may be judged ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely needful for the Services whereto he is designed.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Before <hi>Three</hi> of the <hi>Triers</hi> at least, he shall Preach a <hi>Probationary Sermon,</hi> on a Text, at a <hi>Time,</hi> and in a <hi>Place,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> shall appoint; and they shall upon Hearing pronounce his Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> to be such as give them Satisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. He shall be examined, What Authors in <hi>Theology</hi> he has read; and he shall particularly make it evident, That he has considerately read, <hi>Ames</hi> his <hi>Medulla Theologioe:</hi> [Or, some other generally allowed <hi>Body of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.]</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. His Abilities to <hi>Refute Errors</hi> are to be tried, by putting Instances unto him, as the <hi>Triers</hi> may judge most convenient.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. He shall declare to the <hi>Triers</hi> his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto, <hi>the Confession of Faith,</hi> agreed by the Churches of NEW-ENGLAND, and <hi>the Assembly of Divines</hi> at WESTMINSTER.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It is proposed, That if the <hi>Pastors</hi> of our Churches are so unadvised, as to employ in <hi>publick Preaching</hi> any <hi>Candidate of the Ministry</hi> who hath neglected or contemned the <hi>Trial</hi> propounded for such Persons, it shall be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an <hi>Offence;</hi> and it shall be, by the <hi>Pastors</hi> in the Neighbourhood, signified unto such an one, that if he do not acknowledge his <hi>Offence,</hi> he shalt be dealt withal, as one that <hi>Walks dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly.</hi>

IV. It is proposed, That if any <hi>Congregations</hi> be so unadvised, as to invite unto <hi>publick Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> any <hi>Candidate of the Ministry,</hi> who has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided the <hi>Trial</hi> aforesaid, the <hi>Pastors</hi> of the Churches in the Neighbourhood, shall not only refuse to concur in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of a Person who has so <hi>shunned the Light,</hi> but also write unto the said <hi>Congregations</hi> a suitable <hi>Admonition</hi> for the <hi>Disorder,</hi> by which they thus expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the <hi>Devices of Satan.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. It is proposed, That when any Tried <hi>Candidate of the Ministry</hi> is to be ordained unto the <hi>Pastoral Charge,</hi> he shall, unto the <hi>Elders and Messengers</hi> of the Churches, who are invited un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his <hi>Ordination,</hi> make due answers unto such <hi>Questions</hi> as their <hi>Moderator</hi> shall propound, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to his present <hi>Capacities</hi> and <hi>Inclination,</hi> to serve the Kingdom of GOD, and unto the <hi>Flock</hi> unto which he should now become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>

            </q>
            <p>If this, for Substance, or something of the like Nature, might be united in by <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as a Rule of Conduct, so as none but such as had gone thro' the <hi>proper Tryals</hi> might be <hi>set up in our Pulpits,</hi> it would prevent those Disorders, which may naturally be expected, when <hi>meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> are encouraged, (and without Examination) to take upon them the Work of Ministers.</p>
            <p>A wrong Use of the <hi>Passions,</hi> in the Business of Religion, is likewise a Matter highly needful to be guarded against at this Day. There is, no Doubt, a good Use to be made of the Passions.—They were not in vain planted in our Nature;—but because wisely adapted to serve many Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:005151_0466_1016C921DBE71CB8"/>
in the <hi>religious</hi> as well as the <hi>natural</hi> Life.—But they are capable of being <hi>abused,</hi> and have actually been so; as is abundantly evident from many of the Disorders prevailing in these Times.—</p>
            <p>As <hi>a Preservative</hi> against <hi>such Abuse,</hi> I know of nothing more effectual than what has been wrote by the excellent Dr. WATTS, in his <hi>Discourses</hi> upon <hi>this Subject.</hi> I shall transcribe from them a few Instances of the <hi>Abuse of the Passions,</hi> which, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will not be tho't, by the more sober among us, unworthy a heedful Attention at this Day.</p>

            <p>
               <q>Some Persons, as soon as they begin to find fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Light dawning upon their Minds, and are let into the Knowledge of some Doctrine or Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they knew not before, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set their Zeal to work: Their Zeal is all on a Flame to propagate and promote this new Lesson of Truth, before their own Hearts are well established in it upon solid Reasonings.—How common a Case is it among <hi>Christians,</hi> and too often found among <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, to give a Loose to their Affections at the first G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>mpse of some pleasing Opinion, or some fresh Discovery of what they call Truth? They help out the Weakness of the Proof by the Strength of their Passions:—This confirms their Assent too soon, and they grow deaf to the Arguments that are brought to oppose it.
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:005151_0467_1016C9237045E130"/>
They construe every Text in the Scripture to support this Doctrine, they bring in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles to maintain it. They fancy they see it in a thousand Verses of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> and they pronounce all Men <hi>Hereticks</hi> that dare maintain the contrary Opinions.</q>—He further observes,</p>
            <p>
               <q>There have been some weak Christians when they have heard a Sermon, or read a Discourse full of sublime Language and Darkness, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially if the Stile and Manner has been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>pathetic,</hi> they have been raptured and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, as though it contained the deepest Sense, the noblest Truths of Religion, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Discoveries of Grace and the Gospel: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, perhaps, there may be scarce any Thing in it which has a just Agreement with Reason or Scripture; but, when well examined, it proves to be a meer Jargon of Words, a Mixture of unintelligible and unmeaning Sounds, with some affectionate Airs among them, whereby their Passions were fir'd, and that without Knowledge, and beyond all Reason.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next Abuse of the Passions he mentions is,<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 226, 227.</note> 
               <q>When we encourage them to rise high, and grow very warm about the lesser Things of Religion, and yet are content to be cold and indifferent in Matters of the <hi>highest Importance.</hi> There are too many Christians whose warmest Zeal is employed about the <hi>Mint,</hi> the <hi>Anise,</hi> and the <hi>Cummin</hi> of Christianity, Mat. 23. 23. And have few Passions awakened, or engaged, in the <hi>weighty</hi> Things of the <hi>Law,</hi> or the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel!</hi> They are suriously intent upon <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>

Notions, and some peculiar Opinions that distinguish the little Parties of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and crumble the Church to Pieces: Their <hi>Fears,</hi> their <hi>Hopes,</hi> their <hi>Wishes,</hi> their <hi>Desires,</hi> their <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> are all employ'd in <hi>Party-Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,</hi> and a <hi>Strife of Words:</hi> But they are thoughtless about the momentous Duties of <hi>Love</hi> to GOD and CHRIST, of <hi>Justice</hi> to Men, of <hi>Charity</hi> to Fellow-Creatures, and Fellow-Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. So a sickly Fancy is fond of Trifles, and careless of solid Treasures: So Children have their little Souls wrapt up in painted Toys, while the Matters of manly Life awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en no Desire, no Delight in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The last Abuse I shall mention from this valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Author is,<note n="†" place="bottom">P. 234, 235.</note> 
               <q>When the Passions are suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to entrench upon other Duties either to GOD or <hi>Man,</hi> and withhold us from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Business of our <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Station</hi> in the World. Though the Passions should be indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at proper Seasons, yet they should not so far govern all the Powers of Nature, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross the Moments of Life, as to make us neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any necessary Work to which the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD hath called us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Case, when Persons find so much <q>Sweetness in their religious Retirements, that they dwell there too many Hours of the Day, and neglect the Care of their Families, the Conduct of their Children and Servants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary Duties of Life, and let all Things run at Random in their Houshold, under the Excuse of Religion, and Converse with GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="422" facs="unknown:005151_0469_1016C92AD4358DB0"/>
               <q>'Tis the same culpable Conduct, when Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are tempted to run from Sermon to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from Lecture to Lecture, in order to maintain their spiritual Pleasures, with a flight and careless Performance of <hi>relative Duties.</hi> 'Tis yet more criminal in Persons of low Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the World, who would spend all their Time in hearing, or reading good Things, or at some religious Assemblies or Conferences, while they grosly and grievously neglect their common Duties of providing for themselves and their Children. They are ready to expect the Rich should maintain them, while they make their devout Affections an Excuse for their shameful Idleness and Sloth. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member there is a Time for <hi>working</hi> as well as a Time for <hi>praying</hi> or <hi>hearing. Every Thing is beautiful in its Season.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Instances of the Abuse of the Passions, in these Ways, have not been wanting in these Times: Nor unless some Persons are made sensible of it, and take Care to keep their Passions within the Restraints of Reason, may it be expected that Things should be reduced to a State of Order. There is the Religion of the <hi>Understanding</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Affections;</hi> and if little Account is made of the <hi>former,</hi> while great Stress is laid upon the <hi>latter,</hi> it can't be but People should run into Disorders. "A meer pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate Religion lies very much expos'd to all the wild Temptations of Fancy and Enthusiasm:" Nor can it be too much guarded against.</p>
            <p>Another Thing very necessary, at this Day, is the Use of a <hi>strict Discipline</hi> in our Churches. From whence it arises, that our <hi>Discipline</hi> has been so lax, especially in the Years that are lately past,
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:005151_0470_1016C92EC5DEBB38"/>
I shall not take upon me to determine. The Fact is notorious.—Han't <hi>disorderly Walkers</hi> been suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take their Course, without the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those <hi>Censures</hi> which are proper to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of JESUS CHRIST? Nay, where Persons have openly behaved in an unchristian Manner towards those of the <hi>Community</hi> they were join'd to, both <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> have they been so much as reproved for it in a <hi>Church-Way?</hi> Have they not rather been left to themselves to act as they please, without public Notice, any more than if they sustained no Relation to the Church of GOD? And if it should, in a Measure be attributed to this, that there has been the Increase of Disorders, would it be beside the Truth?—<hi>Discipline</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in all Societies whatever: And where this is neglected, if there is the Appearance of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, what is it more than may justly be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—I presume not to dictate;—But 'tis easy to foretell, without a Spirit of Prophecy, if there is not a <hi>Revival of Discipline,</hi> there will be the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of Disorder.</hi>—Our <hi>Fathers,</hi> under the like Difficulties with those we now complain of, have set us an Example: And I wish, we their <hi>Posterity</hi> had upon Minds as just a Sense of the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of ORDER to the Well-being of the Church of CHRIST, as they discovered in all their Managements.</p>
            <p>The last Thing I shall mention as necessary, at this Day, is, a due Care to <hi>prove all Things,</hi> that we may <hi>hold fast that which is good.</hi> This an inspir'd <hi>Apostle</hi> has directed to: And, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, there never was a Time when a Regard to this Advice was more needful. We have seen enough to convince us, that <hi>Man may not be trusted in;</hi> that the Determinations, whether of <hi>single Persons,</hi> or <hi>public Bodies of Men,</hi> be they who
<pb n="424" facs="unknown:005151_0471_1016C931174751F0"/>
they will, or their Pretences what they will, are not to be received with an <hi>implicit Faith.</hi>—If we would act up to our Character as Men, or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, we must not submit blindfold to the Dictates of others; No, but we should ourselves exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into the Things of GOD and another World: Nor can we be too sollicitous, so far as we are able, to see with our own Eyes, and believe with our own Understandings.</p>
            <p>Only in all our Inquiries of this Nature, let the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> be our <hi>Rule.</hi> This <hi>only</hi> may with Safety be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on.—<q>I see plainly, and with my own Eyes, (said the excellent Mr. CHILLING WORTH), that there are Popes against Popes, Councils against Councils, some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers against others, the same Fathers against themselves, a Consent of Fathers of one Age against a Consent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of another Age, the Church of one Age against the Church of another Age.</q> He adds the following noble Words, in which, if we could all heartily join, it would be happy for us at this Day; <q>There is no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Certainty but of Scripture only.—This therefore, and this <hi>only,</hi> I have Reason to believe: This I will profess; according to this I will live; and for this, if there be Occasion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly, loose my Life.—Propose me any Thing out of this Book, and require whether I believe it or no; and seem it never so incomprehensible to humane Reason, I will subscribe to it with Heart and Hand: as knowing no Demonstration can be stronger than this; GOD hath said so, therefore it is true.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have now finished what I at first proposed, tho' with the Omission of many Things I intended to have said.—<hi>The LORD give us Understanding in all Things.—The GOD of Peace make us perfect in every good Work to do his Will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his Sight, thro' JESUS CHRIST; to whom be Glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</hi>
