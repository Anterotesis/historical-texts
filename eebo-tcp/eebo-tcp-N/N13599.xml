            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE numbering our days, ſo as to apply our hearts unto wiſdom, is not computing the definite ſum total of them to know how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny they ſhall be; but the juſt reckoning them to be few and uncertain, and in conſideration thereof, to live them religiouſly. Yet, to keep an account of thoſe which are paſt, may be a help to the better improvement of thoſe which may be to come, eſpecially in our old age, when the latter muſt appear very few indeed compared with the former, and of the laſt importance to be ſpent well and wiſely by us. The obſervation of our birth-day is to little good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if we do not then with religious ſeriouſneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how many years old we are. There is not in this aſſembly more than one perſon who can adopt the words of the text, and ſay, <hi>I am this day fourſcore and five years old.</hi> Yet, all the aged here may, with him, receive inſtruction therefrom, to remember, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh and concerneth us, how old we are. Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is a common infirmity of old age. The decay of memory is the firſt of their mental faculties which men feel, and are willing to own, and do complain of. In ſome it is to that degree, that they are not able to tell how old they are. But all that can count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the paſt years of their lives, do not apply this knowledge to the good uſes it might ſerve them. That
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017170_0003_0FA06F684E113DF8"/>ſuch of us who are old may ſo remember this, as that our minds may be deeply impreſſed, our affections and actions duly influenced by the conſideration thereof, is the deſign of the preſent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. REMEMBERING how old we are, the goodneſs of God in prolonging our days, ſhould be greatly admired and thankfully acknowledged by us. The boundaries of human life have been different in the ſeveral ages of the world. There have been gradual abbreviations of it from the firſt man, Adam, who lived nine hundred and thirty years, to Moſes, who lived an hundred and twenty. But then, the term fixed by God was threeſcore years and ten. This hath ever ſince been the goal that ſtints our race. Some run beyond it, but the moſt do not reach it. Of David, who lived juſt ſeventy years, it is ſaid, that he died in a good old age, and full of days—being as many as thoſe of a long life, in the ſcripture-account, and of which there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. The addition of ten or fifteen years, was then, and is now, rare, and vouchſafed to very few individuals of mankind. Theſe are diſtinguiſhed from the moſt of their fellow-mortals in the length of their days, and are remarkable inſtances of longevity; and ſhould take ſpecial notice of it themſelves, as doth the pious Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite in the text, <hi>Caleb,</hi> the ſon of Jephunneh the Kene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zite. He was one of the twelve princes, heads of the tribes, whom Moſes, when he came to the borders of Canaan, ſent to ſearch the land: and the only man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Joſhua, the ſon of Nun, that animated the faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to go in, and take poſſeſſion of it. Which he could do with greater aſſurance of ſucceſs in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, becauſe God had promiſed to give him <hi>Hebron,</hi> a city of the moſt gigantic men, and impregnable walls, together with the adjacent country, for his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. To which he put in his claim unto Joſhua, the captain of the Lord's people, ſeven years after he led them into Canaan, and among the ſeveral tribes.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017170_0004_0FA06F690D597330"/>Caleb was probably the oldeſt man of the whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that entered into Canaan—all his cotemporaries dying in the wilderneſs. And with admiration and gratitude he reflected on the goodneſs of God, in the preſervation of his life to that time. <hi>Now behold, the Lord hath kept me alive, as he ſaid, theſe forty and five years ſince the Lord ſpake theſe words unto Moſes, even ſince the children of Iſrael wandered in the wilderneſs: and now lo, I am this day fourſcore and five years old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AN inſtructive example, my aged brethren, is this unto us, to conſider how long God hath kept us alive, and affect our hearts with an admiring and thankful ſenſe of the goodneſs of God therein toward us. The Author is the Preſerver of our lives, who hath given us all things neceſſary to our ſuſtenance, convenient for our uſe, and pleaſant for our enjoyment—<hi>all thoſe things by which men live.</hi> He took us out of the womb, and did make us to hope when we hung on our mothers breaſts. He nurſed our tender infancy, and guarded our heedleſs youth: and having abtained help and mercy of him, we continue unto old age. This ſhould be marvellous in our eyes, while we ſee ſo many dying around us ere they arrive at it. To God our eſcapes from death belong, and ſhould be thankfully aſcribed, when the arrows of it are conſtantly flying ſo thick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us. We have been a-like ſubject as others to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſeaſes and fatal accidents, from which we have been preſerved to this day. Our travel, as Caleb's, hath been through a wilderneſs, in which the carcaſes of the moſt of that generation which ſet out with us are fallen. But God hath kept us alive amidſt innumerable dangers that have ſurrounded us. On which if we look back, our ſouls muſt be filled with wonder, and our mouths <hi>with</hi> praiſe, that we are not deſtroyed from off the earth. Our frail bodies in which we dwell, are hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt: can we but marvel that in ſo many years they are not mouldered down; or that they fell not long ago, when the rain of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017170_0005_0FA06F69CFD29D08"/>affliction deſcended, the floods of ſorrow came, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts of adverſity beat upon them. How often hath God healed our diſeaſes, and brought us back from the gates of death, that we might praiſe him in the land of the living? David in his old age reflecting how marvellouſly he had been holden up from the womb to that time, ſaid, "I am as a wonder unto many." Pſalm 71. He was moſt ſo to himſelf, that he was yet alive, when he thought of the troubles, fatigues, and dangers he had been carried through. How melting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the long-ſuffering God hath ſpared us, while we by our ſins have been continually provoking him to cut off the number of our months in the midſt! He hath prolonged our days, which the indiſcretions and extravagances of our youth; the exceſſes of our appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions would elſe have ſhortned. We ſhould remember all the way which the Lord hath led us theſe ſo many years, and thank him for the conduct of his kind providence in bringing us to a great old age. O bleſs our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praiſe to be heard; who holdeth our ſouls in life. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction.</p>
            <p>BUT, is it ſuch a favour to live to old age, the days of which are evil, and the years ſuch as we are apt to ſay, we have no pleaſure in them? I anſwer, that life is the principal good, the foundation and capacity of our enjoying any: and the lengthening it to old age is an inſtance and diſplay of the goodneſs of a faithful Creator, who hath promiſed it them that follow him in the way of his commandments; as alſo, that goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow them to the end of their days. Iſaiah 46.3.4. Hearken unto me, O houſe of Jacob, ſaith God, and all the remnant of the houſe of Iſrael, which are born by me from the belly, and carried from the womb, and even to your old age I am he, and unto hoar hairs I will carry you, I have made, and I will bear, even I will carry, and will deliver you Such ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017170_0006_0FA06F6A8F8E3D20"/>care of divine providence from the beginning to the end of long life, as theſe words expreſs, certainly demands the thankful acknowledgments of the aged. Were we indeed to live only in this world, ſo full of troubles we meet with in it from wailing infancy to querulous decrepitneſs, it might not be thought ſo great a favour to live unto old age, which is attended with peculiar inconveniences. The evil of theſe days, added to that of the former of our lives, might ſeem more than a balance for the good enjoyed in them all. In the judgment of wiſe Solomon, concerning a man whoſe happineſs is limited to this world, Eccleſi. 6. Though he live a thouſand years twice told, yet hath he ſeen no good—none that makes him happier upon the whole, than if he lived not at all:—hath ſeen no more good than if he never had been born. The vanity and vexation of ſpirit in a life more than twice as long as <hi>Methuſelab</hi>'s, would eat out the heart of all the good in its ſorrows multiplying with the years of it, would render life an inſupportable burthen. "For my part, ſaith Mr. How, upon the ſtricteſt enquiry, I ſee nothing in the life of man upon earth, that ſhould render it for itſelf, more the matter of a rational election (ſuppoſing the free option given him the firſt moment of his being) than preſently again to ceaſe to be the next moment." If we can ſee more good in the preſent life, on the ſuppoſition there is none to follow it, than that heavenly man did, yet we muſt be ſenſible that our beſt days, as to worldly enjoyment, are firſt paſſed, and if with them an end had been put to our exiſtence, we ſhould have been ſo far happy as not to have ſeen the evil of theſe days of old age; and we may have cauſe to think it had been well for us not to have lived to them. But, ſince this life is in order to another, and we are here in a ſtate of probation and preparation for an everlaſting life of perfect felicity; and the good and evil received at the hand of the Lord are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable to our obtaining it, the prolongation of our days
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017170_0007_0FA06F6B4D8F7F20"/>on earth is, on this account, an advantage infinitely exceeding all the diſadvantage thereof. The juſt value of the preſent life is to be eſtimated by it's relation to a future—the dependance which our eternal well-being hath upon it. It is the precious ſeaſon of working out our ſalvation, and making our calling and election ſure: the which requireth, as diligent care and labour, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe competent time. No part of it which is allotted to us for that purpoſe, ſhould we think to be redundant, but fear rather the whole will ſcarce be ſufficient: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when we conſider how much of that which is paſt we have loſt in ſloth and idleneſs. Did we ſet out early to follow God in a religious courſe of life, and make as ſteady and ſpeedy progreſs to the end, as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man frailty ordinarily admits, we may find the longeſt day of life ſhort enough to perform our journey to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Length of days is a real advantage to our improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in virtue, perfecting of holineſs, and attaining to High degrees of glory at laſt. They therefore to whom it is granted, may have great cauſe to thank God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for, whatever inconveniences attend their old age. And yet, it might be in favour to others, that they died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evil came; having lived long enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer life's great end, and be ripe for heaven.—Do any of us continue wicked, that are waxed old? let not the riches of God's goodneſs, forbearance and long-ſuffering, be deſpiſed, but adored by us. Is it leſs wonderful mercy in him, that hath kept us ſo long alive in our rebellion againſt him, than if we had faithfully ſerved him? How admirable is his patience that hath born with us to this day in our ſins—that he hath ſpared us, when multitudes of our coevals (not greater ſinners than we) have been cut off in the midſt of their days? Is it no favor to be ſo long reprieved from death and hell, and to have ſtill opportunity to ſeek for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with the leaſt hope of obtaining it, which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned have not? God is long-ſuffering toward us, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that we ſhould come
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017170_0008_0FA06F6D93625760"/>to repentance; for which the evil days of old age may be a ſpace given us, though not ſo convenient a ſeaſon as we have let ſlip, and irrecoverably loſt. So that whatever our character be, we ſhould admire, and thankfully acknowledge the goodneſs of God in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us alive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To remember, as we ought, how old we are, bringeth death, and it's awful conſequence, in a near and affecting view to us. It conduceth to make us know our end, that it is <hi>near,</hi> it is <hi>near,</hi> and haſteth greatly. This is a point of wiſdom, to which we ſhould apply our hearts, to know practically, or with ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to conſider our latter end, that we ſhortly muſt die out of this world, and enter on eternity. Of this we muſt needs be ſenſible, when we that are old recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect how many years we have already lived—many times more than we can expect ſtill to live. We have not the ſkill of numbering our days, if we reckon not thoſe to come very few indeed compared with thoſe that are paſt. Men judge better of the ſhortneſs of time when it is paſt, than when it is paſſing; and by ſetting a leſſer portion of it againſt a larger. "Few, ſaid Jacob to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, when he was an hundred and thirty years old, have the days of the years of my life been, and have not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers." Gen. 47.7. Do the days of the years we have lived ſeem few? how much fewer, in a comparative view of them, muſt thoſe we may have to live ſeem to us? a day or a year to come, is not longer than one that is paſt. If it appear ſo to us, we meaſure time falſly, and our miſtake, by the leaſt conſideration might be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How long have I to live? ſaid Barzillai to the King—I am this day fourſcore years old. Every man that is ſo old or older, ſhould be as deeply ſenſible, that he hath not long to live. It is vain preſumption in the young, but moſt unreaſonable and abſurd in the aged,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017170_0009_0FA06F6DA7949D38"/>to put far away the evil day of death. Such is the common dotage on life, as to occaſion the remark, that there's no man ſo old but thinks he may live a year longer. Were any of us ſure that we ſhould; is death at no greater diſtance to be unregarded and unprepared for by us: The living know that they ſhall die. From our age and the circumſtances of it, we may with as much certainty conclude that the time of our departure is at hand. The bodily frame is ſo weakened, and ſuch irreparable breaches are made in it, that it's diſſolution is daily to be expected. We may ſay as Job, Our breath is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our vital ſpirits are waſted, our days are extinct, the graves are ready for us. We are tottering over them, and ſhall ſoon tumble into them. This conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the near approach of death, (which is included in the ſerious remembrance of our great age) would be available, in way of rational influence, to bring our hearts unto wiſdom, and engage us to a good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the few uncertain days which may be added to our ſo many paſt years, and ſo to live every day as if it were our laſt. Conſidering ourſelves ſo near the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal world, our great concern would be to get prepared for a ſpeedy removal by death into it, and to appear at that awful bar, before which nature in a very little time will ſet us. "As a ſhip which hath been long at ſea toſs'd and weather-beaten, which is ſhattered in it's tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and hath leſt much of it's rigging, ſhould do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in that caſe but work toward the port, there to find it's ſafety and caſe; ſo ſhould a man, who having paſt many ſtorms and agitations of this world, is grive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly battered and torn with age, ſtrive only to die well, and get ſafe into the harbour of eternal reſt."</p>
            <p n="3">3. REMEMBERING how old we are, and therefore have not long to live, we ſhould review our actions, and repent of out ſins. Happy are thoſe aged ſervants of God who, reſlecting on their paſt behaviour in life,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017170_0010_0FA06F6E541572F0"/>can ſay with him in the text, we have <hi>fully followed the Lord.</hi> But they cannot pretend they have done to without many ſtraying ſteps. Their rejoicing is this, the teſtimony of their conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God, they have their converſation in the world. They ſtill look back with ſorrow and ſhame on the ſins of their youth, and renew their repentance of all they committed before and ſince their converſion; and do not think themſelves ſo righteous in the ſight of God, by imputation, or ſanctification, as not to need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue their repentance in old age, and to the end of their days. Good men die repenting. A repentance unto life is better compleated, than begun, on a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed—If any of us have lived impenitent to old age, and are now to begin the difficult work, for which we have ſo little uncertain time; let us not delay a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer to turn from our evil ways unto the Lord, and follow hard after him. With what confuſion muſt it cover us, to recount the many years we have ſpent in ſin, following worldly luſts and vanities, and have irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably loſt the moſt and beſt of our time and ſtrength given us for the ſervice of God, and the work of our ſalvation. Shall we rob God, and defraud our own ſouls of the ſmall remainder? It was good advice of a Jewiſh Rabbi, Be ſure to repent one day before thy death. If we that are very old mean to do ſo, we muſt repent to-day; for we have leaſt reaſon to boaſt of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow.—But, <hi>can a man be born again, when he is old?</hi> Can he be converted, and become a regenerate child of God, when he is grown old in ſin? It ſeemeth a miracle of grace that he ſhould be ſo; but it is not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of as impoſſible—nothing is ſo with God. To a repentance which is unto ſalvation, the ſuccour of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace is neceſſary; and we do not know it is too late for us to ſeek it: ſoon will it be ſo, if we ſtill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect or refuſe it. To-day, after ſo long a time of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017170_0011_0FA06F6F19097450"/>to the goſpel, are we called upon, not to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our hearts. The goodneſs of God in keeping us alive to this day, leadeth us to repentance, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth us to hope for pardon and acceptance with God, through Jeſus Chriſt, upon it. Wherefore hath the Lord waited, but that he might be gracious; and been ſo long-ſuffering toward us, but that we might have this late opportunity of turning unto him? It is at our infinite peril that we defer a day longer. "Wherefore is our day of trial extended beyond the common term? Is it not indulged to the great need our paſt conduct hath of it? And ſhall our folly reverſe the kind inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that indulgence?" So the bleſſing of long life which God hath given us, will be turned into a curſe, as it is written, Iſa. 65.20, The ſinner being an hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red years old ſhall be accurſed—the more accurſed for dying ſo old an impenitent.</p>
            <p n="4">4. REMEMBERING how old we are, our hearts ſhould be looſened from this world. Our affections to, our cares about, and purſuits after, the things of it be moderated. The conſideration of our having lived ſo many years in it, and muſt therefore ſoon leave it, is proper and uſeful to wean our hearts from it's moſt deſirable enjoyments. Barzillai found it ſo, when David invited him to go and ſpend the reſt of his days in a palace. "The king ſaid unto Barzillai, come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jeruſalem. And Barzillai ſaid unto the king, How long have I to live, that I ſhould go up with the king unto Jeruſalem? I am this day fourſcore years old: and can thy ſervant diſeern between good and evil? Can thy ſervant taſte what I eat, or what I drink? Can I hear any more the voice of ſinging men, and ſinging women? Wherefore then ſhould thy ſervant be yet a burthen unto my Lord the king? They ſervant will go a little way over Jordan with the king: and why ſhould the king recompence
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017170_0012_0FA06F6FDCD66688"/>it me with ſuch a reward? Let thy ſervant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father, and of my mother." The conſideration of his great age prevailed againſt the love of the world, which is deeply rooted in the hearts of men, and is wont, to continue and increaſe until death. All it's alluring baits could not draw him from his home to Jeruſalem, where he might have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in greater ſplendor, wealth and delicacy. All that is tempting in this world—the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, came a-breaſt and aſſaulted him at once; but he withſtood them, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind how old he was. The grandeur and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a court-life, the dainties of a royal table, and charms of muſick, had no force on him to embrace the king's grateful and generous offer. It much better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, he juſtly thought, who was ſo old, and he much rather choſe to retire to his private houſe, where he might paſs his laſt days more free from the dangerous temptations of an inſnaring world, and better prepare for death and the grave, to which he was ſo near. O that we who are old might learn by this noble example, to get our hearts weaned from the world before we are removed, as very ſoon we muſt be, out of it. Surely we forget how old we are, while we mind earthly things, having all our thoughts and cares employ'd about them. If this was our way in youth, and middle age, it was then our folly: much more inexcuſable is it now in our old age. What is more abſurd and ſhocking than to ſee men who are juſt going out of the world, loving it as fondly, and ſcraping for it as eagerly, as if they were never to leave it? What are all the honors, and riches, and pleaſures of it to us, who can ſo little time enjoy them? Did we retain a natural reliſh of them as quick and ſtrong as in youth, this thought might be enough to cool our thirſt, and ſlacken our endeavours after them, and abate our complacence in them. It is our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017170_0013_0FA06F708D891E50"/>ſhame and miſery, if our long experience hath not taught us the vanity of this world. What did we ever get by following it hitherto? Not any thing which ſatisfieth us: nor ſhall we, if we follow it to the end of our days. Vain will all our expectations from this world be found. Is it not in a manner dead to us? And ſhall not we in affection be dead to it?—The aged ſervant of the Lord, who ſaid, <hi>I am this day fourſcore and five years old,</hi> did indeed take a prudent thought and care to ſecure for himſelf and poſterity that part of Canaan which was allotted to him by God, and confirmed with an oath by Moſes.—It is the inordinate love of the world, ſuch as excludeth the love of the Father, and obſtructeth our following the Lord, which we are to take heed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, as moſt ill-becoming our age, who can need, or uſe the things of it but a little while. And as to our children, which may live in this world after us, we ſhould warn them of the evil of covetouſneſs, and not by our anxiety in providing for them leave them an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it. Can we not, in the faith of the dying Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, truſt them to the care of a good God which hath fed us all our life long unto this day? Gen. 48.15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. REMEMBERING how old we are, let patience under the infirmities and afflictions of theſe our evil days have it's perfect work in us. Few that are much younger than Caleb, when he was fourſcore and five years old, can ſay as he did, "as yet I am as ſtrong as I was at forty"—the time when men are in their full ſtrength. If by reaſon of a more than ordinary firm conſtitution, any live to be fourſcore, yet commonly is their ſtrength then <hi>labour and ſorrow.</hi> So decayed are they in body and mind, that they cannot do the buſineſs nor enjoy the comforts of life; which is ſometimes, tho' rarely, extended farther. But the evil days uſually come much ſooner, the years in which men ſay, they have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them. And they are uſually attended with
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017170_0014_0FA06F7156652398"/>ſuch weakneſſes, pains, diſeaſes, diſquiets, miſeries of various kinds, as make folk (ſaith the Roman orator) complain of a load lying upon them heavier than mount <hi>Aetna.</hi> But the conſideration of our great age, may help us to bear the afflictions of it patiently, as knowing it is not long we have to bear them. How full ſoever our evil days are of troubles, they are few, and will ſoon be finiſhed. They are few compared with our good days of youth, and health, and ſtrength, and rejoicing. Have we not many more years of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to remember and thank God for, than we now have of affliction to paſs through in this world? Had we not enjoyed the good of the former, we had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the evil of the preſent. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil? If we would not have lived to old age, why were we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to die before? If we would, why ſhould we repine at the decays of a frail nature, and be diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that we were made men? There is no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or trouble that befalleth us, but what is common to man. It is the condition of humanity to be liable to ſuch infirmities and inconveniences. We ſuffer them by a natural unavoidable neceſſity. "Theſe things in a long life, are like duſt, and dirt, and rain in a long journey." A few weary ſteps more will bring us to the end of our's.—In reſpect of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſtate of things the days are evil, which make theſe of old age the more ſo unto us. If it be not for want of enquiring wiſely concerning this, that we ſay the former days were better than theſe, and we had more pleaſure in them, yet, remembering how old we are, let us in our patience poſſeſs our ſouls, ſubmitting to the providence of God, and believing that he hath wiſe and good reaſon for ſuffering the times to be as they are. Soon will there be an end, if not of theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet of our days, and we ſhall ſee no more the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil work that is done under the ſun.—Should we have
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017170_0015_0FA06F720D3F0978"/>the trial of out-living our ſerviceableneſs in the world, and be laid by as veſſels of no more uſe, the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our being waſted and worn out with age, ſhould make us contented, and others alſo, to whom we may ſeem burthenſome; but ſhall not long be ſo. Paſſive obedience is that which God calleth us to in our age and weakneſs, and in which we muſt ſerve and honour him in the concluſion of our labour.</p>
            <p>IT is one, and not the leaſt, of the melancholy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of old age, to have buried the moſt, or all, of our coeval friends, early acquaintance, and dear companions in the kingdom and patience of Jeſus Chriſt, and be deprived of the benefit and comfort of their ſociety. For, whatever be the reaſon, though we taſte the wine of new friendſhip we have contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it make our hearts glad, yet we are apt to think the old was better. The hope of going ere long to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, ſolaceth the minds of aged chriſtians, when they ſit alone, and feel their want of the company of pious departed friends, with whom they uſed to take ſweet counſel. Having ſet down the names of many who were gone before him into the world of ſpirits, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> writes thus: <hi>"I name theſe for my own delight and comfort; it being pleaſant to me to remember what companions I ſhall have in the heavenly joys, and praiſes of my Lord."</hi> Death diſſolves not the union of ſouls knit to one another in holy love. There is but a ſhort abſence, and they ſhall meet and congratulate in a better world, where the communion of ſaints is perfected.—While in this tabernacle aged chriſtians do groan, being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with many afflictions; but ſhould wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for deliverance therefrom: which, though they have greater reaſon, may be more difficult for them to do, becauſe of the good hope and earneſt deſire in them of paſſing through death to a ſtate of reſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017170_0016_0FA06F72D8F7F7C0"/>in heaven. This trial is peculiar to aſſured chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who have the moſt lively views and expectations of being with the Lord, when they ſhall be abſent from the body. The height of their piety encreaſeth the trial of their patience in waiting for God's ſalvation. The delay of their hopes and deſires, is a ſingular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their patience under the afflictions of this life: eſpecially, when they have many times thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves paſſed the ſtorms and agitations of this world, juſt at harbour, and have been put back again to ſea. The ſhip, however, is ſtill under ſail, and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly making nearer approaches to, and ſhall ſhortly reach their deſired haven. Ye have need of patience, ſaith the author of the epiſtle to the Hebrews, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe: for yet a little while, and he that ſhall come will come, and will not tarry.</p>
            <p n="6">6. REMEMBERING how old we are, let us wholly, and more cloſely follow the Lord to the end of our lives—hold on our way of faithful obedience, and not be tired by the length of it, and be weary of well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. We ſhould take heed that we ſuffer not decays of grace with thoſe of nature; but while our outward man is periſhing, our inward man be renewed day by day. Our diligence ſhould be quickned, our zeal promoted amidſt, and even by our bodily weakneſſes, has they intimate the time of working out our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſhort. We do not, as Caleb did, retain our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vigour to be employed in the ſervice of God, nor can we expect our youth will be renewed in old age, as ſometimes it hath been after ſickneſs; yet waiting upon the Lord, we may (according to his promiſe) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> our ſpiritual <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and <hi>mount up with wings, like eagles</hi> (when they have renewed their plumes, and fly toward heaven, in earneſt deſires and endeavours after higher degrees of grace and holineſs. Are we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:017170_0017_0FA06F73927693E8"/>not too apt to grow remiſs in the buſineſs of religion, dull and ſluggiſh in the performance of the duties of it; and to think our age will excuſe this in us?— whereas this conſideration ſhould urge us to greater diligence in the important work, for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which we have ſo little time remaining. Have we not ſtill much to do, that we may be prepared as we wiſh to be for death and eternity? and O how ſhort a time to do it in? we that are ſo near the grave, where there is not work, ſhould do with all our might that which we are infinitely concerned to finiſh well. Old age hath ſome peculiar advantages for the buſineſs of religion, which we ſhould embrace. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth us from following the world in eager and inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly laborious purſuits; and ſo we may the more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the Lord in the eaſier ways of godlineſs, and mind the one <hi>thing needful.</hi> It abateth the violence of ſenſual inclinations; and it exempteth from many temptations to ſin, into which youth betrayeth men. It alloweth us not to run with the profane and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute to the exceſs of riot—excuſeth us from conformity to the world in its vain faſhions, and ſhutteth us out of much idle time—waſting company, that we might converſe with God in ſecret, by reading, meditation, and prayer. And we ſhould not deprive ourſelves of the benefit of public ordinances of worſhip, ſo long as we are any ways capable of giving our profitable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. Pſal. 92.13.14. Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God. They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing. We ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently improve all means and advantages to our thriving in grace, and abounding in the fruits of righteouſneſs, even in old age. The prophet ſaith of the millenial ſtate, Iſa. 65.20. <hi>There ſhall be no more an old man that hoth not filled up his days.</hi> Our laſt will be empty days, if they be paſſed in the ſlothful
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017170_0018_0FA06F744D778668"/>neglect of our duty. Let none ſuch be put into the <hi>Calendar</hi>—be joined to the days of our years, or come into the number of the months. Let our days to the very laſt of them be filled up with religious virtue, and a long life compleated in us—So will our old be truly "honourable age:" Whereas, nothing is more ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than to have no other proof of our living long, than that we have been threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore years and more, in the world.</p>
            <p n="7">7. REMEMBERING how old we are, we ſhould be willing, when our time cometh, to die. If the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our great age hath the forementioned ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon us, it may be of this comfortable uſe to us at the cloſe of our days. It is a common ſaying, the young may, the old muſt, die. Theſe die in courſe, and by neceſſity of nature. Of which neceſſity we ſhould make a virtue, in being truly willing, at the call of God and nature, to leave this world, in which we have had ſo large a ſhare of life. To die willingly, and go away rejoicing in hope of eternal life, is the crowning virtue of a good life. It doth honour to religion, and might convince the infidel and ungodly part of mankind of its reality and excellence; and that a holy life is indeed the beſt, which hath ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and happy an end. And ſurely, they that have followed the Lord to a good old age, ſhould be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and glad, and only wait for leave, to go to him; although the paſſage be through the valley of the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death. It becometh ſuch to be ſatisfied with long life. And if at the end of it, they feel any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance to a departure hence, to ſay unto the linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit, as good old Hilarion did, "Go forth, O my ſoul, why doſt thou pauſe and ſtop? haſt thou ſerved God theſe threeſcore and ten years, and art thou afraid to die?" The very learned and pious <hi>Matthew
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017170_0019_0FA06F750D24E610"/>Mead,</hi> when he was dying, ſaid, "I am going home, as every honeſt man ſhould, when his work is done; and I bleſs God I have ſo good a home to go to." O how welcome is the day of ſuch a man's death, and more to be rejoiced in by him, than the day of his birth.—To our ſo great advantage in life, and comfort at death, might it be for us, my aged friends, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how old we are.</p>
            <p>HAD I room therefor in this Diſcourſe, calculated more eſpecially for the uſe of the aged of this flock of the Lord's people, I would addreſs my young hearers, and exhort them betimes to learn the holy art of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering their days, ſo as to apply their hearts unto wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and recommend to their imitation alſo the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of faithful Caleb, who followed the Lord from his youth; as his own conſcience teſtifieth when he was ſo old, as he telleth us in the text, and God alſo bare him witneſs. Forty years old (at which age men are reckoned young) was I, ſaith he in the context, when Moſes the ſervant of the Lord ſent me from Kadeſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barnea, to ſpy out the land—and I <hi>wholly followed the Lord.</hi> The ſame teſtimony God himſelf gave of him. Commending the obedient ſpirit which then was in him, ſaith, Numb. 14.24. <hi>My ſervant Caleb follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me fully.</hi> In the Book of Eccleſiaſtus, chap. 46, verſe 10, it is to his honour recorded, "The Lord gave ſtrength unto Caleb, which remained with him to his old age, ſo that he entered the high places of the land, and his ſeed obtained it for an inheritance, that the children of Iſrael might ſee, that it is good to follow the Lord." See here, my young people, an encouraging example for you to do ſo. As you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire life and love many days, that you may ſee good, walk not in the way of your hearts, but turn your feet now unto God's teſtimonies, and wholly follow the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017170_0020_0FA06F75CE9D41B8"/>Lord your God—ſo you may arrive to a good old age: or, if you die before, ſhall obtain an inheritance in the better country, that is, the heavenly Canaan.— O ye beloved children, my mouth is opened, my heart is enlarged, to ſpeak much unto you, and warn you to flee youthful luſts: but to follow righteouſneſs, faith, charity, peace, every chriſtian virtue, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart: that the friend of your ſouls may have the joy to ſee you walk in the truth, following the Lord as dear obedient children.</p>
            <p>BUT it is time for me to put an end to this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I ASK of my hearers, young and old, a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes attention to the conduct of divine Providence toward their aged Miniſter, in the prolongation of his life.</p>
            <p>LO NOW, my brethren, I am this day fourſcore and five years old—A wonder of God's ſparing mercy! Sixty-three of theſe years have I ſpent in the work of the miniſtry among you. One hundred and forty-ſix years ago, your forefathers came with their paſtor, and ſettled in this place. I am the third in the paſtorate of this church, which hath not been two years vacant. Scarce any pariſh but hath had more in that office in ſo long a ſpace of time. The people of this have been ſteady to their own miniſters, living to old age; have not been given to change, nor with itching ears have heaped to themſelves teachers. I bleſs God, who diſpoſed my lot among a people, with whom I have lived here in great peace, eleven years longer than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my worthy predeceſſors.<note n="†" place="bottom">The Rev. <hi>Peter Hobart,</hi> and, The Rev. <hi>John Norton.</hi>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017170_0021_0FA06F780D9BEAD0"/>that my labours had been as profitable, as they have been acceptable to them. I retain a grateful ſenſe of the kindneſſes (injuries I remember none) which I have received from them. While I have reaped of their carnal things to my comfortable ſubſiſtence, it hath been my great concern and pleaſure to ſow unto them ſpiritual things, which might ſpring up in a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of eternal bleſſings. That their affections to me, as their paſtor, have continued from fathers to child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and children's children, hath been thankfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by me; and ſhould have been improved as an advantage and incentive to do them (in returns of love for love) all poſſible good. It is but little I can now do in the work to which I am kept up ſo late in the evening of my days, and my people may feel their great need of one more able in body and mind to ſerve them in the goſpel-miniſtry. In this caſe, by breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, I hope that no partial regard to me, or parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious view to your worldly intereſt, will hinder your timely providing yourſelves with ſuch an one. As much as I dread and deprecate the being cut down as a cumberer of the ground in this part of the Lord's vineyard; I would not with my uſeleſs old age fill up the place, and deprive you of the help, of a profitable labourer in it. I ſubmit to the wiſdom and will of God my own deſire to finiſh my courſe of life, and the miniſtry I have received of him together; while I make the humble acknowledgment and prayer to him in Pſalm 71. "O God, thou haſt taught me from my youth, and hitherto I have declared thy wonderous works: Now alſo when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forſake me not, until I have ſhewed thy ſtrength unto this generation." Caleb, when he was as old as I am, could ſay, As yet I am as ſtrong this day as I was in the day that Moſes ſent me; that is, when he was forty years old. As my ſtrength was then, even ſo my ſtrength is now, for war, both to go out, and to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017170_0022_0FA06F78215EC150"/>come in.—It is far otherwiſe with me: yet, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth of the little ſtrength I ever had for the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial warfare, I would as gladly ſpend in the ſervice of your ſouls, and aſſiſt you all I can in your chriſtian combat againſt the enemies which oppoſe your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This would I do, God enabling me, as long as I am in this tabernacle of frail fleſh, knowing that I muſt ſhortly put it off; and exchange the <hi>Sacred Deſk</hi> for the <hi>Silent Grave!</hi>—But, O my ſoul, how awful the long—the very long and ſtrict account to be given to God of thyſelf, and of thouſands more committed to thy charge, to watch alſo for their ſafety and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs! Brethren, pray for me, that I may find mercy of the Lord in that day: which if I ſhould fail of, it had been good for me, and perhaps for you alſo, periſhing by my neglect, that I had never been born. The conſideration of which ſhould excite my utmoſt care and diligence to make full proof of my miniſtry, and engage your attendance upon it in ſuch a manner as will ſhew you are not grown into a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, which would render it unprofitable to you. I have been young, and now am old. Your fathers deſpiſed not my youth for its weakneſs; nor have you my old age for the infirmities that attend it: Which giveth ſome encouragement to hope that my long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance with you is not ſo much to the hinderance of the goſpel of Chriſt, and detriment of your ſpiritual intereſts, as I am often ready to fear. After ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay or interruption of the Philippians' liberality to Paul, he thus writeth unto them, Phil. 4.10. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the laſt your care of me hath flouriſhed again.</hi> So hath yours of me. I may add, as he doth, <hi>not that I ſpeak in reſpect of want,</hi> which you have let me ſuffer in theſe difficult times. You lay freſh engagements upon me to exert myſelf in the ſervice of your ſouls; and if the God of my life and health prolong the ſame any farther, I
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017170_0023_0FA06F78D62CF8B0"/>would go on in the ſtrength of the Lord God, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for your ſalvation, ardently aiming at the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous commendation which the miniſter of the church in Thyatira received from Chriſt, Rev 2.19. I know thy works; and the laſt to be more than the firſt. That mine may be more faithful, and more ſucceſsful, God of his mercy to me and you grant for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>AND now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are ſanctified.</p>
