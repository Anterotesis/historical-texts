            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tho' I ſpeak, my Grief is not aſſwaged; and tho' I forbear, what am I eaſed?</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>IT is Probable, and more than ſo, That every Perſon in this Aſſembly of <hi>Zion,</hi> has <hi>Bitter Griefs</hi> that may be complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of: There is not an <hi>Heart</hi> but what <hi>knows its own Bitterneſs.</hi> But it is as probable, that the <hi>Griefs</hi> of many People are <hi>Incurable</hi> ones; <hi>Griefs</hi> hopelefs of any <hi>Cure</hi> in this World; There is nothing that can be done to <hi>Cure</hi> them. It may be ſaid unto them, as in Jer. XXX. 12. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Thy Bruiſe as Incurable, and thy Wound is Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This CASE, <hi>What ſhall be done
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001691_0003_0FB52A2596F75948"/>with Griefs, when there is no Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them?</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Caſe,</hi> which I make no doubt, very many are concerned in; A <hi>Caſe,</hi> which I make no doubt, may be very Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, and very Seaſonably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed on.</p>
            <p>My Diſcourſe upon the Caſe, will have an agreeable Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in pointing you to an Inſtance of it. The celebrated <hi>Job,</hi> was one in whom you find it inſtanced. It is well noted by the famous Jew <hi>Maimonides,</hi> That the Book of <hi>Job</hi> Was written, to Eſtabliſh us in the grand Article of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And the <hi>Mahometans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, look upon it, as written to Inſtruct us in this particular My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of that Providence; That God may Afflict thoſe, whom He has a great Favour for. He who writes the Ancient Commentaries on this Book, under the Name of <hi>Origen,</hi> ſays, that he found this Tradition, <hi>In Antiquorum dictis,</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> beholding the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001691_0004_0FB52A27F1DDAFA0"/>of his Brethren in <hi>Egypt,</hi> made a Preſent of this Hiſtory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to Encourage their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, that if they ſuffered Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, God would in the latter End beſtow ſuch a Deliverance upon them, as He did upon His Patient Servant <hi>Job.</hi> And in like manner, it was the Cuſtome of the Primitive Chriſtians, when they viſited one another in their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Calamities, to Read a Leſſon out of <hi>Job</hi> in their Viſits, for the Support of their Minds under what had befallen them.</p>
            <p>It ſeems, I do no New Thing, when I call in the Patriarch <hi>Job,</hi> to ſerve the Intention, of giving ſome Direction about <hi>Incurable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</hi> The Afflicted Patriarch here Complains of his <hi>Grief,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Incurable.</hi> Says he, <hi>Tho' I ſpeak, my Grief is not aſſwaged; and tho' I forbear; what am I eaſed.</hi>
               <q>Neither <hi>Speaking</hi> nor <hi>Silence,</hi> will do any thing for my <hi>Cure.</hi> Let me try what <hi>Methods</hi> I will, my <hi>Grief</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:001691_0005_0FB52A2956077720"/>will remain without a <hi>Cure.</hi>
               </q> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, it was not without ſome Eye to this Paſſage, that <hi>Elibu</hi> charged <hi>Job,</hi> in Chap. XXXIV. 6. with ſaying, <hi>My Wound is Incurable.</hi> Be that as it will, my DOCTRINE will be Inconteſtible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Children of Men are frequently troubled with Griefs which cannot be Cured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many People have ſuch <hi>Griefs</hi> as they have little hopes to <hi>Aſſwage</hi> and have <hi>eaſed,</hi> as long as they are in this <hi>preſent Evil World.</hi> Many People meet with <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> which they can't hope to ſee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; but muſt look to <hi>bear</hi> them as well as they <hi>can;</hi> it may be, as long as they <hi>live.</hi> The <hi>Weeping Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> ſaid of the ſhare which he muſt have in the Woful Things that came upon his Country; Jer. X. 19. <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it.</hi> We ſee many a <hi>Grief,</hi> which there is no Redreſſing of; We muſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001691_0006_0FB52A2E2060E120"/>
               <hi>bear</hi> it. But the Caſe now is, <hi>How to bear it?</hi> This is to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And it will contribute a little unto it, for us to lay down in the firſt Place, this more general Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. <hi>Griefs muſt come;</hi> There are <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> which in <hi>this World</hi> muſt be met withal. They are in the very Nature of the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> It is the Condition of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> the <hi>common Lot,</hi> the <hi>conſtant Fate,</hi> which every <hi>Mothers Son</hi> muſt look for: A Condition of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is <hi>not Joyous but Grievous.</hi> We Read, Job XIV. 1. <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is of ſhort Life, and full of Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will a little Enquire after the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> that are appointed for us. For, <hi>Is there not a Cauſe?</hi> My Brethren, 'Tis not a meer <hi>Chance</hi> that brings our <hi>Griefs.</hi> Let us leave it unto the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to ſay, <hi>It is a Chance that happens unto us.</hi> To aſcribe our <hi>Grievous Things</hi> unto a <hi>Blind For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001691_0007_0FB52A2F56829E78"/>to make no more of it than this, <hi>It was my hard Fortune;</hi> 'tis a very Fooliſh and Faulty <hi>Blindneſs.</hi> There is no <hi>Senſe,</hi> and as little <hi>Grace,</hi> in the Expreſſion, tho' it be a very frequent one. I remember, the Holy one threatens His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Lev. XXVI. 24. <hi>If ye walk contrary unto me.</hi> The Original Word ſignifies, not, <hi>Contrariety,</hi> but, <hi>Contingency.</hi> The Learned Jews Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it with ſuch a Reading, <hi>If ye walk in the way of Chance.</hi> And who do ſo? They moſt Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, who don't look above <hi>Chance</hi> in the <hi>Events</hi> which in their <hi>Walk</hi> they meet withal. They who don't ſee and own the <hi>Providence</hi> of God in all Events. Of ſuch People it is threatned by God. That He will <hi>Walk in the way of Chance</hi> with them, and will regard their Prayers no more than if there were nothing but a <hi>Chance</hi> to Govern their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. But,</p>
            <p>Firſt. Our <hi>Sin</hi> is the Cauſe of our <hi>Grief.</hi> Our <hi>Sin</hi> has made us <hi>worthy</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001691_0008_0FB52A31B5455FF8"/>of <hi>Grievous Things.</hi> 'Tis to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe us for our <hi>Sin,</hi> that the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of Heaven diſpences to us all our <hi>Grievous Things.</hi> Whenever any <hi>Grief</hi> befalls us, it may be ſaid unto us, as in Jer. IV. 18. <hi>Thy Way and thy Doings have procured theſe Things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee; This is thy Wickedneſs.</hi> It was by <hi>Sin,</hi> that the <hi>Curſe</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was firſt brought upon the Earth. In thoſe Terms was the <hi>Curſe</hi> denounced; Gen. III. 17, 18. <hi>Curſed is the Ground for thy ſake; in Sorrow ſhalt thou Eat of it all the Days of thy Life. Thorns alſo and Thiſtles it ſhall bring forth unto thee.</hi> All the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> that Embitter our Lives, are the <hi>Thorns</hi> and <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> which the Earth does bring forth unto us. No Corner of the Earth is free from them. The <hi>Cottage</hi> has them; the <hi>Palace</hi> alſo has them. The <hi>Firſt Adams World</hi> is always full of <hi>Grievous Things;</hi> Ever a Stranger to <hi>uninterrupted Proſperity.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Vain</hi> Thing to flatter our ſelves. <hi>This World</hi> will be always
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001691_0009_0FB52A3315FFD218"/>filled with <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed our <hi>Second Adam</hi> will bring us into a <hi>Better World.</hi> In the <hi>World to come,</hi> we read, Rev. XXI. 4. <hi>There ſhall be no more Death, neither Sorrow nor Crying:</hi> And Rev. XXII. 3. <hi>There ſhall be no more Curſes.</hi> But until we come into <hi>that World,</hi> we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have ſome <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Curſe</hi> to Conflict withal; ſome <hi>Grievous Things</hi> always attending of us. Ah, <hi>Sin, Sin;</hi> Thou art the <hi>Diſtreſſer of the Nations!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A very plain Inference I now ſee ſo lying before me, that there is indeed no ſhunning of it. I Infer, Certainly, our <hi>Sin</hi> ought now to be our <hi>Grief.</hi> Oh! make it thy <hi>Grief,</hi> and except what the Blood of thy Saviour ſhall bring unto thee, do not ask for any thing, that may <hi>Aſſwage</hi> or <hi>Eaſe,</hi> a <hi>Grief</hi> that will not work thy <hi>Death,</hi> as every other will, but will ſave thee from it. If <hi>Sin</hi> bring <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Grief,</hi> certainly then <hi>Sin</hi> ſhould be our <hi>greateſt Grief.</hi> It becomes every one of us
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001691_0015_0FB52A3FD8079898"/>ſay with him; Pſal. XXXVIII. 18. <hi>I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> We Read of ſuch a Bleſſed Thing, as <hi>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</hi> May every <hi>Grief</hi> which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us, be turned into that <hi>Channel:</hi> A <hi>Grief,</hi> becauſe we have <hi>ſinned,</hi> &amp; we have by our <hi>Sin</hi> provoked the Holy One to ſend our <hi>Grief</hi> upon us. May all our <hi>Grievous Things</hi> cauſe us to Reflect on our <hi>Sins,</hi> &amp; fill us with <hi>Grievus Thoughts</hi> becauſe of our <hi>Sins.</hi> My Brethren, I am ſo far from any Wiſh to ſee this <hi>Grief cured</hi> in you, that I wiſh it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the laſt Moment of your Lives. O <hi>Dye</hi> in the midſt of this <hi>Grief;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</hi> It is a <hi>Grief</hi> that will <hi>End</hi> in a <hi>Joy</hi> which will never have an <hi>End!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. But, who was the <hi>Father of Sin?</hi> Give him his <hi>Due;</hi> He muſt be brought in, as having an Hand
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001691_0016_0FB52A4217B25090"/>in the <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> which Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the World. <hi>Satan</hi> has a mighty Hand in them; Satan, the <hi>Prince of this World;</hi> Satan, the <hi>Ruler of the Darkneſs of this World.</hi> That <hi>Angel of Death,</hi> by the Permiſſion of a juſt God, ſills this World with <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things,</hi> and with <hi>Deadly</hi> Ones. When <hi>Grievous Things</hi> befel the good People of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our told them, <hi>The Divel</hi> was the Doer of them. <hi>Satan,</hi> with his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> of wicked Spirits, having loſt his own Comforts, is full of <hi>Envy</hi> at ours. By our <hi>Firſt Sin,</hi> we fell under his <hi>Dominion;</hi> Oh! what a <hi>Grievous</hi> one! By every <hi>New Sin,</hi> eſpecially if it be a <hi>Groſs</hi> one, we give him a freſh Advantage to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Commiſſion for our further Annoyance. We Read, Joh. VIII. 44. <hi>He was a Murderer from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> And who can tell, what <hi>Grievous Things</hi> are done, by the Influence and Energy of that <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi> upon the ſinful Children of Men! The Ancient Pagans had
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001691_0017_0FB52A4397B5B7A8"/>their Minds much exerciſed upon that Queſtion, <hi>What was the Origin of Evil;</hi> Or, <hi>Whence Evil came in upon us?</hi> There was a Tradition among them, and a very old one it was, That there were Two firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; One called <hi>Oromazes,</hi> who might be reſembled unto Light; Another called, <hi>Arimanius,</hi> who might be reſembled unto <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> the one a <hi>God,</hi> the other a <hi>Daemou.</hi> The one lodged this World, like an <hi>Egg</hi> under the ſhell of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; the other broke and pierc'd the Shell, and inſinuated a Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Evil</hi> into all that is Good. A Tradition that contain'd in it ſome notable Reliques of Truth: <hi>God,</hi> the Maker of the World, and the Author of all <hi>Good; Satan,</hi> the Spoiler of the World, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all <hi>Evil.</hi> The Reſult is, That the <hi>Grief</hi> of Mankind, is the Delight of Satan; What <hi>Grieves</hi> us, does Gladden him. He has no Pleaſure, but that of an <hi>Executioner</hi> in <hi>Grievous Things</hi> upon a World,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001691_0018_0FB52A45D6E90938"/>which alas, is always too worthy of them.</p>
            <p>And here again, I could not but ſee an Inference, that looks Black upon ſome among the Children of Men. I infer, To be <hi>pleas'd</hi> becauſe our Neighbours are <hi>griev'd,</hi> this is a Satanic Diſpoſition. The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, who love to make or ſee others <hi>Miſerable;</hi> I ſhall but ſpeak <hi>Scripturally</hi> of them, if I ſay, they are too like the <hi>Children of the Divel;</hi> They have the Image of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> very plain upon them. We may ſay, <hi>In this the Children of God are Manifeſt, and the Children of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi> The <hi>Children of God;</hi> theſe are <hi>full of all Goodneſs;</hi> like their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they <hi>are Good,</hi> they <hi>do Good;</hi> they Rejoice in the Proſperity of their Neighbours. The <hi>Groans</hi> of the <hi>Miſerable,</hi> are a Muſic to none but <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Children. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, there may be the <hi>Triumphs</hi> of the Righteous, in the <hi>Ruines</hi> of the Wicked. But ſtill the <hi>Triumphs</hi> have the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of a Gracious and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001691_0010_0FB52A35578D1938"/>to ſay with him; Pſal. XXXVIII. 18. <hi>I will be ſorry for my Sin.</hi> We Read of ſuch a Bleſſed Thing, as <hi>A Godly Sorrow, working Repentance to Salvation which is not to be Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of.</hi> May every <hi>Grief</hi> which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles us, be turned into that <hi>Channel:</hi> A <hi>Grief,</hi> becauſe we have <hi>ſinned,</hi> &amp; we have by our <hi>Sin</hi> provoked the Holy One to ſend our <hi>Grief</hi> upon us. May all our <hi>Grievous Things</hi> cauſe us to Reflect on our <hi>Sins,</hi> &amp; fill us with <hi>Grievus Thoughts</hi> becauſe of our <hi>Sins.</hi> My Brethren, I am ſo far from any Wiſh to ſee this <hi>Grief cured</hi> in you, that I wiſh it may be ever growing in you as long as you live; and that it may Accompany you to the laſt Moment of your Lives. O <hi>Dye</hi> in the midſt of this <hi>Grief;</hi> and ſo, <hi>Enter into the Joy of your Lord.</hi> It is a <hi>Grief</hi> that will <hi>End</hi> in a <hi>Joy</hi> which will never have an <hi>End!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. But, who was the <hi>Father of Sin?</hi> Give him his <hi>Due;</hi> He muſt be brought in, as having an Hand
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001691_0011_0FB52A36D604B800"/>penſations of a Divine and moſt Glorious <hi>Providence.</hi> Whoever, or whatever <hi>Grieves</hi> us, by <hi>taking away</hi> what is dear unto us, we muſt ſay, <hi>'Tis the Lord who has taken away!</hi> Whatever <hi>Inſtruments</hi> may <hi>Grievs</hi> us, they are but <hi>Inſtruments.</hi> We may ſay, <hi>The Lord has bidden them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grievous Things</hi> which befal the <hi>Reprobate</hi> part of Mankind; Theſe are the <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> which God in His Holy <hi>Providence</hi> does inflict upon them. In theſe <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things</hi> He reſtrains them from ſuch Outrages, as wou'd elſe break up <hi>Humane Society.</hi> In theſe <hi>Grievous Things</hi> He lays them up in thoſe <hi>Fetters,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Dungeons,</hi> that are to go before their final Execution.</p>
            <p>And then, the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> which befal the People of God, belong to the <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> wherewith His Holy <hi>Providence</hi> does prepare them for their Eternal Happineſs. By theſe <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> He weans them from a World, in which they would elſe be too willing to Abide,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001691_0019_0FB52A4755F6ECC0"/>and carry on multiplied <hi>Idolatries;</hi> He kills the Weeds of thoſe <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> that would unqualify them for His Kingdom. He awakens them to the <hi>Things that are Holy and Juſt and Good.</hi> By theſe <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> He Humbles them, He Quickens them, He Ripens them for Heaven; He fits them for the <hi>Inheritance</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly Places</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for them. The Things <hi>which for the preſent are not Joyous but Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> do afterwards yield the <hi>Peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fruits of Righteouſneſs</hi> unto them.</p>
            <p>From this there will be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that is very Obvious. I Infer, We have to do with <hi>God,</hi> as often as any thing that is <hi>Grievous</hi> occurs unto us. O all you that are in any <hi>Grief,</hi> Remember this; <hi>God</hi> orders it, <hi>God</hi> appoints it; You have to do with <hi>God</hi> in every <hi>Grief.</hi> To every one of 'your' <hi>Grievous Things</hi> you may ſay, <hi>Thou couldeſt have had no Power againſt me, if God had not given it.</hi> You have no <hi>Croſs,</hi> but ſuch as <hi>God</hi> has laid upon you.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001691_0012_0FB52A3930628920"/>'Tis impoſſible for me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you a more uſeful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We may now go on to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more particularly; Many of the <hi>Griefs</hi> that come, are ſuch as <hi>cannot be cured.</hi> We meet with ſome <hi>Grievous Things</hi> whereof 'tis a vain thing to expect a <hi>Cure.</hi> We have <hi>Griefs,</hi> which will not be <hi>aſſwaged</hi> by <hi>Speaking,</hi> or <hi>eaſed</hi> by <hi>Silence.</hi> They are altogether <hi>Incurable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt. Be ſure, we have this <hi>Grief</hi> that cannot be <hi>cured;</hi> That our <hi>ſtate in general, muſt be a ſtate of Grief;</hi> a ſtate liable to <hi>Grievous Things.</hi> There are many <hi>Grievous Things</hi> that are the <hi>unavoidable Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Mankind. It is our <hi>Portion,</hi> and there is no Avoiding, there is no Preventing, there is no Eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Come, let us do like the Wiſe Man, in Eccl. III. 10. <hi>See the Travel which God hath given unto the Sons of Men, to be Exerciſed in it.</hi> There are the <hi>Laws</hi> of our <hi>preſent ſtate,</hi> which are leſs to be altered,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001691_0013_0FB52A3A95FE8228"/>than the <hi>Laws of the Medes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians; Laws</hi> which oblige us to many. Humbling and Creepling Circumſtances. And what art thou, <hi>O proud Worm,</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt propoſe for thy ſake any Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them? <hi>Shall the Earth be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken for thee, and ſhall the Rock be removed out of his Place?</hi> Vain Man, Raſh Man, Tho' thou <hi>tear thy ſelf in thine Anger,</hi> it ſhall not be done. A ſtate of <hi>Grievous Things</hi> here, 'tis <hi>Unalterable,</hi> 'tis <hi>Unalterable!</hi> I ſhall ſpeak very Comprehenſively, when I ſay, <hi>Every Condition</hi> of Life, muſt have <hi>Temptations</hi> attending of it. There is no Condition free from its <hi>peculiar Temptations.</hi> Very much of our <hi>Work</hi> in the World, is to <hi>Watch</hi> againſt the <hi>Temptations</hi> in it. <hi>O our God, let them not be too hard for us!</hi> I go on; It is a <hi>Grief,</hi> that we muſt Labour under ſuch <hi>Frailty,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Meanneſs,</hi> and ſuch <hi>Nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſities,</hi> as the Conſtitution of our Bodies does bring upon us; A <hi>Grief;</hi> but there is no <hi>curing</hi> of it. It is a
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001691_0014_0FB52A3E569908C0"/>
               <hi>Grief,</hi> that it is <hi>appointed for Men <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to Die;</hi> and after we have, like the <hi>Sparks,</hi> mounted up for a little while, we muſt anon ſink, and fall down into the common Heap of Aſhes: A <hi>Grief,</hi> But there is no <hi>Curing</hi> of it. It is a <hi>Grief,</hi> that we muſt be always liable to <hi>Grievous Things;</hi> The <hi>Wheel</hi> always upon the <hi>Turn;</hi> and no Man know a Day aforehand what a <hi>Day may bring forth.</hi> Say, This is my <hi>Grief;</hi> I am <hi>Feeble,</hi> and <hi>Mortal,</hi> and Jog on from Day to Day, <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Uncertain</hi> every Day what may come upon me, in the Day that is coming on; But it is <hi>Incurable:</hi> It cannot be otherwiſe. A ſtate liable to <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things,</hi> is call'd, 1 Cor. X. 13. <hi>What is common to Man.</hi> O Man, Be not ſo Impertinent as to Dream of <hi>Curing</hi> and ſhunning, <hi>what is common to Man.</hi> Among the <hi>Incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of our <hi>preſent State,</hi> wonder not that I omit the <hi>Body of Death</hi> which will cleave to us till the <hi>Death of our Body;</hi> An Inclination to <hi>Sin,</hi> a Pro|
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001691_0020_0FB52A48D77B5A40"/>penſity to <hi>Sin,</hi> which will be a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy</hi> cleaving to us, till the Walls of our <hi>Clay-Tabernacle</hi> be all taken down. My Reaſon for this Omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion, is, Becauſe I propoſe the Mention of no <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> but ſuch as we ought to <hi>bear Patiently,</hi> and be Reconcil'd unto. Now out <hi>Sin</hi> is a <hi>Grief,</hi> never to be born with any <hi>Patience.</hi> We are always to be <hi>Groaning</hi> under it. It will be no Offence unto Heaven to ſay, <hi>Lord, I cannot bear it!</hi> The moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Strain under it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be that; <hi>Lord, I am Oppreſſed, undertake for me!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Advice cannot leave us, without an Admonition; <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Souls,</hi> Long for <hi>Heaven!</hi> Since the <hi>preſent State</hi> will and muſt be a <hi>Grievous</hi> one, e'en bear it, as long as God ſhall pleaſe to keep you in it. But then, methinks, the <hi>Future ſtate</hi> ſhould be <hi>Preferr'd</hi> with you; ſhould be <hi>Deſir'd</hi> by you: A <hi>Better ſtate,</hi> you may depend upon it. Syrs, You ſhall not therein <hi>do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001691_0021_0FB52A4B3065ADD0"/>to the Things which you do here this Day.</hi> Nor ſhall you therein ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch Abaſements, and ſuch En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, and ſuch Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, as are now the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> of your Pilgrimage. O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this; <hi>I ſhall never be well, till I come to Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. There is a Variety of more <hi>particular Circumſtances</hi> in our ſtate of Life, which will cauſe <hi>Grief</hi> unto us; but the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> will be found ſuch as cannot be <hi>Cured.</hi> In the <hi>Courſe</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> we muſt meet with many Things, which we could very much wiſh were otherwiſe than they are. But our <hi>Wiſh</hi> will ſignify nothing; 'Tis to no purpoſe to Propound it. We read, Eccl. I. 15. <hi>That which is Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cannot be made Straight; and that which is wanting cannot be Numbred.</hi> There are <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> which the <hi>Decree</hi> of God has aſſign'd for us, and <hi>Sorrows</hi> which <hi>He diſtributes in His Anger:</hi> A <hi>Decree</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Revoked, cannot be Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001691_0022_0FB52A4C95EF14F0"/>there is no contending with it. Who can pretend unto the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi> of them?</p>
            <p>Firſt. We may have our <hi>Bodily</hi> Infirmities, which may be <hi>Grievous Diſeaſes.</hi> But can they not be <hi>Cured?</hi> No; There comes that Meſſage unto us from Heaven concerning them, <hi>Thou ſhalt uſe many Medicines, and thou ſhalt not be Cured.</hi> We muſt lye under the <hi>Grief,</hi> as long as we are <hi>in the Body. Old Age</hi> will be full of ſuch <hi>Ails. Multa Senem—.</hi> Rarely can the <hi>Old Man</hi> ſay as he, <hi>I find nothing amiſs, which Old Age may be accuſed of.</hi> Ah, Dim-ſighted Old Man, whoſe trembling Hands lean on the Staff, whoſe Appetite flags, and whoſe Memory fails; There is no <hi>Curing</hi> of <hi>Threeſcore Years and Ten!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; <hi>Grievous Accidents</hi> may come upon us. But they were <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen.</hi> We could not by any <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight</hi> or <hi>Caution,</hi> or <hi>Parry,</hi> keep them off. And they are <hi>come,</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>Cured.</hi> The <hi>Grief</hi> will abide;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001691_0023_0FB52A50577737A8"/>the <hi>Wormwood</hi> and the <hi>Gall,</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had in <hi>Remembrance</hi> with us.</p>
            <p>Moreover, We may be plung'd into <hi>Wants</hi> and <hi>Straits</hi> that will be <hi>Grievous</hi> to us. But ſuch as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get <hi>Reliev'd;</hi> We can ſee no way of <hi>Relief.</hi> The <hi>Grief</hi> is never like to ceaſe as long as we live. We are <hi>ſtaked down</hi> in the midſt of <hi>Difficulties:</hi> There is no getting from them.</p>
            <p>There muſt be ſomething out of Joint in our <hi>Families;</hi> and it cannot be <hi>Cured;</hi> There will be no bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Thing to Rights.— I find theſe <hi>Incurable Griefs</hi> to grow upon my Meditations, and crowd and preſs in at ſuch a rate, as to ſpoil my Method. I can't <hi>Speak</hi> of them, as faſt as I <hi>Think.</hi> But they are <hi>Immethodical Things;</hi> they cauſe <hi>Confuſion</hi> where they come; and it will be no Indecency to go on with a <hi>Tumultuary Enumeration</hi> of them. I ſay then; There are <hi>Maladies</hi> which are, <hi>Opprobria Medicorum;</hi> ſuch as Deſpiſe and Diſgrace the Skill
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001691_0024_0FB52A51D68997A0"/>of our Phyſicians. And there are <hi>Miſeries</hi> which are, <hi>Opprobria Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum;</hi> ſuch that our Friends are <hi>Phyſicians of no Value</hi> in them. Yea, perhaps our <hi>Friends</hi> themſelves may be ſuch <hi>Miſeries</hi> unto us: <hi>Crooked Things, that cannot be made Straight:</hi> We cannot <hi>Mend</hi> them; And yet we cannot <hi>Leave</hi> them. <hi>Uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Relatives, and yet <hi>Uneſcapable</hi> Relatives. A <hi>Grief;</hi> it may be, A <hi>Continual Dropping.</hi> But it cannot be <hi>Cured;</hi> It will ſtick by thee, as faſt as a <hi>Rib</hi> in thy ſide; as long as thy <hi>Head</hi> upon thy Shoulders. O <hi>Priſoner of no Hope;</hi> There is no getting away; No Out-gate can be hoped for.</p>
            <p>Shall I go on? There may <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> faſten upon us, which <hi>cannot be ſhaken off.</hi> The Servant of God once Complained of, a, <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh.</hi> A Wicked, Venemous, Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Adverſary,</hi> is by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> call'd, <hi>A Vexing Thorn.</hi> I ſuppoſe, our Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was of ſuch a <hi>Vexing Thorn.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001691_0025_0FB52A5355E73D20"/>It was, <hi>A Meſſenger of Satan to Buffet him.</hi> He would fain have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. He <hi>beſought the Lord</hi> with one Day of Prayer after another, more than Once or Twice, for Deliverance. But it muſt not be granted him. The Anſwer was, 2 Cor. XII. 9. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
               <q>Be ſatisfied with what my Grace has done for thee on other Accounts; This Trial muſt continue all thy Days; Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I will enable thee to bear the Trial.</q>
            </p>
            <p>My Friends; There may be <hi>ſtrong Chains</hi> laid upon us: And ſuch may be our <hi>Madneſs,</hi> that Heaven will not allow the <hi>Chains</hi> to be taken off: 'Twill be a <hi>Madneſs</hi> to think of having them taken off.</p>
            <p>I perceive, my <hi>Catalogue of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curables,</hi> is not yet finiſhed. You were told, They <hi>cannot be Numbred. Public Affairs,</hi> and <hi>Public Stations,</hi> will make a vaſt Addition to the <hi>Number</hi> of them. In <hi>Public Affairs,</hi> 'tis how <hi>Grievous?</hi> — to ſee the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001691_0026_0FB52A54D875A478"/>Horrid <hi>Oppreſſions,</hi> the Curſed <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,</hi> the Villianous <hi>Treacheries,</hi> and the Notorious <hi>Miſmanagements,</hi> that Plague the Nations. That which makes the <hi>Grief</hi> become a <hi>deſperate Sorrow,</hi> is, The Things are to be <hi>Cured</hi> by no <hi>Remonſtrances.</hi> They may <hi>Lift up their Voice,</hi> if they pleaſe. There may be much <hi>Roaring</hi> at it: No <hi>Curing</hi> of it. No <hi>Cure,</hi> till He come, who is <hi>Mightier than many Waters.</hi> In <hi>Public Stations,</hi> 'tis <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to Encounter the <hi>Miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> which all that are in any Service muſt meet withal. O you Servants of <hi>Many, Heavy Loads</hi> muſt be laid upon you; and under your Loads you ſhall be <hi>Baſely dealt</hi> withal. But I'll tell you for your Comfort, There is no <hi>Help</hi> for it; no <hi>Cure</hi> to be had; you muſt get along as well as you can; To have it any better, is a <hi>Thing to be deſpaired of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is this Advice, you might be ſure would be left with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go any further. Beware
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001691_0027_0FB52A56560BB510"/>of taking any <hi>Indirect Ways</hi> to get off the <hi>Annoyances</hi> that cleave ſo cloſe unto you. We muſt <hi>bear our Grief,</hi> as long as we cannot <hi>Honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> get from under it. Sometimes, if we will <hi>Sin</hi> for it, we may by ſome <hi>Sin</hi> free our ſelves from theſe and thoſe <hi>Grievous Things.</hi> That is to ſay, <hi>God</hi> has laid on the <hi>Grief,</hi> and the <hi>Divel</hi> offers, that if you'l accept his Help, he'l take it off. But, ſurely, <hi>The Remedy is worſe than the Diſeaſe.</hi> Oh! Reject the <hi>Divels Offers.</hi> Never do any <hi>Sinful</hi> Thing to be made <hi>Eaſy</hi> by it. Say; <hi>'Tu my Grief, and I will not ſpeak any thing that is wrong to have it aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; I will forbear doing any thing amiſs to have it eaſed. It ſhall be as it is, until God will put me into a way to be ſet at Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. But now, the CASE is, <hi>How to bear theſe Grievous Things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What tho' the <hi>Griefs</hi> cannot be <hi>Cured?</hi> Thanks be to our good God; They are not <hi>Intolerable,</hi> tho'

            <p>The <hi>Griefs</hi> that can't be <hi>Cured,</hi> muſt be <hi>born,</hi> as God ſhall <hi>Enable</hi> us, and as God has <hi>Directed</hi> us. 'Tis not enough to ſay, <hi>What can't be Cur'd muſt be Endur'd.</hi> The CASE is, <hi>How they ſhall be Endured?</hi> The only <hi>Cure</hi> for many of our <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> is to <hi>Bear</hi> them Decently, to <hi>Bear</hi> them Diſcreetly. <hi>Hearken to me, my beloved Brethren;</hi> A very conſiderable Part of what we have to do in the World, is to <hi>Bear</hi> ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> of the World. The <hi>Bigger,</hi> and you will excuſe me if I ſay, the <hi>Harder</hi> part of our Work, lies in our <hi>Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Common Senſe</hi> taught the very <hi>Pagans</hi> to ſay, <hi>Levius fit Patientia, Quicquid corrigere eſt nefas.</hi> What no body can tell how to <hi>Cure,</hi> may by <hi>Patience</hi> be <hi>Aſſwaged</hi> and <hi>Eaſed</hi> wonderfully. Surely, <hi>ſpecial Grace</hi> will teach us <hi>more than the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi> 'Tis our beſt <hi>Prudence</hi> to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001691_0029_0FB52A5A15F14B58"/>bear our <hi>Grievous Things</hi> with our beſt <hi>Patience;</hi> To carry our <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> handſomely.</p>
            <p>A due <hi>Patience</hi> under <hi>Grievous Things;</hi> I beſeech you to conſider it; This <hi>Patience</hi> does exceedingly <hi>Glorify God.</hi> No Devotion does more <hi>Glorify God.</hi> God ſees our <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</hi> The Glorious God is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Gratified with it. No Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, no, none, makes a more grateful Melody in the Ears of Heaven, than this; <hi>O my God, ſuch a Grief is by thee order'd for me; and becauſe thou haſt order'd it, I Patiently, Willingly, Cheerfully ſubmit unto it.</hi> By this Lovely <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to our <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> Oh! the <hi>Glory</hi> that we give unto our God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. So did our Saviour <hi>Glorify</hi> His Father. 'Tis an <hi>High flight</hi> in our Conformity to our Saviour, when we come to that Language; <hi>The Cup which my Heavenly Father gives me to Drink of, ſhall not I Drink of it? Oh! 'Tis all well, that ſuch a Father does!</hi> Our Saviour, who bore
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001691_0030_0FB52A5DD76D3910"/>the <hi>Croſs,</hi> will have every Chriſtian to be a <hi>Croſs-bearer.</hi> There can be nothing more Pleaſing unto our Saviour, than to ſee a <hi>Diſciple</hi> take his <hi>Croſs,</hi> and bear the <hi>Croſs</hi> as it becomes a <hi>Diſciple.</hi> We alſo read, 1 Cor. IV. 9 <hi>We are made a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle unto Angels.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> of God, they are the <hi>Spectators</hi> of all the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> that are laid upon us: They are <hi>Spectators</hi> of our <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> under them Carry well, O Suffering Child of God; The <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-Stars</hi> will <hi>ſing together,</hi> the <hi>Sons of God</hi> will <hi>ſhout for Joy,</hi> at the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle.</hi> The <hi>Grace</hi> of God working under thy <hi>Grief,</hi> will appear Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Admirable, to thoſe Noble <hi>Spectators.</hi> And thou that art now the <hi>Occaſion</hi> of their <hi>Praiſes,</hi> wilt one Day be the <hi>Companion</hi> of them. And by our <hi>Patience</hi> under <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> we are Gloriouſly prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Glorious Things.</hi> Like our Bleſſed <hi>Fore-runner,</hi> we muſt <hi>firſt Suffer</hi> and then <hi>enter into Glory.</hi> By a right Behaviour under the <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001691_0031_0FB52A5F56689668"/>of this preſent Time;</hi> we make ready for the <hi>Glory that is to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> It is in this <hi>Preparation</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us up for it, that as we read, 2 Cor. IV. 17. <hi>Our light Afflictions here, which are but for a Moment, work for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> Briefly, <hi>There is no Remedy but Patience.</hi> Then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> thou ſhalt be the <hi>Remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The CASE is yet waiting; <hi>How muſt we bear our Grievous Things?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt; You have been already told, <hi>You muſt bear your Griefs,</hi> AS GOD SHALL ENABLE YOU. This implies, That they muſt be born <hi>Prayerfully.</hi> The firſt Thing you are to do, is to confeſs, <hi>That you can bear Nothing.</hi> But then, in an Humble Senſe of your own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to <hi>bear</hi> the leaſt Thing in the World, fly to God, cry to God, ask for the Help of God Hope to <hi>Bear,</hi> as well as to <hi>Do,</hi> all Things, according to the Motto of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, THRO' CHRIST, WHO STRENGTHENS ME. It was a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001691_0032_0FB52A61AB0BCE50"/>moſt proper Counſil; Jam. V. 13. <hi>Is there any among you Afflicted? Let him Pray.</hi> When <hi>Grievous Things</hi> are laid upon you, receive them, as the <hi>Camels</hi> do their <hi>Burdens;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them on your Knees: Fall to <hi>Praying</hi> immediately. But more than ſo, <hi>Carry</hi> them in this Poſture too, as long as they muſt lye upon you. Your <hi>Prayers</hi> under all your <hi>Griefs!</hi> Your <hi>Prayers:</hi> To call for theſe, verily, 'tis not the leaſt Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand of your <hi>Griefs:</hi> This is the Meſſage they come upon. <hi>Oh! pour out thy Prayer unto God, now His Chaſtning is upon thee.</hi> Now this is to be one very Repeted Stroke of your <hi>Prayers; Lord, help me to bear my Grief: To bear it Suitably. O my God, Let me not by any unſuitable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour Diſhonour Thee, under the Grievous Things which thou doſt Order for me!</hi> My Fellow-ſufferers, I will now ſpeak a <hi>Good Word,</hi> which may make your <hi>Heart Glad,</hi> when <hi>ſtouping with Heavineſs.</hi> 'Tis this; A Sollicitude about this thing, To
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001691_0033_0FB52A63D6081360"/>obtain Help from our God, that we may not Sin under our Grief; 'Tis a lovely Token of a <hi>Soul bound up in the Bundle of Life:</hi> A lovely Token of an <hi>Heart ſound in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of God.</hi> It is a <hi>Token of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Token,</hi> that it is well worth meeting with ſome <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> to have ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it.</p>
            <p>It will be no Contradiction, to go on, and ſay;</p>
            <p>Secondly. They muſt be born <hi>Silently</hi> too. Under all your <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things</hi> you muſt keep up that Frame, Pſal. XXXIX. 9. <hi>I was Dumb, I opened not my Mouth, becauſe thou didſt it.</hi> No Murmuring, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you. <hi>In a certain Place</hi> of the Pſalms, there is a Paſſage, which may be ſo Tranſlated, <hi>Silence is Praiſe to thee, O God.</hi> We never Praiſe our Glorious God ſo well, as by <hi>Silence</hi> under the <hi>Grievous Things</hi> that He lays upon us. Our Murmurs are to be <hi>ſilenced</hi> by the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God. <hi>O thou Afflicted,</hi> Whatever
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001691_0034_0FB52A6556AECB10"/>be thy <hi>Grief,</hi> lye at the Foot of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> GOD, and think; <hi>Lord, Here I lye before thee, as the Clay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Potter. Shall the Clay Complain of any Grievous Things done unto it? Lord, If thou break me to pieces, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Complain of being hardly dealt withal.</hi> And by the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God, our <hi>Murmurs</hi> are to be yet further <hi>ſilenced. O thou Afflicted,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore a <hi>Righteous God,</hi> and think, <hi>Why ſhould a Living Man Complain; a Man for the Puniſhment of his Sin? In the moſt Grievous Things that are done unto me, Lord, Thou doeſt Puniſh me leſs than my Iniquities deſerve; To be broken ſore in the place of Dragons is no more than I deſerve.</hi> But is this all that we have to <hi>Silence</hi> our <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs?</hi> No; There is a <hi>Faithful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> who does manage all. O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, Thou haſt alſo this <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to <hi>delight thy Soul,</hi> in the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Thoughts</hi> which thy <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things</hi> do fill thee withal. <hi>O my dear Saviour, whoſe Name is, The Lord my Helper; Thou art He, by
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001691_0035_0FB52A6795F0D628"/>whom all my Grievous Things are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed unto me; And I am ſure, Thou haſt meant all unto Good; Tho' what thou doeſt, I know not now, I ſhall know hereafter. In the mean time, I know, that thou wilt not lay more upon me, than thou wilt make me able to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict withal.</hi> Oh! Let no <hi>unbecoming Expreſſion</hi> be heard from you. Such Thoughts as theſe muſt Reſtrain your <hi>Paſſions.</hi> You muſt not be <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate,</hi> Outrageous, Tempeſtuous under your <hi>Grievous Things:</hi> Not be always, or often <hi>upon the Fret;</hi> Not give way to <hi>Diſcompoſures.</hi> When you are in a <hi>Storm</hi> at any time, Oh! Rebuke it into a <hi>Calm,</hi> with ſuch Thoughts as theſe; <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Fear God and be Quiet. It is God, who in every Grievous Thing, does but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Thing that is appointed for thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Humbly,</hi> but yet <hi>Stoutly.</hi> They muſt be born <hi>Manfully:</hi> With the Vigour of <hi>Manly Chriſtianity.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:001691_0036_0FB52A6915D62238"/>Under <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> don't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that Word, <hi>If thou Faint in the Day of Adverſity, thy Strength is but ſmall.</hi> There is Hazard, leſt <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Things</hi> befalling you, O <hi>Diligent ſeekers of God,</hi> may diſcourage your <hi>Diligence.</hi> But, Oh! Don't give way to any Diſcouragement. <hi>Be not wearied, nor Faint in your Minds!</hi> Moſt Laudable the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Godly Man; Job XIII. 15. <hi>Tho He ſtay me, yet will I truſt in Him.</hi> Thus; Tho' you ſhould have the <hi>Grief</hi> of being among the <hi>Poor of this World,</hi> yet Reſolve, <hi>I will be as Rich towards God, as ever I can.</hi> Tho' you ſhould have the <hi>Grief</hi> of a <hi>Name</hi> overwhelmed with <hi>Reproaches,</hi> yet Reſolve, <hi>I will Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Name of my great Redeemer, as much as ever I can.</hi> Tho' you ſhould have the <hi>Grief</hi> of Languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under Weakneſſes, yet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, <hi>My God, I will yet Love thee with all my Strength.</hi> Yea, Tho' you cry unto God, and He does not hear you; A Thing, how <hi>Grievous,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:001691_0037_0FB52A6B856F1D00"/>how <hi>Grievous?</hi> — Yet Reſolve, <hi>Lord, I will continue my Cries unto thee; I will call upon thee as long as I live!</hi> Oh! Don't harbour the leaſt Thought of Deſerting the Service of God, tho' you ſhould meet with never ſuch <hi>Grievous Things</hi> in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Him, and have never ſuch <hi>Darkneſs in your Pathes.</hi> Bear all with Reſolution. O Reſolved Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, ſay; <hi>Lord, Tho' all this come upon me, yet I will not forget thee, nor deal falſely in thy Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly. They muſt be born <hi>Fruitfully.</hi> Your <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> you muſt bear them <hi>ſo well,</hi> as to be the <hi>Better</hi> for them. So bear your <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> as to make them <hi>Uſeful Things.</hi> You can't <hi>get rid</hi> of your <hi>Griefs,</hi> then <hi>get Good</hi> by your <hi>Griefs.</hi> Preſs after that Attainment; Pſal. CXIX. 71. <hi>It is good for me, that I have been Afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Obſervable, That for the moſt part, the <hi>Grief</hi> which People would be moſt fond of having <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:001691_0038_0FB52A6CD62E8338"/>proves the moſt <hi>Abiding</hi> one, the moſt <hi>Confirmed</hi> one. The <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing</hi> which is, the <hi>Grand Ulcer</hi> of their Minds, the <hi>Grand Vexer</hi> of their Hearts, the <hi>Grand Imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of their Lives; This <hi>Grievous Thing</hi> muſt prove a <hi>Laſting</hi> one. I will tell you the Reaſon; O <hi>grieved</hi> one, Thou haſt not yet got ſo much Good by thy <hi>Grief,</hi> as ought to be The <hi>End</hi> of thy <hi>Grief</hi> is not yet gain'd, and therefore it muſt not yet come to an <hi>End.</hi> Syrs; Let nor your <hi>Griefs</hi> prove as <hi>Unprofitable</hi> as they are <hi>Incurable.</hi> You can't <hi>ſhake off</hi> your Troubles; But if your Troubles <hi>all Work together for your Good,</hi> This will be more to your Advantage, than if they were <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</hi> Oh! 'Tis a Lamentable Thing, to ſee a Man <hi>tied faſt</hi> unto what is <hi>Grievous</hi> to him; and yet this Man, as Fooliſh, and as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and as Graceleſs a Wretch, as if he were under no Chaſtiſement from God. The ſight is a very <hi>Grievous</hi> one, but yet a very <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:001691_0039_0FB52A6F17465FC0"/>one; <hi>People in Griefs, and not at all improving in Piety under their Griefs.</hi> How Reproveable, but how Pitiable, that Obſtinacy; Jer. XI. 30. <hi>In vain have I ſmitten them; they have received no Correction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Friends, Your <hi>Griefs</hi> can't be <hi>Cured.</hi> But cannot you then be <hi>Cured</hi> by your <hi>Griefs?</hi> Oh! May it come to this; Iſa. XXVII. 9. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall hereby be purged, and all the Fruit ſhall be to take away Sin.</hi> Your <hi>Grievous Things,</hi> Let them <hi>Cure</hi> you of your <hi>Miſtakes; Cure</hi> you of your <hi>Vices; Cure</hi> you of your <hi>Follies.</hi> Be not <hi>Fools bray'd in a Mortar.</hi> Let your <hi>Grievous Things</hi> bring you to <hi>Repent</hi> of thoſe <hi>Evil Things</hi> which you have moſt of all Cauſe to be <hi>grieved</hi> for. Let your <hi>Grievous Things</hi> prevent your wandring in thoſe <hi>Ways</hi> which are <hi>always Grievous,</hi> &amp; Reclaim you to a ſerious Enquiry into the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of your <hi>Evil Things,</hi> or wherefore <hi>God is thus contending</hi> with you. Let your <hi>Grievous Things</hi> cauſe you to grow in that Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001691_0040_0FB52A7097726548"/>with Chriſt, that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, that <hi>Meetneſs for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</hi> and all that Good, which may make amends for all the Evil you meet withal.</p>
            <p>Will you pemit me now, to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle out Three or Four very <hi>uſual Caſes</hi> in the Neighbourhood; <hi>Griefs</hi> that are very <hi>uſual</hi> in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. The Neighbours <hi>have</hi> them; and they can't <hi>Cure</hi> them; they muſt <hi>bear</hi> them: <hi>If they ſpeak,</hi> their <hi>Grief would not be aſſwaged; if they forbear,</hi> they <hi>will not be eaſed.</hi> My Neighbours, I will tell you, how to <hi>bear</hi> them, and find Cauſe to Bleſs God, that he has call'd you to <hi>bear</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Firſt. There are <hi>Corporal</hi> Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, wherewith many are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded; and ſuch as are not <hi>Curable</hi> ones. They are Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that will <hi>ſtick</hi> by you: If they don't <hi>ſhorten</hi> your Lives, yet they
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001691_0041_0FB52A7216A70E98"/>
               <hi>ſower</hi> your Lives; and they will be on you <hi>as long as you live. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Deafneſs, Lameneſs,</hi> the <hi>Tongue of the Stammerer,</hi> or ſome <hi>Deformity;</hi> perhaps a <hi>Pain,</hi> or a <hi>Sore,</hi> beyond the Help of thoſe, whoſe Profeſſion it is, to <hi>Cure</hi> what they can. You muſt ſay, <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it!</hi> But, how will you <hi>bear</hi> it? Why, if you can't have your <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Diſorders</hi> taken away, I pray, Get your <hi>Spiritual Diſorders</hi> taken away. This may be done. Get a <hi>Soul Cured</hi> of all Sinful Diſtempers. The <hi>Grief</hi> of a <hi>Soul out of Order,</hi> this is a <hi>Grief</hi> that ſhould not be born. And, Oh! ply the Throne of Grace; Do it with Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for contrary <hi>Effects of Grace,</hi> which may weigh againſt all the <hi>Defects of Nature.</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord, Give me Eyes to ſee Inviſible Things!</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord, Open the Ears of my Soul to thy Diſcipline!</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord, Help me to walk Uprightly!</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord, Let me take heed, that I do not Sin with my Tongue!</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord, make me all Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001691_0042_0FB52A7396A60110"/>within!</hi> Ask, <hi>Lord Heal my Soul, for I have ſinned againſt thee!</hi> Theſe are Points that may be come at. Come at theſe, O you that are <hi>bowed down,</hi> And you have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Compenſation for all that bows you down.</p>
            <p>I will add; The <hi>Female-Sex</hi> is become ſubject unto ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that, no doubt, are <hi>Grievous</hi> ones. There are <hi>unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sorrows,</hi> which the <hi>Third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Geneſis</hi> has confin'd them to. What will you do, <hi>O Handmaids of the Lord,</hi> but make the <hi>Yoke</hi> as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy as you can, by <hi>well-bearing</hi> of it; and look up to a dear Saviour, who has ways to turn <hi>Curſes</hi> into <hi>Bleſſings! Many ſuch things are with him!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. There are <hi>Impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which many do undergo, and muſt undergo; there can be no <hi>Curing</hi> of them. You muſt be <hi>Low</hi> in the World; you can't get clear of the Things that will keep you <hi>Low.</hi> There are many Things;
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001691_0043_0FB52A7515D01F28"/>you could be glad if you had them. You are diſtreſſed by the want of them. Yet you can't have them. <hi>Want is like to be your Maſter.</hi> You may ſay, <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it!</hi> But, how will you <hi>bear</hi> it? Become <hi>Rich in Faith.</hi> You can't make ſure of <hi>Temporal Riches;</hi> You may make ſure of <hi>Eternal Riches.</hi> Oh! Hearken to me; There is not the pooreſt Man in this great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, but what may before Night become an Owner of <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches. Man,</hi> Embrace thy tendered Saviour, and all the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Riches of Chriſt</hi> are made over to thee. And why ſhould it not alſo be ſaid, <hi>Honour the Lord with your Subſtance,</hi> tho' you have but a <hi>little Subſtance.</hi> Do what you <hi>can,</hi> when you can't do what you <hi>would.</hi> The <hi>Two Mites;</hi> Theſe will be of great Account with God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. There are ſome, who have their <hi>Adverſaries;</hi> People are diſaffected unto them: The <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi> is <hi>Invaterate.</hi> It had perhaps
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001691_0044_0FB52A7695DB42B8"/>
               <hi>little Cauſe;</hi> and it will have no <hi>Cure.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Rooted</hi> Averſion. It will not liſten to the Voice of any <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> They will ſay, <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it!</hi> But, how will you <hi>bear</hi> it? Why, with incomparable <hi>Meekneſs;</hi> With the utmoſt Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all <hi>Perſonal Revenge;</hi> with Generous and Exquiſite Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>How to overcome Evil with Good?</hi> But this is not all. <hi>Mend your Pace,</hi> for Allatrations: as the <hi>Reine Deer,</hi> for the <hi>Dog</hi> in the <hi>Sled:</hi> Let your <hi>Pace</hi> in doing all the Good that is poſſible, be quickened by the Noiſe of your Enemies, as much as 'tis poſſible. And keep an exact Guard upon all your <hi>Steps,</hi> to keep in <hi>plain Pathes,</hi> becauſe of your <hi>Obſervers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly. Many ſee <hi>Grievous Things</hi> in their <hi>Domeſtic Circumſtances.</hi> There are thoſe, whoſe <hi>Relatives</hi> bring to them, the <hi>Griefs</hi> that cannot be <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> Some have been bereaved of <hi>Relatives,</hi> that were the <hi>Deſire of their Eyes.</hi> The <hi>Death</hi> of ſuch, has made a <hi>Breach</hi> upon them, which
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001691_0045_0FB52A78EB9A6A20"/>perhaps <hi>cannot be healed.</hi> They may ſay, <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it!</hi> But, how will you <hi>bear</hi> it? <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Refrain thine Eyes from Tears;</hi> Thy <hi>Reſignation</hi> ſhall be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</hi> The <hi>Tears</hi> will not fetch them to Life again. But now thoſe are gone, that can't be fetch'd back, lay the <hi>faſter Hold</hi> on a Glorious CHRIST; Converſe more with <hi>Him</hi> than heretofore. <hi>The Lord is my Portion, ſaith my Soul! and He ſhall be more to me than all that is taken from me!</hi> Others there may be, who have their Hearts broken with <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſirable Relatives: Fooliſh</hi> ones; <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> ones; <hi>Wicked</hi> ones; Churliſh and Wretched <hi>Conſorts; Children</hi> which take to bad Courſes; <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> or <hi>Siſters</hi> that are ſtrangely Abuſive: Thoſe of whom it may be ſaid, They are <hi>a Grief of Mind unto them;</hi> They are an <hi>Heavineſs unto them.</hi> They may ſay, <hi>This is a Grief, and I muſt bear it!</hi> But, how will you <hi>bear</hi> it? You can't <hi>Change</hi> the <hi>Untoward Things:</hi> You can't

How Happy are you, if God proſper you, and in this way give you a <hi>Conqueſt</hi> over them? Again; You may <hi>do This.</hi> When you can do nothing elſe for them, you can <hi>Pray</hi> for them. When there is nothing elſe to be done for them, ſtill they are to be <hi>Prayed for.</hi> Be they never ſo <hi>Vicious,</hi> or never ſo <hi>Abſurd,</hi> you may go alone, and Weep unto the Lord for them, and beg of Him, to <hi>Convert them from the Error of their way.</hi> It may be, The Almighty Hearer of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, will anon ſay unto you, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this poor Creature, I have heard thee; and thou ſhalt yet have ſome Comfort in what I ſhall do upon thy Supplications!</hi>
