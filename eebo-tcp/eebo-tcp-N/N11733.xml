            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THERE is nothing men bear ſo ill, as to be told with plainneſs of their faults, yet there is nothing more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them—Sinners are often offended becauſe thoſe <hi>who watch for their ſouls,</hi> ſet their danger before them, and thereby diſturb them in the way to ruin.</p>
            <p>The caſe is ſimilar with regard to things of a civil nature: when their favorite opinions are contradicted, or refuted, it touches them to the quick.</p>
            <p>It is often objected againſt the miniſters of Chriſt, if they treat in public upon any thing of a civil nature,
<q>that they are meddling with what does not concern them; that their buſineſs is to preach the goſpel, and not politics.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when was this objected, unleſs the objector's principles or practices had been cenſured? Such Inſtances are rare indeed. Where this has not been the caſe, 'tis ſaid,
<q>theſe matters are handled in the ſcripture, and therefore naturally come under the conſideration of thoſe who are ſet apart to ſtudy and explain the ſcriptures, and urge the duties therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;</q>
but the caſe changes immediately, when their faults are reprehended, and the miniſter is tied up to the goſpel doctrines of faith and repentance.—</p>
            <p>But, let men ſay what they will, every miniſter of Chriſt is bound to preach the whole counſel of God; he never needs a better apology for treating upon any ſubject, than that it is treated upon in the word of God: And as matters of a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical nature are to be found in the word of God, to diſcourſe upon them is ſometimes their duty—and it is eſpecially ſo at this day, in which we are called to contend for our civil rights— It is now their duty faithfully to warn their hearers of their danger, and ſeriouſly caution them, to beware of every thing that may be prejudicial to their country's cauſe.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014826_0003_0F973907649C2970"/>The clergy in general may do much in this way to ſerve their country, as well as by their prayers—The author of the following pages, herein attempts to caſt in his mite, to help on the good cauſe; which he is reſolved to do all the little in his power to aſſiſt.</p>
            <p>He has uſed plainneſs that will doubtleſs offend the enemies of American liberty, and perhaps ſome of thoſe who have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately acted againſt her cleareſt intereſts—He could not expreſs himſelf with the unfeeling coldneſs of a ſtoic, upon matters ſo important to mankind; in which alſo his country is ſo nearly concerned, nor would he if he could—<hi>'Tis good to be zealouſly affected always in a good thing.</hi>*</p>
            <p>Indifference, at this day, is at beſt the badge of ſtupidity, and frequently of ſomething worſe; be it of either, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lothes them, ſhe would <hi>they were either cold or hot;</hi> and if they continue luke-warm, would be happy, could <hi>ſhe ſpew them out of her mouth.</hi>

                  <p>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>WHAT we ſhall attempt from theſe words, will be to point out the character of the perſons, againſt whom a woe is here denounced; and ſhew what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in it.</p>
            <p>THE woe is againſt thoſe who <hi>put evil for good, darkneſs for light, and ſweet for bitter</hi>—all theſe may be done both in a moral and political ſenſe; we ſhall therefore conſider the words in both theſe views—</p>
            <p n="1">I. In a moral—In this ſenſe nothing is more common than a miſ-calling good and evil—Mankind in general, call this world good, as it ſtands oppoſed to the kingdom of God—their conduct ſhews that they think it good for them to lay up their treaſure here, where every thing is fading, and in a few days muſt vaniſh away, rather than in heaven, where an inheritance would be durable, and a <hi>good ſecurity againſt the time to come</hi>—Here therefore they are <hi>careful, and cumbered about with many things</hi>; but pay little, or no regard to the <hi>one thing needful,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 10.42.</note> even that <hi>better part which could never be taken from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAN this nothing can be more palpably abſurd— but a moment's reflection muſt convince the maddeſt worldling of his folly; and that he herein calls and treats <hi>evil as tho' it were good.</hi> Was the period of his exiſtence to end with mortal life, he might juſtify his conduct, in purſuing ſomething here as his chief good—tho' even then, the eagerneſs with which many purſue wealth and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014826_0005_0F97390AF25A6950"/>
fame, would be folly, being deſtructive of preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which did our being end with this life, would be all the reward of our labor and ſorrow under the ſun.</p>
            <p>BUT as man is made for another, an eternal world, where he will be happy or miſerable according to his works here in this, 'tis the heighth of madneſs to purſue this world as his chief good, to lay up his treaſure here, and place his affections upon theſe fading toys, <hi>all which are to periſh with the uſing.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 11.22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IF ſuch be the choice we make, we are always liable to have the very grounds of our happineſs taken from us in a moment; and death will certainly <hi>ſtrip us of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour wherein we truſt,</hi> and turn us more than naked into the other world; it will ſend us to inherit the fruit of their folly and wickedneſs, to ſuffer the natural and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſequences of our conduct here, and that forever. <hi>As we brought nothing into this world with us, 'tis certain we can carry nothing out</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.7.</note>—<hi>whoſe then ſhall theſe things be?</hi> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.20.</note> If then we have not <hi>laid in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come,</hi> 
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.</note> we ſhall be found naked—If we do not ſerve God, and provide for our immortal ſouls here, we ſhall have nothing there, but the reward of ſlothful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, nothing, that is, but endleſs miſery and woe.</p>
            <p>If the caſe be ſo, can any thing be plainer, than that they who call the Earth, or any in it, the chief good, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things, calling that the chief good, which is to them, through their folly, the greateſt evil? the ſource of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs miſery and eternal ruin?</p>
            <p>Now, what the woe is, that belongs to perſons of this character is evident; 'tis the wretchedneſs which their conduct naturally draws after it; 'tis the loſs of all hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and the induction of all miſery. This is what by their miſ-calling and miſ-treating matters, they will bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves in a future ſtate! Well may it be ſaid, <hi>woe be unto them!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014826_0006_0F97390C47FE3808"/>II. The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe who make the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin their chief good; who ſeek happineſs in ways prohibitted by God their maker and ſovereign, as well as from vain, tranſitory objects.—Of thoſe there are not a few in the world: and they are a diſtinct claſs from thoſe juſt mentioned—there we intended only thoſe who are wedded to the world, and ſeek happineſs in heaping up to themſelves, the good things of it; but who take no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt method to attain them.—</p>
            <p>But thoſe we now intend, if the world be their idol, ſtick at no means to attain it—no laws, human or divine, obſtruct them further than to eſcape puniſhment here— If it be ſome other vicious deſire that predominates in their ſouls, every thing is ſacrificed to the gratification of it.—In a word: the perſons, we now intend, are ſuch as roul themſelves in the pleaſures of ſenſe, regardleſs of the commands of God, who requires mankind to be holy, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from ſin, and pay a ſacred regard to all his laws.—</p>
            <p>In this claſs are to be ranked the thief, the drunkard, the profane, the unclean, the extortioner, &amp;c.—and how great a part of the world are there, who in ſome of theſe ways, ſeek happineſs? All which, contemn the divine authority, and alſo the rules and directions of eternal wiſdom, which has ſo ordered theſe matters, that men are in reality reſtrained, only from thoſe gratifications, which tend to miſery even here, was there no hereafter—Was theft, drunkenneſs, &amp;c. allowed by God, every one muſt ſee that the happineſs of the world, would forbid ſuch indulgences; and that the liberty would only be a liberty to be unhappy.—</p>
            <p>If ſo, nothing can be more evident, than that they who call theſe gratifications good, and in theſe ways ſeek hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in preference to the rules which God has given to ſeek it by, do in truth, <hi>call evil good</hi>—and the woe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them is evidently, the loſs of that felicity which is reſerved for the obedient, and their being doomed to

            <p>Many who have not run to ſuch extravagant madneſs, as to forget that they were men, have forgot, or thought themſelves above, the duties incumbent on them as ſuch, and gone into the commiſſion of crimes they had never thought of, or at leaſt dared to commit, had they not been drunk with power—Even good men, when thus exalted, are often guilty of the moſt cruel and abominable actions: Witneſs David in the matter of Uriah, and Solomon in multiplying wives (directly againſt the divine precept<note n="*" place="bottom">

and on his enquiring the occaſion, anſwered, <hi>Becauſe I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Iſrael: their ſtrong holds wilt thou ſet on fire, their young men wilt thou ſlay with the ſword, and wilt daſh their children, and rip up their women with child.</hi>

            <p>If no wiſe man can deſire ſuch power for his own ſake, much leſs can he deſire it for the people's ſake.

            <p>Now, the caſe is ſimilar with the inhabitants of our country at this day—If we ſtand to diſpute about prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, honors, and profits, our liberty will, mean time, be taken from us; and then what will all avail us?</p>

Were we in New-England to inſiſt that the reward of the officers, (eſpecially the principal officers) in our armies, ſhould be greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, as this is a matter chiefly complained of among us, we might perhaps be deſerted by all the ſouthern pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,<note n="§" place="bottom">It may not be improper, here to obſerve (as ſome have been uneaſy about it) that the officers wages in our armies were raiſed for the preſent year, in compliance, with the ſpirit and cuſtoms of the ſouthern provinces, who in their turn, conſented that the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers wages ſhould be higher than they would have fixed them.

They are generally men, who of all others, are leaſt acquainted with public affairs; whoſe knowledge of the ſtate of America, is confined to a ſingle colony, or part of a colony, and even of that is very imperfect: notwithſtanding which, they think themſelves beſt qualified to hold the reins of government, and guide the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſtate at this alarming criſis —Such men ſhould be frowned into ſilence, whenever they thus open their mouths; for they are too weak and too conceited to be reclaimed by reaſon.</note>—

Diviſions among themſelves has been the ruin of moſt free ſtates that ever loſt their liberty—It was ſo particularly of the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> republics, which were invincible till rent by inteſtine diviſions; and it is morally certain, that nothing but this will ever yield us a prey to our enemies.</p>
            <p>If we think every meaſure that is adopted, is not the wiſeſt poſſible, we ſhould ſuſpect our own judgments, while we believe our rulers to be our real friends; remembering that we have not the means of knowledge that they have; conſidering alſo, that the wiſdom of their counſels has confounded our enemies, and filled the wiſeſt politicians with wonder.—And did we even know, that in ſome things they may have erred, it would be wiſe in us to bear with it, rather than divide—Nothing can be ſo fatal to us as diviſion: that would be certain ruin. <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>We have heard of a few, who are very liberal in their cenſures of our rulers, and free in calling them hard names, and calling their authority in queſtion, eſpecially the authority of the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; and of a few who have given broad hints, that they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined never to defray their proportion of the expences of the war.</p>

                  <p>As to their refuſing to defray their parts of the charge incurred for our defence, we know of no way they can avoid it, unleſs they ſly their country, and carry all they poſſeſs with them, before the time comes for collecting their proportion: and be their intereſts ever ſo great, their country will be no looſer by their removing the whole, ſo be they go with it themſelves; nor will the land in which they take up their abode be any gainer thereby.—</p>

This is the moſt IMPORTANT CRISIS for America that has ever been, or perhaps ever will be—On the part we now act DEPENDS the freedom or ſlavery of this land, probably to the end of time. We are therefore called upon to exert ourſelves not only on our OWN ACCOUNT, but that of all FUTURE generations, whoſe happineſs or miſery depends, under God, upon us.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe, ſhall we let our little, paltry private intereſts divide us?

            <p>If ſo, we are unworthy of the day and land in which we live: yea, fit only to have been born the ſlaves of ſome eaſtern deſpot, and lived in a day or place where the very name of freedom is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard— and the day is coming in which we ſhall wiſh this had been our lot!</p>
            <p>Every one that is born in this land, and lives at this day, has an important charge committed to him: the preſervation of liberty, as far as his powers reach, is his care, and he muſt anſwer for the improvement he makes of it. Let us not neglect a due regard to ſo ſacred a depoſite, which will certainly be required at our hands if we do.—Let us ſtand ready with life and fortune, to defend what is entruſted to us; and if called to it, rather part with ALL we poſſeſs, yea and our lives too, in the glorious cauſe, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to live the ſlaves of an imperious tyrant, and ſuffer chains to be riveted upon our children forever, and freedom to be blotted from the face of the earth.</p>
            <p>What is neceſſary for us to do, may be collected from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe (as far as we are capable of inſtructing you) which 'tis needleſs here to repeat—and therefore ſhall only ſay in general, that it conſiſts in making God our friend by repentance and faith in his Son; avoiding whatever has even the remoteſt tendency to DIVIDE us among ourſelves; and ſtanding ready with life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to defend the rights of America, and repel every hoſtile at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the enemies of freedom —</p>

"Even the ſea monſters draw out the breaſt, they give ſuck to their young ones;" and ſhall "the daughter of my people become cruel like the oſtriches of the wilderneſs?" Shall we reduce poſterity to ſuch a ſtate, "that the tongue of the ſucking child will cleave to the roof of his mouth for thirſt?"—that "the young children ſhall aſk bread, and no man break it to them?"—that they who might have "fed delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, ſhall be deſolate in the ſtreets?"—that they who might have been "brought up in ſcarlet, ſhall embrace dunghills?"—If ſo, the puniſhment of the "ſin of the daughter of our people will be greater than the puniſhment of the ſin of Sodom, that was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in a moment, and no hand ſtayed her."<note n="*" place="bottom">Lam. 4.3,—6.</note>—</p>
            <p>It will be greater cruelty to yield poſterity as the property of haughty tyrants, than to have butchered them with our own hands as ſoon as they were born. If ſuch be the part we act, will not all the curſes in the book of God light upon our devoted heads?— Undoubtedly: for more than ten talents will be ſhamefully abuſed by us.—</p>
            <p>May God grant us all the wiſdom, prudence, and fortitude that is neceſſary for us, that we may ſo act our part here, as to ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament forever hereafter, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
