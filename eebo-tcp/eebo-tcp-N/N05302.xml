            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE IMPORTANCE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is agreed, I think, on all Hands, that the gaining and preſerving the Friendſhip of the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, is of no ſmall Importance to the Trade of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as well as to the Peace and Proſperity of theſe Colonies: And, as I have not heard of any Body, that has, as yet, attempted to put this Matter in a proper Light, I ſhall, with great Submiſſion, humbly offer my Sentiments, in Hopes they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome abler Hand to undertake the Taſk.</p>
            <p>When the firſt Ship arrived here from <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> it is ſaid, were ſo well-pleaſed, that they would have her tied to a Tree, in order the better to ſecure her; but as Cables were ſubject to rot, they would have it an Iron Chain, and this to be continued into the <hi>Indian</hi> Countries, that they might be the better able to keep their Part of it clear from Ruſt, as we were to keep our Part. If the <hi>Indians</hi> were in Diſtreſs or Want, the Call was, as it is at this Day, to come and make clean, or renew the Covenant Chain; and the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians on their Part, were to do the like: And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we have aſſiſted them in their Wars and Wants, and they have aſſiſted us in our Wars, and we have their Furs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006699_0004_1029AB61AFB11370"/>
This is the original Contract and Treaty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> And thus Things went on tolerably well for ſome Years, 'till the due Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Treaty was committed to the Care of a Number of Commiſſioners, moſtly <hi>Anglo-Dutch</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in <hi>Indian</hi> Goods; who, together with a Tribe of Harpies or Handlers, their Relations, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrappers, have ſo abuſed, defrauded, and deceived thoſe poor, innocent, well-meaning People, that this Treaty has well-nigh executed itſelf; ſo that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we have very few <hi>Indians</hi> left that are ſincerely in our Intereſt, or that can be depended upon. The fatal Conſequences of this Management were ſeverely felt in many Inſtances laſt War, particularly in the Caſe of <hi>Saraghtoga, Schenectady,</hi> &amp;c. which could not poſſibly have happened had our <hi>Indians</hi> been ſincerely our Friends. And what fatal Conſequences muſt attend a continued Neglect of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs; more eſpecially as the <hi>French,</hi> our natural Enemies and Competitors in every Corner of the World where we have any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, are indefatigable in cultivating the Friendſhip of their own <hi>Indians,</hi> and by all Means and Arts in their Power, <hi>per fas &amp; ne fas,</hi> endeavouring to ſeduce thoſe in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt; is apparent to the meaneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Murders and Deſolation, upon the firſt Breach, is one certain Conſequence; and I wiſh I could think this was all.</p>
            <p>What to me is moſt ſurprizing, that, tho' there is hardly a Colony upon the Continent, but what is a Match for all <hi>Canada;</hi> yet, by a proper Management of their <hi>Indians,</hi> they keep us all, both in Time of Peace and War, in a conſtant Dread and Terror.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament ſeems at this Time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take theſe Colonies under Conſideration, it is the Duty, I conceive, of every Member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to throw in ſuch Hints as he conceives may be of Uſe upon this Occaſion; and it is to be hop'd there
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006699_0005_1029AB633218B500"/>are thoſe amongſt us, of Capacity, Leiſure and publick Spirit, ſufficient to model them into a proper Shape, for the Peruſal of that auguſt Aſſembly. An honeſt Detail of Facts, and a fair View of the Importance of the Subject, is all that I ſhall endeavour at, at preſent. It cannot be doubted, but that the Government at Home would aſſiſt us effectually, were our Situation and Circumſtances but perfectly known to them, and proper Methods propoſed; becauſe it is really their Intereſt.</p>
            <p>I do not mean here to put the Crown and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England</hi> to any great Expence about us, further than that of one ſingle Officer, as Super-intendant of the Whole, who may have no Connection either with the Trade or People of the Country; and ſome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery. The Crown already has expended many and great Sums to make us what we are; and the People of <hi>England</hi> are already ſufficiently loaded with Taxes; whereas we hardly know what they mean. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies therefore, jointly, it is to be hop'd, will willingly contribute towards whatever Expence may attend a proper Regulation of our Trade and Frontiers; if not willingly, let us not diſpair but that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will oblige them. It is high Time we ſhould look to our own Security, and moſt unnatural to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that we ſhould hang forever upon the Breaſts of our Mother-Country: We are ſufficiently able, and muſt be made, ſome of us I doubt, at leaſt, willing. Whatever Pretences may be made, it is abſolutely true, that the Preſervation of the whole Continent, depends upon a proper Regulation of the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> and the Security of the Frontiers of <hi>New-York,</hi> both to the Northward and Southward. I therefore, with great Submiſſion, propoſe,</p>
            <p>That a good ſtrong Fort be built at the <hi>Wood-Creek,</hi> or near it; it ought to be a regular Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe it is not impoſſible to bring great Guns
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006699_0006_1029AB64B5D0CF48"/>againſt it, from <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> from whence they pour in their Parties upon us, in Time of War. Here let there be a Magazine of all Kinds of warlike Stores, both offenſive and defenſive, with Snow-Shoes, ſmall Hatchets, &amp;c. This will in a great Meaſure protect the Country; and from thence a Deſcent upon <hi>Canada</hi> may be very practicable.</p>
            <p>That this Fort be able to contain <hi>Five Hundred</hi> Men in Time of War, and in Time of Peace never leſs than <hi>One Hundred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there be an Addition of two Independent Companies, to the four already eſtabliſhed here, from the Highlands of <hi>Scotland;</hi> the wilder, the better for a common Garriſon there.</p>
            <p>That all the Lands from <hi>Fort-Nicholſon,</hi> to <hi>Fort-Anne,</hi> that is, all the Lands upon the <hi>Carrying-Place,</hi> and thoſe adjacent, be ſet apart for the Uſe of ſuch Highlanders only, as will ſettle there, and to be properly aſſiſted in their ſettling for the firſt two or three Years. To each Man and his Wife One Hundred Acres; and to each ſingle Perſon, Man, Woman, or Child, Fifty Acres, without Fee or Reward, to them and their Heirs for ever.</p>
            <p>That near this Fort, at a proper Diſtance, there be erected a ſmall Block-Houſe, ſufficient for thirty <hi>Indians,</hi> to be kept there on conſtant Pay, during a War; five, <hi>viz.</hi> from each Nation, to be relieved and regulated in ſuch Manner as the <hi>Six Nations</hi> themſelves think moſt proper.</p>
            <p>That a Number of Commiſſioners from all the Colonies, be appointed to meet yearly, at <hi>New-York</hi> or <hi>Albany,</hi> in order to fix their reſpective Quotas for the general Expence, and for erecting ſuch other Forts and Block-Houſes as may be thought neceſſary.</p>
            <p>That thoſe Gentlemen jointly, be fully impowered to lay out Lands, (not already granted) moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated for a Frontier. And as it ſeems very probable, that we ſhall very ſoon have a Run of <hi>Germans</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006699_0007_1029AB66415FAF40"/>this Way, I ſhould adviſe the laying-out of thoſe Lands after the <hi>New-England</hi> Manner, in Townſhips ſufficient for Sixty Families at leaſt; to be granted to them and their Heirs, without Fee or Reward, and clear of all Taxes and Quit-Rents, for ten Years at leaſt.</p>
            <p>That in each Townſhip there be erected a good ſtrong Church, with Loop-Holes, and a few Field Pieces, which may ſerve for a Retreat upon Occaſion. Or rather, let publick Notices, in the moſt authentick Manner, be ſent abroad to the Highlands of <hi>Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> where thoſe emigrant <hi>Germans</hi> have their Agents; that upon the Arrival in this Province of a Number of Families, not under Thirty; which Number, ſuppoſing five to a Family, is ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin any Settlement, and as many as any one Ship ſhould be allow'd to import at a Time; each Perſon, young or old, ſhall be intitled to One Hundred Acres of good Land, granted to them and their Heirs, without Fee, or any other Incumbrance of Taxes, or Quit-Rent, for the firſt ten Years. Their Paſſages, and ſome ſmall additional Helps towards their firſt ſettling, to be paid by the Colonies jointly; or let each Colony have its particular Colony or Townſhip, in that Country; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always, that thoſe Lands be laid out ſo as to form a Barrier. I would not have theſe Townſhips altogether <hi>Germans,</hi> but alternate. <hi>Philadelphia</hi> may one Day repent the vaſt Importation of thoſe People amongſt them; they are moſt of them old Soldiers. I have Reaſon to know ſomething of their Spirit, having had ſome Hand in diſarming 600 of them upon Account of a Mutiny in this Province; and it was my Fortune to command ſome of them upon the Expedition againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> in 1711. A Society of Free-Men, abſolutely diſclaiming the Uſe of Arms, and at the ſame Time encouraging the Introduction of vaſt Numbers of old Soldiers, and foreign too, who hardly know what the Word LIBERTY means; is a Contraſt which <hi>they</hi> only can account for.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:006699_0008_1029AB6F1E7C7950"/>
That a String of Block-Houſes be erected, ſo as to make the Communication, or an Alarm, from one Garriſon, or Block-Houſe, to another, eaſy, by Smoaks properly diſpoſed in the Day Time, or by throwing up a Number of Rockets, or firing Great Guns in the Night Time. Such an Expedient would be of great Uſe during the War, as the <hi>Indians</hi> never attack but by Surprize, and would greatly diſcourage <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy Parties, as it would keep our own Garriſons upon the Watch, and our Out Scouts to their Duty. I do not think it at all impracticable, to convey an Alarm from <hi>Albany</hi> to <hi>New-York,</hi> in one Night, if Rockets or Great Guns were properly diſpoſed and attended. Let us ſuppoſe, for Example, a Party of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> abroad, which ſeldom happens without being diſcovered by ſome Out-Scout or other; upon Diſcovery, if in the Day Time, let there be one great Smoak, and one Great Gun fired; which, if taken up by the other Garriſons, I am confident <hi>that</hi> Party would hardly proceed. In order to diſcover what Courſe the Party may take, let there be three Smoaks, two pretty near to one another, and the third at a proper Diſtance, either to the Eaſtward or Weſtward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will point out the Courſe taken. This may be improved.</p>
            <p>That in each of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> there be built a Fort of ſome Kind or other, where, and in what Manner that particular Nation beſt approves of.</p>
            <p>That in the <hi>Onondago</hi> Country, where their general Councils are held, and the Archives of the <hi>Six Nations</hi> are kept, ſomething more than common be erected; this will do Honour to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourage the <hi>Indians,</hi> eſpecially in Time of War, while their old Men, Women, and Children are ſecure in a Fort, with a ſmall Party of Chriſtians, their Excurſions will be more free, and frequent: But, this Security ought to be left altogether to their own Choice; whether, by erecting one ſingle Fortification
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006699_0009_1029AB70A1355F90"/>for the Retreat of the Whole; (the <hi>Senecas</hi> I ſhould chuſe, being a fine Country, where great Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be given to Settlers, and where the <hi>Indians</hi> are leſs tainted with Chriſtian Vices); or whether each Nation ſhould have their proper Retreat or Security.</p>
            <p>What has hitherto prevented our <hi>Indians,</hi> in their Excurſions againſt the Enemy, is, in my humble Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in a great Meaſure, owing to the Apprehenſions of having their Caſtles cut off in their Abſence; they have been often threatened, and indeed at preſent they have Nothing to truſt to but their Heels: And No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in my humble Opinion, has prevented the Attempt, but the Reſolutions of the <hi>Cachnawagas,</hi> their principal Fighters, (but Deſerters from our <hi>Mohawks</hi>) not to ſpill the Blood of their Relations and Country-men: And the ſame natural Affection has prevented our <hi>Indians</hi> from doing, what I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they would have done, had they been ſure not to have met with their Friends and Country-men, the <hi>Cachnawagas.</hi> Proper Methods, therefore, ought to be taken to recover thoſe <hi>Indians;</hi> which I conceive, is very far from impracticable.</p>
            <p>The villainous Treatment thoſe poor People have met with at <hi>Albany,</hi> from the Handlers, was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cauſe of that Deſertion; and undoubtedly for the ſame Reaſons, many more do, and will deſert, if proper Remedies are not ſpeedily applied.</p>
            <p>For this Purpoſe, I am to obſerve, that without a proper Regulation of the Trade, all other Endeavours to gain and preſerve the Friendſhip of the <hi>Indians,</hi> will avail but little. I ſhall not enter further into a Diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Methods hitherto taken; but that thoſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> have for many Years been under the Direction of the People of <hi>Albany,</hi> whoſe Intereſt it was to deceive and defraud them, and that they have been deceived and defrauded accordingly, is notorious;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006699_0010_1029AB7268C5D9D8"/>Inſtances in Abundance might be produced, but they are really too ſhocking to relate. But that I may not be thought to talk without Book, I ſhall here beg Leave to inſert the Preamble to an Act of the Legiſlature here, to encourage the Indian Trade at <hi>Albany,</hi> 13th <hi>Anne.</hi> I have not heard of an Act of the kind ſince, tho' the Miſchief has been daily increaſing.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas great Endeavours have from Time to Time been uſed by her Majeſty's Governors, and Commanders in Chief of this Colony, to ſettle a Trade, and to have Commerce with ſuch Indian Nations as live beyond our five confederated Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which in Proceſs of Time, might not only be very advantageous, but alſo of great Security to the Frontiers of this Colony, at or near <hi>Albany,</hi> in Time of War; and ſeveral of the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> being lately come to the City of <hi>Albany,</hi> in order to trade with the Inhabitants thereof; but ſeveral private Perſons, not regarding the Safety of this Colony, but only deſigning their own private Lucre, have, and do daily, uſe many indirect Means to engroſs the Trade into their Hands, by their Contrivance with thoſe who are employed by the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> to carry them in their Waggons to <hi>Albany;</hi> and having once gotten the Peltry, Beavers, or other Furs, of the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> in their Poſſeſſion, hinder them to make the beſt of their Market, to the Ruin of the ſaid Trade, and the Alienation of the Affections of the ſaid <hi>Indians</hi> from this Colony; and inſtead of ſecuring the Friendſhip of the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> will, if not prevented, cauſe them to be our Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> This Act to continue for two Years.</p>
            <p>The Principles to be laid down in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our <hi>Indians,</hi> are, firſt, by all Means to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to under-ſell the <hi>French;</hi> and the next is, to do Juſtice to the <hi>Indians</hi> in thoſe Sales. For which Reaſon I ſhould adviſe, that this Trade, inſtead of being under
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006699_0011_1029AB73EF211BF8"/>the Direction of the People of <hi>Albany,</hi> who are moſt of them, if not altogether, Traders, or Handlers, and whoſe Intereſt it is, to take all Advantages of thoſe poor People, and that with Impunity, as they have no Body to complain to, the principal Directors being all Traders, and of Courſe <hi>Socii Criminis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it be put under the Direction of one ſingle Perſon of Capacity and Integrity, of his Majeſty's Appointment, during good Behaviour, with a handſome Allowance, in the Nature of a <hi>Superintendant of Indian Affairs,</hi> with full Powers to do ſummary Juſtice upon all Occaſions.</p>
            <p>That he be debarr'd trading directly or indirectly, upon the ſevereſt Penalties.</p>
            <p>That he take his Inſtructions from the Governor and Council; and report to them, at leaſt twice a Year, a State of Indian Affairs, in order to be laid before his Majeſty, or the Board of Trade.</p>
            <p>That he be obliged to make a Tour through the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> once a Year at leaſt, with a proper Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and ſome ſmall Preſents for the chief Men; when and where he may receive Complaints, and redreſs Grievances.</p>
            <p>In order to ſave the Crown the Expence of ſuch an Officer, I ſhould adviſe, that as there are two Surveyor Generals of the Cuſtoms upon this Continent, at an Allowance of a Guinea a Day, and Sixty Pounds <hi>Sterl.</hi> yearly each of them for a Clerk; that upon the Demiſe of either, that Officer be ſet apart for this Uſe, one Surveyor General is ſufficient for all the Purpoſes of the Cuſtoms upon this Continent; the Officers being rather in the Nature of preventive Officers, that is, their chief Buſineſs is to prevent any European Goods being imported from any Part but from <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to prevent the Exportation of any of the enumerated Commodities, to any Parts, but to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> this, I ſay, is the chief Buſineſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006699_0012_1029AB7CB3733FD8"/>of the Officers upon this Continent; and the ſeveral Governors, upon their Admiſſion to their Governments, are obliged by Act of Parliament, to take an Oath, to ſee this duly executed. There are no Revenues collected by the Offices here, nor no Accounts worth mentioning to comptrole. From hence I conclude, that one of thoſe Officers at leaſt, may be very well ſpared for the above Purpoſe, and much better employed.</p>
            <p>That there be a handſome Allowance made for two Interpreters at leaſt; one indeed for each Nation I ſhould not think too much: One of them always to attend the principal Officer.</p>
            <p>That there be a Smith appointed by the principal Officer, with a proper Allowance, in each Nation, with two Apprentices, in order to multiply Interpreters; for want of which, I doubt we have often been miſled; and if thoſe Smiths were obliged to teach one or two Indian Youths of the beſt Capacities, to read and write <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it might be of great Uſe, as nothing is ſo much wanted as honeſt Interpreters.</p>
            <p>That every Perſon employed by the Publick in this Service, be prohibited Trading, directly or indirectly, under ſevere Penalties, and give Security for the due Execution of his Duty; and to be on Oath obliged to repreſent every Grievance he conceives the <hi>Indians</hi> meet with from the Traders. As all Monopolies are the Bane of Trade, I would have this open and free for all his Majeſty's Subjects; by this Means a Number of <hi>Buſh-Lopers,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> call them, and the <hi>French,</hi> who are indefatigable in this Point, <hi>Coureurs Debois,</hi> are created; a Set of Men, who, from their Acquaintance with the Woods and Indians, are very uſeful upon many Occaſions, eſpecially in Time of War.</p>
            <p>That there be lodged in the Hands of every Smith, or Agent for that Purpoſe, <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, to the Value of £.—always by them; which they are to diſpoſe of for the Uſe of the Publick, according to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006699_0013_1029AB7E34B4B0E8"/>Invoices from <hi>New-York,</hi> fixing the Prices of the Goods, as well as of the Furs and Skins, and by no Means to exact further: This is the Method, and the only Method, I humbly conceive, by which we can underſell the <hi>French;</hi> and will be a Means to regulate the whole <hi>Indian</hi> Trade: And this is the Method taken in the Government of <hi>New-England,</hi> in the following Manner, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By an Act of the 12th <hi>Geo.</hi> it is enacted,
<q>That Proviſions, Cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuitable for carrying on a Trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> not exceeding the Value of £. 4000, be procured at the Coſt and Charge of the Province, and the Produce applied for ſupplying the <hi>Indians,</hi> by ſuch Perſons as ſhall be annually choſen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and likewiſe annually produce fair Accounts of their Proceedings; which Supplies ſhall be lodged to the Eaſtward, at, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>That a ſuitable Perſon be choſen annually at each of the Places where any of the Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which Truck-Maſters ſhall be under Oath, and give ſufficient Security for the faithful Diſcharge of that Truſt, and ſuch Inſtructions as they ſhall receive from Time to Time: And ſhall keep fair Accounts of their Trade and Dealings with the <hi>Indians;</hi> and ſhall return the ſame, together with the Produce, to the Perſon or Perſons who ſhall be appointed to ſupply them with Goods. And they ſhall not Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> directly or indirectly. That the Truck-Maſters ſell to the <hi>Indians</hi> at the Price ſet in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voices ſent them from Time to Time, without any Advance thereon; and ſhall allow the <hi>Indians</hi> for their Furs, and other Goods, as the Markets ſhall be at <hi>Boſton,</hi> according to the lateſt Advices from the Perſon or Perſons, that ſhall ſupply them for the ſame Commodities of equal Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Rum to be given to the <hi>Indians</hi> in moderate Quantities by the Truck-Maſters only.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006699_0014_1029AB7FB86D7EE0"/>
No Perſon whatſoever other than the Truck-Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and they only as ſuch, ſhall or may preſume by themſelves, or any other for them, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to ſell, truck, barter, or exchange to any <hi>Indian</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> any Wares, Merchandizes, or Proviſions, within ſix Miles of any Truck-Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on Penalty of forfeiting £. 50, or ſix Months Impriſonment.</p>
            </q>
            <p>From this I have only to obſerve, That had our <hi>Indian</hi> Trade been under ſuch a Regulation, or indeed any Regulation at all, we ſhould have leſs to apprehend at this Day: And, that it is high Time to make a Beginning.</p>
            <p>A grand Fair yearly eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> to be kept alternately; to begin firſt in the <hi>Onondage</hi> Country, the next Year in the <hi>Seneca</hi> Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which all the Nations, far and near, may have due Notice; and where the Super-intendant, or Inſpector-General, ſhould always attend; might be of great Uſe: And the Prices of Goods being fixed from the lateſt Invoices from <hi>New-York,</hi> it would be a great Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the far Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> as well as our own, to purchaſe, and would at the ſame Time be a Check upon the Handlers at <hi>Oſwego,</hi> as well as elſewhere. One eſſential Article in our Trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> and upon which, in a great Meaſure, their All depends, has been hitherto much neglected on our Part; and that is, from us they have the cheapeſt Engliſh Arms and Ammunition, and of Courſe the worſt upon the Face of the Earth: The <hi>French</hi> take Care to ſupply them with what is really good; and I believe at a cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Rate than we can afford the beſt of ours; by which Means I doubt, they will ever be able to underſell us in that eſſential Article, unleſs ſome effectual Methods are fallen upon to prevent it; ſuch as allowing us the Importation of a Quantity of Powder for that Purpoſe only from <hi>Holland;</hi> the Traders have attempted this, to their Coſt. The <hi>French</hi> purchaſe <hi>Indian</hi> Goods'
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006699_0015_1029AB8140BE46F0"/>both in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> for thoſe very <hi>Indians.</hi> Why might not we be allowed the Importation of Powder and Arms from <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>France?</hi> or why might we not manufacture our own Powder in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks</hi> Country, where Saltpetre may be had in Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, from thoſe vaſt Beds of Pidgeon-Dung? In ſhort, the <hi>Indians</hi> muſt have good Powder and Arms; and where the beſt is, there they will go; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent Situation of Things, they will depend upon the <hi>French</hi> for it. Could we get the better of this one Article, all that Attachment and Intercourſe our <hi>Indians</hi> have at preſent with <hi>Canada,</hi> would, I am confident, ſoon be at an End.</p>
            <p>That inſtead of ſupporting this Trade by Way of Licence, which has hitherto been but oddly managed, that there be a Duty, applicable only to <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs, and thrown into the joint Stock, upon all <hi>Indian</hi> Goods, exported either by Land or Water; and likewiſe upon all Furs and Skins imported, <hi>under the Direction of the Officers of his Majeſty's Cuſtoms: Thoſe appointed by the Country, have generally more Regard to their Friends than their Duty.</hi> This has been formerly practiſed here, and I humbly conceive will anſwer every Purpoſe much better. As this Affair will create a yearly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, ſuch as no one Colony can well bear; let there be a Scheme prepared, for each Colony's paying their Proportion. Moſt certain it is, as I have before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that if ever <hi>New-York, Albany,</hi> and <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, ſhould get into other Hands, every other Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would ſoon follow; and while that is ſecure, every other Colony is ſecure. If this is true, is it poſſible to doubt, but that they will readily comply! In anſwer to that trite Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> As we have all the Trade, we ought to be at all the Expence: In God's Name let each contributing Colony have it's Townſhip upon the Frontiers, with proper Magazines, and one or more Trading-Houſes, and a Sloop, and make the moſt of it.</p>

A long Series of Ill-uſage from the Traders, has given the <hi>Indians</hi> but a very indifferent Opinion of our Morals; and of late, from the ſeveral abortive Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they begin, I doubt, to ſuſpect our Courage; than which, Nothing can more affect our Intereſt with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They of themſelves are honeſt, ſuch at leaſt as have not been debauched by the Chriſtians; and brave in their Way; and deſpiſe Knaves and Cowards.

               <q>Purſuant whereunto you are, as Occaſion requires, to call for the ſame; and in Caſe of any Invaſion upon the neighbouring Plantations, you are, upon Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſpective Governors thereof, to be aiding and aſſiſting to them, in the beſt Manner you can; and as the Condition of your Government will permit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to this Inſtruction, his Majeſty, I doubt, has not been thoroughly informed: Becauſe, upon an Invaſion, conſidering the Diſtance and Dilatorineſs of Aſſemblies, the Miſchief, in all Probability, would be over before we could have any Aſſiſtance: I ſhould, therefore, think it adviſeable, that thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions be immediately detached to the Frontiers, upon the firſt News of a War; there to remain, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006699_0020_1029AB9198BF5F78"/>to be recruited during the War, at the Expence of the ſaid Colonies. I ſhudder to think what would have been the Fate of <hi>Albany,</hi> had not thoſe Troops, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Canada,</hi> been accidentally there; more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially as the People of <hi>Albany,</hi> at that Time, were afflicted with an epidemical Diſtemper, which carried off great Numbers.</p>
            <p>From hence his Majeſty's Care is apparent; and why thoſe Inſtructions have not been hitherto duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, is what I ſhall not take upon me to determine: I cannot, however, help thinking, that, from upwards of forty Years Obſervations upon the Conduct of our Colony Aſſemblies, and the little Regard paid by them to Inſtructions, if it is left altogether to them, the Whole will end in Altercation and Words. By the above Inſtructions it appears, that his Majeſty is fully apprized of the Conſequences of leaving this Colony unguarded; as well as of its Inability to anſwer his moſt gracious Intentions.</p>
            <p>I ſhould therefore adviſe, That the Quotas be doubled, which they can now very well bear; and both the <hi>Carolinas</hi> added, and the Whole enforced by an Act of the Britiſh Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>In that Caſe, if this preſent Scheme, or ſomething like it, as I am very far from thinking, but that it will admit of many Improvements, and for that Purpoſe it is offered, is duly executed, I will venture to prophecy, that in twenty Years the whole Fur Trade will be in <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hands, and that the Fur Trade Company in <hi>Canada,</hi> will ſink, upon which the very Being of that Country depends.</p>
            <p>I have only further, with great Submiſſion, to adviſe, that the Meeting of the <hi>Indians</hi> be alternate; one Year at <hi>New-York,</hi> which will add but very little to the Expence, and where the Commiſſioners from thoſe contributing Colonies, may more conveniently attend, and where, it is to be hoped, the <hi>Indians</hi> may receive
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006699_0021_1029AB96923ED278"/>ſome better Impreſſions of our People, than they have hitherto done at <hi>Albany;</hi> the next Year any where, but at <hi>Albany</hi> or <hi>Schenectady.</hi> That the Preſents made upon thoſe Occaſions, as ſoon as viewed, and divided by the particular Nations, be packed up again, in ſuch Manner, as may make the Carriage the eaſieſt, of which they themſelves will be the beſt Judges, and locked up, and the Keys to be delivered to the principal Sachem of each Nation, and not to be opened 'till they arrive in their own Country. I believe, I may venture to affirm, that the greateſt Part of thoſe Preſents made them upon thoſe ſolemn Occaſions, ſeldom go further than <hi>Albany</hi> or <hi>Schenectady,</hi> but are bought up by the Handlers, for Rum, and afterwards ſold to them when ſober, at a dear Rate. I would propoſe this Method, being well aſſured, there is no Law can be contrived, or Oath framed, to bind a Handler.</p>
            <p>[<hi>So much for our Northern Frontiers.</hi>]</p>
            <p>AS to our Southern Frontiers, the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I mean, of <hi>NewYork,</hi> let thoſe be altogether under the Direction, and at the Expence of the Colony of <hi>NewYork;</hi> hoping withal, his Majeſty will be graciouſly pleaſed, to favour us with a ſmall Detachment of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and one Engineer, for ſome Time at leaſt, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome Artillery and Ammunition. Large Sums have been expended, or rather ſquandered away upon this Account, by the Country, to very little Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Let there be two Batteries erected at the <hi>Narrows;</hi> one on each Side, in proper Places, and with Breaſt-Works only; any Fortifications there, may fall into the Enemy's Hands, and have bad Conſequences, Theſe Batteries to be under the Care of the adjoining Counties; that on the Eaſt Side, under the Care of the Regiment of <hi>Kings</hi> County; and that on the Weſt Side, under the Care of the Regiment of <hi>Richmond</hi> County.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006699_0022_1029AB99DCBEE6E8"/>
Our utmoſt Endeavours muſt be in the firſt Place, to prevent the Enemy's Landing; and alſo in the next Place, to prevent a Bombardment. For this Purpoſe it may be neceſſary, narrowly to view the Coaſt below the two firſt Batteries. Should an Enemy land at or near <hi>New-Utrecht,</hi> the March is eaſy, even with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, from thence to the Ferry, of which we ſhould ſoon feel the Effects. Low Batteries, as I would have all thoſe to be, even with the Water if poſſible, at <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Yellow-Hook,</hi> will be a Means to prevent a Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardment, and the Enemy's Landing upon <hi>Long-Iſland.</hi> A ſmall Battery upon <hi>Kennedy's-Iſland,</hi> may be of Uſe. Let there be ſeveral ſmall Batteries fixed round <hi>Nutten-Iſland,</hi> of heavy Cannon, and it were to be wiſhed they were all ſuch; and one ſtrong Entrenchment in the Middle, for a Number of Troops.</p>
            <p>At the Eaſt End of the Town, a good Battery will be neceſſary, as well as ſeveral along <hi>Hudſon's-River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would not have any of thoſe Batteries exceed five Guns; but to be placed the thicker. Ships generally aim at one Battery at a Time. Beſides, it is impoſſible to know where a Ship may lye. In this Caſe, it is odds but ſome of our Batteries may take her up.</p>
            <p>Breaſt-Works, with Block-Houſes inſtead of Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adoes, would anſwer all Purpoſes much better, be much leſs Expence, and laſt longer.</p>
            <p>As to the Fort, and the lower Batteries, they are altogether ill deſigned, and as badly executed. But as our late Engineer has reported to his Excellency, the Failures, and the Improvements that may be made, ſo as to reſiſt any ſudden Attack, to that I refer.</p>
            <p>It is a conſtant Rule, that every detached Work, however inſignificant in itſelf, ſhould have its Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition at Hand, to be come at without Difficulty or Danger; One Hundred Weight of Powder to each Gun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:006699_0023_1029AB9D356F9890"/>
The Regiments of <hi>Suffolk, Queens</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Richmond</hi> and <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> will be Force ſufficient to defend the City, if they can be brought together with Regularity and Certainty; to which, however, may be added, the Militia of <hi>Connecticut</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> County. Let all the other Counties bend their Force towards the Frontiers.</p>
            <p>Beacons, or rather Smoaks, in the Day Time, and Rockets or Great Guns in the Night, for this Purpoſe, will be abſolutely neceſſary. It will be no great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to carry an Alarm to the Eaſt End of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> to <hi>Richmond</hi> County and <hi>Weſtcheſter,</hi> at the ſame Time, in a very few Hours; upon which, every Man that keeps a Horſe, ought to make the beſt of his Way to the City, and not to wait forming into Companies, 'till they arrive at the City; where I will ſuppoſe the Colonel or Lieut. Colonel to be forming them, whilſt the other who may have full Power to preſs Horſes, is bringing up the Rear; where Tranſportation is neceſſary, the City to take Care to have Boats at the proper Landings.</p>
            <p>During a War, let there be one ſtout Sloop of War provided at the Expence of the Governments of <hi>Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey,</hi> and <hi>Pennſylvania;</hi> one other at the Expence of <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South-Carolinas, Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland;</hi> and one at the Expence of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts, New-Hampſhire, Halifax,</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia:</hi> Which, if under proper Regulations, together with the Station Ships, will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to protect our Trade. Give me Leave to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, that in Caſe of a War, we ſhall ſorely repent it, if timely Proviſion is not made againſt the Efforts of the People of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> and upon our Settlements from <hi>Crown-Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If theſe Things, or ſomething of this kind, perhaps from an abler Hand, be duly conſidered, and executed, during the Calm of a Peace, we ſhall have little to apprehend from an Enemy. What I moſt apprehend
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006699_0024_1029ABA23AF5C000"/>is, the old Proverb, <hi>What's every Body's Buſineſs, is no Body's Buſineſs.</hi> But let thoſe Gentlemen, I mean our General Aſſemblies, with whom we have intruſted the Care of our Lives and Liberties, anſwer, if they can, either to God or Man, a Neglect of their Duty, in a Matter of ſo much Importance to themſelves, their Fellow-Subjects and Poſterity. <hi>Dulce eſt pro Patria Mori,</hi> is an old <hi>Roman</hi> Maxim; and tho' I have not at preſent any Thoughts of dying for my Country, yet I have a real Satisfaction, in imagining, whether in Reality, or not, I cannot ſay, That I have pointed out ſome Things, which, if obſerved, may prevent a good deal of Bloodſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which I waſh my Hands clear, and leave it at the Doors of thoſe whoſe proper Buſineſs it is to look out in Time.</p>

            <p>I Have, as you deſire, read the Manuſcript you ſent me; and am of Opinion, with the publick-ſpirited Author, that ſecuring the Friendſhip of the <hi>Indians</hi> is of the greateſt Conſequence to theſe Colonies; and that the ſureſt Means of doing it, are, to regulate the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade, ſo as to convince them, by Experience, that they may have the beſt and cheapeſt Goods, and the faireſt Dealing from the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and to unite the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Governments, ſo as to form a Strength that the <hi>Indians</hi> may depend on for Protection, in Caſe of a Rupture with the <hi>French;</hi> or apprehend great Danger from, if they ſhould break with us.</p>
            <p>This Union of the Colonies, however neceſſary, I apprehend is not to be brought about by the Means that have hitherto been uſed for that Purpoſe. A Governor of one Colony, who happens from ſome Circumſtances in his own Government, to ſee the Neceſſity of ſuch an Union, writes his Sentiments of the Matter to the other Governors, and deſires them to recommend it to their reſpective Aſſemblies. They accordingly lay the Letters before thoſe Aſſemblies, and perhaps recommend the Propoſal in general Words. But Governors are often on ill Terms with their Aſſemblies, and ſeldom are the Men that have the moſt Influence among them. And
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006699_0026_1029ABA58C6EBD40"/>perhaps ſome Governors, tho' they openly recommend the Scheme, may privately throw cold Water on it, as thinking additional publick Charges will make their People leſs able, or leſs willing to give to them. Or perhaps they do not clearly ſee the Neceſſity of it, and therefore do not very earneſtly preſs the Conſideration of it: And no one being preſent that has the Affair at Heart, to back it, to anſwer and remove Objections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis eaſily dropt, and nothing is done.—Such an Union is certainly neceſſary to us all, but more immediately ſo to your Government. Now, if you were to pick out half a Dozen Men of good Underſtanding and Addreſs, and furniſh them with a reaſonable Scheme and proper Inſtructions, and ſend them in the Nature of Ambaſſadors to the other Colonies, where they might apply particularly to all the leading Men, and by proper Management get them to engage in promoting the Scheme; where, by being preſent, they would have the Opportunity of preſſing the Affair both in publick and private, obviating Difficulties as they ariſe, anſwering Objections as ſoon as they are made, before they ſpread and gather Strength in the Minds of the People, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> I imagine ſuch an Union might thereby be made and eſtabliſhed: For reaſonable ſenſible Men, can always make a reaſonable Scheme appear ſuch to other reaſonable Men, if they take Pains, and have Time and Opportunity for it; unleſs from ſome Circumſtances their Honeſty and good Intentions are ſuſpected. A voluntary Union entered into by the Colonies themſelves, I think, would be preferable to one impos'd by Parliament; for it would be perhaps not much more difficult to procure, and more eaſy to alter and improve, as Circumſtances ſhould require, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience direct. It would be a very ſtrange Thing, if ſix Nations of ignorant Savages ſhould be capable of forming a Scheme for ſuch an Union, and be able to execute it in ſuch a Manner, as that it has ſubſiſted Ages, and appears indiſſoluble; and yet that a like Union ſhould be impracticable for ten or a Dozen <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006699_0027_1029ABAA9F370720"/>whom it is more neceſſary, and muſt be more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous; and who cannot be ſuppoſed to want an equal Underſtanding of their Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Were there a general Council form'd by all the Colonies, and a general Governor appointed by the Crown to preſide in that Council, or in ſome Manner to concur with and confirm their Acts, and take Care of the Execution; every Thing relating to Indian Affairs and the Defence of the Colomes, might be properly put under their Management. Each Colony ſhould be repreſented by as many Members as it pays Sums of Hundred Pounds into the common Treaſury for the common Expence; which Treaſury would perhaps be beſt and moſt equitably ſupply'd, by an equal Exciſe on ſtrong Liquors in all the Colonies, the Produce never to be apply'd to the private Uſe of any Colony, but to the general Service. Perhaps if the Council were to meet ſucceſſively at the Capitals of the ſeveral Colonies, they might thereby become better acquainted with the Circumſtances, Intereſts, Strength or Weakneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all, and thence be able to judge better of Meaſures propos'd from time to time. At leaſt it might be more ſatisfactory to the Colonies, if this were propos'd as a Part of the Scheme; for a Preference might create Jealouſy and Diſlike.</p>
            <p>I believe the Place mention'd is a very ſuitable one to build a Fort on. In Times of Peace, Parties of the Garriſons of all Frontier Forts might be allowed to go out on Hunting Expeditions, with or without Indians, and have the Profit to themſelves of the Skins they get: By this Means a Number of Wood-Runners would be form'd, well acquainted with the Country, and of great Uſe in War Time, as Guides of Parties and Scouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— Every Indian is a Hunter; and as their Manner of making War, <hi>viz.</hi> by Skulking, Surprizing and Killing particular Perſons and Families, is juſt the ſame as their Manner of Hunting, only changing the Object, Every Indian is a diſciplin'd Soldier, Soldiers of this Kind
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006699_0028_1029ABAE361CD050"/>are always wanted in the Colonies in an Indian War; for the <hi>European</hi> Military Diſcipline is of little Uſe in theſe Woods.</p>
            <p>Publick Trading Houſes would certainly have a good Effect towards regulating the private Trade; and preventing the Impoſitions of the private Traders; and therefore ſuch ſhould be eſtabliſhed in ſuitable Places all along the Frontiers; and the Superintendant of the Trade, propos'd by the Author, would, I think, be a uſeful Officer.</p>
            <p>The Obſervation concerning the Importation of <hi>Germans</hi> in too great Numbers into <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> is, I believe, a very juſt one. This will in a few Years become a <hi>German</hi> Colony: Inſtead of their Learning our Language, we muſt learn their's, or live as in a foreign Country. Already the <hi>Engliſh</hi> begin to quit particular Neighbourhoods ſurrounded by <hi>Dutch,</hi> being made uneaſy by the Diſagreeableneſs of diſonant Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and in Time, Numbers will probably quit the Province for the ſame Reaſon. Beſides, the <hi>Dutch</hi> under-live, and are thereby enabled to under-work and under-ſell the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> who are thereby extreamly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded, and conſequently diſguſted, ſo that there can be no cordial Affection or Unity between the two Nations. How good Subjects they may make, and how faithful to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Intereſt, is a Queſtion worth conſidering. And in my Opinion, equal Numbers might have been ſpared from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Iſlands without being miſs'd there, and on proper Encouragement would have come over. I ſay without being miſs'd, perhaps I might ſay without leſſening the Number of People at Home. I queſtion indeed, whether there be a Man the leſs in <hi>Britain</hi> for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Colonies. An Iſland can ſupport but a certain Number of People: When all Employments are full, Multitudes refrain Marriage, 'till they can ſee how to maintain a Family. The Number of Engliſhmen in <hi>England,</hi> cannot by their preſent common Increaſe be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006699_0029_1029ABAFB8E92B08"/>doubled in a Thouſand Years; but if half of them were taken away and planted in <hi>America,</hi> where there is Room for them to encreaſe, and ſufficient Employment and Subſiſtance; the Number of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> would be doubled in <hi>100 Years:</hi> For thoſe left at home, would multiply in that Time ſo as to fill up the Vacancy, and thoſe here would at leaſt keep Pace with them.</p>
            <p>Every one muſt approve the Propoſal of encouraging a Number of ſober diſcreet Smiths to reſide among the <hi>Indians.</hi> They would doubtleſs be of great Service. The whole Subſiſtance of <hi>Indians,</hi> depends on keeping their Guns in order; and if they are obliged to make a Journey of two or three hundred Miles to an Engliſh Settlement to get a Lock mended; it may, beſides the Trouble, occaſion the Loſs of their Hunting Seaſon. They are People that think much of their temporal, but little of their ſpiritual Intereſts; and therefore, as he would be a moſt uſeful and neceſſary Man to them, a Smith is more likely to influence them than a Jeſuit; provided he has a good common Underſtanding, and is from time to time well inſtructed.</p>
            <p>I wiſh I could offer any Thing for the Improvement of the Author's Piece, but I have little Knowledge, and leſs Experience in theſe Matters. I think it ought to be printed; and ſhould be glad there were a more general Communication of the Sentiments of judicious Men, on Subjects ſo generally intereſting; it would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good Effects. Pleaſe to preſent my Reſpects to the Gentleman, and thank him for the Peruſal of his Manuſcript.</p>
