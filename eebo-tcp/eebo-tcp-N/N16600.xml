            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE WHALE-FISHERY.</head>
            <p>WHALE oil enters, as a raw material, into ſeveral branches of manufacture, as of wool, leather, ſoap: it is uſed alſo in painting, architecture and navigation. But its great conſumption is in lighting houſes and cities. For this laſt purpoſe however it has a powerful competitor in the vegetable oils. Theſe do well in warm, ſtill weather, but they fix with cold, they extinguiſh eaſily with the wind, their crop is precarious, depending on the ſeaſons, and to yield the ſame light, a larger wick muſt be uſed, and greater quantity of oil conſumed. Eſtimating all theſe articles of difference together, thoſe employed in lighting cities find their account in giving about 25 per cent. more for whale than for vegetable oils. But higher than this the whale oil, in its preſent form, cannot riſe; becauſe it then becomes more advantageous to the city-lighters to uſe others. This competition then limits its price<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> higher than which no encouragement can raiſe it, and becomes, as it were, a law of its nature, but, at this low price; the whale fiſhery is the pooreſt buſineſs into which a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant or ſailor can enter. If the ſailor, inſtead of wages, has a part of what is taken, he finds that this, one year with another, yields him leſs than he could have got as wages in any other buſineſs. It is attended too with great riſk, ſingular hardſhips, and long abſences from his family. If the voyage is made ſolely at the expence of the merchant, he finds that, one year with another, it does
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:021345_0002_0FB31DC49C987EE0"/>
not reimburſe him his expences. As, for example, an Engliſh ſhip of 300 ton, and 42. hands brings home, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munibus annis, after a four months voyage, 25. ton of oil, worth 437l. 10s. ſterl. but the wages of the officers and ſeamen will be 400l. The Outfit then and the merchant's profit muſt be paid by the government. And it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly on this idea that the Britiſh bounty is calculated. From the poverty of this buſineſs then it has happened that the nations, who have taken it up, have ſucceſſively abandoned it. The Baſques began it. But, tho' the moſt economical and enterpriſing of the inhabitants of France, they could not continue it; and it is ſaid they never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed more than 30. ſhips a year. The Dutch and Hanſe towns ſucceeded them. The latter gave it up long ago tho' they have continued to lend their name to Britiſh and Dutch oils. The Engliſh carried it on, in competition with the Dutch, during the laſt, and beginning of the preſent century. But it was too little profitable for them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with other branches of commerce open to them. In the mean time too the inhabitants of the barren Iſland of Nantucket had taken up this fiſhery, invited to it by the whales preſenting themſelves on their own ſhore. To them therefore the Engliſh relinquiſhed it, continuing to them, as Britiſh ſubjects, the importation of their oils into England duty free, while foreigners were ſubject to a duty of 18l. 5s. ſterl. a ton. the Dutch were enabled to continue it long, becauſe, 1. They are ſo near the northern fiſhing grounds, that a veſſel begins her fiſhing very ſoon after ſhe is out of port. 2. They navigate with more eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy than the other nations of Europe. 3. Their ſeamen are content with lower wages: and 4. their merchants with a lower profit on their capital. Under all theſe favorable circumſtances however, this branch of buſineſs, after long languiſhing, is at length nearly extinct with them. It is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:021345_0003_0FB31DC64FF51540"/>
ſaid they did not ſend above half a dozen ſhips in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the whale this preſent year. The Nantuckois then were the only people who exerciſed this fiſhery to any extent at the commencement of the late war. Their country, from its barrenneſs, yielding no ſubſiſtence, they were obliged to ſeek it in the ſea which ſurrounded them. Their economy was more rigorous than that of the Dutch. Their ſeamen, inſtead of wages, had a ſhare in what was taken. This induced them to fiſh with fewer hands, ſo that each had a greater dividend in the profit. It made them more vigilant in ſeeking game, bolder in purſuing it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimonious in all their expences. London was their only market. When therefore, by the late revolution, they became aliens in great Britain, they became ſubject to the alien duty of 18l. 5s. the ton of oil, which being more than equal to the price of the common whale oil, they were obliged to abandon that fiſhery. So that this people, who before the war had employed upwards of 300 veſſels a year in the whale fiſhery, (while great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain had herſelf never employed one hundred) have now almoſt ceaſed to exerciſe it. But they ſtill had the ſeamen, the moſt important material for this fiſhery; and they ſtill retained the ſpirit of fiſhing: ſo that at the reeſtabliſhment of peace they were capable in a very ſhort time of reviving their fiſhery in all its ſplendor. The Britiſh government ſaw that the moment was critical. They knew that their own ſhare in that fiſhery was as nothing. That the great maſs of fiſhermen was left with a nation now ſeparated from them: that theſe fiſhermen however had loſt their ancient market, had no other reſource within their country to which they could turn, and they hoped therefore they might, in the preſent moment of diſtreſs, be decoyed over to their eſtabliſhments, and be added to the maſs of their ſeamen. To effect this they offered extravagant advantages
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021345_0004_0FB31DC7CFC283F0"/>
to all perſons who ſhould exerciſe the whale fiſhery from Britiſh eſtabliſhments. But not counting with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on a long connection with their remaining poſſeſſions on the continent of America, foreſeeing that the Nantuckois would ſettle in them preferably, if put on an equal footing with thoſe of great Britain, and that thus they might have to purchaſe them a ſecond time, they confined their high offers to ſettlers in Great Britain. The Nantuckois, left without reſource by the loſs of their market, began to think of removing to the Britiſh dominions: ſome to Nova Scotia, preferring ſmaller advantages, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their ancient country and friends; others to great Britain poſtponing country and friends to high premiums. A veſſel was already arrived from Halifax to Nantucket to take off ſome of thoſe who propoſed to remove; two families had gone on board and others were going, when a letter was received there, which had been written by Monſieur le Marquis de la Fayette to a gentleman in Boſton, and tranſmitted by him to Nantucket. The purport of the letter was to diſſuade their accepting the Britiſh propoſals, and to aſſure them that their friends in France would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do ſomething for them. This inſtantly ſuſpended their deſign: not another went on board, and the veſſel returned to Halifax with only the two families.</p>
            <p>In fact the French Government had not been inattentive to the views of the Britiſh, nor inſenſible of the criſis. They ſaw the danger of permitting five or ſix thouſand of the beſt ſeamen exiſting to be transferred by a ſingle ſtroke to the marine ſtrength of their enemy, and to carry over with them an art which they poſſeſſed almoſt excluſively. The counterplan which they ſet on foot was to tempt the Nantuckois by high offers to come and ſettle in France. This was in the year 1785. The Britiſh however had in their favour a ſameneſs of language, religion, laws, habits
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021345_0005_0FB31DC9531B6350"/>
and kindred. 9 families only, of 33 perſons in the whole came to Dunkirk; ſo that this project was not likely to prevent their emigration to the Engliſh eſtabliſhments, if nothing elſe had happened.</p>
            <p>France had effectually aided in detaching the U. S. of America from the <hi>force</hi> of Great Britain. But as yet they ſeemed to have indulged only a ſilent wiſh to detach them from her <hi>commerce.</hi> They had done nothing to induce that event. In the ſame year 1785, while M. de Calonne was in treaty, with the Nantuckois, an eſtimate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the U. S. was ſubmitted to the count de Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gennes, and it was ſhewn that, of 3. millions of pounds ſterling to which their exports amounted, one third might be brought to France and exchanged againſt her produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and manufactures advantageouſly for both nations, provided the obſtacles of prohibition, monopoly, and duty were either done away or moderated as far as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would admit. A committee, which had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to inveſtigate a particular one of theſe ſubjects, was thereupon inſtructed to extend its reſearches to the whole, and ſee what advantages and facilities the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could offer for the encouragement of a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the United States. The Committee was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of perſons well ſkilled in commerce; and, after labouring aſſiduouſly for ſeveral months, they made their report: the reſult of which was given in the letter of his Majeſty's Comptroller General of the 2d of Octob. 1786. wherein he ſtated the principles which ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the future regulation of the commerce between France and the United States. It was become tolerably evident, at the date of this letter, that the terms offered to the Nantuckois would not produce their emigration to Dunkirk; and that it would be ſafeſt in every event to offer ſome other alternative which might prevent their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021345_0006_0FB31DD05B4A5BD0"/>
acceptance of the Britiſh offers. The obvious one was to open the port of France to their oils, ſo that they might ſtill exerci<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e their fiſhery, remaining in their native country, and find a new market for its produce inſtead of that which they had loſt. The article of Whale oil was accordingly diſtinguiſhed, in the letter of M. de Calon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, by an immediate abatement of duty, and promiſe of further abatement after the year 1790. This letter was inſtantly ſent to America, and bid fair to produce there the effect intended, by determining the fiſhermen to carry on their trade from their own homes, with the advantage only of a free marker in France, rather than remove to Great Britain where a free market and great bounty were offered them. An Arret was ſtill to be prepared to give legal ſanction to the letter of M. de Calonne. M. Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, with a patience and aſſiduity almoſt unexampled, went through all the inveſtigations neceſſary to aſſure himſelf that the concluſions of the Committee had been juſt. Frequent conferences on this ſubject were held in his preſence; the Deputies of the Chambers of Commerce were heard, and the reſult was the Arret of Dec. 29. 1787. confirming the abatements of duty preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the letter of Octob. 1786. had promiſed, and reſerving to his Majeſty to grant ſtill further favours to that production, if on further information he ſhould find it for the intereſt of the two Nations.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh had now begun to deluge the markets of France with their whale oils: and they were enabled by the great premiums given by their Government to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſell the French fiſherman, aided by feebler premiums, and the American aided by his poverty alone. Nor is it certain that theſe ſpeculations were not made at the riſk of the Britiſh Government, to ſuppreſs the French and American fiſhermen in their only market. Some remedy
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021345_0007_0FB31DD226781948"/>
ſeemed neceſſary. Perhaps it would not have been a bad one to ſubject, by a general law, the merchandize of every nation and of every nature to pay additional duties in the ports of France exactly equal to the premiums and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backs given on the ſame merchandiſe by their own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This might not only counteract the effect of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium in the inſtance of whale oils, but attack the whole Britiſh ſyſtem of bounties and drawbacks by the aid of which they make London the center of commerce for the whole earth. A leſs general remedy, but an effectual one, was to prohibit the oils of all <hi>European</hi> nations: the treaty with England requiring only that ſhe ſhould be treated as well as the moſt favoured <hi>European</hi> nation. But the remedy adopted was to prohibit all oils without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>To know how this remedy will operate we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the quantity of whale oil which France conſumes annually, the quantity ſhe obtains from her own fiſhery; and if ſhe obtains leſs than ſhe conſumes, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what will follow this prohibition.</p>
            <p>The annual conſumption of France, as ſtated by a perſon who has good opportunities of knowing it, is as follows.</p>

It is treating theſe with ſufficient reſpect to place them on an equal footing with the eſtimate of the perſon before alluded to, and to ſuppoſe the truth half way between them. We will call then the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſumption of France only 60,000 quintals, or 3750 ton a year. This conſumption is increaſing faſt as the practice of lighting cities is becoming more general, and the ſuperior advantages of lighting them with whale oil are but now beginning to be known.</p>
            <p>What do the fiſheries of France furniſh? ſhe has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed this year 15. veſſels in the Southern, and 2 in the Northern fiſhery, carrying 4500 tons in the whole or 265 each on an average. The Engliſh ſhips, led by Nantuckois as well as the French, have as I am told never averaged, in the Southern fiſhery, more than one fifth of their burthen, in the beſt year. The 15 ſhips of France, according to this ground of calculation, and ſuppoſing the preſent to have been one of the beſt years, ſhould have brought, one with another, one fifth of 265 tons, or 53 tons each. But we are told they have brought near the double of that, to wit 100 tons each and 1500 tons in the whole. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the 2. Northern veſſels to have brought home the cargo which is common from the Northern fiſhery, to wit, 25 tons each, the whole produce this year will then be 1550 tons. This is 5½ months proviſion or two fifths of the annual conſumption. To furniſh for the whole year would require 40 ſhips of the ſame ſize, in years as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as the preſent, and 85 communibus annis, 44 tons, or one ſixth of the burthen, being as high an average as ſhould be counted on, one year with another: and the number muſt be increaſed with the increaſing conſumption. France then is evidently not yet in a condition to ſupply
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021345_0009_0FB31DD603A52AA0"/>
her own wants. It is ſaid indeed ſhe has a large ſtock on hand unſold occaſioned by the Engliſh competition. 33,000 quintals, including this year's produce, are ſpoken of. This is between 6. and 7. months proviſion: and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, by the time this is exhauſted, that the next year's ſupply comes in, that will enable her to go on 5. or 6. months longer; ſay a twelvemonth in the whole. But, at the end of the twelvemonth, what is to be done? The Manufactures depending on this article cannot main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their competition againſt thoſe of other countries, if deprived of their equal means. When the alternative then ſhall be preſented of letting them drop, or opening the ports to foreign whale oil, it is preſumable the latter will be adopted, as the leſſer evil. But it will be too late for America: her fiſhery, annihilated during the late war, only began to raiſe its head on the proſpect of market held out by this country. Cruſhed by the Arret of Sept. 28. in its firſt feeble effort to revive, it will riſe no more. Expeditions, which require the expence of the outfit of veſſels, and from 9. to 12 months navigation, as the Southern fiſhery does, moſt frequented by the Americans, cannot be undertaken in ſole reliance on a market which is opened and ſhut from one day to another, with little or no warning. The Engliſh alone then will remain to furniſh theſe ſupplies, and they muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived even from them. We muſt accept bread from our enemies, if our friends cannot furniſh it. This comes exactly to the point to which that government has been looking. She fears no rival in the whale fiſhery but Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Or rather, it is the whale fiſhery of America of which ſhe is endeavouring to poſſeſs herſelf. It is for this object ſhe is making the preſent extraordinary efforts by bounties and other encouragements: and her ſucceſs ſo far is very flattering. Before the war ſhe had not 100 veſſels

They have juſt changed places then, England having gained exactly what America has loſt. France by her ports and markets holds the balance between the two contending parties, and gives the victory, by opening and ſhutting them, to which ſhe pleaſes. We have ſtill precious remains of ſeamen educated in this fiſhery, and capable by their poverty, their boldneſs and addreſs, of recovering it from the Engliſh, in ſpite of their bounties. But this Arret endangers the transferring to Great Britain every man of them who is not invincibly attached to his native ſoil. There is no other nation in preſent condition to maintain a competition with Great Britain in the whale fiſhery. The expence at which it is ſupported on her part ſeems enormous. 255 veſſels, of 75 4<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are known to have coſt the government 15l. each, or 176,580l. in the whole, and that to employ the principal part of them from 3. to 4. months only. The Northern ſhips have brought home 20. and the Southern 60. tons of oil on an average, making 8,640 tons, every ton of oil then has coſt the government 20l. in bounty. Still, if they can beat us out of the field and have it to themſelves, they will think their money well employed. If France undertakes ſolely the competition againſt them, ſhe muſt do it at equal expence. The trade is too poor to ſupport itſelf. The 85 ſhips neceſſary to ſupply even her preſent conſumption, bountied as the Engliſh are, will require a ſacrifice of 1,285,200 livres a year, to maintain 3,570 ſeamen, and that a part of the year only. And if ſhe will puſh it to 12,000
<pb n="11"

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
men in competition with England, ſhe muſt ſacrifice, as they do, 4. or 5. millions a year. The ſame number of men might, with the ſame bounty, be kept in as conſtant employ carrying ſtone from Bayonne to Cherburg, or coal from Newcaſtle to Havre, in which navigations they would be always at hand, and become as good ſeamen. The Engliſh conſider among their beſt ſailors thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in carrying coal from Newcaſtle to London. France cannot expect to raiſe her fiſhery, even to the ſupply of her own conſumption, in one year or in ſeveral years. Is it not better then, by keeping her ports open to the U. S. to enable them to aid in maintaining the field againſt the common adverſary, till ſhe ſhall be in condition to take it herſelf, and to ſupply her own wants? Otherwiſe her ſupplies muſt aliment that very force which is keeping her under. On our part, we can never be dangerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors to France. The extent to which we can exerciſe this fiſhery is limited to that of the barren iſland of Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket, and a few ſimilar barren ſpots; its duration to the pleaſure of this government, as we have no other market.</p>
            <p>A material obſervation muſt be added here. Sudden viciſſitudes of opening and ſhutting ports, do little injury to merchants ſettled on the oppoſite coaſt, watching for the opening, like the return of a tide, and ready to enter with it. But they ruin the adventurer whoſe diſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires 6 months notice. Thoſe who are now arriving from America, in conſequence of the Arret of Dec. 29. will conſider it as the falſe light which has led them to their ruin. They will be apt to ſay that they come to the ports of France by invitation of that Arret, that the ſubſequent one of Sept. 28. which drives them from thoſe ports, founds itſelf on a ſingle principle, viz. 'that the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreign oils is the moſt uſeful encouragement which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021345_0012_0FB31DDAAA0F3640"/>
can be given to that branch of induſtry.' They will ſay that, if this be a true principle, it was as true on the 29th. of Dec. 1787. as on the 28th. of Sept. 1788. it was then weighed againſt other motives, judged weaker, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled, and it is hard it ſhould be now revived to ruin them.</p>
            <p>The Refinery for whale oil lately eſtabliſhed at Rouen, ſeems to be an object worthy of national attention. In order to judge of its importance, the different qualities of whale oil muſt be noted. Three qualities are known in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican and Engliſh markets. 1. That of the Spermaceti whale. 2. Of the Groenland whale. 3. Of the Brazil whale. 1. The Spermaceti whale found by the Nantucketmen in the neighbourhood of the weſtern Iſlands, to which they had gone in purſuit of other whales, retired thence to the coaſt of Guinea, afterwards to that of Brazil, and begins now to be beſt found in the latitude of the cape of good hope, and even of cape Horn. He is an active, fierce ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and requires vaſt addreſs and boldneſs in the fiſherman. The inhabitants of Brazil make little expeditions from their coaſt, and take ſome of theſe fiſh. But the Americans are the only diſtant people who have been in the habit of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and attacking them in numbers. The Britiſh however, led by the Nantuckois whom they have decoyed into their ſervice, have begun this fiſhery. In 1785 they had 18 ſhips in it; in 1787, 38: in 1788, 54. or as ſome ſay 64. I have calculated on the middle number 59. ſtill they take but a very ſmall proportion of their own demand. We furniſh the reſt. Theirs is the only market to which we carry that oil, becauſe it is the only one where its properties are known. It is luminous, reſiſts coagulation by cold to the 41ſt. degree of Farenheit's thermometer, and 4th. of Reaumur's, and yields no ſmell at all. It is uſed therefore within doors to lighten ſhops, and even in the richeſt houſes
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021345_0013_0FB31DE0F125DD08"/>
for antichambers, ſtairs, galleries, &amp;c. it ſells at the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don market for treble the price of common whale oil. This enables the adventurer to pay the duty of 18l. 5s. ſterl. the ton, and ſtill to have a living profit. Beſides the maſs of oil produced from the whole body of the whale, his head yields 3. or 4. barrels of what is called head-matter, from which is made the ſolid Spermaceti uſed for medicine and candles. This ſells by the pound at double the price of the oil. The diſadvantage of this fiſhery is that the ſailors are from 9. to 12. months abſent on the voyage, of courſe they are not at hand on any ſudden emergency, and are even liable to be taken before they know that a war is begun. It muſt be added on the ſubject of this whale, that he is rare, and ſhy, ſoon abandoning the grounds where he is hunted. This fiſhery being leſs loſing than the other, and often profitable, will occaſion it to be ſo thronged ſoon, as to bring it on a level with the other. It will then require the ſame expenſive ſupport, or to be abandoned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Groenland whale oil is next in quality. It reſiſts coagulation by cold to 36°. of Farenheit and 2°. of Reau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur; but it has a ſmell inſupportable within doors, and is not luminous. It ſells therefore in London at about 16l. the ton. This whale is clumſy and timid, he dives when ſtruck, and comes up to breathe by the firſt cake of ice, where the fiſhermen need little addreſs or courage to find and take him. This is the fiſhery moſtly frequented by Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean nations; it is this fiſh which yields the ſin in quantity, and the voyages laſt about 3. or 4. months.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third quality is that of the ſmall Brazil whale. He was originally found on the coaſt of Nantucket, and firſt led that people to this purſuit. He retired firſt to the banks of Newfoundland, then to the weſtern iſlands; and is now found within ſoundings on the coaſt of Brazil, during the months of December, January, February and March.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021345_0014_0FB31DE2CF3FA408"/>
This oil chills at 50°. of Farenheit and 8°. of Reaumur, is black and offenſive, worth therefore but 13l. the ton in London. In warm ſummer nights however it burns better than the Groenland oil.</p>
            <p>The qualities of the oils thus deſcribed, it is to be added that an individual has diſcovered methods 1. of converting a great part of the oil of the ſpermaceti whale into the ſolid ſubſtance called ſpermaceti, heretofore produced from his head alone. 2. Of refining the Groenland whale oil, ſo as to take from it all ſmell and render it limpid and luminous, as that of the ſpermaceti whale. 3. of curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the oil of the Brazil whale into tallow, reſembling that of the beef, and anſwering all its purpoſes. This perſon is engaged by the company which has eſtabliſhed the Refinery at Rouen: their works will coſt them half a million of livres, will be able to refine all the oil which can be uſed in the kingdom, and even to ſupply foreign markets.—The effect of this refinery then would be 1. to ſupplant the ſolid ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceti of all other nations by theirs of equal quality and lower price. 2. to ſubſtitute, inſtead of ſpermaceti oil, their black whale oil, refined, of equal quality and lower price. 3. to render the worthleſs oil of the Brazil whale equal in value to tallow: and 4. by accomodating theſe oils to uſes, to which they could never otherwiſe have been applied, they will extend the demand beyond its preſent narrow limits to any ſupply which can be furniſhed, and thus give the moſt effectual encouragement and extenſion to the whale fiſhery. But theſe works were calculated on the Arret of Dec. 29. which admitted here freely and fully the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the American fiſhery. If confined to that of the French fiſhery alone, the enterpriſe may fail for want of matter to work on.</p>
            <p>After this review of the whale fiſhery as a Political inſtitution, a few conſiderations ſhall be added on its
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021345_0015_0FB31DE452EF2330"/>
produce as a baſis of Commercial exchange between France and the United States. The diſcuſſions it has undergone on former occaſions, in this point of view, leaves little new to be now urged.</p>
            <p>The United-States not poſſeſſing mines of the precious metals, they can purchaſe neceſſaries from other nations ſo far only as their produce is received in exchange. Without enumerating our ſmaller articles, we have three of principal importance, proper for the French market, to wit, Tobacco, whale oil, and rice. The firſt and moſt important is Tobacco. This might furniſh an exchange for 8. millions of the productions of this country: but it is under a monopoly, and that not of a mercantile, but a financiering company, whoſe intereſt is to pay in money, and not in merchandiſe; and who are ſo much governed by the ſpirit of ſimplifying their purchaſes and proceedings, that they find means to elude every endeavour on the part of government to make them diffuſe their purchaſes among the merchants in general. Little profit is derived from this then as an article of exchange for the produce and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of France. Whale oil might be next in importance; but that is now prohibited. American Rice is not yet of great, but it is of growing conſumption in France, and being the only article of the three which is free, it may become a principal baſis of exchange. Time and trial may add a fourth, that is, timber. But ſome eſſays, rendered unſuccesful by unfortunate circumſtances, place that at preſent under a diſcredit, which it will be found hereafter not to have merited. The Engliſh know its value, and were ſupplied with it before the war. A ſpirit of hoſtility, ſince that event, led them to ſeek Ruſſian rather than Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſupplies. A new ſpirit of hoſtility has driven them back from Ruſſia, and they are now making contracts for American timber. But of the three articles before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021345_0016_0FB31DE7F1C11F20"/>
proved by experience to be ſuitable for the French market, one is prohibited, one under monopoly, and one alone free, and that the ſmalleſt and of very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited conſumption. The way to encourage purchaſers is to multiply their means of payment. Whale oil might be an important one. In one ſcale is the intereſt of the millions who are lighted, ſhod or clothed with the help of it, and the thouſands of labourers and manufacturers who would be employed in producing the articles which might be given in exchange for it, if received from America. In the other ſcale are the intereſts of the adventurers in the whale fiſhery; each of whom indeed, politically conſidered may be of more importance to the ſtate than a ſimple labourer or manufacturer: but to make the eſtimate with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy it merits, we ſhould multiply the numbers in each ſcale into their individual importance, and ſee which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderates.</p>
            <p>Both governments have ſeen with concern that their commercial intercourſe does not grow as rapidly as they would wiſh. The ſyſtem of the United States is to uſe neither prohibitions nor premiums. Commerce there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates itſelf freely, and aſks nothing better. Where a government finds itſelf under the neceſſity of undertaking that regulation, it would ſeem that it ſhould conduct it as an intelligent merchant would: that is to ſay, invite cuſtomers to purchaſe, by facilitating their means of payment, and by adapting goods to their taſte. If this idea be juſt, government here has two operations to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, with reſpect to the commerce of the United States. 1. To do away, or to moderate, as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the prohibitions and monopolies of their materials for payment. 2. To encourage the inſtitution of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal manufactures which the neceſſities, or the habits of their new cuſtomers call for. Under this latter head a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021345_0017_0FB31DE98FC31C48"/>
hint ſhall be ſuggeſted which muſt find its apology in the motive from which it flows, that is, a deſire of promoting mutual intereſts and cloſe friendſhip. 600,000 of the labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor of America, comprehending ſlaves under that denomination, are clothed in three of the ſimpleſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures poſſible, to wit, Oznabrigs, Plains, and Duffel blankets. The firſt is a linen, the two laſt woollens. It happens too that they are uſed exactly by thoſe who cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the tobacco and rice and in a good degree by thoſe employed in the whale fiſhery. To theſe manufactures they are ſo habituated, that no ſubſtitute will be received. If the veſſels which bring tobacco, rice and whale oil, do not find them in the ports of delivery, they muſt be ſought where they can be found. That is in England at preſent. If they were made in France they would be gladly taken in exchange there. The quantities annually uſed by this deſcription of people, and their value are as follows.

It would be difficult to ſay how much ſhould be added for the conſumption of inhabitants of other deſcriptions. A great deal ſurely. But the preſent view ſhall be confined to the one deſcription named<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7 millions of livres, are 9 millions of days work of thoſe who raiſe card, ſpin and weave the wool and flax; and at 300 working days to the year, would maintain 30,000 people. To introduce theſe ſimple manufactures ſuppoſe government to give 5 per cent. on the value of what ſhould be exported of them, for 10. years to come. If none ſhould be exported, nothing would be to be paid: but on the other hand, if the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021345_0018_0FB31DEB569109E0"/>
manufactures, with this encouragement ſhould riſe to the full demand, it will be a ſacrifice of 351,000 livres. a year for 10. years only, to produce a perpetual ſubſiſtence for more than 30,000 people, (for the demand will grow with our population) while ſhe muſt expend perpetually 1,285,000 livres. a year to maintain the 3,570 ſeamen, who would ſupply her with whale oil: that is to ſay, for each ſeaman as much as for 30. labourers and manufacturers.</p>
            <p>But to return to our ſubject, and to conclude.</p>
            <p>Whether then we conſider the Arret of Sept. 28. in a political or a commercial light, it would ſeem that the U. S. ſhould be excepted from its operation. Still more ſo when they invoke againſt it the amity ſubſiſting between the two nations, the deſire of binding them together by every poſſible intereſt and connection, the ſeveral acts in favour of this exception, the dignity of legiſlation which admits not of changes backwards and forwards, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of commerce which require ſteady regulations, the aſſurances of the friendly motives which have led the king to paſs theſe acts, and the hope that no cauſe will ariſe to change either his motives or his meaſures towards us.</p>
