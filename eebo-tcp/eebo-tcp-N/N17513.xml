            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p n="1">1ſt. WE believe that the firſt light of ſalvation was given or made known to the patriarchs by promiſe; and they that believed in the promiſe of CHRIST, and were obedient to the command of GOD made known unto them, were the people of GOD and were accepted of GOD as righteous, or perfect in their genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; according to the meaſure of light and truth manifeſted unto them; which was as waters to the ancles ſignified by <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s viſion of the holy waters (chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 47.) And altho' they could not receive regeneration or the fulneſs of ſalvation, from the fleſhly or fallen nature in this life; becauſe the fulneſs of time was not yet come, that they ſhould receive the baptiſm of the HOLY GHOST and fire; for the deſtruction of the body of ſin, and purification of the ſoul: but <hi>Abram</hi> being
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:022664_0004_0FB9EBEB834E5040"/>called, and choſen of GOD as the father of the faithful; was received into cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant relation with GOD by promiſe; that in him (and his ſeed which was CHRIST) all the families of the earth ſhould be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and theſe earthly bleſſings, which were promiſed to <hi>Abram,</hi> were a ſhadow of goſpel or ſpiritual bleſſings to come: and circumciſion, though it was a ſeal of <hi>Abram</hi>'s faith, yet it was but a ſign of the mortification and deſtruction of the fleſh by the goſpel in a future day. Obſerve, circumciſion, or outward cutting of the foreſkin of the fleſh, did not cleanſe the man from ſin; but was a ſign of the baptiſm of the HOLY GHOST and fire: which is by the power of GOD manifeſted in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and gifts of the ſpirit, as in the days of the apoſtles; which does indeed deſtroy the body of ſin, or fleſhly nature, and purify the man from all ſin both ſoul and body. So that <hi>Abram,</hi> though in the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:022664_0005_0FB9EBEF646FF508"/>full faith of the promiſe; yet, as he did not receive the ſubſtance of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, his hope of eternal ſalvation was in Chriſt, by the goſpel to be attained in the reſurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. THE ſecond diſpenſation was the law that was given of GOD to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> which was a further manifeſtation of that ſalvation which was promiſed through CHRIST by the goſpel, both in the order and ordinances which was inſtituted and given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the church and people of GOD according to that diſpenſation; which was as waters to the ancles, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> XLVII. by which they were diſtinguiſhed from all the families of the earth. For, while they were ſtrictly obedient to all the commands, odinances, and ſtatutes, that GOD gave them, they were approbated of God according to the promiſe for life; and bleſſing was promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022664_0006_0FB9EBF4E874F2E8"/>unto them in the line of obedience: Curſing and death, in diſobedience: for GOD, who is ever jealous for the honor and glory of his own great name, always dealt with them according to his word: for while they were obedient to the command of GOD, and purged out ſin from amongſt them, GOD was with them, according to his promiſe. But when they diſobeyed the command of GOD, and committed ſin, and became like other people, the hand of the LORD was turned againſt them; and thoſe evils came upon them which GOD had threatened; ſo we ſee that they that were wholly obedient to the will of GOD made known in that diſpenſation, were accepted as juſt, or righteous: yet, as the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſhort, they did not attain that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which was promiſed in the goſpel; ſo that as it reſpected the new-birth, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al purification of the man from all ſin; the law made nothing perfect, but was a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022664_0007_0FB9EBF6508FEDE0"/>ſhadow of good things to come; their only hope of eternal redemption was in the promiſe of CHRIST, by the goſpel to be attained in the reſurrection from the dead. <hi>Acts of the Apoſtle</hi> xxvi. 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THE third diſpenſation was the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of CHRIST'S firſt appearance, in the fleſh: and that ſalvation which took place in conſequence of his life, death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and aſcenſion at the right hand of the father being accepted in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the firſt born among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; he received power and authority to adminiſter the power of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eternal judgment to all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men: ſo that he has become the author of eternal ſalvation to all that obey him; and as CHRIST has this power in himſelf, he did adminiſter power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to his church at the day of Penti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt; as his body: with all the gifts that he had promiſed them, which was the firſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022664_0008_0FB9EBF7698201D0"/>gift of the HOLY GHOST, as an in-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling comforter to abide with them forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and by which they were baptiſed into CHRIST'S death; death to all ſin; and were in the hope of the reſurrection from the dead, through the operation of the power of GOD, which wrought in them. And as they had received the ſubſtance of the promiſe of CHRIST come in the fleſh, by the gift and power of the HOLY GHOST; they had power to preach the goſpel in CHRIST'S name to every creature; — and to adminiſter the power of GOD to as many as believed, and were obedient to the goſpel which they preached: and alſo to remit and retain ſin in the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of CHRIST on earth: ſo that they that believed in the goſpel, and were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to that form of doctrine which was taught them; by denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; and became entirely dead to the law by the body of CHRIST,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022664_0009_0FB9EBF9F3AF56A8"/>or power of the HOLY GHOST, were in the travel of the reſurrection from the dead; or the redemption of the body. So that they who took up a full croſs againſt the world, fleſh, and devil; and who forſook all for CHRIST'S ſake; and followed him in the regeneration, by perſevering in that line of obedience to the end; found the reſurrection from the dead, and eternal ſalvation in that diſpenſation: but as the meaſure of that diſpenſation was only as water to the loins; the myſtery of GOD not finſhed; but there was another day propheſied of, called the ſecond appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of CHRIST, or final and laſt diſplay of GOD'S grace to a loſt world: in which the myſtery of GOD ſhould be finiſhed as he has ſpoken by his prophets ſince the world began: which day could not come, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there was a falling away from that faith and power that the church then ſtood in; in which time anti-chriſt was to have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022664_0010_0FB9EC0117A2A0F0"/>his reign, whom CHRIST ſhould deſtroy with the ſpirit of his mouth and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his appearance: which falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way began ſoon after the apoſtles, and gradually increaſed in the church, until about four hundred and fiftyſeven years from CHRIST'S birth (or thereabouts) at which time the power of the HOLY PEOPLE, or church of CHRIST, was ſcattered or loſt by reaſon of tranſgreſſion: and anti-chriſt, or falſe religion, got to be eſtabliſhed. Since that time the witneſſes of CHRIST have propheſied in ſackloth or under darkneſs; and altho' many have been faithful to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy againſt ſin; even to the laying down of their lives for the teſtimony which they held; ſo that GOD accepted them in their obedience: while they were faithful and juſt to live or walk up to the meaſure of light and truth of GOD, revealed or made known unto them, but as it is written, that all they that will live godly in CHRIST
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022664_0011_0FB9EC01F6600F28"/>JESUS, ſhall ſuffer perſecution: and ſo it has been, and thoſe faithful witneſſes loſt their lives, by thoſe falſly called the church of CHRIST: which is anti-chriſt; for the true church of CHRIST never perſecuted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but were inoffenſive, harmleſs, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from ſin: for the true church of CHRIST taking up their croſs againſt the world, fleſh, and devil, and all ſin, living in obedience to GOD they earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the ſame. Therefore it may be plainly ſeen and known, where the true church of CHRIST is: but as it is written anti-chriſt or falſe churches ſhould prevail againſt the ſaints and overcome them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore CHRIST'S ſecond appearance, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day ſhall not come except there come a falling away firſt; and that man of ſin be revealed, the ſon of perdition, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 7. And it was given unto him to overcome them, and power was given him
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:022664_0012_0FB9EC03BA076090"/>over all kindreds, tongues, and nations; and this is the ſtate CHRIST propheſied the world of mankind ſhould be in, at his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance, <hi>Luke</hi> xvii. 26. And as it was in the day of <hi>Noe,</hi> ſo ſhall it be in the days of the ſon of man, verſe 30. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſo ſhall it be in the day when the ſon of man is revealed: plainly refering to his ſecond appearance to conſume or deſtroy anti-chriſt, and make a final end of ſin; and eſtabliſh his kingdom upon earth: but as the revelation of CHRIST muſt be in his people, whom he had choſen to be his body, to give teſtimony of him and to preach his goſpel to a loſt world.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. THE fourth diſpenſation or day is the ſecond appearance of CHRIST, or final, or laſt diſplay of GOD'S grace to a loſt world, in which the myſtery of GOD will be finiſhed and a deciſive work, to the final ſalvation, or damnation of all the children
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022664_0013_0FB9EC0767E86A58"/>of men. (Which according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies rightly calculated, and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, began in the year of our Saviour JESUS CHRIST, 1747.) See <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelations.</hi> In the manner following, 1ſt.

               </gap>forter that has led us into all truth: which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to abide with the true church of CHRIST unto the end of the world, and by which we find baptiſm into CHRIST'S death; death to all ſin, become alive to GOD, by the power of CHRIST'S reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which worketh in us mightily; by which a diſpenſation of the goſpel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto us; and woe be unto us if we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022664_0014_0FB9EC0BB9766748"/>preach not the goſpel of CHRIST. (For in finding ſo great a ſalvation and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the law of ſin and death in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obeying this goſpel which is the goſpel of CHRIST, in confeſſing and forſaking all ſin, and denying ourſelves and bearing the croſs of CHRIST, againſt the world, fleſh, and devil.) We have found repentance of all our ſins; and are made partakers of the grace of GOD where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we now ſtand: which all others in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and obeying, have acceptance with GOD, and find ſalvation from their ſins as well as we; GOD being no reſpecter of perſons but willing that all ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved. Thus we have given a ſhort information of what we believe of the diſpenſations of GOD'S grace to mankind, both paſt and preſent: and in what manner the people of GOD have found juſtification, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD, which was and is ſtill
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022664_0015_0FB9EC0D370E5088"/>in believing and obeying the light and truth of GOD, revealed or made known, in the day or diſpenſation in which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: for as the wrath of GOD is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs or live in any known ſin againſt him; ſo his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and grace is towards all them that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear him, and turn from all their ſins, by confeſſing, and forſaking, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is the way and manner in which all muſt find the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and acceptance with GOD through our LORD JESUS CHRIST, or finally fail of the grace of GOD; and that ſalvation which is brought to light by the goſpel. But to conclude, in ſhort, as we believe, and do teſtify, that the preſent goſpel of GOD'S grace unto us is the day which in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſpoken or propheſied of, as the ſecond appearing of CHRIST to conſume
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022664_0016_0FB9EC0EA9B54AB8"/>or deſtroy anti-chriſt, or falſe religion, and to make an end of the reigning power of ſin (for he that commiteth ſin is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of ſin and ſatan) over the children of men: and to eſtabliſh his kingdom, and that righteouſneſs that will ſtand forever: and that the preſent diſplay of the work and power of God, will increaſe until it is manifeſt to all; which it muſt be in due time: for every eye ſhall ſee him; and he will reward every man according to his deeds; and none can ſtand in ſin or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs; but in that righteouſneſs which is pure and holy: even without fault before the throne of GOD which is obtained by grace, through faith in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the truth of the everlaſting goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, in denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts; by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing all ſin, and taking up the croſs of CHRIST, againſt the world, fleſh, and dev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il: we deſire therefore, that the children
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022664_0017_0FB9EC102BDC0318"/>of men would believe the teſtimony of truth; and turn from their ſins by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that they might obtain the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, and ſalvation from ſin before it be too late.</p>

            <head>A LETTER FROM JAMES WHITTAKER, <hi>Miniſter of the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I HAVE wrote to you a letter, in anſwer to a letter you wrote to me laſt winter; wherein I have ſignified my mind partly to you: it remains now that I declare unto you my whole heart; which I cannot tell at preſent but it will be a final cloſe between you and me, thro' time and eternity. Flattering titles I am not about to uſe towards you or to ſooth you with lies, but with the truth will I come forth, whether you hear, or whether
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022664_0018_0FB9EC1DB492E878"/>you forbear: be not ſo unwiſe as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> who ſaid to CHRIST, thou beareſt record of thyſelf, thy record is not true: while I teſtify unto you what GOD has done for my ſoul: bleſſed be GOD forevermore who has ſeparated me from my mother's womb; and made me a miniſter of the goſpel in the day of CHRIST'S ſecond appearance. All earthly profits and pleaſures; all earthly genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and propagation which are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of all men in their natural birth (profeſſor and prophane) all theſe, I ſay, have I forſaken for CHRIST'S ſake; and I have already received an hundred fold in this preſent time, according as the holy SON of GOD promiſed in the day of his firſt appearance; and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly: A death to the man of ſin have I found; a total ſpoiling of the ſtrong man's goods and redemption from the bondage of corruption; which is that ſordid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022664_0019_0FB9EC1F3422D128"/>to, or ardent deſire of copulation with women: which has not been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that ſenſe for many ages, but now is made manifeſt to all them that believe and obey the goſpel which GOD has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my truſt. I daily feel a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of love, life, joy, and heavenly glory flowing in my ſoul like a river of living waters; pure and clean my ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repleniſhed with rich ſupplies from the heavenly glory; and my heart inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly flows with charity and benevolence to all mankind: with a broken heart GOD has bleſſed me; and the image of the LORD of glory is formed in my ſoul: plenty of the dew of heaven is diſtilled in my ſoul from day to day, and the divine nature doth inſold me like a delightful ſea of pleaſant waters, full of glory. What think ye? If I were to ſeek friends in this world, ſhould I not cleave to my own blood? Should I not make you the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022664_0020_0FB9EC20AB5932D0"/>of my firſt purſuit? but I am weaned from all terreſtrial connexions; and in lieu thereof I have joined the hoſt of heaven: with open viſion do I behold the angelic company of the ſpiritual world; and join the melodius ſongs of the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Why tell ye me of your increaſing and multiplying after the fleſh? Your veſſels are marred in the potter's hand, and they muſt be made over again by regeneration; or go down to the pit. Say ye it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to increaſe and multiply? but I ſay it never was a command to corrupt the earth, and fill it with a double condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and then plead the command of GOD to increaſe and multiply, as though you had been doing his will. GOD has given me the power to increaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in its true, typical, and evangelical ſenſe, which I go forth to do: I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten many thouſands of children, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed them with many good things
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022664_0021_0FB9EC28A71AB248"/>I hate your fleſhly lives, and your fleſhly generation, and increaſing, as I hate the ſmoke of the bottomleſs pit: and your pleading the command of GOD to increaſe and multiply, to cover your doleful cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; and inverting the order of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Think ye that I will look towards you, while you live after the fleſh, defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelve with effeminate deſires, and prophaning the command of GOD for a cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? It is in my power indeed to help you greatly in a temporal ſenſe, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who live as corrupt lives as you do this day; as much without GOD in the world; but be it known unto you and all men that I will not do it; except you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your wicked lives and ſerve the living and true GOD: which I have no expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you will do if I ſhould nouriſh and cheriſh you as a tender father does his children. Stay in <hi>England</hi> 'till you go down into your grave, as long as you are
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:022664_0022_0FB9EC2A0CB8B6C0"/>for following natural generation and the courſe of this world: I know that your greateſt oppreſſion is your living after the fleſh, which is your own chooſing; and is the very reaſon why I will not help you, tho' I have it in my power. Away! with your looking towards me for help, ſince you are ſunk in my ſoul for your diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to GOD and your lying hopes that you are in favor with him; while you corrupt the law and trample the goſpel under foot; were it ſo indeed that you had it in your hearts to turn to GOD, and obey the goſpel; I would look towards you with charity and compaſſion, and would take care of you, ſoul and body: but that is far from you, and it is in your hearts to enlarge your liberty after the fleſh; and to provide livings for yourſelves and poſtery: therefore you are but a ſtink in my noſtrils: inſtead of your having the pardon of your ſins, you are deceived,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:022664_0023_0FB9EC2B46F236A8"/>and I feel that you are powerleſs, alienated from the life of GOD and become carnal, ſenſual, unwiſe, therefore as you have choſen your own ways: ſee what the god you ſerve will do for you, and your falſe hopes what they will bring you to. All we that are of that one community that worſhip GOD in ſpirit and rejoice in CHRIST JESUS, being ſeparated from all effeminate deſires, and ſenſual pleaſures, are in poſſeſſion of the only hope of eternal life: my GOD has delivered me, redeemed my ſoul, filled it with heavenly glory, and the power of an endleſs life; as well as made me able to help many in a temporal ſenſe: and you might have been ſharers with me in all this unmeritted munificence, had you obeyed the goſpel with me. As therefore you have forſaken GOD, ſo I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo forſake you; and will never give you any encouragement to come into this land, 'till once for all you reſolve to turn to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:022664_0024_0FB9EC3208F42128"/>GOD, and obey the goſpel. I feel the compaſſion of GOD to warn you. What you are loſing in this great day of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance of the SON OF MAN; you are loſing no leſs than the only means of ſalvation that ever will be offered again in this world. The power of the goſpel does proſper in my ſoul, in bowels of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity &amp; compaſſion for the poor loſt children of men: and I would that you would be warned by a faithful friend, not to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the day of GOD'S final viſitation, for the ſake of your falſe hopes, which will leave yuor ſouls deſolate and barren: or for the fading things of this life, which are but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation of ſpirit. O! that you would hearken! for then there is the ſame door for your eſcape, as for the reſt of the children of men; at which door, if you enter, I feel to receive you with charity: and the ſeverity of this letter, is the charity of GOD for your ſouls; and his abhorence of your falſe hopes.</p>
