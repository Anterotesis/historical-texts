            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Prophet,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and from <hi>Love</hi> to it, humbly mourns, bewails, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, confeſſes, ſupplicates, deprecates, and expoſtulates; in Words the moſt moving and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting you ever read: See from the 19 <hi>Verſe, "Haſt thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy Soul loathed Zion? why haſt thou ſmitten us and there is no healing for us? we looked for Peace and there is no Good, and for the Time of healing and behold Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! We acknowledge, O Lord, our Wickedneſs, and the Iniquity of our Fathers; for we have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee. Do not abhor us for thy Name ſake; do not diſgrace the Throne of thy Glory; remember, break not thy Covenant with us: Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles that can cauſe Rain? or can the Heavens give Showers? "Art not Thou He, O Lord our god? therefore will we wait upon Thee, for Thou haſt made all theſe Things."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe <hi>laſt</hi> Words the <hi>Prophet</hi> firſt <hi>deſpiſes,</hi> diſdains, pours Contempt on, and rejects with Abhorrence the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>Nations:</hi> "Are there any among the <hi>Vanities of the Gentiles</hi> that can give <hi>Rain?</hi> He gives to <hi>Idols</hi> their true Name <hi>Vanities;</hi> for we know that <hi>an Idol is nothing in the World.</hi> He affirms it univerſally, of <hi>all</hi> and every <hi>one</hi> of them, that they are but ſo many <hi>Vanities.</hi> He demands of them, if they can, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give <hi>Rain:</hi> One of the <hi>greateſt</hi> things, it is true, in Nature; yet one of the moſt <hi>common</hi> things too, and moſt neceſſary for Man. If they can't do <hi>this,</hi> what is there they can do for us? and if they could do this, what elſe might they not do?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004130_0005_1003D23B9D31C528"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He aſſigns to <hi>ſecond Cauſes</hi> their Place and <hi>Limits; "Can the Heavens give Showers?</hi> either the <hi>upper</hi> or <hi>lower</hi> Heavens! As for the <hi>upper</hi> Heavens and all their <hi>Hoſts,</hi> they are thus far concerned in our <hi>Rains,</hi> that the <hi>Sun</hi> exhales the Vapours by its fiery Rays, and the <hi>Moon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences our Waters both in the Air and Sea, and the Fluids in our Bodies, in a ſenſible but ſecret manner. And as for the <hi>lower</hi> Heavens, the Region of our <hi>Clouds,</hi> they gather not by any Knowledge or Deſign of their own, neither when they give their Showers do they mean a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Benefit</hi> to us: For as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid very piouſly and juſtly, "<hi>if I beheld the Sun when it ſhone!</hi> ſo muſt we ſay, if I behold the <hi>Rain</hi> when it falls, with any religious Reſpect to the <hi>Creature</hi> itſelf, it were to deny the GOD that is above.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> GOD the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> is devoutly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the <hi>Government</hi> of all ſecond Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in the <hi>Benefits</hi> done us by them; and all the <hi>Glory</hi> is render'd to <hi>Him</hi> alone, to Whom it is due: "<hi>Art not Thou He, O Lord our God? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will wait on Thee; for Thou haſt made all theſe Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1.

Thou the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the God of Iſrael, thou only canſt <hi>cauſe Rain,</hi> and command the <hi>Heavens</hi> to give us Showers! Thou doſt it when and where thou pleaſeſt, and thy Will and Providence governs herein! Who art <hi>greater</hi> than the Heavens and above them, haſt made and ruleſt them.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004130_0006_1003D2440E53B598"/>
2. A devout <hi>Reſolution</hi> is formed upon this <hi>Principle,</hi> a Reſolution of <hi>Dependance</hi> on God and of <hi>Application</hi> to Him at all Times: "<hi>Therefore will we wait upon Thee,</hi> for <hi>thou haſt made all theſe things:</hi> a good <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the Reſolution; <hi>while the gods that made not the Earth and Heavens, let them periſh from the Earth and from under theſe Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"<hi>We will wait upon thee:</hi> ſhould not <hi>a People</hi> wait on <hi>their God?</hi> They declare their Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be only from Him, their Dependance to be ſolely on Him, and their Confidence to be ſtrong in Him. They apply, and ſeek and pray, and <hi>reſolve</hi> to continue herein, to Day, always and for evermore.</p>
            <p>"<hi>For thou haſt made all theſe things:</hi> the Earth, Waters, Air, Clouds, Seaſons; and governeſt all for the Life and Good of Man. <q>Thou haſt given <hi>Being</hi> to all things, and thou giveſt <hi>Laws</hi> to them, and they ſerve the wiſe and gracious Intentions of thy <hi>Providence!</hi>
               </q> Thou <hi>with-holdeſt</hi> the Rain, or thou ſendeſt it in <hi>Judgment</hi> or for <hi>Mercy!</hi> "Therefore <hi>we will</hi> wait upon Thee; rely on thee, ſeek to thee, tarry thy Time, be found in thy Way, and reſign our Selves to thy Will.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrinal Obſervation</hi> from the Words might be this; "That the <hi>Supremacy,</hi> the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Providence</hi> and Agency of the <hi>Lord our God,</hi> does ſtrongly <hi>oblige</hi> us, and ſhould engage and <hi>bind</hi> us, to be <hi>waiting</hi> upon Him at all <hi>Times</hi> and in every <hi>Caſe;</hi> more eſpecially in our Times of <hi>Trouble,</hi> Straits and Difficulties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004130_0007_1003D24880BB35C8"/>
Or in the Words of <hi>Another,</hi> "The <hi>Sovereignty</hi> of God ſhould engage, and his <hi>Aſufficiency</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our <hi>Attendance</hi> on Him, and our <hi>Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from Him at all <hi>Times."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only enquire into the <hi>Nature</hi> of this great <hi>Duty</hi> of Religion, our <hi>waiting</hi> on God; and then briefly ſuggeſt a few <hi>Reaſons</hi> for it and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>waiting</hi> on God implies and includes in it the following Things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our fix'd <hi>Belief,</hi> our conſtant <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and actual <hi>Conſideration</hi> of God, his <hi>Perfection</hi> and governing <hi>Providence,</hi> and the <hi>Extent</hi> of it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing in the World: that the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi> is <hi>one</hi> Lord, the <hi>living God</hi> and <hi>everlaſting King,</hi> in Heaven above and on Earth below; and that <hi>we</hi> and all things are under his moſt wiſe, good, powerful and perfect <hi>Rule</hi> and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; without <hi>which</hi> not a Cloud gathers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, nor a Ray of the Sun ſhines on us, nor a Spire of Graſs grows under our Feet. We muſt bear about with us always, wherever we are and whatſover we do, want and ſeek after, an abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Senſe of our <hi>Dependance</hi> on God; who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all things by the Word of his Power, and the Eyes of all wait on Him; who holds <hi>our</hi> Soul in Life, feeds us every Day, and is <hi>our Life and the Length of our Days.</hi> Deut. xxx. 20.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Belief in God</hi> is eſſentially requiſite to, and neceſſarily ſuppoſed in, our waiting on Him: For he that cometh to God muſt believe that He is, and have right and juſt Apprehre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his bleſſed Nature and ſupream univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004130_0008_1003D24DAEBD5500"/>Government; what He is <hi>in Himſelf</hi> and <hi>to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſequently, we cannot <hi>wait</hi> upon God, but with a Frame of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and high <hi>Adoration.</hi> The <hi>idea</hi> of a great and good God commands <hi>this</hi> from us, all his <hi>Works</hi> challenge it, and every <hi>Benefit</hi> we look for from Him. They are all <hi>vaſt</hi> in themſelves, and ſpeak his <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> and declare an Infinite Dominion, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs and Juſtice For Inſtance, Do we wait on God for the Light and <hi>Heat,</hi> or for the <hi>Shade</hi> and Moiſture; it muſt be in ſuch a Frame and Poſture of Soul as that, Pſalm cxxxv. 6, 7. <hi>For I know that the Lord is great, and that our God is above all Gods! Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places: He cauſeth the Vapours to aſcend from the Ends of the Earth, he maketh Lightnings for the Rain, he bringeth the Wind out of his Treaſuries:</hi> And in the xxxiii Pſalm; <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them by the Breath of his Mouth; He gathereth the Waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the Depths in Store-houſes; Let all the Earth fear the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of the World ſtand in Awe of Him!— Behold, the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy; to deliver their Soul from Death, and to keep them alive in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; Our Soul waiteth on the Lord, He is our Help and our Shield; for our Heart ſhall rejoice in Him, becauſe we have truſted in his Holy Name: Let thy Mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in Thee.</hi>

4. We muſt <hi>wait</hi> upon God with <hi>upright Hearts,</hi> true and ſtrong <hi>Deſire</hi> of Soul to his Name, with <hi>Affection and Earneſtneſs.</hi> The acceptable and <hi>effectual</hi> Prayer of the <hi>Righteous</hi> is the <hi>fervent</hi> one. St. <hi>James</hi> v. Cold and <hi>formal</hi> Praying is not meet to be called <hi>waiting</hi> on God. "<hi>Our Soul waiteth for the Lord;</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>more than they that watch for the Morning:</hi> and he <hi>repeats the Profeſſion</hi> to expreſs the Truth and Vehemence of his Deſire.

"<hi>I wait for the Lord, my Soul doth wait, and I hope in his Word; Lord hear my Voice, and let thine Ear be attentive to my Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Such are the Breathings of the earneſt waiting Soul; "<hi>Lord all my Deſire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee; with my Soul have I deſired thee in the Night, and with my Spirit within me will I ſeek thee early.</hi> All the Powers and Affections of our Souls muſt be excited and engaged in our waiting on God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Humble and ardent <hi>Hope, Expectation, Truſt</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> are implied in our <hi>waiting</hi> upon God. To <hi>wait</hi> on Him is to <hi>depend,</hi> rely, and expect from his Power and Goodneſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>promiſes</hi> of his Word. We are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>ask in Faith,</hi> and are told that <hi>believing</hi> we receive. <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>ſtrong</hi> in Faith, giving <hi>Glory</hi> to God; being <hi>fully</hi> perſwaded that what he had <hi>promiſed</hi> he was <hi>able</hi> to perſorm; and it was <hi>imputed</hi> unto him for Righteouſneſs; as it is to Us alſo, if we <hi>believe</hi> on Him that raiſed up <hi>Jeſus</hi> our Lord from the dead, Rom. iv. 20. God

            <p>In ſuch a Spirit of Faith and <hi>Truſt</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet prays in our <hi>Context, "O the Hope of Iſrael, the Saviour of it in the Time of Trouble! Remember, break not thy Covenant! Do not abhor us for thy Name's ſake, diſgrace not the Throne of thy Glory! Art not Thou He, O Lord our God! Therefore we wait on thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>waiting</hi> and praying thro' the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi>

To <hi>reſolve</hi> is a rational Act of the humane Soul, whereby it freely and firmly determines and <hi>binds</hi> it ſelf to <hi>do,</hi> that which it judges to be it's Duty, Wiſdom and Intereſt. But conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an Act of <hi>Religion,</hi> it ſuppoſes a Mind divinely <hi>illuminated</hi> from the Word of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Influence and Power of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> with a full Purpoſe of Heart determined for a holy Life. Joſh. xxiv. 27. <hi>Nay, but the Lord our God we will ſerve, and his Voice we will obey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a very <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>awful</hi> thing, and muſt be done with Underſtanding and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> with Deliberateneſs and <hi>Conſideration,</hi> fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently and <hi>zealouſly,</hi> for <hi>without Counſel Purpoſes are diſappointed.</hi> To uſe the Apoſtle's Words, it muſt be done devoutly and with Solemnity: 2 Cor. i. 17. <hi>When I therefore was thus minded, did I uſe Lightneſs? or the Things that I purpoſe, do I purpoſe according to the Fleſh? that with me there ſhould be Yea, Yea, or Nay, Nay! As God is true our Word was not Yea and Nay.</hi> Religion is founded on certain and <hi>unchangeable</hi> Principles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and there muſt be no ſaying and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, promiſing and changing in it. But then neither may we make any religious Reſolutions in <hi>our own</hi> Strength, but with an entire <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> on the Grace of God, which <hi>worketh in us both to will and to do.</hi> We muſt be very <hi>humble</hi> if we wou'd be ſtrong, and have a <hi>godly Jealouſy</hi> of our ſelves, that our Hope may be in God. Pſal. cxix. 8. <hi>I will keep thy Statutes, O forſake me not.</hi> We muſt alſo reſolve upon the <hi>Means,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>End;</hi> and <hi>up and be doing that the Lord may be with us.</hi>

And thus I have ſpoken of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Duty, what it is for us <hi>to wait upon God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I come briefly to mention a few <hi>Reaſons, Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> for our reſolving on and engaging in this Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God is <hi>great</hi> and it is <hi>meet</hi> we ſhould wait on Him. <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> expect much wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them. It is the <hi>leaſt</hi> Homage to the <hi>King Eternal,</hi> Immortal, the bleſſed and only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. Should we not daily attend his <hi>Levee?</hi> not in Ceremony and Compliment, or for any Need of our Services, but to expreſs a ſincere Loyalty and humble <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and to acknowledge an abſolute Subjection and Dependance. Zeph. iii. 8. <hi>Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the Day that I riſe up.</hi> Luke xii. 36. <hi>And be ye your ſelves like unto Men that wait for their Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Favour, <hi>Gifts and Bounties of a God</hi> are well <hi>worth</hi> our waiting for. Inſtance if you pleaſe in the <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Rain</hi> from Heaven, do they not <hi>deſerve</hi> more than all the Pains that we can be at in our Dependance on God, or Supplications to Him? Do they not <hi>pay</hi> us well for our repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted urging Prayers? Doth not the <hi>Husbandman</hi> wait for them <hi>with long Patience,</hi> after much Toil and Labour, that he may receive the Fruits of the Earth? <hi>James</hi> v. 7. And when he has reap'd a good <hi>Harveſt,</hi> thinks himſelf well recompens'd for his Summer's Work! But how great and good are the Bleſſings of <hi>Grace,</hi> which our God eſpecially requires us to be waiting on him for! Luke xii. 23: <hi>It is your Fathers good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004130_0022_1003D2B199B22FA0"/>
3. All things <hi>wait</hi> upon God, and he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them. In this <hi>Way</hi> it is that we give him <hi>Honour,</hi> and do him <hi>Glory.</hi> So we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Power, Goodneſs and Sovereignty, and teſtify our Dependance on Him, Subjection to Him, and Receipts from Him. Pſal. cxxiii. 2. <hi>Behold, as the Eyes of Servants look unto the Hand of their Maſters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden unto the Hand of her Miſtreſs; ſo our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have Mercy upon us.</hi> We wait as <hi>Beggars</hi> for an Alms, as <hi>Children</hi> for a Father's Regard and Bleſſing, and as <hi>Subjects</hi> on their Prince for his Favour and Reward, and at the ſame Time to know his Pleaſure and do his Will. Pſal. lix. 9. <hi>Becauſe of his Strength will I wait on thee, the God of my Mercy ſhall prevent me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is <hi>highly profitable and beneficial to us</hi> to be waiting upon God. "<hi>A Servant that waiteth on his Maſter ſhall be honoured.</hi> We do not ſerve God <hi>for nought.</hi> It is <hi>good</hi> for a Man to hope and <hi>quietly wait;</hi> Good in it ſelf, good in us, good for us; <hi>good before his Saints,</hi> good in their Account, good in their Experience as well as Conſcience, Pſal. xxv. 3. <hi>O my God I truſt in thee, let me not be aſhamed.</hi> Iſai. xxxiii. 2. <hi>O Lord be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us, for we have waited on thee.</hi> As <hi>Kings</hi> diſtribute Riches and Honours among them that wait in their Preſence, ſo doth the <hi>King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> the Bleſſings of his Providence and Grace here, and all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, among them that religiouſly wait on and ſerve Him.</p>
            <p>Let what has been ſaid <hi>reprove</hi> thoſe among us, who are <hi>irreligious</hi> and <hi>prayerleſs,</hi> and ſo far
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004130_0023_1003D2B8267638D0"/>from <hi>waiting</hi> on God in <hi>this Day of Trouble and Rebuke,</hi> on private and perſonal Accounts as well as publick; that they are indeed <hi>murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> againſt Him in their <hi>Hearts</hi> and with their <hi>Mouths,</hi> and <hi>mutinying</hi> againſt him with their <hi>Hands,</hi> in open Defiance of that <hi>Government</hi> which God has ſet over them. Theſe things bring great <hi>Guilt</hi> upon a People, and ſhould be matter of <hi>Mourning</hi> and great <hi>Humiliation</hi> to us; they are greatly to be <hi>repented</hi> of and openly <hi>teſtified</hi> againſt. Pſal. xii. 4. <hi>Who have ſaid, with our Tongues will we prevail, our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> We cry out of <hi>Wrongs,</hi> and of <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> we cry <hi>to Men</hi> and <hi>againſt</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and we cry againſt <hi>Thoſe</hi> (it may be) who <hi>never</hi> wrong'd us, but are publick <hi>Benefactors;</hi> but we cry not to <hi>God</hi> that binds us, to <hi>whom</hi> we ſhou'd cry out againſt our <hi>ſelves</hi> and our own <hi>Sins:</hi> we do not <hi>wait upon Him</hi> with our Secret and Publick mournful <hi>Prayers</hi> for our Families and our People.</p>
            <p>To <hi>this</hi> let us be humbly <hi>directed</hi> and <hi>exhorted</hi> in the <hi>Fear</hi> of God; to carry all our <hi>Difficulties</hi> to God, ſenſible of his puniſhing <hi>Hand</hi> in them, and <hi>humble</hi> our ſelves under it. Job xxi 4. <hi>Is my Complaint to Man? If it were ſo, why ſhould not my Spirit be troubled?</hi> x. 1, 2 <hi>I will leave my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint upon my ſelf, I will ſay unto God do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me.</hi> 
               <q>God will <hi>hear</hi> the Deſire of the <hi>Humble,</hi> he <hi>prepares</hi> their Heart and <hi>bows</hi> his Ear. <hi>Curſed</hi> is the Man, that truſteth in <hi>Man,</hi> and maketh <hi>Fleſh</hi> his Arm, and whoſe Heart departeth from the <hi>Lord;</hi> But <hi>bleſſed</hi> is the Man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe <hi>Hope</hi> the Lord is: the <hi>One</hi> ſhall not ſee when
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004130_0024_1003D2C1159E7838"/>
                  <hi>Good</hi> cometh, nor the other when <hi>Heat</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let us eſpecially be waiting on God for the <hi>ſpiritual Bleſſing,</hi> the Bleſſings of his <hi>Grace,</hi> for the Effuſion of his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> for broken and <hi>contrite Hearts,</hi> and for the <hi>Pardon</hi> of our Sins. <q>Seek <hi>firſt</hi> the Kingdom of God and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all <hi>other</hi> Things ſhall be added to us, by our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> who knows our Need of them.</q> Our anxious <hi>Fore-tho't,</hi> diſtracting <hi>Cares</hi> and immoderate <hi>Fears,</hi> are our Miſery and Crime. We need the Spirit of Humiliation and <hi>Repentance,</hi> of Prayer and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> more than the very <hi>Light,</hi> or <hi>Rains</hi> of Heaven. We need to care for our <hi>Souls,</hi> more than for our Bodies; that <hi>theſe</hi> may feed and flouriſh under the Word of Life: This <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is more than the <hi>Dew of Heaven, the Fatneſs of the Earth, or Plenty of Corn and Wine.</hi> O if the <hi>Lord</hi> would make <hi>his Face to ſhine upon his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries,</hi> in the Efficacy of his Word and the Converſion of Souls! This is the <hi>Conſolation</hi> we ſhould be waiting for in the <hi>Temple!</hi> theſe the richer <hi>Dews of Hermon</hi> deſcending on the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Zion,</hi> where the Lord commands the Bleſſing, even <hi>Life for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us wait on God in all his <hi>Ordinances</hi> that his <hi>Doctrine</hi> may drop as the <hi>Rain,</hi> and the <hi>Light</hi> of the Knowledge of his Glory <hi>ſhine into our Hearts</hi> by and with his <hi>Word.</hi> Let us lift up our Eyes and Hearts to <hi>Him</hi> that is above the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and pray — "<hi>Drop down ye Heavens from above, ond let the Skies pour down Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!</hi> It follows, <q>Let the Earth open and let
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004130_0025_1003D2C902375A30"/>them bring forth <hi>Salvation,</hi> and let Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſpring up together: I the <hi>Lord</hi> have created it! Wo unto him that ſtriveth with his <hi>Maker;</hi> let the <hi>Potſherd</hi> ſtrive with the Potſherds of the Earth; ſhall the <hi>Clay</hi> ſay to Him that faſhions it, <hi>what makeſt thou?</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Men</hi> are but broken <hi>Potſherds</hi> (ſays <hi>One</hi> on the Place) and are often made ſo by their <hi>mutual Contentions,</hi> daſhed <hi>in pieces</hi> one againſt another.</p>
            <p>What faith the <hi>Apoſtle?</hi> Galat. v. 5. <hi>We thro' the Spirit wait for the Hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith.</hi> There is nothing worthy of a <hi>Chriſtians</hi> waiting for like <hi>this;</hi> nothing in Compariſon of it. It is highly <hi>pleaſing</hi> to God to ſee us waiting on him for this, and his <hi>Promiſe</hi> is full on this point, Luke xi. 13. <hi>Shall not your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</hi> This Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Bleſſings is the <hi>Hope</hi> of Believers, and it is <hi>the Hope of Righteouſneſs;</hi> the <hi>Promiſe of the Father</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> left with his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in his <hi>Farewell Diſcourſe</hi> with them: <q>who when He ſhould come would <hi>convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and of Judgment:</hi>
               </q> A <hi>Hope</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> ſanctifying to us and keeping us in the Ways of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> allows us not to <hi>hope</hi> on any other <hi>Ground,</hi> nor in any other <hi>Way,</hi> but warrants us in <hi>this.</hi> And it is <hi>thro' the Spirit,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>his</hi> Direction and Influence, that we are <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> unto the lively <hi>Hope,</hi> and are kept <hi>waiting</hi> for it. And they that <hi>thus</hi> wait upon God, that wait on Him <hi>for this,</hi> ſhall never be <hi>aſhamed of their Hope.</hi>
