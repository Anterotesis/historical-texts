            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt, Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, more than ſo; Secondly; In the <hi>Forgiveneſs of our Sins,</hi> the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven does Inveſt us with a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is according to <hi>Law,</hi> the very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of Happineſs; Even a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> has annexed <hi>Life Eternal</hi> as a <hi>Reward</hi> unto: a <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which in all things does come up to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Law.</hi> 'Tis therefore ſaid, in 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>We are made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, How comes this to paſs? Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; In the <hi>Forgiveneſs of our Sins,</hi> the God of Heaven, graciouſly <hi>Imputes</hi> unto us, the <hi>Obedience</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. There was an <hi>Habitual Rectitude of Nature,</hi> which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was Born withal; There was a <hi>Courſe of an Holy Life,</hi> which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt Led for many years together; There was, Laſtly, the Exquiſite <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Horror,</hi> of the <hi>Curſe</hi> due for Sin, Suffered by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

looks on it, as belonging unto <hi>Us,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our being Judicially dealt withal, according to the <hi>Merit</hi> of it.

It may be, there ha's been ſome Remarkable <hi>Anſwer of Prayer,</hi> in our Deliverance: It may not be Forgotten. Truly, I cannot without ſome Delight read one paſſage, in the <hi>Great Auſtin,</hi> upon the occaſion of a Malady, ſo common, that People Scarce count <hi>Prayer</hi> to have any concernment about it. His words, (in his, <hi>Confeſſions</hi>) are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Lord, Thou didſt Afflict me, with <hi>Pain of the Teeth</hi>; and when it was ſo great, that I could not ſpeak, it came into my mind, to admoniſh my Friends preſent to Pray for me, unto the <hi>God of all Health.</hi> Writing this on <hi>Wax,</hi> I gave it 'em to Read; and as ſoon as we kneeled down, the pain went away.

               </p>
               <p>All that I have now to ſay, is;</p>
               <p>Ha's God given us, an Heart, for to Acknowledge the <hi>Merit</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Purchaſing</hi> our Deliverance from

                  <hi>Sickneſs</hi>? It is ſaid, in 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>By His Stripes ye were Healed.</hi> All we have been like <hi>Run away Servants,</hi> [and the Apoſtle is there diſcourſing to <hi>Servants</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] and we deſerve <hi>Stripes</hi> for our thus Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away from the <hi>Service</hi> of God. In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> there are ſome of our Deſerved <hi>Stripes</hi> laid upon us; but when we come out of <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> do we, with a Thankful Soul make this Acknowledgment; <hi>My Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ha's felt the Stripes that were due to me, and thus tis, that I am Healed!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ha's God given us an Heart, for to Acknowledge the <hi>Power</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Beſtowing</hi> our Deliverance from <hi>Sickneſs</hi>? It was ſaid in Mal. 4.2. <hi>To you that Fear my Name, ſhall the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe, with Healing in His Wings.</hi> In the Eaſtern parts of the World, it ha's been a Cuſtome among the poor Pagans there, That when they have Ineffectually Tryed all ordinary wayes, for the Succour of their <hi>Sick Folks,</hi> they would Expoſe them abroad unto the <hi>Sun,</hi> Expecting that the Beams of the <hi>Sun,</hi> would perform for them, what could be no other wayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000829_0045_0FAB4123AA9E6A68"/>
Yea, but inſtead of this, do's our Soul, now make this Thankful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>Nothing would Save me out of my Sickneſs, until that Sun of Righteouſneſs, my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, aroſe upon me, with Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in His Wings!</hi> Truly, Theſe Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in us will argue, that when we no longer ſay, <hi>I am Sick,</hi> we are alſo <hi>Forgiven our Iniquity.</hi>
