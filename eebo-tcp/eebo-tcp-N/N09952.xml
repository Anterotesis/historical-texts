            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>INASMUCH as there appears to us a real need of ſuch an appeal, we would previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly offer a few thoughts concerning the general nature of liberty and government, and then ſhew wherein it appears to us, that our religious rights are encroached upon in this land.</p>
               <p>It is ſuppoſed by multitudes, that in ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to government we give up ſome part of our liberty, becauſe they imagine that there is ſomething in their nature incompatible with each other. But the word of truth plainly ſhews, that man firſt loſt his freedom by breaking over the rules of government; and that thoſe who
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012654_0003_0F8BBF656F02CE28"/>
now ſpeak great <hi>ſwelling words</hi> about <hi>liberty,</hi> while they <hi>deſpiſe government,</hi> are themſelves <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of corruption.</hi> What a dangerous error, yea, what a root of all evil then muſt it be, for men to imagine that there is any thing in the nature of true government that interferes with true and full liberty! A grand cauſe of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is, ignorance of what we are, and where we are; for did we view things in their true light, it would appear to be as abſurd and dangerous, for us to aſpire after any thing beyond our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, or out of the rule of our duty, as it would for the frog to ſwell till he burſts himſelf in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get as big as the ox, or for a beaſt or fowl to dive into the fiſhes element till they drown themſelves. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment is great gain:</hi> But they that <hi>will</hi> take a contrary courſe <hi>fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh and hurtful luſts, which</hi> DROWN <hi>men in deſtruction and perdition.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 6, 9.</p>
               <p>The true liberty of man is, to know, obey and enjoy his Creator, and to do all the good unto, and enjoy all the happineſs with and in his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures that he is capable of; in order to which the law of love was written in his heart, which carries in it's nature union and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Being in general, and to each being in particular, according to it's nature and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to it's relation and connexion to and with the ſupreme Being, and ourſelves. Each rational ſoul, as he is a part of the whole ſyſtem of rational beings, ſo it was and is, both his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his liberty to regard the good of the whole in all his actions. To love ourſelves, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012654_0004_0F8BBF691A289438"/>
truly to ſeek our own welfare, is both our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and our indiſpenſible duty; but the conceit that man could advance either his honor or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by diſobedience inſtead of obedience, was firſt injected by the <hi>father of lies,</hi> and all ſuch conceits ever ſince are as falſe as he is.</p>
               <p>Before man imagined that ſubmiſſion to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and acting ſtrictly by rule was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and that breaking over thoſe bounds would enlarge his knowledge and happineſs, how clear were his ideas! (even ſo as to give proper names to every creature) and how great was his honor and pleaſure! But no ſooner did he tranſgreſs, than inſtead of enjoying the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of innocency, and the liberties of paradiſe, he ſneaks away to hide himſelf; and inſtead of clear and juſt ideas, he adopted that maſter of all abſurdities (which his children follow to this day) of thinking to hide from OMNICIENCY, and of trying to deceive HIM who knows every thing! Inſtead of good and happineſs, he felt evil, guilt and miſery; and in the room of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord was wrangling, both againſt his Creator and his fellow-creature, even ſo that ſhe who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loved as his <hi>own fleſh,</hi> he now <hi>accuſes</hi> to the great Judge. By which it appears, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man's gaining any dignity or liberty by refuſing an intire ſubmiſſion to government, was ſo deluſive, that inſtead of it's advancing him to be <hi>as Gods,</hi> it ſunk him down into a way of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the beaſts and like the devil! the beaſts are actuated by their ſenſes and inclinations, and the devil purſues his deſigns by deceit and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. With malicious reflections upon God,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012654_0005_0F8BBF6944C279B0"/>
and flattering pretences to man, he drew him down to gratify his eyes and his taſte with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit: and he had no ſooner revolted from the authority of heaven, than the beauty and order of his family was broken; he turns accuſer againſt the wife of his boſom, his firſt ſon murders the next, and then lies to his Maker to conceal it; and that lying murderer's poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were the firſt who broke over the order of marriage which God had inſtituted; and things proceeded from bad to worſe, till all fleſh had corrupted his way, and the earth was filled with violence, ſo that they could no longer be borne with, but by a juſt vengeance were all ſwept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, only one family.</p>
               <p>Yet all this did not remove the dreadful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper from man's nature, for the great Ruler of the univerſe directly after the flood, gave this as one reaſon why he would not bring ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while the earth remains, namely, <hi>For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;</hi>

Obſerve well where the diſtemper lies; evil imaginations have uſurped the place of reaſon and a well informed judgment, and hold them in ſuch bondage, that inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by thoſe noble faculties, they are put to the horrid drugery of <hi>ſeeking out inventions,</hi> for the gratification of <hi>fleſhly luſts, which war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſoul;</hi> and to guard againſt having theſe worſt of all enemies detected and ſubdued. Enemies which are ſo far from being God's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

that ſtrictly ſpeaking, they have no being at all in themſelves, only are the privation of his creatures well-being; therefore ſin with it's off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring death, will, as to thoſe who are ſaved, be <hi>ſwallowed up in victory.</hi> Sin is an enemy both to God and man, which was begotten by ſatan, and was conceived and brought forth by man; for luſt when it is conceived bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eccl. 7. 29. 1 Pet. 2. 11. Jam. 1. 14, 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now how often have we been told, that he is not a freeman but a ſlave, whoſe perſon and goods are not at his own but anothers diſpoſal? And to have foreigners come and riot at our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and in the fruit of our labours, has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been repreſented to be worſe than death. And ſhould the higher powers appear to deal with temporal oppreſſors according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, it would ſeem ſtrange indeed, if thoſe who have ſuffered intolerably by them, ſhould employ all their art and power to conceal them, and ſo to prevent their being brought to juſtice! But how is our world filled with ſuch madneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſpiritual tyrants! How far have pride and infidelity, covetouſneſs and luxury, yea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and cruelty, thoſe foriegners which came from hell, carried their influence, and ſpread their baneful miſchiefs in our world! Yet who is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to own that he has been deceived and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved by them? Who is willing honeſtly to bring them forth to juſtice! All acknowledge that theſe enemies are among us, and many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain aloud of the miſchiefs that they do; yet even thoſe who lift their heads ſo high as to laugh
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012654_0007_0F8BBF6A6CFB4DF8"/>
at the atonement of Jeſus, and the powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit, and ſlight public &amp; private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, are at the ſame time very unwilling to own that they harbour pride, infidelity, or any other of thoſe dreadful tyrants. And nothing but the divine law refered to above, brought home with convincing light and power, can make them tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the ſoul-ſlavery that they are in: and 'tis only the power of the goſpel that can ſet them <hi>free from ſin,</hi> ſo as to become the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>righteouſneſs:</hi> can <hi>deliver</hi> them from theſe <hi>enemies,</hi> ſo as to <hi>ſerve God in holineſs</hi> all their days. And thoſe who do not thus <hi>know the truth,</hi> and have not been <hi>made free</hi> thereby,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. 6. 18. Luke 1. 74, 75. John 8. 32.</note> yet have never been able in any country to ſubſiſt long without ſome ſort of government; neither could any of them ever make out to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh any proper government without calling in the help of the Deity. However abſurd their notions have been, yet they have found human ſight and power to be ſo ſhort and weak, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do ſo little toward watching over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and guarding the rights of individuals, that they have been forced to appeal to heaven by oaths, and to invoke aſſiſtance from thence to avenge the cauſe of the injured upon the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Hence it is ſo far from being neceſſary for any man to give up any part of his real liberty in order to ſubmit to government, that all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have found it neceſſary to ſubmit to ſome government in order to enjoy any liberty and ſecurity at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012654_0008_0F8BBF6B16568568"/>
We are not inſenſible that the general notion of liberty, is for each one to act or conduct as he pleaſes; but that government obliges us to act toward others by law and rule, which in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of many, interferes with ſuch liberty; though when we come to the light of truth, what can poſſibly prevent it's being the higheſt pleaſure, for every rational perſon, to love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himſelf, but corruption and deluſion? which, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted, are foreigners and not originally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to men. Therefore the divine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that thoſe who promiſe liberty while they deſpiſe government are ſervants of corruption is this; <hi>For of whom a</hi> MAN <hi>is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 18, 19. He is ſo far from being <hi>free</hi> to act the <hi>man,</hi> that he is a <hi>bond ſlave</hi> to the worſt of tyrants. And not a little of this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is carried on by ſuch an abuſe of language, as to call it liberty, for men to yield themſelves up, to be ſo <hi>fooliſh, diſobedient</hi> and <hi>deceived,</hi> as to <hi>ſerve divers luſts and pleaſures.</hi> Tit. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>Having offered theſe few thoughts upon the general nature of government and liberty, it is needful to obſerve, that God has appointed two kinds of government in the world, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in their nature, and ought never to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together; one of which is called civil, the other eccleſiaſtical government. And tho' we ſhall not attempt a full explanation of them, yet ſome eſſential points of difference between them are neceſſary to be mentioned, in order truly to open our grievances.</p>

               <p>Some eſſential points of difference between ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and eccleſiaſtical government.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The forming of the conſtitution, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the particular orders and offices of civil government is left to human diſcretion, and our ſubmiſſion thereto is required under the name of their being, the <hi>ordinances of men</hi> for the Lord's ſake. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Whereas in eccleſiaſtical affairs we are moſt ſolemnly warned not to be <hi>ſubject to ordinances, after the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and commandments of men.</hi> Col. 2. 20, 22. And it is evident that He who is the only worthy object of worſhip, has always claimed it as his ſole prerogative, to determine by expreſs laws, what his worſhip ſhall be, who ſhall miniſter in it, and how they ſhall be ſupported. How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs were his appointments concerning theſe things by Moſes? And ſo wiſe and good a ruler as Solomon, was not intruſted with any legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power upon either of theſe articles, but had the exact dimenſions of the temple, the <hi>pattern</hi> and <hi>weight</hi> of every veſſel, with the <hi>treaſuries</hi> of the <hi>dedicate things,</hi> and the <hi>courſes</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts and Levites,</hi> all given to him in <hi>writing by the Spirit,</hi> through the hand of his father David. 1 Chron. 28. 11—19.

And when the Son of God, who is the great Law-giver and King of his church, came and blotted out the hand-writing of the typical ordinances, and eſtabliſhed a better covenant, or conſtitution of his church, upon better promiſes, we are aſſured that he was <hi>faithful in all his houſe, and counted worthy of more glory than Moſes.</hi> What vacancy has he then left for fali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men to ſupply, by making new laws to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate and ſupport his worſhip? eſpecially if we conſider,</p>

of which the Holy Ghoſt gave early and plain warnings. He gave notice to the church, that the main of thoſe antichriſtian confuſions and abominations, would be drawn by philoſophy and deceit, from the <hi>hand-writing of ordinances</hi> that Chriſt has <hi>blotted out.</hi> And to avoid the ſame, directs the ſaints to walk in Chriſt Jeſus <hi>as they received him,</hi> rooted and built up <hi>in him,</hi> and ſtabliſhed in the faith <hi>as they have been taught;</hi> viewing that they are <hi>complete in him, which is the</hi> HEAD <hi>over</hi> ALL PRINCIPALITY <hi>and</hi> POWER. Therefore he charges them not to be beguiled into a <hi>voluntary humility,</hi> by ſuch <hi>fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minds</hi> as do not hold this <hi>Head,</hi> but would ſubject them to ordinances after the doctrines and commandments of men. Col. 2.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis well known that this glorious Head made no uſe of ſecular force in the firſt ſitting up of the goſpel church, when it might ſeem to be pecularly needful if ever; and it is alſo very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that ever ſince men came into the way of uſing force in ſuch affairs, their main arguments to ſupport it have been drawn from the old Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh conſtitution and ordinances.

               <p>Firſt they moved Conſtantine, a ſecular prince, to draw his ſword againſt heretics; but as all earthly ſtates are changeable, the ſame ſword that Conſtantine drew againſt heretics, Julion turned againſt the orthodox.

piloſophy that had gone ſo far, never left plotting till they had ſet up an eccleſiaſtical head over kingdoms as well as churches, who with Peter's keys was to open and ſhut, bind and looſe, both in ſpiritual and temporal affairs. But after many generations had groaned under this hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh tyranny, a time came when England renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that head, and ſet up the king as their head in eccleſiaſtical as well as civil concernments; and though the free uſe of the ſcriptures which was then introduced, by a divine bleſſing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a great reformation, yet ſtill the <hi>high places</hi> were not taken away, &amp; the <hi>lord biſhops</hi> made ſuch work in them, as drove our fathers from thence into America.

               <p>A brief view of how civil and eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are blended together among us, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving of many of God's people of that liberty of conſcience which he has given them.</p>
               <p>We are not inſenſible than an open appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt any part of the conduct of men in power, is commonly attended with difficulty and danger; and could we have found any way wherein with clearneſs we could have avoided the preſent attempt, we would gladly have taken it. But our bleſſed Lord &amp; only Redeemer, has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, to <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he has made us free;</hi> and things appear ſo to us at preſent that we cannot ſee how we can fully obey this command, without refuſing any active compliance with ſome laws about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affairs that are laid upon us. And as thoſe who are intereſted againſt us, often accuſe us of complaining unreaſonably, we are brought under a neceſſity of laying open particular facts which otherwiſe we would gladly have conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and all muſt be ſenſible that there is a vaſt difference between expoſing the faults, either of individuals or communities, when the cauſe of truth and equity would ſuffer without it, and the doing of it without any ſuch occaſion. We view it to be our incumbent duty, to render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012654_0016_0F8BBF764AC9DB28"/>
to Caeſar the things that are his, but that it is of as much importance not to render unto him any thing that belongs only to God, who is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed rather than man. And as it is evident to us, that God always claimed it as his ſole prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to determine by his own laws, what his worſhip ſhall be, who ſhall miniſter in it, and how they ſhall be ſupported; ſo it is evident that their prerogative has been, and ſtill is, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon in our land. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our legiſlature claim a power to compel every town and pariſh within their juriſdiction, to ſet up and maintain a pedobaptiſt worſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; although it is well known, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm is never expreſs'd in the Bible, only is upheld by men's reaſonings, that are chiefly drawn from Abraham's covenant which the Holy Ghoſt calls, <hi>The covenant of circumciſion,</hi> Acts 7. 8. And as circumciſion was one of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing of ordinances which Chriſt has <hi>blotted out,</hi> where did any ſtate ever get any right to compel their ſubjects to ſet up a worſhip upon that covenant?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our aſcended Lord gives <hi>gifts unto men</hi> in a ſovereign way as ſeems good unto him, and he requires <hi>Every man, as he has received the gift, even ſo to miniſter the ſame;</hi> and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved his apoſtles when they forbid one who was improving his gift, becauſe he followed not them. 1 Pet. 4. 10, 11. Luk. 9. 49. But the Maſſachuſetts legiſlature, while they claim a power to compel each pariſh to ſettle a miniſter, have alſo determined that he muſt be one, who
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012654_0017_0F8BBF770DCB0D38"/>
has either an accademical degree, or a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in his favour from a majority of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the county where the pariſh lies. So that let Chriſt give a man ever ſo great gifts, yet hereby theſe miniſters derive a noble power from the ſtate, to forbid the improvement of the ſame, if he follows not their ſchemes.<note n="¶" place="bottom">It has been the cuſtom of miniſter's who are ſettled in this way, for theſe thirty years paſt, to apply the <hi>gainſaying of Core</hi> to thoſe who have diſſented from them; as if they were as certainly in the right way, as Moſes and Aaron were. And 16 miniſters in the county of Windham, in a public letter to their people in 1744, ſtile theirs, <q>The inſtituted churches; and thoſe who had withdrawn from them, uninſtituted worſhip;</q> and then they go on to aſſert, that Deut. 13, prove that the people, <q>May not go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, any more than—after a falſe god.</q> p. 42. 43.</note> And if the apoſtles aſſumed too much in this reſpect to themſelves, even when their Lord was with them, can it be any breach of charity to conclude that miniſters are not out of danger of doing the like now? eſpecially if we conſider how intereſt operates in the affair! For,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though the Lord hath <hi>ordained that they which preach the goſpel ſhall live of the goſpel;</hi> or by the free <hi>communications to them,</hi> which his goſpel will produce. 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14. Gal. 6. 6. 7. Yet the miniſters of our land have choſen to <hi>live by the law;</hi> and as a reaſon therefor, one of their moſt noted writers, inſtead of producing any truth of God, recites the tradition of a man, who ſaid, <q>Miniſters of the goſpel would have a poor time of it, if they muſt rely on a <hi>free contribution of the people</hi> for their mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance And he ſays, The laws of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

having had the royal approbation to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them, they are the king's laws. By theſe laws it is enacted, that there ſhall be a public worſhip of God in every plantation; that the perſon elected by the majority of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to be ſo, ſhall be looked upon as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the place; that the ſalary for him, which they ſhall agree upon, ſhall be levied by a rate upon all the inhabitants. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, the miniſter <hi>thus</hi> choſen by the people, is (not only Chriſt's but alſo) in reality, the <hi>king's miniſter;</hi> and the ſalary raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, is raiſed in the <hi>king's name,</hi> and is the king's allowance unto him.</q>

               <p>Now who can hear Chriſt declare, that his kingdom is, NOT OF THIS WORLD, and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this blending of church and ſtate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be pleaſing to him? For though their laws call them "orthodox miniſters," yet the grand teſt of their orthodoxy, is the major vote of the people, be they ſaints or ſinners, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or unbelievers. This appears plain in the foregoing quotation; and another of their learned writers lately ſays, <q>It is the congregation in it's parocal congregational capacity, that the <hi>law</hi> conſiders; and this as ſuch does not enough partake of an eccleſiaſtical nature to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction.</q>

How can any man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſuch proceedings to the following commands of our Maſter which is in heaven? Mat. 23. 9, 10. What matter of grief and lamentation is it, that men otherwiſe ſo knowing and juſtly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, ſhould by the traditions of men be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſuch a <hi>crooked</hi> way as this is! for though there is a ſhew of equity in allowing every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to chooſe it's own miniſter; yet let them be ever ſo unanimous for one who is of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>mode</hi> from the court, their choice is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.

               <p>It is true the learned author juſt now quoted ſays, <q>If the moſt of the inhabitants in a planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are epiſcopalians, they will have a miniſter of their own perſuaſion; and the <hi>diſſenters,</hi> in the place, if there be any, muſt pay their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the tax for the ſupport of this <hi>legal miniſter.</hi>

               <p>Even a heathen monarch, when he was moved to make a decree in favour of God's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's and worſhip at Jeruſalem, it was to reſtrain their enemies from injuring or interrupting of them, and to order that a portion of the <hi>king's goods</hi> ſhould be <hi>given unto the elders of the Jews</hi> for the building of <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> and for the <hi>burnt-offerings of the God of heaven.</hi> Ezra. 6. 6—9.

Did not theſe things afford arguments much more plauſible, for their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to compel the world to ſubmit to the church, than any can have for the modern way, of trying to ſubject the church in her religious affairs to rulers, and the major vote of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, a great part of whom are not brethren in any church at all!

Another argument which theſe miniſters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mention, is the apoſtolic direction to us, to pray for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all <hi>godlineſs</hi> and <hi>honeſty.</hi> But do they pray and act according to that direction? One while they cry up the great advantages of having religion eſtabliſhed by law; and ſome have cauſed near as loud a clamour about it as the <hi>craftſmen</hi> did at Epheſus; but when it comes to be calmly repreſented, that, Religion is a <hi>voluntary obedience unto God,</hi> which therefore <hi>force</hi> cannot promote; how ſoon do they ſhift the ſcene, and tell us, that <hi>religious liberty</hi> is fully al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to us, only the ſtate have in their wiſdom thought fit to tax all the inhabitants, to ſupport an order of men for the good of <hi>civil ſociety.</hi> A little while ago it was for religion, and many have declared, that without it we ſhould ſoon have no religion left among us: but now tis to maintain civility. Though by the way, it is well known, that no men in the land, have done more to promote uncivil treatment of diſſenters from themſelves, than ſome of theſe pretended miniſters of civility have done. In 1644 the court at Boſton paſſed an act to puniſh men with baniſhment, if they oppoſed infant bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or departed from any of their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons when it was going to be adminiſtered.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Clark's narrative, p. 35.</note> And after they had acted upon this law, one of their chief magiſtrates obſerved, that ſuch methods tended to make hypocrites.

               <p>A brief account of what the baptiſts have ſuffered under this conſtitution, and of their reaſons for refuſing any active compliance with it.</p>
               <p>Many are ready to ſay, the baptiſts are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from miniſterial taxes, therefore why do they complain? Anſwer, We would be far from forgetting or undervaluing of our privileges: but are willing thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that our honored rulers do protect
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012654_0030_0F8BBF8608363028"/>
our ſocieties, ſo as not to allow them to be interrupted in their worſhip; and as the taking cognizance of marriage belongs to them, we take it as a favour that they grant our miniſters power to adminiſter it, ſo that we may have marriage ſolemnized among ourſelves. Many other liberties we alſo enjoy under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is ſet over us, for which we deſire to be thankful, both to the Author, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of them. Yet if our opponents could once put themſelves into our place, we doubt not but they would think it was high time, to ſeek for more full liberty than we have hitherto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, a ſhort view of but a little part of what we have met with, my be ſufficient to evince this.</p>
               <p>Our charter, as before obſerved, gives us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual religious liberty with other chriſtians: yet the pedobaptiſts being the greateſt party, they ſoon made a perpetual law lo ſupport their own way, but did nothing of that nature to exempt our denomination from it, for 36 years; and ſince that time, what they have done in that reſpect has only been by temporary acts, which have been ſo often changed, that many times their own officers have hardly known what the law was, that was in force; and as an exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the letter of their laws is much inſiſted upon in their executive courts, while thoſe acts have never been enforced with penalties upon their own people, they have often broken them, and we have had but little chance to get them puniſhed for ſo doing. For in all their acts till the laſt, they have impoſed a name upon us, that ſignifies <hi>re-baptizers,</hi> which we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandingly
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012654_0031_0F8BBF86C791ED60"/>
own. In many acts the words, "be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto," were inſerted ſo ambigouſly, as to leave it diſputable, whether a being church members, or only a belonging to the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or worſhipping aſſembly were intended; and in the caſe of Haverhill, where their certificate was otherways compleat, and the caſe had been determined in the baptiſts favor, in that which both parties had agreed ſhould be the final trial; yet another hearing was obtained, in which the want of them ambiguous words in the certificate, was made the main plea by which an action was turned againſt us, of near three hundred dollars. All their latter acts have required a liſt or liſts of our ſocieties, to be given in annually by a certain day, ſigned by three principal members, and the miniſter if there be any; and becauſe one of our churches of above 50 members (and which is now a church in good credit) happened one year to have ſuch a difficulty with their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, as prevented the giving in of ſaid liſt, they were taxed to pedobaptiſt miniſters; and tho' ſome of the ſociety were adviſed to apply to their county court for relief, yet inſtead of obtaining any, the court took away 20 dollars more from them. Another church gave in their liſt by the direction of a noted lawyer, yet they were all taxed to the pedobaptiſt worſhip, and one of the principal members of the baptiſt church, which the law directed to ſign the liſt, was ſtrained up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and both the inferior and ſuperior court turned the caſe againſt him, becauſe he was a <hi>party concerned.</hi>

               <p>Here note, the inhabitants of our mother-country are not more of a party concerned, in
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012654_0032_0F8BBF878D7EAE70"/>
impoſing taxes upon us without our conſent, than they have been in this land who have made and executed laws, to tax <hi>us</hi> to uphold <hi>their worſhip.</hi> This <hi>party influence</hi> has appeared in a much larger number of inſtances than we are willing to trouble the public with at this time; but one inſtance more will ſet our caſe in ſuch a ſtriking light, that we muſt aſk for a very ſerious attention to it; we mean that of Aſhfield, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called Hunts-town in the county of Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. One of the conditions on which that plantation was granted by our legiſlature, was their ſettling a learned orthodox miniſter, and building a meeting-houſe. Now in the year 1761, full two thirds of the inhabitants called and ſettled a miniſter, who they believed was taught of God and truly orthodox. But not being of the ſame mode with the court (for they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts) other people were prompted on, before this ſociety could get up a meeting-houſe, to ſettle another miniſter, and to tax the firſt miniſter with all his people to ſupport their way. This burden the baptiſts bore for a number of years, till in 1768, they preſented a petition to our general court for relief; who ordered that they ſhould ſerve the town and proprietors of Aſhfield with a copy of the petition, that they might ſhew cauſe, if any they had, at the next ſeſſion of the court why it ſhould not be granted, and that a further collection of taxes from the petitioners ſhould be ſuſpended in the mean time. Yet in the ſame ſeſſion of the court, a law was made which cut the baptiſts in that place, off from any exemption from miniſterial taxes at all. In conſequence of which ſeveral hundred acres
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012654_0033_0F8BBF884D790920"/>
of their lands were ſold at public auction, for but a ſmall part of their real value; of which ten acres belonged to the baptiſt miniſter. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter five or ſix journies of above an hundred miles to ſeek relief, and long waiting without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, their meſſenger was at laſt plainly told, by a number of our repreſentatives, <q>That they had a right to make that law, and to keep the baptiſts under it as long as they ſaw fit.</q> Hereupon notice was given in ſome Boſton pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, of a deſign among our churches of joining to ſeek redreſs from another quarter.</p>
               <p>Accordingly at an aſſociation or general meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our churches at Bellingham, in Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1770, theſe things were conſidered, and it was unanimouſly agreed upon to apply to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for help, if it could not ſpeedily be obtained here, and a committee and agents were choſen for that purpoſe. When news hereof was ſpread, our committee were urged by leading men both in church and ſtate, to apply again to our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court; which therefore they did in October following. In the mean time a piece dated from Cambridge, where the court was then ſitting, was publiſhed in all the Boſton news-papers, wherein it was repreſented that, <q>All poſſible care had been taken to prevent our ſuffering the <hi>leaſt diſadvantage</hi> from our religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents;</q> and we were challenged to ſhew the contrary if we could.</p>
               <p>Upon this the pious and learned Mr. John Davis, who from Pennſylvania had not long before been ordained paſtor of the ſecond bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt

church in Boſton, and who was clerk of our committee, called them together to conſider of this matter. And though they were far from deſiring to enter into a news-paper controverſy, yet they adviſed him to make ſome reply to that challenge: He did ſo; and on Dec. 27, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a brief and plain view of the caſe of Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field: but inſtead of any fair and manly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, he in the Evening-Poſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Inſtead of honeſtly <hi>coming to the light</hi> (which our Lord gives as the criterion to know him <hi>that doth truth,</hi> John 3. 21.) how do they hover in the works of darkneſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt article in our committee's petition to the legiſlature, being for Aſhfield, they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to notify the proprietors thereof: They did ſo; and in the ſpring ſeſſion of the aſſembly, they came with a long addreſs againſt us, in which they begin, with ſaying more generally of the baptiſts in that part of the province, <q>The
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012654_0035_0F8BBF8A2F834CB0"/>
proprietors conceive it to be a duty they owe to God and their country, not to be diſpenſed with, to lay open the characters, and real <hi>ſprings of action</hi> of ſome of theſe people.</q> Then they go on to ſay, <q>The <hi>rule</hi> the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners have ſet up, and on which alone they ſeem to ground their claim of exemption, is <hi>falſly applied,</hi> and therefore all arguments bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed on it muſt be inconcluſive. <hi>Natural rights,</hi>
                     <note n="¶" place="bottom">Here note, the plea of our petition was for what we are <q>Intitled to as men, as chriſtians, and ſubjects of a free government.—Some of the laws of this province, we think deprive us of a CHARTER privilege.</q> Theſe are what we grounded all our claims upon; yet they inſinuate that our claim was in this affair to be, <q>reſtored to a ſtate of nature;</q> like thoſe who are under no civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. Notwithſtanding we expreſly ſpeak of our being ſubjects of a free government, and pleaded charter-privileges. Remember what is ſaid of thoſe who <hi>Turn aſide to their crooked ways!</hi>
                     </note> as the reſpondents humbly conceive, are in this province <hi>wholly</hi> ſuperceded in this caſe by <hi>civil obligation,</hi> and in matters of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion individuals cannot with the leaſt propriety plead them.</q> Having thus denied us any claim from <hi>natural rights,</hi> they reſume what they call an indiſpenſible duty, viz. an attempt to lay before our honored legiſlature the baptiſts' cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and the <hi>ſprings</hi> of their actions; and after a number of mean reflections without any proof at all, they ſum up the ſprings of the actions of moſt of them to be <q>Pride, vanity, prejudice, impurity and uncharitableneſs.</q> Very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indeed if it could be proved! but that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a hereafter, and they ſay, <q>At preſent we ſhall content ourſelves with aſſuring your excellency and honors, that the foregoing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is not exaggerated.</q>

                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:012654_0036_0F8BBF8AB913EC58"/>
From this they proceed to obſerve, that as it belongs to rulers to <q>protect and ſupport all regular religious ſocieties of proteſtants,</q> ſo they ſay, <q>Whenever any religion or profeſſion wears an <hi>ill aſpect to the ſtate,</hi> it is become a proper object of attention to the legiſlature.—And this is the religion of the people whom we have been deſcribing.</q> How much does this reſemble the language of him who ſaid, <hi>It is not for the king's profit to ſuffer them!</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After thus repreſenting that the religion of the baptiſts that way, wears an <hi>ill aſpect to the ſtate,</hi> they go on to ſpeak of the conditions upon which Aſhfield was granted; and then try to prove that Mr. Ebenezer Smith, paſtor of the baptiſt church there, <q>is not a miniſter in law,</q> becauſe he has neither an accademical degree, nor a teſtimonial in his favor from the majority of the miniſters of that county. And to give an idea of the ſmallneſs of his ability for teaching, they ſay, <q>Taking occaſion in one of his diſcourſes upon that paſſage of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in which mention is made of the thick boſſes of God's buckler; inſtead of <hi>buckler,</hi> he gave his hearers the word <hi>butler.</hi> Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated by one occaſionally preſent as to his meaning, he explained himſelf ſo as clearly ſhewed, he meant to connect the other part of the ſentence with the word butler, in the commonly received ſenſe of the word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The cleareſt light we have gained in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is this. After Mr. Smith had been preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:012654_0037_0F8BBF8F2DFF3520"/>
in a neighbouring town ſome years ago, a miniſter who was preſent aſked him what a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was? he readily replied, <hi>Pharoah'</hi>s <hi>cup-bearer.</hi> After a little more talk, ſaid miniſter<note n="†" place="bottom">The miniſter who thus treated Mr. Smith is nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to a ruler who has had a principal hand in all their troubles at Aſhfield, and likely they were confederates in forming this addreſs againſt them. And it is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it was the ſame miniſter who publiſhed a piece a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the baptiſts of Aſhfield, in the Boſton News-Letter of Feb. 7, 1771; to which Mr. Smith returned an Anſwer in the ſame paper of March 21, following; wherein, from public records and other ways, he detected ſaid writer in a number of groſs violations of truth.</note> aſſerted, That Mr. Smith uſed the word butler inſtead of buckler in his ſermon. He did not remember that he had; but if he did ſo, how injurious is the above repreſentation? is it not the evil which we read of in Iſa. 29. 20, 21? Having made this reflection upon Mr. Smith, they ſay, <q>He has none of the qualifications of a miniſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laws of Chriſt, or of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, unleſs thoſe of <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>orthodoxy.</hi>
                  </q> We wiſh his accuſers were ſo well qualified. 2 Cor. 1. 12. and 4. 2.</p>
               <p>In April, 1771, the addreſs we have made a few remarks upon was referred to a committe of both houſes of our general court, who reported that, <q>Your committe find, that in the ſale of thoſe lands there was no unfairneſs, but every thing was quite fair, quite neighbourly, and <hi>quite legal.</hi>

With what face then, ſaid Mr. Davis, could the writer of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſay as he does!</note> And as to our plea for exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:012654_0038_0F8BBF9181571038"/>
from miniſterial taxes they ſay, <q>There is an eſſential difference between perſons being taxed where they are not repreſented, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt their wills, and being taxed when repreſented.</q> So they adviſed the court to diſmiſs our petition as unreaſonable; and though the honorable houſe of repreſentatives did not accept that advice, but voted to repeal the Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field law; yet the council refuſed to concur with them therein; ſo that if his gracious Majeſty in council had not diſannuled ſaid law for us, our brethren of Aſhfield muſt, for ought that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the contrary, have been entirely ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of the inheritances, which they had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſubdued at the peril of their lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſword of the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>It may be remembered that the pedobaptiſt proprietors of Aſhfield, repreſented that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts there were not worthy of the <hi>protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of our legiſlature. The following narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may help to explain what they meant by it. The news of what our king had done for them, arrived and was publiſhed in Boſton the latter end of October, 1771, at which their oppreſſors diſcovered great uneaſineſs; and on the 8th of November came two officers with nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous attendants, to the houſe of Mr. Smith, father of the baptiſt miniſter in Aſhfield, (and very much of a father to that ſociety) with a warrant from the chief judge of that county, to
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:012654_0039_0F8BBF92943F5598"/>
ſeize his perſon, and to ſearch his houſe and ſhop for bad money: and it was ſaid they had a like warrant for the miniſter, but he happened to be then abſent on a journey. His father was made a priſoner before he was out of his bed in the morning, and though he promiſed the uſe of his keys, and deſired that no lock might be broken, yet while he was at prayer with his family, for which he obtained leave of one officer, the other broke open his ſhop, and did conſiderable da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage there; and after ſearching both that and his houſe as much as they pleaſed, they carried him before the aforeſaid judge and others; where it plainly appeared that the complaint was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered againſt Mr. Smith from a report, that he had put off a counterfeit dollar; which report was then proved to be a falſe one. Yet the old gentleman was not releaſed, but was kept a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner through a cold night, in circumſtances that greatly injured his health, and next day was bro't on further examination, when even his frequent retirement for ſecret devotion, which he had practiſed for above forty years, was catched hold of to raiſe a ſuſpicion of his being guilty: and he was bound over with two ſureties to the next ſuperior court in that county. Hereupon the following men who had been called as witneſſes againſt him, gave him their teſtimony in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declaring that they were ready to make oath to it, in the following terms, viz.</p>

               <p>Alſo <hi>Leonard Pike,</hi> to whom the report was that Mr. Smith had put off a bad dollar, gave from under his hand that ſaid report had no truth in it. Theſe are eight of the ten witneſſes that were ſummoned againſt Mr. Smith; &amp; tho' much pains was taken to procure evidence againſt him at the ſuperior court, yet he was entirely acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the law was open for him to come back for damages, for a <hi>malicious proſecution;</hi> but they had contrived to have the complaint againſt him entered by a bankrupt, ſo that no recompence might be obtained by him. Are theſe the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruits of having a particular mode of worſhip eſtabliſhed by law, and their miniſters ſupported by force!</p>
               <p>Though we are often accuſed of complaining without reaſon, yet no longer ago than the 26th
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:012654_0041_0F8BBF9389FADAF8"/>
of laſt January, three men of good credit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a numerous and regular baptiſt ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Chelmsford, were ſeized for miniſterial rates (notwithſtanding they had given in a liſt according to law) and though one of them was above four ſcore years old, another very infirm in body, while the third had no man at home, able to take care of the out-door affairs of his numerous family, yet they, in that cold ſeaſon, were all carried priſoners to Concord goal.</p>
               <p>Theſe accounts we have received from good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and have taken great pains to have them ſtated as exactly and truly as poſſible; and if any can point out the leaſt miſtake in what has been now related, we ſhall be glad to correct it. At the ſame time we are far from charging all the evils we complain of, upon the whole congregational denomination without diſtinction; for we believe there were many among them in various ſtations, who are ſorely grieved at theſe oppreſſions. We are willing alſo to make all the allowance that is reaſonable, for the influence of old cuſtoms, education and other prejudices, in thoſe who have injured their neighbours in theſe affairs; but is it not high time now to awake, and ſeek for a more thorough reformation! We agree with the committee of our honored legiſlature in ſaying, There is an eſſential difference between perſons being taxed <hi>where they are repreſented,</hi> and being taxed where they are not ſo; therefore the whole matter very much turns upon this point, viz. Whether our <hi>civil</hi> legiſlature are in truth our repreſentatives in <hi>religious</hi> affairs, or not? As God has always claimed it as his prerogative,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:012654_0042_0F8BBF944AB29A08"/>
to appoint who ſhall be his miniſters, and how they ſhall be ſupported, ſo under the goſpel, the peoples communications to Chriſt's miniſters and members, are called <hi>ſacrifices</hi> with which <hi>God is well-pleaſed.</hi> Phil. 4. 18. Heb. 13, 16—18. And what government on earth ever had, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can have any power to make or execute any laws to appoint and enforce <hi>ſacrifices to God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In civil ſtates the power of the whole collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body is veſted in a few hands, that they may with better advantage defend themſelves againſt injuries from abroad, and correct abuſes at home, for which end a few have a right to judge for the whole ſociety; but in religion each one has an equal right to judge for himſelf; for we muſt all <hi>appear</hi> before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, that <hi>every one</hi> may receive the things <hi>done in his body,</hi> according to that <hi>he hath done</hi> (not what any earthly repreſentative hath done for him) 2 Cor. 5. 10 And we freely confeſs that we can find no more warrant from divine truth, for any people on earth to conſtitute any men their repreſentatives, to make laws, to impoſe religious taxes, than they have to appoint Peter or the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary to repreſent them before the throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. We are therefore brought to a ſtop about paying ſo much regard to ſuch laws, as to give in annual certificates to the other denomination, as we have formerly done.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the very nature of ſuch a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice implies an acknowledgment, that the civil power has a right to ſet one religious ſect up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove another, elſe why need we give certificates
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:012654_0043_0F8BBF9508A783E0"/>
to them any more than they to us? It is a tacit allowance that they have a right to make laws about ſuch things, which we believe in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences they have not. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the foregoing addreſs to our legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and their committees report thereon, it is evident, that they claim a right to tax us from <hi>civil obligation,</hi> as being the repreſentatives of the people. But how came a civil community by any eccleſiaſtical power? how came the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of <hi>this world</hi> to have a right to govern in Chriſt's kingdom which is <hi>not of this world!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That conſtitution not only emboldens people to <hi>judge the liberty of other mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and has carried them ſo far as to tell our general aſſembly, that they conceived it to be a <hi>duty they owed to God</hi> and their country, not to be diſpenſed with, to lay before them the <hi>ſprings</hi> of their neighbours actions;<note n="¶" place="bottom">How are men deluded to think they <hi>do God ſervice,</hi> when they violate his word! 1 Cor. 4. 5.

John 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.</note> but it alſo requires ſomething of the ſame nature from us. Their laws require us annually to certify to them, what our belief is concerning the <hi>conſcience</hi> of every perſon that aſſembles with us, as the condition of their being exempted from taxes to other's worſhip. And only becauſe our brethren in Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingham, left that clauſe about the <hi>conſcience</hi> out of their certificates laſt year, a number of their ſociety who live at Mendon were lately taxed, and ſuffered the ſpoiling of their goods to uphold pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptiſt worſhip.</p>

4. The ſcheme we oppoſe evidently tends to deſtroy the purity and life of religion; for the inſpired apoſtle aſſures us, that the church is <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed as a chaſte virgin to Chriſt,</hi> and is obliged to be <hi>ſubject to him in every thing,</hi> as a true wife is to her huſband. Now the moſt chaſte domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic obedience, does not at all interfere with any lawful ſubjection to civil authority; but for a woman to admit the higheſt ruler in a nation into her huſband's place, would be <hi>adultery</hi> or <hi>whoredom;</hi> and how often are <hi>mens inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> about worſhip ſo called in the ſacred ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſalm 106. 39. We delight not in hard names, but every vice ought to be called by it's proper name; and the cuſtom in this adulterous age of calling thoſe, <hi>natural chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> which God calls <hi>children of whoredom,</hi> has doubtleſs had a pernicious effect upon many to embolden them to go on in their filthy ways. God charged his ancient church with <hi>playing the harlot,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſaid, <hi>I will go after my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that gave me my bread and my water;</hi>—<hi>For ſhe did not know that</hi> I GAVE HER CORN, &amp;c. Hoſea 2. 5, 8. By which it appears, that to fix our dependence upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſide the divine Being, and to purſue any method be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his directions, to obtain the neceſſaries and comforts of life, is whoredom; and does not the chief ſin of the <hi>mother of harlots</hi> lie in her fixing this dependence upon the <hi>kings of the earth?</hi> Rev. 18. 3—13.</note> And does it not greatly concern us all, earneſtly to ſearch out and put away ſuch evils, as we would deſire to eſcape the awful judgments that ſuch wickedneſs has brought on other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! Eſpecially if we conſider that not only the purity, but alſo the very life and being of religion among us is concerned therein; for 'tis evident that Chriſt has given as plain laws to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what the duty of people is to his miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as he has the duty of miniſters to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:012654_0045_0F8BBF96B6F36200"/>
and moſt certainly he is as able to enforce the one as the other. The common plea of our opponents is, that people will not do their duty if rulers do not enforce it; but does not the whole book of God clearly ſhew, that miniſters as often fail of doing their duty as the people do? And where is the care of rulers to puniſh miniſters for their unfaithfulneſs? They often talk about <hi>equality</hi> in theſe affairs, but where does it appear! As Chriſt is THE HEAD of all <hi>principality</hi> and <hi>power;</hi> ſo the <hi>not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having</hi> NOURISHMENT MINISTRED, <hi>and</hi> KNIT TOGETHER, <hi>increaſeth with the increaſe</hi> OF GOD, but bringing in an <hi>earthly power</hi> between Chriſt and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, has been the grand ſource of anti-chriſtian abominations, and of ſettling men down in <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> while they <hi>deny the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> Has not this earthly ſcheme prevailed ſo far in our land, as to cauſe many miniſters, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>taking heed to the miniſtry received from the Lord;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>watching for ſouls as thoſe who muſt give an account,</hi>

But the contrary that takes any man's eſtate by force to maintain their own or any other miniſtry, it ſerves for nothing but to provoke to wrath, envy and ſtrife, and <hi>this wiſdom cometh not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi>—And ſince you wrote this letter, the conſtable of Attle-borough has been taking away the eſtates of our dear friends, and pious diſſenters to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their miniſter; the like hath been done in the town of Mendon. Is this the way of peace? Is this the fruit of your love? Why do you hug the iniquity of Eli's ſons, and walk in the ſteps of the falſe prophets, to <hi>bite with the teeth,</hi> and cry <hi>peace;</hi> but no longer than men put into your mouths than you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare war againſt them.—Since you admire our

You deſire that all former injury done by you may be buried in oblivion. We ſay, far be it from us to revenge ourſelves; or to deal to you as you have dealt to us, but rather ſay, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do.</hi> But if you mean that we ſhould not ſpeak of former actions, done hurtfully to any man's perſon, we ſay, God never called for that, nor ſuffered it to be hid, as witneſs Cain, Joab and Judas, are kept on record to deter other men from doing the like.</q>

               <p>And now our dear countrymen, we beſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider of theſe things. The great importance of a general union through this country, in order to the preſervation of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, has often been pleaded for with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but how can ſuch a union be expected ſo long as that deareſt of all rights, equal liberty of conſcience is not allowed? Yea, how can any reaſonably expect that HE who has the hearts of kings in his hand, will turn the heart of our earthly ſovereign to hear the pleas for liberty, of thoſe who will not hear the cries of their fellow-ſubjects, under their oppreſſions? Has it not
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:012654_0052_0F8BBFA11C2EFF10"/>
been plainly proved, that ſo far as any man gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies his own inclinations, without regard to the univerſal law of equity, ſo far he is in bondage? ſo that it is impoſſible for any one to tyranize over others, without thereby becoming a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſlave himſelf: a ſlave to raging luſts, and a ſlave to guilty fears of what will be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. We are told that the father of Cyrus, tho' a heathen, <q>Had often taught him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the prudence of men is very ſhort, and their views very limited; that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate into futurity; and that many times what they think muſt needs turn to their advantage proves their ruin; whereas the Gods being eternal, know all things, future as well as paſt, and inſpire thoſe that love them to undertake what is moſt expedient for them; which is a favor and protection they owe to no man, and grant only to thoſe that invoke and conſult them.</q> And we are told by the ſame author,<note n="†" place="bottom">Rollin in his ancient hiſtory</note> of another wiſe heathen, who ſaid, <q>'Tis obſervable, that thoſe that fear the Deity moſt, are leaſt afraid of man.</q> And ſhall not chriſtians awake to a moſt hearty reverence of HIM who has ſaid, (and will ever make good his word) <hi>With what meaſure ye meet, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suffer us a little to expoſtulate with our fathers and brethren, who inhabit the land to which our anceſtors fled for religious liberty. You have lately been accuſed with being diſorderly and rebellious, by men in power, who profeſs a
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:012654_0053_0F8BBFA1C84A21A0"/>
great regard for order and the public good; and why don't you believe them, and reſt eaſy under their adminiſtrations? You tell us you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, becauſe you are taxed where you are not repreſented; and is it not really ſo with us? You do not deny the right of the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to impoſe taxes within her own realm; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain that ſhe extends her taxing power beyond her proper limits; and have we not as good right to ſay you do the <hi>ſame thing?</hi> and ſo that wherein you judge others you condemn your ſelves? Can three thouſand miles poſſibly fix ſuch limits to taxing power, as the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween civil and ſacred matters has already done? One is only a diſtance of <hi>ſpace,</hi> the other is ſo great a difference in the <hi>nature</hi> of things, as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>ſacrifices to God,</hi> and the <hi>ordinances of men.</hi> This we truſt has been fully proved.</p>
               <p>If we aſk why have you not been eaſy and thankful ſince the parliament has taken off ſo many of the taxes that they had laid upon us? you anſwer that they ſtill claim a power to tax us, when, and as much as they pleaſe; and is not that the very difficulty before us? In the year 1747, our legiſlature paſſed an act to free the baptiſts in general from miniſterial taxes for ten years: yet becauſe they increaſed conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when that time was about half expired, they broke in upon the liberty they had granted, and made a new act, wherein no baptiſt church nor miniſter was allowed to have any ſuch exemption. till they had <hi>firſt</hi> obtained certificates from three other churches. By which the late Mr. John Procter obſerved (in a remonſtrance that he
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:012654_0054_0F8BBFA291DB51D0"/>
drew, and which was preſented to our court) that they had as far as in them lay, <q>disfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, unchurched and uſurped an illegal power over all the religious ſocieties of the people in ſaid act called anabaptiſts through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this province:—For where is it poſſible for the poor anabaptiſts to find the <hi>firſt</hi> three authenticated miniſters and churches to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticate the firſt three!</q> So we have now related a caſe, in which a number of our breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren were put to new coſt for copies to notify o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with hope of relief to themſelves, and yet in the ſame ſeſſion of court, they had a worſe burden laid upon them than before; and their repeated cries, and then the petition of our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted churches, were all rejected.</p>
               <p>A very great greivance which our country has juſtly complained of is, that by ſome late proceedings a man's houſe or locks cannot ſecure either his perſon or his property, from oppreſſive officers. Pray then conſider what our brethren have ſuffered at Aſhfield.</p>
               <p>Many think it hard to be frowned upon only for pleading for their rights, and laying open parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular acts of encroachment thereon; but what frowns have we met with for no other crime? and as the preſent conteſt between Great-Britain and America, is not ſo much about the greatneſs of the taxes already laid, as about a ſubmiſſion to their taxing power; ſo (though what we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſuffered is far from being a trifle, yet) our greateſt difficulty at preſent concerns the ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:012654_0055_0F8BBFA34DA8A888"/>
to a taxing power in eccleſiaſtical affairs. It is ſuppoſed by many that we are exempted from ſuch taxes, but they are greatly miſtaken, for all know that paper is a money article, and writing upon it is labour, and this tax we muſt pay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, as a token of ſubmiſſion to their power, or elſe they will lay a heavier tax upon us. And we have one difficulty in ſubmitting to this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which our countrymen have not in the other caſe: that is, our caſe affects the conſcience, as their's does not: and equal liberty of conſcience is one eſſential article in our CHARTER, which conſtitutes this government, and deſcribes the extent of our rulers authority, and what are the rights and liberties of the people. And in the confeſſion of faith which our rulers and their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have publiſhed to the world, they ſay, <q>God alone is Lord of the conſcience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, which are, in <hi>any thing</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his word; or <hi>not contained in it;</hi> ſo that to believe ſuch doctrines, or to obey ſuch commands, out of conſcience, is to <hi>betray</hi> true liberty of conſcience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an abſolute blind obedience, is to deſtroy liberty of conſcience and reaſon alſo.</q>

                  <p>And a moſt famous hiſtorian of their's, after mentioning ſome former violations of that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſays, The great noiſe that hath been made in the world about the <hi>perſecution</hi> made in New-England, I will now ſtop with only tranſcribing the words uttered in the ſermon

But <hi>human</hi> learning is ſurely as needful for phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and lawyers as for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> teachers; and dare any deny that the affairs of law and phyſick fall more directly under the notice of the ſtate than divinity does? why then do our legiſlature leave every man, and woman too, at liberty to chooſe their own lawyer and phyſician, and not oblige them either to employ or pay any other, though the majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may prefer them? Can any better reaſon be rendered for this difference in conduct than this, viz. It has been found to be an eaſier matter to <hi>impoſe</hi> upon people about their ſouls, than about their bodies or their temporal eſtates!</note>

               <p>In a celebrated oration for liberty, publiſhed laſt ſpring in Boſton, a maxim was recited which carries it's own evidence with it, which is this, NO MAN CAN GIVE THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER'S. Yet have not our legiſlature from time to time, made acts to empower the major part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in towns and precincts, to <hi>give away</hi> their neighbours eſtates to what miniſters they
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:012654_0058_0F8BBFA5DBB19598"/>
pleaſe! And can we ſubmit to ſuch doctrines and commandments of men, and not <hi>betray</hi> true liberty of conſcience! Every perſon is or ought to be, benefited by civil government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they owe rulers honor and a tribute on that account; but the like cannot be truly ſaid of an impoſed miniſter; for as the goſpel miniſtry is an ordinance of God and not of man, ſo the obligation that any perſon or people are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obey and ſupport any man as a miniſter of Chriſt, ariſes from the <hi>conſideration</hi> of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to them to reſemble his Maſter in <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>converſation,</hi> and from the benefit which peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple receive under their miniſtrations.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Heb. 12. 7, 17. Phil. 4. 9, 10. 1 Cor. 9. 11. Gal. 6. 6. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 18.</note> From whence the law of equity makes the free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of our <hi>carnal things</hi> to Chriſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to be a matter that as really concerns the exerciſe of a good conſcience toward God, as prayer and praiſe do; for they are both called <hi>ſacrifices</hi> to him in the ſame chapter. Heb. 13. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Thus we have laid before the public a brief view of our ſentiments concerning liberty of conſcience, and a little ſketch of our ſufferings on that account. If any can ſhow us that we have made any miſtakes, either about principles or facts, we would lie open to conviction: But we hope none will violate the forecited article of faith ſo much, as to require us to yield a <hi>blind obedience</hi> to them, or to expect that ſpoiling of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:012654_0059_0F8BBFAAE342E2D0"/>
goods or impriſonment can move us to <hi>betray</hi> the cauſe of true liberty.</p>
               <p>A late writer in the Boſton papers, has taken much pains to prove, that ſome other colonies have impoſed upon people in ſuch affairs worſe than New-England has; and to prove it he informs us, that an act for miniſters mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, was paſſed in New-York near eighty years ago, which ſucceeding rulers have turned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a denomination that had very few repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives in court when the act was made, while the denomination who made it, have been deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any benefit from it. If ſo, how loud is the call to every man that is a friend to liberty, and who regards the good of poſterity, to riſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert all his influence, to demoliſh the engine which has done ſo much miſchief in all ages! We are far from trying to repreſent the fathers of New-England as the worſt of the coloniſts; We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary. But our veneration for their memory, is ſo far from reconciling us to, that it fills us with greater deteſtation of, that <hi>myſtery of iniquity,</hi> which carried them into ſuch acts of impoſition and perſecution as have left a great blemiſh upon their character. And ſince theſe are tedious things to dwell upon, we ſhall cloſe with this remark.</p>
               <p>The Maſſachuſetts miniſters, in their letter to governor Jencks and other baptiſts in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſaid, We hope and pray that ancient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that had <hi>acrimony</hi> unhappily in them may be buried in oblivion. Now we are told that
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012654_0060_0F8BBFAD8B4C1AE8"/>
acrimony ſignifies that quality in one body whereby it corrodes, eats up or deſtroys another, This <hi>eating deſtroying</hi> quality is truly unhappy: but how can it be buried before it is dead? The worſt of criminals are to be executed before they are buried. Therefore let this cruel <hi>man-eater</hi> be fairly executed, and we are ready to join heart and hand to bury him, and not to have a bone of him left for contention in all the land. If it be ſo hard to our opponents to hear of theſe matters, what has it been to thoſe who have felt their eating and deſtroying influence for theſe hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and forty years? And how can any perſon lift up his head before God or man, and ſay he hopes to have theſe things buried, if he at the ſame time holds faſt, and tries hard to keep alive the procuring cauſe of them!</p>
               <p>The foregoing appeal, having been examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved by many of his brethren, is preſented to the public, by their humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</p>

               <p>SINCE the above was written, I have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed direct accounts, that at Montague (whoſe caſe is mentioned p. 32.) they continue from time to time, to make diſtreſs upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal members of the baptiſt church there, whom the law directs to ſign their certificates, while
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:012654_0061_0F8BBFAEA4DCCC50"/>
they let the reſt of the ſociety alone. Alſo that William White a regular member of the baptiſt church in Aſhfield, who lives in Cheſterfield, and has had his ſtanding in ſaid church certified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to law; yet had a cow taken from him on Auguſt 25, 1773, and ſold the 30th, for the pedobaptiſt miniſters rate; and that in both of theſe places, the civil charges of the town, and the miniſters ſalary are all blended in one tax (contrary as I am informed to the law of our province) ſo that our brethren who would readily pay their civil tax, yet cannot do it, without pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miniſters alſo. Now the grand pretence that is made for the uſe of the ſecular arm to ſupport miniſters is, that thereby <hi>equality</hi> is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed among the people; but what religion, equality or equity can there be in the above proceedings!</p>
