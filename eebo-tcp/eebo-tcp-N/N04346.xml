            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOU have I perceive, ſuſtain'd the Loſs of a dear Creature-Comfort, your little Daughter.

great and worthy Name of our Immanuel! Well! Glory to free pure Grace: The Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs is become a fruitful Field, and made to bloſſom as the Roſe: <hi>The Roſe of Sharon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in tranſcendent Glory. Lo! now the Winter is paſt, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers of Grace appear, the <hi>Time of the ſinging of Birds,</hi> young Converts, ſweet Birds of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe is come, and there they are chirping forth the Praiſes of the Lamb on the Boughs of free Grace; <hi>and the Voice of the Turtle,</hi> the bleſſed Spirit is heard in your, as well as in our Land: This is the more refreſhing to me, as the dear Lord himſelf drew out my Soul much, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for more than a Month) the latter End of laſt Winter, and beginning of the Spring, that he would give you, my dear Brother, much Aſiſtance, Comfort, and Succeſs &amp;c. as I wrote to you in a Letter about that Time. Oh! He is a Prayer-hearing, a Wonder-working God! He makes his Name appear glorious and excellent indeed! <hi>Glory to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>The Letter that comes inclos'd to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Barber,</hi> from our dear Brother <hi>T</hi>— was peruſed by me when it came to Hand; that I might find out what remained for me to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005373_0002_101827F6D5A71740"/>
write, and I am glad he has given you ſome Hints of what has paſs'd, and ſomewhat par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly: But a full Narration muſt be left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told till we ſee one another here below, or meet in the Upper-Houſe; juſt as our Father pleaſes: But if it be his holy Will, I ſhould indeed be glad, my dear Brother, yea very glad to ſee you again while we are in this World. Oh my dear Brother! When will you come over to your longing and loving Brother <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and others that are dear to you? The Lord give me to wait, and you to come in his Time.</p>
            <p>But to return, I would add to what Brother <hi>T</hi>—has written on the awful Affair of Books and Cloaths at <hi>New-London,</hi> which affords Grounds of deep and laſting Humiliation. I was, to my Shame be it ſpoken, the Rignlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in that horrid Action. I was, my dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under the powerful Influence of the falſe Spirit, almoſt one whole Day together, and Part of ſeveral Days. The Lord ſhewed me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that the Spirit I was then acted by, was in its Operations void of true inward Peace, prompting me to lay the greateſt Streſs on Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals, to neglect the Heart, to be full of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datience, Pride, and Arrogance: Although I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005373_0003_101827F8617E6EB0"/>
thought in the Time of it that 'twas the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in a high Degree, (awful indeed!) My Body, eſpecially my Leg Were much diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the ſame Time, which Satan and my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Heart might make ſome Handle of. When the Lord ſhewed me and my Brethren <hi>T.</hi>— and <hi>S</hi>—our Sin, he diſpoſed us to a free and full Confeſſion. Preſently upon it a Light ſhone into my Soul, diſcovering the Wiſdom of God in leaving us, and me particularly to fall; that however Shame belonged to me, yet Glory to him for his Wiſdom eſpecially; but this Light I ſoon ſhut my Eyes againſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſweet, I could not bear it. I thought, having committed ſo grievous a Sin, I muſt have much more Bitter, before I had any Sweet. Thus I tried to be humbled, crying in my Soul for more Weight, ſeeking after a legal Repentance; and thus I continued from ſome Part of the Forenoon, till near Night. Although this ſweet and pleaſant Light was offered to my Soul almoſt or quite all the Time; but I durſt not admit it for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon aforeſaid: Yet at laſt it increaſed to that degree, and became ſo powerful that I could withſtand no longer, I was conſtrained to praiſe the Lord, eſpecially for his Wiſdom, in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005373_0003_101827F8617E6EB0"/>
leaving me to fall as I did. At the ſame Time my Sin in falling appear'd ne'er the leſs, but indeed more odious and Abominable; but ſtill I muſt praiſe the Lord, while I condemn'd and loath'd my ſelf. The dear and merciful Lord took from me a legal Spirit of Heavineſs and gave me a Garment of Praiſe; and I found Goſpel Repentance to be quite another Thing than I imagined in my legal Frame, viz. to take Part with the Lord fully againſt my ſelf. He gave me truly to loath what I had done, and my ſelf for it; and he made me willing if it was his Pleaſure, and for his Glory to be ſtoned by the whole World together, not to make Attonement, but in Teſtimony againſt, and Abhorrence of the Sin; yet ſtill I muſt praiſe the Lord if I went thro' Hell to him, I muſt praiſe, I could not bear to refrain from that one Minute. I believe moſt of God's dear Children around could not receive it, that I ſhould enjoy the Lord ſo ſoon after ſo awful a Fall. However the Lord purified my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this Way, and I could not wonder at them, having been my ſelf juſt before in the ſame legal Frame and Track. Quickly after one told me, he believed I had confeſs'd that to be the falſe Spirit that was the true, I gave
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005373_0004_101827FA1BC1FCD0"/>
heed to him, and preſently began to murmur againſt the Lord, and felt about a Quarter of an Hour, as if I was ſinking into the Belly of Hell; but the Lord in great Love came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and brought to my Soul a ſweet and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Senſe of his Wiſdom in leaving me to fall; that I might thus be purged of idolizing my ſelf, others of God's Children purged of idolizing me, Hypocrites alſo diſcovered, yea, and the Elect converted; while others are hardened in righteous Judgment, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus was my poor ill deſerving Soul in Free Grace refreſh'd for a Day together, and ſometimes even feaſted. The next Day I felt ſtill, but had not ſo much Sweetneſs, but the Day after, the Wiſdom, Power, Love and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God ſhone in clearly and warmly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on my Soul from Morning to Night. In the Afternoon in thoſe Words, <hi>He doeth all Things well!</hi> Thus was my Soul fed, yea ſometimes filled with Comfort, while my dear Brethren that fell with, or rather after me, who had not been near ſo guilty as I, were fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with racking Diſtreſs, Darkneſs and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Oh my Brother! This was ſovereign Grace indeed! By this Time my complicated Diſeaſe was come near to a Criſis: For I had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005373_0004_101827FA1BC1FCD0"/>
the long Fever on me, and the Cancry Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour broken out in one Leg, raw and ſwol'n round and over it from my Knee to my Foot at the ſame Time, and running Friday Night and after, near the Middle of <hi>March,</hi> I believe I may ſay Quarts in ſome Hours; and now for a Day together I expected nothing but to die, and that ſoon; all about me expected the ſame. But Oh! my dear Brother, I can't tell you in Words, how refreſhing this was to my Soul; although I concluded it would be look'd upon by the World, and even by moſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as an immediate Judgment of Heaven, and that ſo I ſhould die in their Eyes as a Hypocrite and Malefactor: Yet, bleſſed be God, I think this did not at all damp, but ſweetly purify my Joy, my Evidences for Heaven, thro' pure rich Grace, were then clear without Doubt, and a ſecret inexpreſſible Thirſt for Eternity given and continued to my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Soul moſt of the Time with much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, ſometimes with Rapture. Oh! my beloved Brother, you muſt think, for I can't tell you how I felt, when I thought thus; Oh! am I indeed within a few Days, or a few Hours of Eternity, bleſſed Eternity! What ſo near the End of my Courſe here? And eſpecially,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005373_0005_101827FD1574E798"/>
am I ſo near the End of all Sin, that which my Soul could not bear, and longed to be freed from above any Thing elſe! Difficulties and Troubles ſeem'd as nothing in compariſon of it! Oh! am I ſo near pure and perfect Glory above! Oh I ſhall then be like my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious God, and dear Redeemer? <hi>For I ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I ſhall ſin no more, no more for ever,</hi> &amp;c. Here let your Soul Fire in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and joyn with me in Praiſe to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Father, Son and Spirit, <hi>Amen!</hi> Once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I was thought by ſome to be actually dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when I was juſt a fainting. I did not think I was going then, but I hop'd in a few more ſuch Turns that I ſhould take a clear Flight to the Realms of Glory. It ſeem'd to be a Foretaſte of Death, and I had preſently a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte of Glory, which the Children of God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into in a Moment, when they leave their Bodies and this World. Oh! What heavenly Light and raviſhing Joys broke in then upon my Soul! <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Lord was pleaſed to order me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and tho' it was truly hard, the Lord ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to ſay, <hi>Thy Will be done.</hi> I ſeem'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to thoſe about me, as one riſing from the Dead, particularly to Brother <hi>S</hi>—and <hi>T</hi>—
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005373_0005_101827FD1574E798"/>
and the Lord comforted my Soul with a freſh Senſe of that Word in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Therefore ſprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo the Lord ſet home that Word powerfully, and cauſed a feeling Senſe of it to continue near a Month together; <hi>Go tell the Diſciples and</hi> Peter <hi>that he goeth before you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Galilee.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid himſelf, Go, tell my Diſciples that have forſaken me, and <hi>Peter</hi> that has denied me in a moſt awful Manner, tell them, &amp;c. Tell <hi>Peter</hi> the guiltieſt of all, the vileſt of all, comfort his drooping Soul, let him be diſtinguiſhed by Grace, free ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace, tho' he has diſtinguiſhed himſelf by Sin; call him by Name, tell him <hi>I go before him into Galilee</hi> with my comfortable and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Preſence, let him ſtand up in the Day of Pentecoſt, and ſpeak, let my Power go forth and Three Thouſand be converted &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus was my poor Soul refreſhed and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that the dear Jeſus would further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and improve me, <hi>would go before me, &amp;c.</hi> Oh! My Brother, never did I behold ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo ſenſibly apprehend the Lord's ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Grace with reſpect to his Children, the moſt back-ſliding of them, as at this Time I am ſpeaking of; and then for near a Month,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005373_0006_101827FEA7305558"/>
and at ſometimes ſince, <hi>Glory to God alone.</hi> The Lord Jeſus was alſo pleaſed to give a fixed, ſollid and ſenſible Union to his Children where ever they were, and what ever their Frames might be, or their Thoughts or Treatment of me, be it ever ſo wrong (they then being to be pitied) I ſay, Union to them as and becauſe they were Fellow Members of the ſame Body of Jeſus, more purely I think, than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: And bleſſed be God, this was a great Support and Comfort to me in the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Trials I met with from the Children of God at that Time. Say of me, or do with me what they would, ſtill I muſt love them dearly, inexpreſſibly; and if they pull'd from me, they ſeem'd to pull the Heart-Strings of Love the tighter; my very Soul thro' Grace lov'd them and pitied them, and thoſe dear Chriſtians, that ſpake and acted moſt againſt me, I think I may ſay thro, rich Grace, were made as dear, if not dearer to my Soul than any, <hi>Glory to God!</hi> Had it not been ſo, my Trials then would have been exceeding cutting. Thus the Lord ſtood by me, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, and comforted me a vile Mortal: Bleſſed be his Name forevermore, who ſo wonderfully diſplay'd his Covenant-Love and

Faithfulneſs, even to the moſt backſliding of his Children.</p>
            <p>Oh! My dearly beloved Brother, the Lord give you to take Warning by this terrible Fall and give you <hi>to watch and pray that you enter not into Temptation.</hi> Oh be humble thro Grace, and be not proud of the Gifts and Graces, the Aſſiſtance and Succeſs the Lord has given or may give you, take no Part of the Glory to your ſelf, neither lean to your own Underſtanding. Oh! be not wiſe above what is written, nor ever leave the ſacred unerring Oracles of Truth. The dear Lord ſave you from Extremes on both Sides the Path of Duty, and continue his Preſence, yea fill you ſtill more with his Spirit, and give you Grace for Grace. Grace, <hi>That you may rightly improve, and not ſadly abuſe, the Grace that he gives,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord bleſs you my dear Brother, and bleſs theſe mournful and yet joyful Lines to you and to any other that may hear them. Do write to me as ſoon and as often as you can, or rather let me ſee you Face to Face, that we may ſpeak about Jeſus together, and I truſt he will come in the Midſt and ſay, <hi>Peace unto you.</hi>— I can't but hope, if my dear Brother <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> return, and it be the Lord's Will, I may

ſee you in theſe Parts in the Spring, or ſoon after. <hi>The Lord's will be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Lines come fill'd with Love to you, and the dear Children of God with you. Tell thoſe poor Orphans and others that are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, I long for them to come to Chriſt without Delay: For, <hi>If they don't come to Chriſt and believe on him, they muſt be damned and burnt in Hell for ever.</hi> Mat. 16.16. John 3.16. Dreadful indeed! Oh! Jeſus offers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy freely, (<hi>John</hi> 7.37.) and can they bear to ſtay behind in this glorious Time, when others thro' Grace are flocking to Chriſt, and longing for them. (<hi>Luke</hi> 7.41, 32.) You may improve upon this with them, as the Lord may enable you.</p>
            <p>The good Lord bleſs it to their dear preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls! When Brother <hi>Whitefield</hi> returns, give much <hi>Love</hi> to him, and deſire him to pray, yea joyn with him in praying for Your poor fallen Brother, yet mercifully treated in our dear and bleſſed IMMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUEL.</p>

            <p>JOYN with me in giving Golory to the Name of our GOD, for what he has been doing among us at <hi>Betheſda</hi> of late, as well as formerly. Surely your Heart muſt leap for Joy, when you hear what the Lord has done for us, and that he made uſe of you as an Inſtrument. Indeed, we have had a Spring of new, and very wonderful Delights. This deſart Land is made to rejoyce and bloſſom like a Roſe. We have ſeen ſomewhat of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord and the Excellency of our God. He is indeed excellent in Working. Oh! that I could ſuitably admire and ſet forth his Work unto you. When you read, you muſt think what you have ſeen in Time paſt, and may the Lord give you a lively and refreſhing Senſe thereof. For ſome Months paſt there has been ſome Stir among the dry Bones in this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005373_0008_10182803878CF3F0"/>
Valley.—Several were awakened and made to cry earneſtly after the Lord. And about a Month ago, one of our Labourers was hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully converted, a Man of about forty Years of Age.</p>
            <p>The laſt Day of laſt Month, I receiv'd Yours from <hi>Maidenhead</hi> of the 30th of <hi>November</hi> laſt, for which I thank you. I read it over to ſome of my Friends that Evening; but being ſome what wearied in Body, having been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad all Day, I found no Diſpoſition to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Meſſage in publick that Night; but the next Evening I thought I muſt do it, and ſo took your Letter in my Pocket when I went to Prayers, and after Prayers, I read about a Page and Half at the Beginning, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Meſſage at the latter End, and as the Lord enabled, I did enlarge upon it both to the Converted and Unconverted, and the Hearts of ſome of God's Children were warmed and ſome others cried out under Concern. After Publick Worſhip was over, they got together in another Room, and the Spark was ſoon kindled into a Flame.—The Love of God was ſhed abroad in many Hearts, and they ſang Praiſe to free Grace. One and another came running to me telling me how the Lord had
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005373_0008_10182803878CF3F0"/>
revived their Souls. You will have a Taſte of their Loves by the Letters they have ſent you, and I hope you will write them an Anſwer as ſoon as you can. But my Brother, I have not told you the one Half yet. The ſame Night that the Children of God were revived, was a Night of God's Power to four poor Souls. I can't particularly relate to you the Manner of their Converſion, it was very evident and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful to all around, moſt of the Night was ſpent in Prayer and Praiſe. Oh! How ſweet was it, your Experience muſt Witneſs? The next Morning, another young Woman, that had been crying with the Reſt the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was <hi>brought out of Darkneſs into marvel-Light.</hi>—Moſt of that Day and the next, many Souls were filled with the Love of God, ſome were even overcome with the Power and Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof.</p>
            <p>In the Day of God's Power his People ſhall be willing. Some Days paſt we have had no great Stirring, what the Lord has further to do here, I know not. I can't yet tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord will let me leave <hi>Betheſda,</hi> but Time will diſcover what the Will of the Lord is.</p>

Bleſſed be God that he has humbled and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you up again. Your Letter upon that Head is very pleaſing to me and others. I hope and truſt it will be a Means of your ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſteady, not in your own but the Lord's Strength, but I can't dwell upon it.

            <p>IT has been upon my Mind to let you know what the ſweet Lord Jeſus has done for my Soul. Indeed, he has done great and marvellous Things for me, bleſſed be his holy NAME. He brought me out of my native Land, and brought me to this Houſe of Mercy. Soon after I came here, at Times I was under ſome Concern about my poor Soul, but it would ſoon wear off. At the Death of dear Mr. <hi>Barber</hi>'s Child, the Lord was pleas'd to renew my Convictions again, and made me cry out, <hi>What ſhall I do to be
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005373_0010_10182808E27D7BA8"/>
ſaved.</hi> I continued in great Diſtreſs about Six Months, and one Sabbath at Meeting, my Soul was in great Anguiſh, ſo that I cried out. I continued ſo till the <hi>Friday</hi> following, and could not reſt Night nor Day, then did I ſee that if the Lord had not Mercy upon me, I muſt go to Hell, it was but what I deſerv'd, yea I deſerv'd a Thouſand Hells: But when I was ſtripp'd of my own Righteouſneſs, then the Lord put on me the Robe of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: Yea, he paſſed by me, and ſaw me polluted in my Blood, and ſaid unto me <hi>live,</hi> and I did live. Then did he afford unto me that Peace, <hi>which paſſeth all Underſtanding,</hi> and the Joy of his free Spirit. O What a Love did I then feel to God and all his Children! Indeed my Soul was raviſhed at God's free Grace that had choſen me, and left Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to periſh for ever. Then did I think that I would never be ſorry any more; but leſt I ſhould be exhalted above Meaſure, the Lord ſaw fit to hide himſelf behind the Wall, and then did I think, that <hi>My Lord had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, and my God had forgotten me.</hi> But O!

What reaſon have I to praiſe the Lamb for ever and ever: For he is a forgiving God, he heals all my Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings, and loves me freely, not for any Thing in me, but for his own Name's ſake. The laſt Night the Lord ſtood in the midſt of us, and ſpake Peace to many that were troubled.

            <p>I Write theſe few Lines to you, that you may know, that I am very well in Health, as I hope you are alſo. I lived in this Houſe of Mercy four Years, and the Lord was pleaſed to let me know what a miſerable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I was, and he made me able to wait upon him. It is nothing but Free Grace in Chriſt, and not for any Thing we can do, but for his Names Sake, that he ſhould look upon ſuch rebellious Worms of the Duſt as we are.

Dear Sir, I long to ſee you once in the Body; but if not we ſhall all (I truſt) meet you in Heaven, ſinging Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah! No more at preſent, this is from</p>

I have had in hearing your Letters to our dear Mr. <hi>Barber,</hi> namely the Night after they came to Hand. Mr. <hi>Barber</hi> thought of reading that Paſſage you ſent to the Children in Publick, accordingly he did: He firſt began at the Beginning, and read ſome Way; he was ſoon fill'd with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from on High, and enabled from thoſe Texts of Scriptures; that were in your ſweet Letter, to ſpeak largely to them that were preſent; both the Converted and unconverted.</p>
            <p>But O how was my Soul filled with the Love of Jeſus Chriſt! I long'd for all poor Sinners to come to Chriſt, Indeed my Heart was ready to burſt for them. I could do nothing but beg and pray, that Chriſt would come and get to himſelf the Victory, in the Hearts of all poor Souls amongſt us. Indeed it was a glorious Night to many Souls here, both to the Revival of many of God's dear Children, and to ſome that had <hi>ſat in Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death:</hi> Among whom was a Siſter who now writes to you, <hi>M. A.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Oh! Glory be to God, that he was pleaſed to bring her with three others that Night, and one the next Morning to lay hold of Jeſus Chriſt for their Saviour and merciful

            </p>
            <p>Dear Sir, Will not your Heart rejoyce and be glad, to hear ſuch joyous Tydings from a far Country; that the Goſpel flouriſhes in this Wilderneſs Land, that Souls are daily flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, <hi>as Doves to their Windows.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it fill'd my poor Soul with Joy and Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hear that the Goſpel runs and is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in theſe our Days in your Land. O Glory, Glory, Glory, be to his holy Name, for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt into the World to die for Sinners, of whom I am chief, that he did not ſuffer me to fall into the Pit of everlaſting Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but when he ſaw me in my Blood, ſaid unto me <hi>live.</hi> Yea, he paſſed by me and ſaid unto me <hi>live.</hi> Indeed then was a Time of Love; but O now I want an enlarg'd Heart to praiſe him more than I do: For that he hath done ſuch wonderful Things for me, and the dear Lambs of his Flock here.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, I make no doubt, but that the Lord has drawn out your Heart to pray for us, that our dear Mr. <hi>Barbar</hi> may have a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful

            <p>I Muſt tell you what the Lord has done for my Soul. No, never did I ſee ſuch a Sight, nor my Ears hear ſuch a Sound, as the laſt Night at our uſual Meeting together. Dear Mr. <hi>Barber</hi> read the Letters that you ſent him Indeed every Word he read ſeem'd to pierce as if a Sword had been run thro' me. He ſpoke firſt to thoſe that were converted laſt

Spring. O; how it cut me to hear him put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in mind of the glorious Time laſt Spring. But after he ſpake to us that were in a natural State. Oh! he intreated poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to believe on the Lord Jeſus. O indeed I thought it was all in vain: For I thought I muſt ſink down into everlaſting Burnings; for I thought Chriſt would not ſave me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God ſeem'd to be ſtirring up many; and I could not bear it; but I would caſt my ſelf at his Feet, ſeeing I deſerv'd nothing but Hell.</p>
            <p>But indeed I did not lye long there before he told me my Sins were forgiven me. O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Sir, the Lord has ſurely heard your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for us! Indeed, <hi>the Time of the ſinging of Birds is come, and the Voice of the Turtle is heard in our Land.</hi> Sweet Birds of Paradiſe indeed, chirping forth the Praiſes of the Lamb that was ſlain. Sure it's a glorious Sight that I ſaw! Five of us eſpouſed as it were at once unto the Lord Jeſus! Surely I can ſay this Verſe,
