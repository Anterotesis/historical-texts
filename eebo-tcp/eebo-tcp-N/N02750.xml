            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>OUR former Intimacy at the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Holland</hi> and Hoſpitals in <hi>Flanders,</hi> inclined me to this Addreſs. The Station which you have acquired by your Merit, being one of the higheſt which our <hi>Profeſſion</hi> admits of, I mean of being <hi>a Court Phyſician,</hi> ſeems naturally to demand it, even at this diſtance. But more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your knowledge in this Affair or Subject, obliges me to ſubmit this Practical Eſſay upon the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> to your better Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>My former Inclinations to ſeveral branches of <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> I have now contracted to that of <hi>Medical Caſes</hi>; more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003275_0004_0FF0305ED90FE0D8"/>
I continue to make Obſervations concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Endemial Diſtempers</hi> of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Climate, eſpecially of a certain Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malous ill-conditioned <hi>Autumnal Fever</hi> which ſometimes galls us much. In the Year <hi>1721.</hi> after an abſence of about twenty years, the <hi>Small Pox</hi> rendred this large and populous Town of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> a meer Hoſpital; ſuch Opportunities are ſeldom to be met with in <hi>Europe,</hi> and there being no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of ſuch another as to Numbers and Varieties in this Country in my Time; I ſecluded my ſelf from all other Company but that of my Patients during the Small Pox Illneſs, and committed to writing for my own reminiſcence and private uſe, the remarkable Small Pox Caſes which occurred in a very extenſive Practice. This laſt Summer after fifteen years abſcence, the <hi>Meaſles</hi> prevailed here, which afforded me a very extraordinary Opportunity of obſerving the Varieties which attend that Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>It is the duty of <hi>a Man,</hi> in times of any publick Calamity, to lend a helping hand, as his Station, Profeſſion or Capacity may enable him: This induced me at this time, when the <hi>Small Pox</hi> begins to annoy the Town a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003275_0005_0FF0306131F30C60"/>
to reduce into ſome Method, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations I made concerning the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in <hi>Boſton 1721.</hi> with what other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I formerly had of this Diſtemper. <hi>Obſervations</hi> reduced to Method and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy from thence is all we know or can learn in any Diſtemper. I have candidly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve imparted all that I know of this Diſeaſe, ſo far as can be reduced to writing in a ſhort Abſtract. I have by choice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome few things in the Words of ſome Celebrated Practitioners, rather than in my own. To have inſerted <hi>Formulas</hi> of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines would be trifling, they are ſoon conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where the Indications and Intentions are known. I deſigned to have interſperſed <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> of remarkable Caſes, by way of <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Illuſtrations</hi>; but the nature of an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract does not give room, and more eſpecially being recent, moſt of the Subjects alive in the place, I was afraid it might not be ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as certainly it would have been uſeful.</p>

            <head>A Practical Eſſay Concerning the Small Pox.</head>
            <p>WHERE the <hi>prima ſtamina Vitae</hi> are good, the whole Affair of <hi>Health and long Life</hi> would conſiſt in <hi>Temperance and moderate Exerciſe,</hi> were it not for ſome <hi>malignant acute Diſeaſes</hi> which have ſomething <hi>Myſterious</hi> in their Nature, invading the healthy and Vala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarians indifferently: Of thoſe ſome are <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demial,</hi> peculiar to Countries, Climates, Seaſons, and Conſtitutions of the Air; but <hi>not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> by Infection from Man to Man: Moſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries have at times <hi>Fevers</hi> of this kind, in this and the neighbouring Colonies, eſpecially in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn we are afflicted with a certain <hi>febris mali moris,</hi> not reducible to any Claſſical Name of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

deſcribed by Authors. It begins as all Fevers do with <hi>Horripulations</hi> &amp;c. has no perfect Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, but, without any more horrors, <hi>remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and exacerbations</hi> ſometimes periodical but more frequently uncertain, the Symptoms are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, being the moſt <hi>anomalous Fever</hi> that ever came to my knowledge; the moſt general Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is <hi>oppreſſio gravitativa circa cordis regionem,</hi> which the Patients expreſs by a pain at their Hearts, and in all Fevers except the Eruptive is reckoned a Symptom <hi>mali Ominis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>malignant Fevers</hi> altho' originally <hi>Ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mial</hi> or the produce of Climates Seaſons <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may by <hi>Infection</hi> be ſpread at home, and in ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the Air, may be conveyed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated in Countries abroad where they are not natives but <hi>Exoticks,</hi> and therefore cannot thrive ſo well there as in their native Soil. Thus the <hi>Plague</hi> Endemial in the <hi>Levant</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> does ſometimes get ſooting in <hi>Europe</hi> (I cannot learn that it ever viſited the <hi>American</hi> Continent) it was in <hi>London</hi> from 1602 to 1648, every Year there died a few of it, but did not ſpread except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1603, 1625 and 1636; ever ſince the Year 1665 notwithſtanding a continued Trade to the <hi>Levant,</hi> it has not taken root in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> is a Diſeaſe of a more <hi>ſingular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it is of a very uncertain Original, we know of no Country where it is a Native or <hi>Endemial,</hi> that is, where it is the produce of Seaſons, Winds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is the Plague in the <hi>Levant.</hi> It owes the continuation of its being to a <hi>variolous leaven</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable in all Countries and Seaſons, but ſome Conſtitutions of Years favour its propagation and mortality more or leſs; from the <hi>London</hi> Bills of Mortality there died there of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> 1702 only 31, in the Year 1706 died 721, in the Year

1719 dies 3229. There is another <hi>Circumſtance very ſingular</hi> in its Nature, that it never affects a Perſon oftner than once; in the <hi>Plague</hi> ſome have died in the 2d, 3d, 4th <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Seiſure, as Dr. <hi>Hod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> informs us: It is therefore an Infection eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially different from the <hi>Peſtilential,</hi> and cannot be the Effect of ſome ancient violent <hi>Plague in Egypt,</hi> as ſome Authors ſurmiſe.</p>
            <p>We are beholden to the <hi>Arabians</hi> or <hi>Saracens,</hi> not only for many <hi>Drugs and Medicines,</hi> as <hi>the Purging Rhubarb, Manna, Mercurial Unguents, the Epiſpaſtick Uſe of the Cantharides,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo for the firſt Accounts we have of ſeveral Diſeaſes, as <hi>Small Pox, Meaſles, Lepra Arabum, Spina ventoſa. Vena Medini,</hi> or <hi>Guinea Worm,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Small Pox</hi> was a Stranger in Medicine until the Time that the <hi>Arabians</hi> or <hi>Saracens</hi> ſettled in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was ſoon after <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Death. As this People in leſs than 30 Years did vaſtly propagate their <hi>Religion and Empire,</hi> ſo they did the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in a ſhort Time, and might Introduce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe</hi> by Way of <hi>Spain,</hi> where they ſettled powerful Colonies. The various <hi>Exanthemata</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Puſtulae</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> with other <hi>Eruptive Fevers</hi> mentioned by them, were no ways analagous to the <hi>Small Pox</hi>: At the Diſcovery of this Continent of <hi>America,</hi> not the leaſt Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of it was to be found.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Small Pox</hi> is an <hi>Inflammatory Fever,</hi> but with a peculiar Malignancy or Poiſon; which requires the Indications of Cure to be taken principally <hi>ae juvantibus &amp; laedentibus.</hi> Inflammations, as purely ſuch, require <hi>U. S.</hi> and the Body to be kept ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but in the <hi>Small Pox</hi> the Body ought to be bound; and Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> gives us an Inſtance of a young Man, who, notwithſtanding he had ſome ſhort Time before Seiſure been frequently let Blood

for <hi>Rheumatick</hi> Pains, had the worſt Sort of conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Small Pox</hi> he ever did ſee. In ſome Families, by a <hi>jus haereditarium,</hi> it is always very <hi>malignant,</hi> or fatal; thus Mrs. <hi>A</hi>— and her Daughter, Capt. <hi>R</hi>—'s Wife and her Child, two Children of <hi>F</hi>— a Fiſherman, two Boys at <hi>L</hi>— Couſin Germans, all died with Purples and Haemorrhages, Mr. <hi>W</hi>— and his Siſter died in the Innoculated Way: To other Families it is always favourable; Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> ſays, that he could not recollect, that any Perſon of his own or his Wife's Family ever died of the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> We find by Experience, that a <hi>confluent,</hi> or very: full Knid, does not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a more intenſe Inflammation of the Blood, or from driving by Cordials: Frequently it is in the Nature of the Perſon's <hi>Conſtitution</hi> to be ſo affected with the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> having very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a Fever, no Phrenzy, Coma, or any other violent Symptom; but meerly from a too profuſe <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003275_0010_0FF0306E41467E08"/>Moſt <hi>malignant Diſtempers</hi> have their <hi>Criſis</hi> in the Glands; the <hi>Plague</hi> in the Inguinal, Axillary, and Parotidal Glands; the <hi>Small Pox</hi> in the Miliary Glands of the Skin. The <hi>Cauſtick</hi> acrimonious Quality of the <hi>Small Pox</hi> Infection is evident from the Pittings. That this Malignity is <hi>colliquative</hi> appears by the profuſe Sweatings or Diarrhaeas in ſome, in others Salivation, Swellings of Face, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, <hi>Scroti &amp; Preputii,</hi> Diabetical <hi>Profluviums,</hi> Purples and <hi>Haemorrhages.</hi> The <hi>Small Pox</hi> ſeldom arrives to that Degree of Malignity, as to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſudden Death; there were but two Inſtances came to my Knowledge here, being both young Women, and <hi>died before Eruption,</hi> by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent <hi>Necroſis</hi> of their Spirits, intenſe <hi>Coma</hi> and <hi>Stupor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cure of a <hi>Fever</hi> in the firſt Intention is by ſome <hi>Specifick</hi> to extinguiſh it, without allowing it to come to a <hi>Criſis</hi>; becauſe <hi>Criſis's</hi> are frequently precarious: So that the Cure of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> properly ſpeaking, is ſo to manage the infecting <hi>Miaſma</hi> in the firſt Period or <hi>Apparatus</hi> of the Diſeaſe, that it ſhall not come to <hi>Eruption,</hi> i. e. Suppuration, with a tedious Train of Symptoms; thus if a Prickle or Splinter is lodged in the Finger, the proper direct Cure is <hi>Extraction,</hi> whereby Suppuration, Ulceration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are prevented. If we could find an Antidote to deſtroy the <hi>Small Pox</hi> Infection in <hi>Embrio,</hi> it would be a genuine <hi>ſpecifick</hi> Cure; we cannot ſay it is impoſſible, but hitherto it is not diſcovered to Mankind; may it be the Happineſs of future Ages.</p>
            <p>Next to a ſpecifick Cure, would be <hi>a Method to alleviate</hi> the <hi>Criſis,</hi> as to the Quantity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leterious Nature of the Inflammations and Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. The <hi>Circaſſian</hi> Method of procuring the <hi>Small Pox</hi> by <hi>variolous Pus,</hi> applied externally to

freſh cutaneous Inciſions, lately introduced in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>New England,</hi> ſeems to bid the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for this; but it is not an abſolute certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt a bad Sort. Much of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is what Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Haverfordweſt,</hi> ſays, has been an imimemorial Cuſtom in ſome Parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> called, <hi>buying of the Small Pox.</hi> The Perſon procures a few <hi>freſh Pocky Scabs,</hi> and holds them in the Hollow of the Hand a conſiderable Time; about 10 or 12 Days thereafter the Perſon ſickens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An old Midwife, <hi>Jane Jones,</hi> aged 70, told him, that ſhe knew it practiſed at Times above 50 Years, and knows but one dying of the Diſtemper ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. Conſidering the Caſes of ſeveral of my Patients who had at the Time <hi>Iſſues,</hi> I was very inclinable to think, that by their Vent they did contribute towards alleviating the Diſtemper, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in <hi>Children</hi> abounding with <hi>groſs Humours,</hi> or Faeculencies. <hi>Mercurialis</hi> ſays that he obſerv'd few to die of the <hi>Plague</hi> who ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What is commonly called, <hi>the Cure of the Small Pox</hi> at preſent, is only from the Experience of the <hi>juvantia &amp; laedentia,</hi> to prevent, alleviate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the various diſturbing <hi>Symptoms</hi> in the ſeveral Periods of this Diſeaſe. Formerly Practitioners were zealouſly bigotted, ſome to a <hi>cool Regimen,</hi> others to a <hi>hot Method,</hi> reckoning the oppoſite Practice of pernicious Conſequence. That the Patient ought to be kept in a <hi>moderate natural Temper</hi> as near as can be, we learn from Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. We find that Nature performs her Office beſt in a moderate Seaſon; Heat diſſipates, and Cold depreſſes the Spirits too much.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>cool Regimen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> ever to be celebrated for his Diligence in obſerving, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in communicating, was a great Stickler, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the former Years of his Practice, and has
<pb n="7"
                   facs="unknown:003275_0012_0FF03072E6E4C1B0"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
been much blamed on that Head; but after more Years Experience, he was not ſo rigorous in this Method; and ſays, that after the <hi>Eruption com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated,</hi> the Patient ought to be kept <hi>cloſe a-bed,</hi> not ſo much as to expoſe an Arm or Hand, that by the agreeable and mild Heat of the Bed, the Plumpneſs of the <hi>Puſtules</hi> may be kept up, as alſo the Swellings of Face and Hands. He conſidered it chiefly as an <hi>Inflammatory Diſeaſe,</hi> and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Confluent,</hi> and other Bad Kinds, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Fever aſſimulating and expelling of too much <hi>varioloſe</hi> Matter. I never obſerv'd any Benefit, but frequently Hurt, by expoſing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients to the <hi>Air colder</hi> than the natural Temper of the Body required. I remember ſome Caſes, where in the Eruption being <hi>expoſed to the Cold,</hi> it was <hi>check'd</hi> for ſome Time; but ſoon after follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>ſecond Crop</hi> generally mortal We find by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that <hi>Intermitting Fevers,</hi> and ſuch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ones as are allied to them, are <hi>protracted</hi> by a cold Regimen. In other Diſeaſes we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Coolers ſo retard</hi> the Circulation, that there may ariſe a Sort of Ferment from Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and inſtead of allaying Heat, may change a <hi>ſimple Inflammatory Fever,</hi> diſpoſed to a <hi>Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſis,</hi> into a <hi>putrid</hi> and malignant one. In the <hi>Small Pox</hi> the more <hi>perſpirable</hi> the Body, (I do not mean Sweating, which is a Colliquation) the better; thus we find, the Face, Neck, Arms and Hands, being continually expoſed to the Air, are <hi>indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> and ſuffer moſt from the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> Extreme <hi>cold</hi> Weather is bad in all <hi>Eruptive Fevers</hi>: In 1713, the <hi>Meaſles</hi> raged here in the <hi>Winter,</hi> and there died about 150 Perſons; in 1729, it prevailed in the <hi>Summer,</hi> and there died only about 15.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Hot Regimen,</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that ſome Part of the <hi>Virulency remaining
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003275_0013_0FF030746F6E1318"/>
not protruded</hi> to the Surface of the Body, was the Reaſon of the <hi>Lucta,</hi> and Fever, and other Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſtill continuing; and that this <hi>Languor</hi> of Nature <hi>protracts</hi> the Periods of Maturation and Deſquammation to many Days; and therefore, the more malignant, the more generous <hi>Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks</hi> are by them adminiſtred; thus by a <hi>hot Method,</hi> they inadvertently conſpire with a moſt inflammatory Diſtemper to kill the Patient; the formerly received Notion of <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> being <hi>Antidotes</hi> to Malignity, has by a dangerous vulgar Error, in violent <hi>inflammatory Caſes,</hi> ſent many prematurely to their cold Graves. I obſerv'd in the moſt malignant <hi>Small Pox</hi> with Purples and Haemorrhages, they immediately and moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly multiplied theſe Symptoms, and ſoon procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an <hi>Exit. E.

Capt. <hi>B</hi>—'s Child, <hi>aet.</hi> 8, having Purples, by this Method, the <hi>Blood was forced thro' the Pores</hi> of the Skin under the Noſe, on the Lips, and Corners of the Eyes; with many others I could mention. <hi>Cordial Spirits and Volatiles</hi> in all Fevers puſh Nature <hi>precipitately</hi> to a <hi>Criſis,</hi> and beſides other Inconveniencies, their natural Tendency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Brain,</hi> they ſolicite along with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Violence of the Diſeaſe, occaſioning <hi>Phrenzies, Delirias, Comas,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to inſert here the <hi>general Methods of Cure</hi> which have been uſed by the moſt celebrated Practitioners. Dr. <hi>Sydenham,</hi> by a cool Regimen, by acidulating all their Drinks with <hi>Sp. Vitriol.</hi> which he calls a Specifick in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and by Paragoricks at Night, managed his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients. Dr. <hi>Pitcairn</hi> lets Blood where there is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003275_0014_0FF030770241E180"/>
much of a Fever, and repeats it even after Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the Fever continues; if the Puſtules ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide too early, he lets Blood and bliſters; he gives any ſimple Water in which Sheeps Dung is infuſed cold, and for common Drink Barley Water and Watergruel; in the Confluent Kind, towards the End, he opens the Body. Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> drives all before him with his Alexipharmicks or hot Method. D. <hi>Friend</hi> has very much obliged the World by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending early Purging in the Declenſion in ſeveral Caſes.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>accidental Contagion,</hi> from Infection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to Sickening, are 18 to 21 Days; from Obſervations which I made in ſeveral Families; and as to the Town in general, we may recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that about the Middle of <hi>June,</hi> 1721, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions appearing in many Houſes, the Watches which had been appointed to prevent its Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003275_0015_0FF0307A958BB770"/>
were diſcontinued; in the next Parcel of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents, the Eruptions appeared about the 7th and 8th of <hi>July</hi>; and in the End of <hi>July,</hi> and Beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it ſpread much. The Change and Full of the <hi>Moon</hi> may more or leſs <hi>diſpoſe</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to receive the Infection; but Sickening and Eruptions do happen in all Times of the Moon: In Southerly cloſe Weather the Infection is moſt ſuſceptible. In the <hi>Small Pox received by Inciſion</hi> the Patient ſickens the 5th 6th or 7th Day, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1, 2, 3, or ſometimes 4 Days, the Eruptions begin.</p>
               <p>There are <hi>vaſt Varieties of the genuine</hi> Small Pox; but in general, <hi>the ſooner</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Stadia</hi> are accompliſhed, the <hi>more benign</hi>; and moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the <hi>Danger</hi> is in Proportion to the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Puſtules</hi>: There are ſome Exceptions were a Diſtinct Sort has been very malignant, and even attended with Purples, Mr. <hi>F </hi>—'s <hi>Indian Peter,</hi> &amp;c. From the Quantity and Nature of the <hi>Puſtules in the Face</hi> we generally judge of the more or leſs <hi>Violence</hi> of the Diſtemper. <hi>H.

               <p>To form <hi>a general Idea of this Diſtemper,</hi> we muſt take the <hi>diſtinct plump Kind as a Standard.</hi> It may be deſcribed thus; begins with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Symptoms of a Fever, but more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is attended with <hi>Pain in the Head, Back and Loins, and about the Region of the Stomach, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes, Sore Throat. Vomitings, Doſedneſs, Startings, and in Children ſometimes Convulſions. The End of the</hi> 3<hi>d, or Beginning of the</hi> 4<hi>th Day, the Small Pox Puſtules begin to appear diſtinct</hi>; 5<hi>th they grow round and enlarge their Baſes of a lively red,</hi> 6<hi>th Day they come to a Point,</hi> 7<hi>th the Points or Apices turn white,</hi> 8<hi>th they turn yellow,</hi> 9<hi>th they are full of lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable

digeſted Pus,</hi> 10<hi>th they begin to cruſt or ſcab,</hi> 12<hi>th they are dry Scabs, and Appetite returned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may comprehend all the <hi>Varieties of</hi> Small Pox under theſe. 1. <hi>A diſtinct dry Sort,</hi> being the moſt favourable of all; yet ſometimes with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Apparatus Symptoms; they are few, not large, Baſes ſcarce inflamed, ſmall Digeſtion, being hard with a little white Point; 5th or 6th Day from Eruption they begin to dry away, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually vaniſh, leaving only a Freckle behind them, but no Redneſs; I have ſeen <hi>Indians</hi> with this Kind. 2. <hi>A diſtinct plump Kind,</hi> already deſcribed as the Standard. 3. <hi>The Cohaerent,</hi> or ſmall fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Sort; they are not exactly round, pointed and vivid; but ſeſſile and depreſſed, the Symptoms do not intirely ceaſe upon Eruption, but after ſome Time they intermit until the <hi>Stadium</hi> of Maturation, then ariſes a Fever, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 4. <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent,</hi> they appear ſooner than the 4th Day, or are retarded by ſome violent Symptom later; their firſt Appearance is frequently <hi>Eriſypilas</hi> like, and and at laſt appear of on Aſh-coloured Cruſt or white Skin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. To theſe add the Small Pox with interſperſed <hi>Petechiae</hi> brown or red, with <hi>Veſiculae miliares,</hi> or ſmall Bliſters full of a limpid or bluiſh Serum, and with <hi>Purple Spots</hi> from the black to the more diluted Purples, and Haemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which are more mortal than the Plague it ſef.</p>
               <p>Some general <hi>Directions</hi> for the <hi>Regimen in the Courſe of the Small Pox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Let not Numbers be pent up in one Room,</hi> which can ſcarce contain Air enough for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance of Health in one ſingle Perſon, eſpecially if kept from Communication with the free exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Air; for the <hi>Spring</hi> of the inſpired <hi>Air</hi> is the continued Cauſe of the <hi>Circulation</hi> in our Bodies. 2. <hi>Where the Deſign of Nature is obvious, and her Intentions right, we ought not to diſturb Nature by Medicines.</hi> 3. In this or any other acute Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Nature or the <hi>Spirits ought not to be diſturb'd by Noiſe or Confabulation.</hi> 4. Where Medicines are required, we are <hi>not to inſiſt on any Medicine that continues to be diſagreeable to the Stomach.</hi> 5. In this Diſtemper <hi>any violent Symptom appearing muſt be immediately obviated</hi>; Delays here are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: But we are to expect in this as in moſt other acute Diſtempers, that the Symptoms ſhould have a Sort of Exacerbation towards Night. 6. <hi>Let not your Mixtures be too much compounded,</hi> that you may be the more certain of the Effects of the ſeveral Ingredients. 7. <hi>The Belly is not to be kept ſoluble.</hi> It is obſerv'd by every Body, that in the Small Pox (Dr. <hi>Friend</hi>'s Caſes excepted) Opening of the Body by Catharticks, however mild, confounds the Courſe of Nature, and gives the <hi>Small Pox</hi> Fever a Determination to the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of bad Conſequence: The Body ſometimes bound up for two Weeks, without any Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency only the Pain of a labouring Stool at laſt, ſhows that this Diſtemper does not allow of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's being diſturb'd in her Office: If there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens in any of the <hi>Stadiums</hi> any undue Evacuation or Colliquation, uſe moderate Aſtringents, Opiats, and mild Cordials. 8. <hi>Avoid Grief, Study, intenſe Thinking, and the like</hi>; they hinder Perſpiration, and all other Tendencies to the Surface or <hi>ad extra</hi> of the Body.</p>
               <p>In the malignant Kinds, a Fever accompanies all the <hi>Stadia</hi>; the <hi>Abſence or Preſence of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the three laſt Stadia, Diliria, Vigilae, Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por profundus, Subſultus tendinum, are always prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003275_0018_0FF03082D3A1CD78"/>
Indications of Safety or Danger.</hi> In this, as in all acute Diſeaſes, we ought to <hi>obſerve the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's Pulſe, Tongue, Urine, Breathing,</hi> as alſo the Eyes, Temper of the Skin, and Poſture of laving. The beſt <hi>Pulſe</hi> is the ſtrong, full, equal, and ſlow; the nearer it approaches theſe the better. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Continuation of the Membrane which inveſts the <hi>Tongue,</hi> with that of the Stomach and Inteſtines, Phyſicians judge of the inward Temper of the Body by the Aſpect of the <hi>Tongue.</hi> In all Eruptive Fevers, the <hi>Urine</hi> ſettles from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; <hi>Urine</hi> pretty high coloured with Contents is beſt, thin clear and pale is bad; where Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions follow a laudable Sediment Nature is in Danger; large Quantity of <hi>Urine,</hi> eſpecially if without any conſiderable Thirſt, is always a good Symptom. <hi>Reſpiration</hi> is moſt to be attended to of all Symptoms; juſt upon the <hi>Criſis</hi> it may be <hi>magna &amp; celeris,</hi> and yet ſalutary.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> is much extolled from introducing <hi>Opiats</hi> into the Management of this Diſtemper. Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> ſays, without the Uſe of <hi>Laudanum</hi> not much is to be done in the Cure of the <hi>Small Pox.</hi> It is certain that Inquietudes, Watchings, Deliria and the like, ſo exhauſt the Spirits in this Diſtemper, that they make the Uſe of <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes</hi> unavoidable. <hi>Opiats</hi> relax the Skin, and give a proper Determination <hi>ad extra; Laudanum</hi> in that Sort of Small Pox which is accompanied with a Salivation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concocts the Spittle, and promotes the Swelling of the Face and Hands. Diſcretion however is required in their Uſe; for where the Blood is languid, they leave the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient more languid and faint, Tongues drier, Pulſe weaker, gravitative Headakes, and the like: The indifferent Uſe of <hi>Narcoticks</hi> fix the faeculent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and occaſion <hi>Pittings and Scars.</hi> The <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003275_0019_0FF030854F47F4F0"/>
ought to ſupyly the Place of <hi>Opiats</hi> in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for they moderate the inordinate Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood more kindly and ſalutarily.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veſicatories</hi> by their <hi>Stimulus</hi> increaſe the Oſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all the Fibres, and ſqueeze out the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Contents. In <hi>Comatoes</hi> Caſes the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> without <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> do not rouſe the Spirits. <hi>Epiſpaſticks,</hi> by their <hi>Stimulus,</hi> not only attenuate and derive the Humour to the Parts, but alſo diſcharge them: Tranſlations of morbid Matter from one Part to another, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the greateſt Service, eſpecially where it has a Diſcharge: All critical Evacuations are of this Nature. When Symptoms threaten the <hi>Brain, Veſicatories</hi> are of excellent Uſe, not neglecting <hi>ſuppedanea irritantia, live Animals,</hi> and the like, to the Soles of the Feet.</p>
               <p>Let the Patient drink plentifully of diluting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; for there is ſomething <hi>Cauſtick</hi> and acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious in the Infection. <hi>Herb Teas</hi> much uſed In this Country, I cannot recommend; they ſeem to waſh away that ſoft mellow Moiſture of the Mouth and Throat, and do frequently rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion than alleviate Thirſt: The more mellow Diluents I always found to anſwer better, as <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Water, thin Water Gruel, Sack Whey, Vin.

               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Preſervatives</hi> againſt the <hi>Small Pox</hi> Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we know of none really ſuch, excepting <hi>Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

               <p>In <hi>Eruptive Fevers</hi> (in other Fevers ſuch Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms only happen towards their fatal End) the <hi>Apparatus Symptoms</hi> are moſtly <hi>nervoſi generis,</hi> viz. <hi>Oppreſſion at the Breaſt, Aſthmatick Breathings, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings, Deliria, Comas, Lumbagos, tendinum Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultus, Inſultus Epileptici</hi> in Children.

               <p>Where the Symptoms are any ways conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let the Patient immediately upon Seizure be <hi>put to Bed,</hi> but not with too many Cloaths. The Temper is not to be <hi>lowered</hi> too much by catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The Blood may be thus ſo harraſſed as not to allow of any regular Separation, but occaſion an <hi>Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelas</hi> like, or very unequal, or tardive Sort, which are the worſt Kinds. <hi>Emollient Cataplaſms,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Children, to the Feet, have been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved manifeſtly to alleviate the Symptoms, and ſometimes to ſollicite the <hi>variolous</hi> Matter more plentifully that Way, to the Relief of the other Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Blood letting</hi> in the Beginning, without any Exception, would be always uſeful, if the <hi>Small Pox</hi> were a ſimple inflammatory Caſe, and not complicated with ſome deleterious <hi>Miaſma,</hi> which requires Strength of Nature to ſubſiſt under.

                  <hi>The End of the</hi> 3<hi>d or Beginning of the</hi> 4<hi>th Day the beſt Sort appeared with us,</hi> An. 1721; ſo much as the Eruption anteverts the 4th Day, or is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded beyond it, ſo much greater the Danger; either from the Violence of the Fever, or hot Regimen, in the firſt Cafe; for the more violent and haſty any Inflammation is in its Courſe, the Danger of a ſubſequent Gangrene is the more to be apprehended. Dr. <hi>Huxham</hi> ſays, that <hi>An.</hi> 1724, 1725, there was in <hi>Plymouth</hi> an anomalous <hi>Small Pox,</hi> that appeared in leſs than 24 Hours after Seizure, and was always of the fluxed Kind: The other Caſe of being retarded, is from a too cool Regimen, officious Bleeding, catching cold, or ſome conſiderable Evacuation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The more univerſal the Appearance is at firſt,</hi> the more perfect and more benign is the <hi>Criſis</hi>; the more gradual, eſpecially with new Sprouts in the Interſtices, the more imperfect is the Criſis, and the Diſtemper is the more malignant. <hi>F.

                  <hi>W. W</hi>— aet. 25, violent Pain at his Stomach, and dull, was <hi>U.

Mr. <hi>H—r,</hi> aet. 30, a few Purples, with <hi>Haemorrhagia narium,</hi> the Pox in his Face had the regular Courſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluent Kind, but in his Extremities, at the Time of his Death, being 14th of Seizure, the Puſtules had ſcarce begun to maturate. Mrs. <hi>Y</hi>— aet. 20, juſt having given over Suckling, violent Pain in her Back, and Reachings, was brought from an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Iſland to <hi>Boſton,</hi> 2d of Seizure ſome Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Small Pox,</hi> and after 3 or 4 Days more a Sort of ſecond Crop, reddiſh, with ſome watery Bliſters interſperſed, ſhe did not ſpit, a continued <hi>Nauſea</hi> and <hi>Delirium,</hi> died 16th of Seizure. <hi>B.

               <p>The Eruptions appearing in the <hi>Extremities</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they appear in the <hi>Face,</hi> preſage ill, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Purple Caſes, being from a ſtifled Fever; for the Circulation being freer in the Extremities, the Eruptions come out there more kindly.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Upon the Eruption the <hi>Throat complains.</hi> The <hi>Ptyaliſm</hi> begins with the Eruption.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Chriſtalline Small Pox</hi> is a Colliquation, and therefore not good. <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> with a very hot Temper preſage a confluent Sort. The <hi>Confluent</hi> Sort appear ſooner than the 4th Day, or by ſome violent Symptom are retarded until after the 4th Day; the Symptoms continue after Eruption; they make their firſt Appearance <hi>Eryſipelas</hi> like.</p>

               <p>In the <hi>Winter Small Pox,</hi> Coughs, and Sore Throats, are great Complaints; they occaſion Want of Reſt, and Sleep, and exhauſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; therefore if very troubleſome, give <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes</hi> with Diſcretion, and a light <hi>Pectoral</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction for their common Drink; guard the Chops with Flannels.</p>

               <p>After 3 Days Inflammation the <hi>Puſtules begin to digeſt</hi>; where the Eruption was protracted, in the ſame Manner the Digeſtion is <hi>protracted</hi>; firſt in the Face and Neck, afterwards gradually in the Trunk and Extremities, the lower Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities being laſt: The Duration of the Period of <hi>Maturation</hi> in bad Kinds is very uncertain, (it is reckoned to continue until the Declenſion begins) eſpecially when accompanyed with a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livation, and Swellings, and may be protracted to 10 or 12 Days, the longer always the worſe: Where Nature is very low, and no <hi>Succedaneum</hi> happens, the Fever and other bad Symptoms may continue to the 18th Day before there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Maturation.</p>
               <p>A <hi>round, florid, and turgid Pox</hi> is the Standard of Goodneſs.

               <p>Frequently the Puſtules ripening inflame the whole Habit, and occaſion Inquietudes; the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient becomes hotter, and Pulſe higher, which diſturb Nature in her Courſe; this is called the Second, or <hi>Maturation Fever</hi>: Here <hi>Paragoricks</hi> (beginning the 6th Day) are as much a Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick as the <hi>Cortex Peruv.</hi> in Intermittents.

                  <hi>Purple Spots</hi> appear in the <hi>Apparatus</hi> and Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Periods, the <hi>Petechiae</hi> generally appear late; both diſcover themſelves firſt on the Breaſt, Neck, and Arms. <hi>Miliary Bliſters</hi> and <hi>Petechiae,</hi> their Increaſe in Number of Dimenſions portend ill, their Decreaſe are ſomewhat promiſing, being Signs of a more or leſs Intenſeneſs of the <hi>Cauſtick</hi> Affection, ſome few recovered; with <hi>Purple Spots</hi> and <hi>Haemorrhages</hi> ſcarce any ſurviv'd; the three Caſes that came to my Knowledge were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſuch in the Nature of the Diſtemper; Mr. <hi>D</hi>—'s <hi>Indian</hi> Boy, <hi>aet.</hi> 13, with a confluent Kind, his few and ſmall pale Spots, conſidering the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Complexion, are rather to be reckoned <hi>Pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae; I. C</hi>— aet. 19, confluent Small Pox, his few Purples were the Effects of violent Exerciſe juſt before Decumbiture; Capt: <hi>T</hi>—'s <hi>Negroe</hi> Man's bloody Urine was from a Blow croſs the Loins ſome ſhort Time before, he had the Confluent Sort. Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> gives an Inſtance of a Patient of Dr. <hi>Goodale</hi>'s, <hi>An.</hi> 1691, in a continued (but not Small Pox) Fever with browniſh Spots on his Neck, Breaſt, and Arms, attended with bloody Urine, cured; which he reckons a Prodigy in Medicine, and the greateſt Cure he ever did know. Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> never knew but one recover, a Patient of Dr. <hi>Slare</hi>'s, in <hi>July,</hi> 1692, a ſanguine Woman, <hi>aet.</hi> 20, with a few <hi>Petechiae</hi> and bloody Urine, by Spitting, and a very unuſual Swelling

of Face and Hands ſaved. Dr. <hi>Huxham</hi> ſays, that in the malignant Small Pox at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> An. 1724, 1725, he knew but one Perſon that ſurviv'd Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Spots; ſome died 5th or 6th Day, ſome dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled till the 10th or 11th Day; he heard of none who had bloody Urine.</p>
               <p>Some Families Blood is more apt to be fuſed by the Small Pox Infection than others, as I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced before. Purple and black Spots are <hi>Indices</hi> of a begun Mortification; the cadaverous Stench of the Breath and Stools in many of them, is a plain Sign of an inward Gangrenous Diſpoſition: <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages</hi> declare the Conſiſtance of the Blood and Texture of the Solids diſſolved. The Degrees of <hi>Spots</hi> are, black the moſt malignant, purple, blue, red, brown, dusky, with their greater or ſmaller Dimenſions. Purple Spots, if they increaſe in Numbers or Dimenſions, denunciate ſome impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Haemorrhage, and ſoon after the Cataſtrophe. <hi>E. G</hi>— aet. 18, by generous Alexipharmicks his Purples increaſed to Millions, ſoon after bloody Stools, and dies next Day.</p>
               <p>Some few have miliary Bliſters or Purple Spots, with a large diſtinct crude Kind <hi>mali moris</hi>; Mr. <hi>F</hi>—'s <hi>Indian,</hi> aet. 25; Mr. <hi>C</hi>—'s <hi>Indian,</hi> aet. 15, they died the 14th Day.</p>
               <p>Purples have generally a ſtrangled Countenance, and an <hi>Eriſypelas</hi> like Small Pox, eſpecially if Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages are to follow, frequently a profuſe Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The Symptoms in the moſt intenſe Kind of Purples, are only <hi>Suſpiria,</hi> and great Dejection of Spirits, without any violent Symptom. Capt. <hi>C</hi>—'s <hi>Indian</hi> Woman, <hi>aet.</hi> 45, had the firſt Day <hi>Eriſypelas</hi> like Eruptions in Arms and Hands, dies the 3d Day with Purples, bloody Stools, bloody Spittle, and vomiting Blood, The milder Sort are attended with ſpaſmodick Pains in the Breaſt, Back, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

By <hi>U. S.</hi> and a cool Regimen (Milk and Water for their Drink) I protracted the Lives of ſome to the 14th Day.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1721, we had in <hi>Boſton</hi> 5989 ill of the <hi>Small Pox,</hi> whereof died 844; of theſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of 80 (that is 1 in 10) died with Purple Spots and Haemorrhages, whereof 65 came to my Knowledge (not including <hi>I.

The Varieties of their Caſes at length cannot be inſerted in an Abſtract, but for the Contemplation of the curious I ſhall reduce them thus; Of White Perſons died 16 Men, 24 Women, 18 Children, (all under 14 <hi>aet.</hi> I call Children) 7 <hi>Indians,</hi> no <hi>Negroes</hi>; of the Women 7 were <hi>preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> whereof 3 at their full Time were brought to Bed, 3 ſuffered Abortion at 5 or 6 Months; 1. Mrs. <hi>L.</hi> 5 or 6 Months gone with Child, had a confluent Sort with a few Spots, and in the Beginning of Maturation a violent Haemorrhage at the Noſe, dies the 17th without <hi>Proflavium</hi> or Abortion.</p>
               <p>In theſe 65 Caſes, 20 had Purples only without Haemorrhages; one <hi>D. I.</hi> aet. 15, had no Purples, but Spittle and Urine dilutely tinctur'd with Blood; the 44 following, beſides <hi>Purples had Haemorrhages,</hi> viz. bloody Urine 6, <hi>Profluvium</hi> (I mean <hi>mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>) 5, bloody Spittle 11, Haemorrhage at the Noſe 2, bloody Stools 1, Urine and Spittle 1, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Stools and Spittle 1, Urine Spittle and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvium</hi> 1, Urine and at the Noſe Spittle and Stools 1, <hi>Profluvium</hi> and at the Noſe 1, <hi>Profluvium</hi> and Spittle 2, Stools and at the Noſe 2, Stools and

Spittle 3, Stools and Vomiting 3, Stools Spittle and Vomiting 1, Vomiting and by the Pores of the Skin under the Noſe, and at the Corners of the Eyes 1, at the Gums and Mouth 1, Mrs. <hi>W.</hi>'s <hi>Indian</hi> Woman, 6th of Illneſs ſuddenly ſeized with all Sorts of Haemorrhages, ſoon dies wallowing in her Blood.</p>
               <p>Theſe 65 died at various Periods, reckoning from the Beginning of their Illneſs. With <hi>Purples only,</hi> dies fourth Day of Illneſs 2, fifth <hi>Day</hi> 5, ſixth Day 1, ſeventh Day 1, ninth Day 4, eleventh Day 2, fourteenth Day 3, ſeventeenth Day 2. With <hi>Haemorrhages only,</hi> the eighth Day 1: With <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Haemorrhages,</hi> the third Day dies 1, fourth Day 6, fifth Day 6, ſixth Day 12, ſeventh Day 6, ninth Day 5, tenth Day 1, eleventh Day 1, twelfth Day 1, thirteenth Day 2, fourteenth Day 2, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth Day 1, being only a Haemorrhage at the Noſe, which did not continue:</p>
               <p>Hence we may learn that no <hi>Ages nor Sex</hi> are exempted from Purples and Haemorrhages. Mrs. <hi>C.</hi> was 60 <hi>aet.</hi> Capt. <hi>C.</hi>'s Child 6 Months old. 2. Of the various Races or Species of Mankind, if we may ſo expreſs it, the <hi>American Indians</hi> are the moſt liable to them, and the <hi>African Negroes</hi> the leaſt; altho' in the Year 1721 our <hi>Negroe</hi> Slaves were ten Times the Number of our <hi>Indian,</hi> (the Province having diſcouraged the Importation of <hi>Spaniſh Indians,</hi> becauſe of their valetudinary ſtate of Health) there died 7 <hi>Indians,</hi> but not one <hi>Negroe</hi> with theſe diſmal Symptoms. 3. <hi>Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Women</hi> are in ſome Danger of Purples and Haemorrhages.</p>
