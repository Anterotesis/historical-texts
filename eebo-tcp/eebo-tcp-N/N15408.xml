            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Cool Thoughts on the SUBJECT of the BANK. Addreſſed to the Honorable the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Freemen of the Commonwealth of Pennſylvania in General Aſſembly.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH a great deal has been wrote on the ſubject of the Bank, which has engroſſed much of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics of the State, and no ſmall ſhare of the converſation of the town; and although an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Gentleman, who is a great ſtockholder, and, therefore, very naturally, a great champion for the Bank in the Houſe of Aſſembly, has ſaid, that he imagines "ſufficient light has been thrown upon the ſubject," yet I cannot help thinking that there is ſtill room to ſay ſomething upon it, and that without going "the old ground over again."</p>
            <p>It would be ungenerous, and unworthy the character of that Gentleman, to ſuppoſe that he entertained a wiſh to ſtifle any further enquiry, in order to bring the Members to an immediate deciſion upon that ſubject. But as one of the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:019583_0002_0FAC5BBEB586BA70"/>
writers in favor of the Bank has been candid enough to acknowledge, that "the <hi>directors</hi> were engaged in a buſineſs in which they had no experience (nothing of the kind having ever before been practiſed in America) and though they acted with the greateſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, care and caution poſſible; yet all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, 'tis hardly ſuppoſable but ſome <hi>errors in management muſt have been committed."</hi> I ſay, if this has been the caſe, there is nothing preſumptuous in ſuppoſing, that there may be ſome very worthy and reputable Members, who are very deſerving, and very well qualified to fill the ſeat which they hold in that honorable Houſe, who nevertheleſs may wiſh for further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on this ſubject; their thoughts and attention having been employed another way.</p>
            <p>In what I have to offer on this ſubject it is not my intention to run out into a laboured pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric on the utility and importance of Public Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to a nation, as ſome of the writers in favor of the Bank have done; though I am as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of both as any of them. My reaſon for declining it is, becauſe the Bank is a thing that has very little to do with it.</p>
            <p>Public Credit entirely depends upon the faith kept by the Government with the Public, in the ſtrict and punctual diſcharge of her pecuniary obligations.</p>
            <p>The Bank is a private trading company, principally in the hands of four or five perſons; who, it is true, have their own private credit to ſupport, but at preſent they have no connection whatſoever with the credit of the Government.</p>
            <p>Neither is it my intention to go into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the powers of Government and of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:019583_0003_0FAC5BBF7585ACE8"/>
the Aſſembly to give or to take away charters of incorporation, highly lucrative to private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals; whereby the ſituation of Government is given to thoſe individuals, not only without any adequate conſideration, but without any conſideration at all.</p>
            <p>I purpoſely omit going into this inveſtigation, becauſe, if I ſhould be able to prove that one Aſſembly had not power to repeal a law which a former one had imprudently paſſed, this might be proving too much; becauſe it might be made uſe of to prove, that a future Aſſembly had no power to alter what a former one had repealed.</p>
            <p>Setting aſide theſe topics, therefore, I mean to confine myſelf to a very few points; and the point I mean chiefly to inſiſt on is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how far the conſtitution of the Bank is conſiſtent with the Government and with the preſent ſtate of trade and commerce in this country.</p>
            <p>This is a ſubject that has been but lightly if at all touched upon, and in the purſuit of it I mean to be as candid and as impartial as poſſible. I ſhall carefully avoid all perſonalities, and as I profeſs to be of no party, having the ſupreme felicity of being friends with all, I ſhall as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid all party diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>And firſt then, with regard to the queſtion, how far the conſtitution of the Bank is conſiſtent with the Government. In order to determine this queſtion, it is neceſſary to draw a parallel betwixt them.</p>
            <p>The conſtitution of this country, and of this State in particular, is well known to be Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican. The Members of the Aſſembly are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:019583_0004_0FAC5BC0341632B0"/>
annually, by the freemen thereof, but no member is eligible to ſerve for more than four years in ſeven, nor has any inhabitant, let his property be ever ſo great, more than one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual vote.</p>
            <p>The directors of the Bank are few in number, only twelve. It is true, they are choſen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, but every proprietor has as many votes as he has ſhares. Hence a few great ſtockhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have the power of perpetuating their own election, and that of their friends. Nor is there any proviſion made for a change or ſucceſſion, by way of rotation. It is not in any reſpect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Government. Here, therefore, is not only a monopoly, but an ariſtocracy, formed of a moſt formidable kind, a monopoly which, by the acquiſition of the ſanction of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will be capable of abſorbing all the wealth of the United States. And, as wealth creates influence, it is impoſſible to tell how far their influence may extend. So much for the conſtitution of the Bank.</p>
            <p>Now with regard to the ſecond queſtion, <abbr>viz.</abbr> How far the preſent Bank is conſiſtent with the preſent ſtate of trade and commerce in this country, it may be neceſſary to take a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wider range, in order to inquire into the ſtate and condition of other Banks that have been inſtituted in Europe.</p>
            <p>If we look abroad, we find the four moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and moſt conſiderable Banks to be thoſe of Amſterdam, Venice, Hamburgh and Genoa. The three firſt of which are all in the hands and, conſequently, in the intereſt of their reſpective Governments. The Bank of Genoa was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Machiavel, in his hiſtory of Florence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019583_0005_0FAC5BC0F412DB38"/>
tells us, "that a war with the Venetians occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned that Government to borrow great ſums of the citizens, for the payment of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them their cuſtoms, and incorporated them into a Bank, which had the palace over the cuſtom-houſe for their meeting, they had a Council of Hundred, and a Magiſtracy or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors of Eight, and divided their credit into loqui or ſhares in ſtock, and the body thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted bore the name of St. George, as the Government had the name of the <hi>Commonalty."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Commonalty,</hi> or Commonwealth, had a further occaſion for a loan, and applied to St. George, then grown rich, and the ableſt, if not the only lender, and for that they mortgaged to it ſome lands and towns, as they had done the cuſtoms before. What was the conſequence?</p>
            <p>Machiavel tells us, that <hi>moſt of theſe towns and lands,</hi> (that were in mortgage to them) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſubject to the Genoeſe, ſubmitted to them.</hi> The Hiſtorian adds, "<hi>And they</hi> (St. George) <hi>governed and defended them,</hi> (the towns and lands) <hi>and every year, by public vote, ſent their rectors; and the Commonalty</hi> (that is the Government) <hi>of the city was no way concerned.</hi>" He goes ſtill further, "Whence," ſays he, "it came to paſs that thoſe citizens have taken away their love to the Rules of the Commonalty, as a thing uſurped and tyrannized, (though the ancient conſtitution) and placed it on St. George, as a Rule well and equally adminiſtered."</p>
            <p>I ſhould not have ſaid ſo much had not the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian in a manner compelled me to it; but now, ſince the murther is out, I cannot refrain from giving you his concluſion, "Whence," ſays he, "(that is from the Bank's adminiſtration) ariſes
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019583_0006_0FAC5BC1B57852F0"/>
the frequent and eaſy change of Government, and that ſometimes they obey a citizen, and ſometimes a ſtranger."</p>
            <p>I muſt however do our Bank the juſtice to ſay, that ſhe differs widely from the Bank of St. George at Genoa, and that in almoſt every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. When the monied men in England firſt ſolicited an eſtabliſhment of a Bank by Act of Parliament, the argument made uſe of in favour of it, was not only a preſent loan, but a great ſhow of future ſervices. But what does the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Bank of North America offer? Why ſhe inſtitutes no loan in favour of the Government. She is of a more provident and ſelfiſh nature, ſhe is willing to gain all ſhe can from the ſanction of Government, but ſhe is not willing to give her any aſſiſtance in return. On the other hand ſhe endeavours to thwart the operations of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as much as ſhe can, and inceſſantly ſets herſelf up in oppoſition to the Government.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, Among the Banks I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which are in the hands of their reſpective Governments and purſue their intereſt, there are none of them that iſſue notes payable in ſpecie to bearer upon demand. And yet, perhaps, this is the circumſtance that recommends the Bank in this city to moſt people. What is the reaſon, they do not iſſue notes payable in ſpecie? Why, the reaſon is, becauſe they have the intereſt of their country at heart.</p>
            <p>The Bank of Amſterdam is one of the oldeſt as well as one of the moſt conſiderable in Europe, having ſubſiſted now for near two centuries. She receives coin, but ſhe never pays any. There are indeed caſhiers or brokers always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending who are ever ready to exchange caſh
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:019583_0007_0FAC5BC275CAD7F0"/>
for Bank credit; and what is remarkable, is, that this Bank credit is generally upon an ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from three to five per cent. better than the ſpecie itſelf. The reaſon why this Bank never pays in ſpecie, is, becauſe ſhe knows very well, that if ſhe was to pay in coin, her country would ſoon be drained of it. England is the only country in Europe, and I believe I may ſay, in the world, where Banks can ſubſiſt iſſuing notes payable to bearer in ſpecie upon demand. What is the reaſon of it, why ſhe is the only country whoſe trade is ſo well protected by laws, that there is never a reflux, but always an influx of wealth, conſtantly coming into her. France indeed, following the example of England, has within theſe few years inſtituted a Bank, iſſuing notes payable upon demand. The Bank I mean, is the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte, or Bank of Paris. What was the conſequence? Why, let us read the following extract of a letter from Paris, bearing date the 27th of September, 1783.</p>
            <p>"The adminiſtrators of the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte having repreſented to the King, that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſcarcity of caſh in their hands, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the circumſtances of the war, which have prevented the annual and regular importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gold and ſilver, at the ſame time that ſpecie has been exported, they, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port commerce, and above all that of the city of Paris, where the ſcarcity has been particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly felt, have recurred to the reſource which Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment allowed them, in authoriſing the eſtabliſhment of the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte—That their zeal to aſſiſt commerce has induced them to diſcount ſuch bills of exchange, and good deeds on individuals, as have been preſented
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019583_0008_0FAC5BC3342AC068"/>
to them, and have paid thoſe bills of exchange in caſh, or in notes of their Bank <hi>payable to the bearer</hi>—That the confidence of the public in this Bank, has led them to augment the number of theſe notes in proportion to the wants of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; but the reſource, by which trade has been ſo greatly benefited and ſpecie thrown into circulation, being retarded in its effects, the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte will be prevented, for a time, from continuing to the public the facility of diſcount, by the impoſſibility of iſſuing ſpecie, and even if being able to give caſh for their notes, when they are preſented in too great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, unleſs proviſion is made by his Majeſty." How extremely ſimilar, in ſome reſpects, is the ſituation of America, with that of France, at the time alluded to; but further: "It does not appear, however, that any further means are wanting there until the firſt of January next, a period, when it is expected that the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of ſpecie will be re-eſtabliſhed. They therefore pray his Majeſty's protection. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof, the King ordains, that all the notes of the ſaid Bank ſhall have circulation till that time in the city of Paris, and be received in payment as before, and that no proſecutions ſhall take place on account of their non-pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Bank. At the ſame time a ſevere edict was iſſued, to prevent the exportation of gold and ſilver for a limited time."</p>
            <p>Here we ſee, in a very ſtriking manner, the bad effects of a wrong balance of trade upon a Bank paying in ſpecie, even in ſo great a kingdom, as that of France where ſpecie abounds, even though this wrong balance was but temporary. But let us proceed—</p>
            <p>"On the fourth of that ſame month a new edict
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:019583_0009_0FAC5BC3FB5AF628"/>
of the King appeared, opening a loan of twenty-four millions of livres, for which his Majeſty offered ſixty thouſand tickets of a new lottery, price four hundred livres each, which makes in all the twenty-four millions wanted. The pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers of theſe tickets, in order to favor the Bank, had the option of paying half the four hundred livres in notes iſſued by the Caiſſe d'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compte. The lottery was to be drawn during the ſpace of eight years, and the adventurers were to run no riſque, as the holders of blanks were to be allowed the principal and intereſt of their money." Here ſurely is a moſt extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſtance of Royal interpoſition in favour of a Bank. What was the conſequence?</p>
            <p>Why, notwithſtanding all this, ſo great is the effect of natural cauſes that on the firſt of October following the Bank of Paris, called the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte, ſtopt payment, which occaſioned the utmoſt conſternation and horror throughout that city.</p>
            <p>The fact is, that no Bank iſſuing notes payable in ſpecie upon demand can hold their ſtation long in any country where there is a ſtrong ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of trade againſt that country, let her be reinforced by Royal Edicts or entrenched in Charters, or let her do what ſhe will.</p>
            <p>The caſe is plain and obvious—For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that balance againſt that country to be a Million of pounds, or a Million of dollars per annum, or what you will, is it not plain that ſo much money muſt be ſent out of the country every year as that balance amounts to, in order to pay that wrong balance?</p>
            <p>But, it may be ſaid that money comes into the country every year, as well as it goes out of it. Well then, let us ſuppoſe that Half a Million is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019583_0010_0FAC5BC4B4352490"/>
imported annually. Why then the account will ſtand thus: Half a Million being imported, and a Million going out, this will juſt make Half <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Million of caſh of which the country <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> drained every year.</p>
            <p>If only half a Million, therefore, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> what is imported goes out every <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> years the country will be drained of two <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and a half, in ten years of five Millions, <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſo on.</p>
            <p>How then is this demand for caſh for expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to be ſupplied? Why, ſurely, no where ſo readily as at the Bank; for as the Bank is the common receptacle for money, and as ſhe iſſues her notes payable in ſpecie to bearer upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, is it not in the power of every one who gains poſſeſſion of theſe notes to go with them and to demand payment for them at the Bank, and conſidering how the Bank is conſtituted at preſent, is it in her power to refuſe? Surely not, for the moment ſhe does, that moment ſhe ſtops payment, and there is an end put to her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at once. The Bank therefore facilitates the exportation of money, but ſhe not only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitates the exporation of money in general, but particularly of the beſt pieces. That this is no idle ſuppoſition I myſelf can witneſs, for I have known perſons keep accounts with the Bank merely for the purpoſe of drawing out the beſt of the ſpecie. Thus by paying in their own notes and then drawing for ſpecie, they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the beſt and ſo paid the remainder back, and thus after repeated drawings, they have been able to get poſſeſſion of all the beſt pieces, in order to ſend them abroad.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid, that when the Bank finds an extraordinary demand of caſh for exportation
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019583_0011_0FAC5BC5757DB9C0"/>
it is her cuſtom to ſtop diſcounts. That is, in hopes that this demand will ceaſe, after the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a particular veſſel, or of a packet for Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, ſhe, for the preſent, puts a ſtop to her profits as well as her out-goings, and, in fact, ſhuts up ſhop; for as her profit ariſes from the diſcounting of bills, the moment ſhe puts a ſtop to this, that moment ſhe puts a ſtop to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of her trade. And yet this is far from being any remedy for the evil complained of; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for caſh to ſend abroad ſtill ſubſiſts and is not ſupplied, and it only tends to make peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have occaſion for this money, more artful, by beginning to draw upon the Bank a little earlier. I ſhall ſay nothing of the great advantage that thoſe have, who are concerned in the Bank, in trading with the Bank's money, which gives them a great advantage over other traders, in buying lands, in making uſe of the ſpecie of the Bank for their own remittances, and in the preferences which they have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of giving to their friends; all of which are matters of the greateſt importance. Suffice it to ſay, that if the prayer of the Bank's petition was granted, and the charter reſtored <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on the footing it was before, it is impoſſible, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, that it could afford any thing more than a temporary relief, by creating a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary confidence: indeed, like the King of France's edict in favor of the Caiſſe d'Eſcompte, it might induce ſome to bring their caſh to the Bank; but the ſame cauſe exiſting, <abbr>viz.</abbr> an unfavorable balance of trade, and that ſtill ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating againſt her, the ſame diſtreſs muſt ſoon recur, from which ſhe muſt neceſſarily find her ſelf involved in as much difficulty as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:019583_0012_0FAC5BC6357D34F0"/>
But this method of ſtopping diſcounts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, I confeſs, a moſt extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; and ſuch a one, as in any other country would be conſidered as little ſhort of committing an act of bankruptcy. It is extraordinary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not her intereſt to do it; and becauſe, upon the principles upon which ſhe is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, it is what ſhe is not juſtifiable in doing. Banks are the ſervants of the public, and their inſtitution is intended for the facilitating circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and for the promotion of trade, and the profits they receive for the diſcounting of bills are the wages they receive for performing that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. To refuſe therefore to diſcount good bills, unexpectedly, and at a time perhaps when they are moſt wanted, is defeating the very purpoſe for which they were inſtituted. It is a tacit acknowledgment, that they either want caſh, or that they want credit; and it is giving a vital ſtab to circulation and trade. When they do this, it demonſtrates that the confidence that was placed in them by their cuſtomers was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and that they have received wages for performing an office, which, at the time when their aſſiſtance was moſt wanted, they took the liberty to decline. Hence it is that we ſee ſo many running about the ſtreets with diſtraction and deſperation in their countenances; and hence it is that ſo many have been obliged to ſtop payment who had reckoned upon having their bills diſcounted as a ſure reſource.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſaid that the profits of the Bank muſt be conſiderable, notwithſtanding their ſtopping diſcounts, becauſe they have made large dividends. Large dividends may be made various ways, by manufacturing their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019583_0013_0FAC5BC6F3FE5168"/>
own paper while the public confidence conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, or even by dividing their capital. What their profits are, is beſt known to themſelves; but that their profits could never be ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to afford a dividend of 16 per cent, though they had made no bad debts, even if they had never ſtopt diſcounts, I am inclined to believe, by comparing it with the dividends that have been made at different times by the Bank of England.</p>
            <p>I have before me a liſt of the dividends made by the Bank of England, for a matter of ſeventy years paſt, <abbr>viz.</abbr> from the year 1715 down to the preſent time, by which I learn that ſhe never has, in any one year, divided to her creditors more than after the rate of 8 per cent. The liſt is as follows, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

            <p>From 1715 to 1719 ſhe divided 8 p. ct. per an.</p>

            <p>If the Bank of England therefore, whoſe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo much more extenſive, and who has always had an intereſt allowed her by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019583_0014_0FAC5BC7B4E872E8"/>
of at leaſt 3 per cent. upon her ſtock, beſides four thouſand pounds a year to defray her expences of management, has never been able to divide amongſt the proprietors more than 8 per cent. is it probable, that the profits of the Bank of North America, in this city, can have enabled her fairly to divide amongſt her creditors after the rate of 16 per cent. eſpecially when we conſider, that ſhe has no intereſt paid her by the Government upon her ſtock, nor has ſhe any other means of defraying her expences but what ariſe out of the profits of her trade.</p>
            <p>If this is not a fair inference, I call upon the directors to prove the contrary, by producing a full and fair account of their property and effects, and laying them before the public. This, at leaſt, your honourable Houſe, I think, has a right to expect, before they conſent to a renewal of their charter, and a refuſal on their part can be conſtrued into nothing but an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their guilt.</p>
            <p>For my own part, I own, I am ſomewhat at a loſs, to account for their extreme ſolicitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this head. If they have been acting fairly and honeſtly, which I always ſuppoſe till it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the contrary, where is the great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for a charter? Is it to ſcreen their own private fortunes from being anſwerable to the public creditors for debts contracted by the Bank? If it is, let the proprietors look to it. This, I am ſorry to ſay, has been done in other countries, and why may it not in this?</p>
            <p>After all that has been ſaid, I am far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enemy to Banks.</p>
            <p>Banks have ſubſiſted for ages in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and have been of the greateſt utility. A
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019583_0015_0FAC5BC87402F4E8"/>
Bank, as I before obſerved, has exiſted at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, another at Genoa, another at Amſterdam, for a great number of years; but they are all of them very differently conſtituted from the Bank in this city. They are ſuited to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and circumſtances of their reſpective coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. Were the Bank in this city to continue upon its preſent plan, iſſuing notes payable in ſpecie, for any length of time, it would be the means, by degrees, of transferring all the coin in the country out of it, and we have no mines to afford an inexhauſtible ſupply. This the Bank of St. George once did with reſpect to Corſica, and were Banks paying in coin eſtabliſhed in Spain, Portugal, or any other country that has a conſtant balance of trade againſt her, they would only help on their ruin a little faſter. This had very nearly happened in Scotland in the year 1764. Such a Bank, it is true, may be a preſent temporary convenience and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to the merchant, but it is ruin and deſtruction to the country. Had our greateſt enemies been the inventors of this device, they could not have concerted our ruin more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, than by recommending the inſtitution of ſuch a Bank. And is it any wonder, that Britiſh merchants and others ſhould complain moſt grievouſly of the abolition of a Bank, through the inſtrumentalilty of which they had been enabled to glean away from us all our money. This is the true reaſon of our preſent ſcarcity of caſh, and if the Bank continues upon its preſent plan, this ſcarcity of caſh muſt every day grow greater. If European countries are ambitious of our trade, let them conſent to a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:019583_0016_0FAC5BC934047F70"/>
ſettlement of it upon the only terms upon which it can be carried on, <abbr>viz.</abbr> A free, open and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous exchange of their manufactures for our produce through ſuch channels as may be found convenient for that purpoſe. When that is done, and a favourable balance of trade reſtored, it will be time enough to inſtitute Banks, paying in ſpecie. But if we muſt have a Bank in our preſent circumſtances, it muſt be of a different kind. To conclude,</p>
            <p>The queſtion, therefore, before the Houſe, in my humble opinion, which I beg leave to ſubmit to you, is not, Whether the charter ought to be reſtored to the Bank, only limiting the time of its duration and the quantum of its ſtock, (which I underſtand is the thing prayed for) but, Whether it ought to ſubſiſt at all under its preſent form, or whether it ought not to be new modelled, ſo as to harmonize with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this country, and with the preſent ſtate of trade and commerce.</p>
