            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:009334_0006_1030329CC66D2828"/>At the ſame Time, the beſt Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of GOD, which Reaſon aided by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation can form, teach us to rely on the Father of Spirits, the great Preſerver of Men, not only in Emergencies, but in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Courſe of Life, and even in Affairs wherein human Power and Sagacity have much to do, for a proper Direction of the Powers of the Mind, as well as for the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Health and Strength of the Body.</p>
            <p>PRAYER therefore, is an Application to Heaven, as natural and as obvious, in its Grounds and Motives, as any of the moſt common Actions of Life. A Mind open to divine Advices, is a Mind in its true State of modeſt Humility.</p>
            <p>THIS important Day then, of the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Exerciſe of the peculiar Rights of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Province, by which Rights our civil Polity approaches nearer to that of the happy Iſland from whence we origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, than that of any other of the Britiſh Plantations, and if ſo, to the Standard of a perfect Government; This <hi>joyful Day,</hi> I ſay,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009334_0007_1030329F015B7D08"/>
is moſt properly opened, by this ſolemn Act of public Worſhip; by a devout Addreſs to the Fountain of Wiſdom, from whom are derived all the Streams of it, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in innumerable human Minds; and by a decent Attention to thoſe moral and religious Truths, an Attention to which, is indeed in the laſt Reſort, the hearkening unto GOD. What lively Faith ſhould ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate theſe Services; "O People ſaved of the LORD, for whom he has done ſuch great Things, whereof ye are glad."</p>
            <p>FROM whence can a Politician go to the moſt arduous Affairs, which require Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Deliberation, Integrity, publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and an inward Regard to GOD, better than from ſuch an Exerciſe, as compoſes the Soul, brings to View the higheſt Motives to diſintereſted Benevolence, and preſents in their true Colours, Craft, Avarice, little Deſigns, ſiniſter Practices, and every Thing, which generous Souls and thoſe beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with themſelves, are moſt jealous of, and keep the ſtricteſt Guard againſt.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER the Paſſage of ſacred Story now read, which the Wiſdom of GOD has han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009334_0008_1030E8A79DEEE720"/>
down to us, may not lead to thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points, which have been often treated on this Anniverſary, with Accuracy, yet it may ſuggeſt to us ſome ſuch Truths, as however obvious, yet can never paſs our Minds, but with Advantage, and which have a direct Aſpect on the weighty Affairs of this Day.</p>
            <p>THE Style and Conſtruction of theſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is that of an Apologue, or Fable, a Mode of ſpeaking extremely popular in ancient Times, and much in Taſte among the eaſtern Nations at this Day. It had its peculiar Advantages, eſpecially in caſes of Reproof; it inſinuated itſelf in a ſmooth and artful Manner into Perſons indiſpoſed to hear, and by not making perſonal Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Inſtant, it delayed that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, thro' which Reproof often fails of its Uſe.</p>
            <p>SOME Roman Writers have piqued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the famous Apologue of <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> concerning the Stomach and Limbs of the human Body, which had ſuch a wonderous Influence in calming the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Spirits of the Patricians and Commons, as being the moſt ancient Example of that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009334_0009_1030E8ABB079F538"/>
Manner of Speaking. It muſt have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them to have known, that this moral and political Fable, correct, beautiful and inſtructive as it is, was uttered by a deſpiſed and in their Opinion, barbarous Hebrew, 700 Years before <hi>Agrippa</hi> was born.</p>
            <p>FOR it was delivered, while <hi>Iſrael</hi> was yet governed by Judges of their own Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Among theſe <hi>Gideon</hi> was famous. Under their grievous Oppreſſions, GOD rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them up this eminent Magiſtrate and General, who with great Succeſs humbled their Enemies, and reſtored their Liberty and Tranquility. Such a grateful Senſe had the People of his Merit and Services, that they were for rendering the ſupreme Magiſtracy hereditary in his Family, which he ſaw fit to decline. But this was a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Fit of Gratitude; for when their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was no more, they treated his Family with baſe Neglect. And no wonder, that when (as we find) they had forgotten their ſupreme Deliverer, they ſhould ill uſe the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his Providence for their Good.</p>
            <p>THIS unworthy Spirit was wro't up, by a ſeditious baſe-born Son of <hi>Gideon,</hi> named <hi>Abimelech,</hi> a Youth of an ambitious and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009334_0010_1030E8AD46366888"/>
enterpriſing Genius, of a cruel and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Temper. He had the Addreſs to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade a ſtrong Party to combine in ſetting aſide <hi>Gideon</hi>'s, legitimate Sons, under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (and Ambition never wants colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pretences) that Inconveniences might ariſe to the Conſtitution, from their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And leſt after the People had taſted of his arbitrary Meaſures, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Senſes, he villainouſly murdered all <hi>Gideon's</hi> Sons, except this <hi>Jotham,</hi> the Speaker in our Text, who eſcaped the Maſſacre. And thus <hi>Abimelech</hi> was made King by the prevailing Faction.</p>
            <p>ADVICE of this Tranſaction was it ſeems bro't to <hi>Jotham,</hi> before the Aſſembly of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors broke up; and he from a Place of Safety addreſſes them in the Manner I have read; intending by the "Olive Tree, &amp;c." the Family of <hi>Gideon,</hi> who had the Example and Inſtructions of their Father, to form them to the Love of their Country, and of every ſocial Virtue; and by the "Bramble", their new Leader, the Spirit of whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was eaſily predicted, from the Temper and paſt Conduct of the Man. Thus much for the Occaſion of this Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:009334_0011_1030E8AED6E6AFA8"/>TO bring this Fable as an Authority, to prove the divine Right of Societies of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their chief Magiſtrate, tho' a Proof as much to the Purpoſe as many Texts which have been adduced, to prove the divine hereditary Right of Tyranny and Tyrants, would yet be futile and abſurd. What has more Weight is, that this Fragment of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, ſhews how high we may trace the Claim and Practice of civil Societies, to elect ſuch to Places of Truſt for the common Benefit, as would in the general Opinion well anſwer the Ends of their Appointment.</p>
            <p>THE Doctrines of Slavery, political or theological, are not the Maxims of Reaſon, Prudence or Revelation; nor took Place till Men by Ignorance, Effeminacy and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, became fitted for them. 'Tis no doubt an Improvement upon this Principle of civil Right, in great and populous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, where the chief Authority is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to ONE, to render it hereditary in a certain Family, ſo long as the Succeſſion in it comitts with the well-being of the Society.</p>
            <p>BUT, 'tis a leſs abſtract Uſe I propoſe to make of this Parable, by directing your Thoughts, my honoured and can did HEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009334_0012_1030E8B54DC9ADA8"/>
to two or three Leſſons and Warnings of Wiſdom, ſet here to View. And if what I ſhall now ſay, be the Words of moral and religious Truth and Soberneſs, it will not be Arrogance in me, to uſe <hi>Jotham's</hi> Words, "Hearken unto me, and GOD ſhall hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you."</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. THE firſt is, That it is the Part of Wiſdom, in thoſe who have the Right of electing others to important Truſts in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, to chooſe ſuch as have in private Life manifeſted, that the benevolent Affections have powerful Influence upon them, who have conducted worthily in more contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spheres of Action.</p>
            <p>SUCH a Character <hi>Jotham</hi> intends, by "the Olive Tree with whoſe Fatneſs they honour GOD and Man," "the Fig-tree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in Sweetneſs and good Fruit," "the Vine whoſe Wine cheereth" or is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to "GOD and Man." Theſe the Republic of Trees called forth to public Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who had before ſhewn their Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to promote the Happineſs of all about them, in their narrow Circle, and of whom it was to be presumed that their Uſefulneſs

would be increaſed, when their Capacity of Service ſhould be extended. The Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is eaſy.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION of human Nature fully proves, that the Wiſdom of the Creator has made Part of our Frame, two Setts of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to impell us to Action, the ſelfiſh and the benevolent; in the Ballance of which, the due Proportion of their Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the perfect Character in ſocial Life conſiſts. And altho' ſuch is the Influence of Matter, in the different Combination of its Parts, upon Mind; ſo manifold are the Trials which the ſame Wiſdom ſees beſt for different Creatures; that theſe Affections, theſe inward Motives, have very different Proportions in the Make of different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet by the due Exerciſe of the Powers of the Mind they may be reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively cultivated or reſtrained, ſo as that any one by prudent Conduct in indulging or limiting them, may become entitled to Reſpect and Love, and promiſe fair to be a public Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>WHEN a ſtrong Diſpoſition to do Good and promote Happineſs, ariſes merely or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009334_0014_1030E8BA1743FE60"/>
moſtly from natural Complexion, 'tis yet in a moral View amiable; ſeeing the Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, that notwithſtanding the natural Bias, there will be much Occaſion in this corrupt World, for the reſtraining the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus of contrary Affections, in the various Parts and incidents of the Intercourſe of Life.</p>
            <p>BUT this Character becomes more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uſeful, becauſe more perfect, when theſe Tendencies of Conſtitution become fixed Habits, on Reflection and Principle. When Men are active in their Endeavours for the Welfare of thoſe about them, from a juſt Senſe of the innate Excellency and happy Fruits of public Spirit, from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of theſe with the contrary Temper, which cold, vindictive, proud, avaritious, cannot feel the ſublime Pleaſure of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing with others, but lives only for itſelf, and having been uſeleſs or noxious in its Day, drops into Oblivion unregretted, unlamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and its Memory rots.</p>
            <p>BUT Religion, Contemplation of the bleſſed GOD and his Son, the beſt Friend of Men, ſtedfaſt Imitation of theſe higheſt and moſt noble Examples; this fixes ſocial
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009334_0015_1030E8BF23663D98"/>
Love on its firmeſt and beſt Foundation; this affords the moſt worthy and powerful Motives to it; this raiſes it to the moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pitch.</p>
            <p>WHEN Affections of this Kind have the Aſcendant in private Life, the Perſon whom they poſſeſs becomes a rich Blſſing to all within the Sphere of their Operation. Place him at the Head of a Family, he counts it the chief Joy of Life, to exert himſelf for its Good. His wiſe Maxims of Education, his prudent Regimen, derive Bleſſings even on his remoteſt Dependants. His Servants are as Children, his Children as his own Soul. He forms them to ſuch Tempers, he obliges them to ſuch Deportment, as ſhall maintain Internal Harmony and Friendſhip, he encourages their Induſtry, trains them to Virtue and Piety and uſes every Method whereby they may become meet for the Deſcent of the beſt Bleſſings of Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
            <p>SUCH an One is the Life and Cement of good Neighbourhood. His "liberal Heart deviſeth liberal Things," and "the Law of Kindneſs is in his Lips." He "prays for the Peace of Jeruſalem," and his unceaſing En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009334_0016_1030E8C56FB72238"/>
ſecond his beſt Wiſhes. He ſtills the angry Paſſions of the Imprudent, is the Arbiter of contending Parties, feels the Troubles and mourns the Folly and Vices of every Individual, rejoices in their Joys.—He is ever vigilant for the Intereſts of the Church, Pariſh, Town, he is connected with, and never more in his Element, than when engaged in Deſigns for their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, Opulence, Virtue and Religion.</p>
            <p>RAISE ſuch a Character to a public Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an important Truſt in Society, that of a Maker for Inſtance of thoſe Laws by which it ſubſiſts, and this generous Spirit which before bleſſed a few, ſends forth its benign Influence, and Thouſands and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands feel the happy Effects of it. He receives the Truſt as Power put into his Hands by the univerſal Father, to indulge in the moſt pleaſing Degree to his ruling Paſſion. No Honours, no Profits of his own are ſought diſtinct from ſuch generous Views, no Deſigns of others countenanced, which are unfavorable to the public Peace and Proſperity. He enjoys the Plenty, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the Knowledge, the Virtue, of all about him, in Proſpect, while he is purſuing proper Meaſures for them; in pleaſurable
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009334_0017_1030E8C7071E3078"/>
Sympathy when they are poſſeſſed of them. He is therefore ever intent, moved thereto by Inſtinct, Reaſon and Religion, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his Truſt to the general Advantage, from the loweſt to the higheſt Point of it.</p>
            <p>WHEN ſuch is the deſerved Character of the ruling Part of a Community, "GOD has a Pleaſure for them," Men of ſuch a Temper and ſuch Affections, ſleep and wake for the common Benefit. Their equal and ardent Love to the Whole, excites them to all ſuch Meaſures as Wiſdom points out, whereby the Whole may be made eaſy and happy. While by all Encouragement to Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, they "turn a Wilderneſs into a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Field," they protect and cheriſh her Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Commerce, and make every Part of the Globe, as well as their own, miniſter to their Plenty and Riches. Fair Liberty, which gives Life and Spirit to the whole, is guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them as the Apple of their Eye.—Wrong Doing and Immorality are frowned upon, Temperance and good Manners, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as the very Source of that Spirit of Independance and maſculine Courage, which muſt give the collective Body of a Community, Reſpect and Weight with their Neighbours, which will render them terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009334_0018_1030E8C898BD09D0"/>
to foreign Enemies, as "an Army with Burners." In their Days, Arts and Scie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nces will be cultivated and flouriſh, thoſe who excel in them be honoured and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, while their Labours tend to enoble the Mind, to diffuſe thoſe intellectual Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, which afford the moſt refined Pleaſures the human Mind can be bleſſed with, ſhort of thoſe which are divine, and at the ſame Time raiſe up from Age to Age, Men of "Knowledge and Wiſdom, the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of their Times." Eſpecially will this lovely Spirit of Patriotiſm exert itſelf in the Support of real Religion, by ſeverely ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverting on every Thing contrary to its unqueſtioned Dictates, by ſtricly requiring that outward Veneration of GOD, which none deny to be his due, by guarding the Rights of Conſcience with the niceſt Care, the leaſt Infringement of which, in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſaps the Foundation of that "pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and undefiled," which alone is uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to Men, or acceptable to the Deity.</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid, it may be well inferred, that when any Community, or thoſe in it who have the Right of electing their principal Officers, neglect ſuch Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications as I have deſcribed, they become
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009334_0019_1030E8CA2B481FB8"/>
in the Language of our Law, <hi>Felo's de ſe,</hi> in the Style of Scripture, "they refuſe to hearken unto GOD" and "reject the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of GOD againſt themſelves." For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more certain than that "Grapes are not to be gathered of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles." No Society can flouriſh long, where public Spirit is not the Characteristics of its Rulers—Avarice will in an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent State its Neighbours, and in any State keep its own interior Condition weak and contemptible, by ſtinting the Progreſs of every Thing which is its Strength and Beauty. In a ſingle perſon, it will thwart every Meaſure which requires Expence, ſtarving the Public for fear of leſſening its own private Stock. Terrible are the Effects of this corrupt Paſſion, when Rulers are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Juſtice itſelf bought and ſold.—Want of Capacity, from whence proceed little ſordid Views, will ſerve particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests to the Detriment of the common, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Uneaſineſs and Bickerings, like thoſe of the Belly and Limbs in the Fable, and keep a Society low.—Ambition, except well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, is dangerous in a Ruler: When gratified, it cannot heartily love Equals, is apt to look with an evil Eye on Liberty her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the croſſes its Views; diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009334_0020_1030E8D1E08B6FA8"/>
eſpecially in an iraſcible Conſtitution, which is moſtly the Caſe, it is like a raging Fire which devours every Thing in its way, nor ſpares "the Cedars of Lebanon."—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, will not give itſelf the Trouble to foreſee or guard; to think nor act for "the Peace of Jeruſalem." The worst impending Calamities awake it not. The Public ſinks or ſwims as Events turn up, when unactive Men are at Helm.—What is called a politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Head, ſkill in the Art of Government, where diſintereſted Patriotiſm is not at Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, is but a mean deteſtable Craft, which abuſes its Acquaintance with the Paſſions of Men, its Aſcendency over their Ignorance, or Confidence it has inſidiouſly gained, to anſwer Purpoſes alien from the general Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, by Means inconſiſtent with plain open Right.—Severity of Temper, inclining to write its Laws in Blood, will keep Society unquiet, and be apt to approach the Verge of Tyranny. Touchineſs or Moreſeneſs ſinks the Character of Reputation of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and if it prevails in the general Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body of Rulers, of Government itſelf.—But above all, Diſregard to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, open Impiety, in a Ruler, eſpecialy in an Adminiſtration, has a moſt baneful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on Society. To patronize Diſſolution
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009334_0021_1030E8D4FB537060"/>
of Manners, by Word or Example, conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Example, to ſuffer the Hedges of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to be trodden down, that Fear of GOD to fail, without which every ſocial Tye is weak, and eaſily ſnapped in ſunder, is the worſt Defect of Policy, the greateſt Want of Benevolence that can be conceived.—"Sin is the Reproach of any People." and if there be a righteous Ruler of the World, he will viſit for ſuch Neglects in thoſe, who repoſe Truſts in unfit Perſons, and this Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in its own Nature brings a Curſe.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE, Let thoſe of my Hearers who are more peculiarly concerned in theſe Obſervations, hearken unto GOD. They have been in a ſolemn Manner aſking his Direction and Bleſſing this Morning; GOD ſpeaks to them, he anſwers their Requeſts, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> an happy Iſſue to the Choice of this Day. If they take heed to the mark the Characters, which unworthy or noxious in private Life, will be uſeleſs or hurtful to the general Intereſts, and avoid them. They cannot have greater Security, of any Man's being a Bleſſing in the Execution of the Truſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009334_0022_1030E8D6E7F4C668"/>
repoſed in him, than this, That he has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en full Proof in private Life, of the Extent and Strength of the Habits of Juſtice and Benevolence he poſſeſſes. When theſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are joined with good Senſe, extenſive Knowledge and Penetration; which I mean always to take into the Account, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Reverence of GOD, and they fix on ſuch Men, they have done their Part faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and may chearfully leave Events to GOD.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE <hi>Second</hi> Obſervation I make on the Part of antient Story now read, is, That Men who are well qualified for important Offices in Society, will, when called to undertake them, do it with a ſerious Senſe of the Labour and Difficulty, attending a faithful Diſcharge of them.</p>
            <p>THIS Remark I make, on the Averſeneſs of the Olive-Tree, the Fig-Tree, &amp;c. to the being preferred; their eſteeming the Eaſe and Quiet of a retired Life of Beneficence, more eligible than all the Honours and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a public Station.</p>
            <p>GOD forbid that all worthy Men ſhould carry a similar Averſion to ſuch a Length,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009334_0023_1030E8DA48910610"/>
that Society ſhould be forced to recur to Brambles, for the filling the Departments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to its Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>WHERE Men in high Poſts, execute the Duties of them with Integrity and Zeal, the Envious, or thoſe who affect to degrade hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, to derive whatever appears va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable from a foul and corrupt Source, theſe may call ſuch, Men of Ambition, and ſay, they are but gratifying their Pride; but the Tenor of their Conduct proves the Goodneſs of their Principles. Let Ambition be one; and is it not (within due Limits) a good one, yea a neceſſary one, for Creatures of our Rank, who are not ſo perfect as to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only by the ſublimeſt Affections. Public Truſts well diſcharged, uniform Patriotiſm, vindicate from ſuch invidious Aſperſions prove the ſelfish Paſſions to be under due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint: For where ſuch Conduct is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in, there muſt have been a ſober Senſe of the Weight of ſuch Truſts, a final Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to go through every Step of Labour, needful to the qualifying for the faithful and uſeful Diſcharge of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009334_0024_1030E8E12CFEB8F8"/>LET us then ſuppoſe, an upright Mind deliberating on and ballancing each Side of the Affair, when a chief Place in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſents. He ſees before him Honour and Diſtinction among his Fellow-Citizens; Power which Nature ſo greedily catches at; perhaps more Revenue than private Life will afford him. But he ſees on the other Side, that good Conſcience requires, cloſe Application of Mind to the amaſſing civil and political Knowledge; the gaining juſt Ideas of the general Rights of Mankind na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſocial; of the Laws of Nature and Nations; the municipal Conſtitutions of his own Country; the Genius and Intereſts of his People; their Connections with, or Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from their Neighbours; the Methods of beſt encreaſing their Numbers, Wealth and Extent; the Laws which will render their Liberties more equal and ſecure; their internal Policy more firm; encourage their Trade and Manufactures; promote Virtue and a Spirit of Religion: The good Ruler, in ſuch a View, eſteems his Office a Poſt of Care and Burden.</p>
            <p>HE is alſo ſensible, that from a Variety of Cauſes he ſhall have much Trial of his Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009334_0025_1030E8E4900D2950"/>
much Anxiety and Grief; that he muſt ſet his Face forward in Duty as a Flint, reſolving that <q>till he dies his Integrity ſhall not depart from him.</q> Aware of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Capacity of Mind, he foreſees he may adviſe to, or vote for Meaſures, which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience may prove unfit or unſalutary. Thoſe Evil-doers, to whom he is by his Place to be a Terror, will of Courſe be his avowed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if he ſhall diſtinguiſh himſelf in the Cauſe of Order, Peace and Juſtice. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of others will give him much Pain. For placed on high, with the Eyes of all fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, Cenſures will be frequent and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. The moſt uſeful Inſtitutions, if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, often offend by their Novelty; if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of deep-rooted, long-continued E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; ſome have found an Advantage in theſe Evils, they will be chagrined; the Change is often attended with Perplexities, the good Effects perhaps at a Diſtance; the Patriot muſt have much Firmneſs to ſupport him under the Complaints and Obloquy which will be ſometimes ſtirred up. Some think themſelves equal to the Government of Provinces and Kingdoms, merely through Want of Senſe; theſe are uſually very loud in their Clamours. Others carp becauſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009334_0026_1030E8E6490E0DE0"/>
they imagine nothing can be well done but by themſelves;—They are out of Place, they are injured and the Commonwealth ſuffers.</p>
            <p>To conclude here, the wiſe and tho'tful Ruler ever conſiders himſelf, as introduced by the high Monarch of the Univerſe, the Judge of All, to his Poſt of Dignity. He eſteems himſelf bound to follow Him who "never ſlumbers nor ſleeps," never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits his powerful and gracious Providence. The Vows of GOD are upon him. And when he carries himſelf forward to that awful Tribunal, at which the great as well as the ſmall are to appear, he is convinced, that as he has more Talents to account for the Improvement of than others, his future Reward or Puniſhment will be proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly greater. `How can I,' ſays he in his Retirements for Recollection, `How can I bear to hear from the Judge of All, "thou wicked and ſlothful Servant!" `How can I bear the Woe which thoſe deſerve who by Breach of Truſt, have been acceſſory to the Wrongs of Multitudes, of Peoples and Nations!'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:009334_0027_1030E8ED618B18E0"/>BUT the wiſe GOD has, in the moral as well as in the natural World, ſet one Thing over againſt another. With his Anxieties and Labours, the Patriot Ruler has alſo his Satisfactions and Supports. If he is the Butt of the Querulous and Envious, he has little to fear from Flattery. The Incenſe of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites is uſually offered to thoſe of other Deſigns and Tempers. He is ſure of the Eſteem of the diſcerning Few, the beſt Judges and trueſt Friends of Merit, whoſe Opinion only affects a wiſe Man's inward. Peace, and a Series of Wiſdom and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, will in the long Run be the Object of general Approbation, tho' the Path to ſuch Honour be tedious and rugged. He will have the conſtant Applauſe of his own Mind, which like a Shield of Braſs, repels the Darts of Envy, and keeps all calm within. He will enjoy the noble Pleaſure of being able to appeal to GOD, "LORD thou knoweſt that I have ſerved thee in Integrity, and done that which is good in thy Sight." He will be able to look forward to the great Day with ſublime Joy, when by Faith he views the Judge of All diſtributing the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Grace, ſaying, "Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt; been faithful
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009334_0028_1030E8F0D20F2758"/>
in a few Things, I will make thee Ruler o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver many Things, enter thou into the Joy of thy LORD." And if a "Cup of cold Water" given to a Diſciple of his, ſhall not loſe its Reward, to what an elevated Seat of Glory ſhall thoſe be exalted, who out of Regard to GOD, have employed their Time and Abilities for the Happineſs of Multitudes.</p>
            <p>WHEN therefore, <hi>my Hearers,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate the Advancement of ſuch to high Offices, who receive them only as a Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of childiſh Vanity, or as the Means, of gratifying ſome ſelfiſh paltry Intereſt, or who tho' they labour and toil in them, yet 'tis only to ſatiate ſome ugly Paſſion; when, I ſay, we pray that this may not be our Fate, we ought with Gratitude to Heaven, to rejoice that our Affairs are hitherto in better Hands.</p>
            <p>IT affords the ſtrongeſt Preſumption of Capacity, Application and public Spirit in Rulers, when in the Style of Scripture, "All Things go well." And 'tis to be pretty certainly determined that Things in the whole go well, when the Body of a People feel well, and when the malevolent and froward, are obliged to exaggerate or
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009334_0029_1030E8F676E32D90"/>
diſtort in Order to preſent a different Image of Affairs. Tranquillity and Order are not the Effects of Chance. We are then one and all to be thankful for Bleſſings of this ſort we have experienced, and to endeavour in our reſpective Places, that they may be perpetuated.</p>
            <p>A JUSTER Compliment cannot be paid to the GENTLEMAN, whom his royal Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has placed at the Head of this Province, (and ſeeing thereby we enjoy much Peace and Quietneſs, may He be long here conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued) than in the Name of this whole People, to expreſs our full Confidence in him, that it is his Heart's Deſire, that ſuch may from Time to Time be joined in the Adminiſtration with him, as ſhall heartily labour and watch for the Liberty, Peace and Proſperity of the Community; going on har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly and zealouſly with him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the general Intereſt, that ſo he may enjoy that permanent and heart-felt Pleaſure, which is the Property and Happineſs of a generous Mind in an exalted Station, and give account at laſt, not merely of well-meant Endeavours, but of extenſive and ſubſtantial Fruits of his Fidelity in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his People, his Maſter and his GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:009334_0030_1030E8F81125E868"/>WISE Rulers, in ſuch a Train of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will enter upon their Offices with great Sobriety of Mind, as into Scenes of Care and Burthen, through the whole of which they ſhall need the ſteadieſt Application, unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Efforts to approve themſelves to Him, by whom the Welfare of the People is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to them;—And to every Thing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, will add that devout Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him, whoſe is the Preparation of the Heart, whoſe is Counſel and Underſtanding; which ſhall ſecure his gracious Preſence, his conſtant Guidance and final Acceptance.—May this be the Spirit of thoſe who ſhall be choſen into HIS MAJESTY'S Council this Day!</p>
            <p>WITH ſuch Ideas of the Weight of public Truſts the Body of a People will, if they are wiſe or humane, be careful not to add to the unavoidable Fatigues of Magiſtracy, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Jealouſies and trifling Complaints: But where there are Marks of good Intention, and of a ſteady Purſuit of the general Weal, will be tender of the Character of their Rulers, ready to give them Honour and Applauſe, animate them by chearful Submiſſion, and ever (above all) commend them to GOD,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009334_0031_1030E900F9168468"/>
whoſe "Miniſters they are to them ſo good," and through whom his Bounties de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcend upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE laſt Part of our preſent Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will ariſe from the Concluſion of our Text, which preſents to us the Spirit and Genius of unlimited Deſpotiſm; and from this View we ſhall naturally turn to the lovely Contraſt, and be led to a grateful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of the Bleſſings of civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Liberty, a valuable Branch whereof we are this Lay improving.</p>
            <p>HERE our Field of Meditation grows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive, and I own I the rather choſe this Part of Scripture for my Text, because it carries us beyond our own comparatively little Intereſts; to continue ourſelves to which, at ſuch a joyful and remarkable a Period as this, and on ſuch a Day, would betray want of Judgment and want of Gratitude. You ſee here in the Fable a repti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, contemptible, noxious Plant; in the Application of it, an upſtart Uſurper, raiſed to Power by the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſome and the Wickedneſs of others, no ſooner inveſted with it, than he inſolently lets his Electors know what they had to expect

from him: <q>If in Truth ye anoint me King over you, then come and put your Truſt in my Shadow; and if nor, let Fire come out of the Bramble, and devour the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars of Lebanon.</q>—'You have made me your ſupreme Magiſtrate, you are now to pay me an unreſerved, abject Submiſſion; if you fail, expect this Power to be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Deſtruction of him who dares op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me, tho' the moſt noble and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character.'</p>
            <p>THIS is the genuine Language of arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Will, and has been too often heard, not only in Fable, but in real Life, and Facts have followed it in a moſt full and dreadful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Tyrant's Nod, the Caprice of his Minions and Paraſites, have diſpoſed of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, Property, Life, in ſpite of the moſt venerable Rights, deſcended from diſtant Ages; the Voice of Reaſon; the Maxims of Equity and Claims of Conſcience. No Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice reſtrains: no Mercy relents: Does any one diſpute, or lift up his Hand, "Fire comes out of the Bramble and deſtroys the Cedars of Lebanon." O that for the Honor of the human Species, the horrible Fruits of arbitrary Power were Matter of Theory on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009334_0033_1030E90472071D18"/>
or the painting of a lively Imagination: that Perſecution, Oppreſſion, Rapine, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, Depopulations, were Exaggerations or <hi>Caracatura</hi>'s! — But it is not eaſy to overcharge the diſmal Features of Tyranny: Every one converſant in ancient Hiſtory has ſeen this Fury firing the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> yea, devouring every Part of the Earth by Turns with her internal Flames: Nor have later Ages, with all the Experience of thoſe who went before them, quite emancipated themſelves from her Chains, eſcaped her Ravages.</p>
            <p>ASIA formerly, almoſt to its utmoſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, ſaw the wanton <hi>Alexander</hi> with no Pretence of Right, yet ſpreading? Deſolation, accounting the Claim of Independence, a ſufficient Cauſe for inducing all the Miſeries of War, on thoſe whom GOD and Nature had made free. The <hi>Romans,</hi> once the People on the Earth the moſt tenacious of their Liberties, yet ſaw <hi>Julius</hi> proſcribing their few ſurviving Patriots, baſely abuſing the Name and Majeſty of the Commonwealth, to aid him in climbing the Pinnacle of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Greatneſs, from whence he might tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it under Foot. Language cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009334_0034_1030E90877554498"/>
the wretched Condition to which the Miſtreſs of the World fell, when ſhe was ſubjected to Monſters, who could wiſh the whole People had one Neck, to be cut off at a Stroke; when the firſt Magiſtrates were ſet up and pulled down by a rude, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacious Soldiery; when the very Shew of Virtue, Integrity and Love of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, marked Men out for Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>WHEN in after Times, the northern Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> became the Seat of Liberty, her Influence tending Southward, what conſtant Conflicts have there been between Freedom and Deſpotiſm! what Seas of Blood have been ſhed in them! How often has this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cauſe been foiled! In how many Parts is the Name and Thing extinct! Where are the ancient Parliaments of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Cortes</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Aſſemblies of the States and Commons, the voluntary Supporters of Princes, the avowed Defenders of their own Rights? They are no more.—There gripes the iron Hand of Power; there dwells un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly, daſtardly Slavery, in her moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful and ignominious Forms. For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is a tame, contented Slavery more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and reproachful, than in Times and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009334_0035_1030E90F1720D660"/>
Places where Knowledge of natural and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Right prevails. There a helliſh Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reigns over the ſacred Rights of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; there Dragoons are the Inſtruments of converting Men to Truth; there Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try flags, and every thing generous is cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>BUT, <hi>Britain,</hi> favoured of GOD, has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto maintained her Liberty; Freedom has ſubſiſted in Health and Vigour, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all Oppoſition; recovered of every Diſorder: There may ſhe ever flouriſh, and "under her Shadow we ſhall be ſafe." Not all the Viciſſitudes of human Affairs have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded Opportunity for the Deſtruction of the Freedom of our Nations. Inteſtine Frauds and Treaſons, the Weakneſs and Wickedneſs of Princes, foreign Invaſions, have all in Event ('tis wonderful!) but they have all, in Event, ſerved to fix Liberty more firmly, to mark out her Path, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine her Bounds, extend her Influence.</p>
            <p>LOOK back, my Hearers, to the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Times, of which we have any authentic Records; trace the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory from thence, in its principal Events, to this Day,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:009334_0036_1030E910AA3FDF48"/>
you will find it verified. The Irruption of the <hi>Romans</hi> drew our Anceſtors from the Faſtneſſes of the Wilderneſs, and its unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Manners, to ſocial Life, to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, perhaps of Chriſtianity itſelf. The rough <hi>Saxons</hi> imported thoſe maſculine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Freedom and Government, that Equipoiſe of Power and Liberty, which, built upon and improved, have rendered the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution the Admiration and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the World. The Companions and Abettors of the <hi>Norman</hi> Invader, as though the very Air of the Iſland infected them; no ſooner were they ſeated, than they became the Reſtrainers of Power, the Patrons of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. <hi>Papal</hi> Uſurpations upon civil Rights could never have quiet Poſſeſſion there, for any Length of Time. And when what was termed eccleſiaſtical Power, was tranſlated from the Mitre to the Crown, this Power, founded on civil, or imperial and canonLaw, in themſelves and unchecked, a Syſtem of Tyranny, could never eſtabliſh itſelf to the Wrong of the commonLaw, the ancient, fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Laws, Cuſtoms and Franchiſes of the People. Attempts to put theſe Laws in Uſe, and extend them, were the real Source of the Misfortunes of the Royal Houſe of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009334_0037_1030E91472FDA278"/>
               <hi>Steuart</hi>; theſe Attempts made wiſe Men mad in the Fury of their Oppoſition to them for a Seaſon, brought on Scenes of Confuſion and Miſery. Length of Time has cooled the Party-Rage which ſucceeded that unhappy Day; and it ought, in good Meaſure, to cover the Errors of thoſe Princes, that the firſt of them had the Honor, to be Progenitor to Kings, who have as zealouſly laboured for the Happineſs of theſe Nations, as ever <hi>they</hi> miſtakenly could for their Hurt.</p>
            <p>THE Reſtoration of the Conſtitution in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, however fair it promiſed, had well nigh been but a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ent Gleam of Light, haſtening to fatal Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thro' the mean Attachment of that Prince to a foreign graſping Power, and the nigh Approach of the Succeſſion of a Popiſh Sovereign; when behold! the very Men who had been bribed and penſioned to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Country, opened their Eyes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Maſter, and became ſtedfaſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the public Enemy.</p>
            <p>The glorious Revolution in I688, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Rights of Britons on a ſure Baſis; they were declared, claimed, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:009334_0038_1030E91620085140"/>
in their full Extent; and yet, ſtrange to tell; there wanted not a Faction of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded or abandoned Men, who by reſtleſs Treaſon, endeavoured to ſink them and us again, into Slavery to the moſt contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Abimelechs.</hi> But the Effect followed, which is to be expected from ſocial Virtue and public Spirit alarmed and its Powers collected, greatly an Overmatch for unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parricide, it prevailed in the peaceable Succeſſion of the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and the cloſe Attachment of all who wiſhed well to themſelves or their Poſterity, to them. GOD be thanked, that the Time is come, when this abſurd Spirit is extinct.</p>
            <p>DURING the long Period we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, <hi>England</hi> was frequently in Jeopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from Abroad; ſometimes ready in Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to ſubject herſelf to foreign Power, that ſhe might free herſelf from domeſtic Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as in the Caſe of King <hi>John</hi>; once at the Brink of being ſwallowed up by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible <hi>Armada</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>; once nigh reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs Confuſion, thro' the infernal Arts of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the infamous Powder-Plot; and for a Century paſt, conſtantly endangered by the inſidious Arts of <hi>France,</hi> the uncea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009334_0039_1030E91FD557E5D0"/>
Enemy of her Tranquillity—an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, at one Time tampering with her indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, profuſe, ſuperſtitious Princes; at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, abetting vagrant Pretenders to her Crown: At length, this aſpiring Power rightly judged that her future Efforts of this Kind would be vain, if the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Continent of <hi>America</hi> ſhould flouriſh and extend, and derive Wealth and Strength for their Mother-Country: Her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry therefore, with Craft and Perfidy, laid a Plan for firſt ſtinting their Growth (as they found the inhuman ſtimulating the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to their Deſtruction, would not effect the Purpoſe) that they might by and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwhelm them. This brought on the late bloody War, in which, to diſtreſs and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Britain,</hi> this capital Enemy had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to engage the greateſt Part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and at length to ſeduce the weak Councils of <hi>Spain</hi> to taſte the bitter Fruits of it. The moſt important Events of the War, its firſt dark Scenes, the "Light which aroſe in the Darkneſs," brightning "more and more unto the perfect Day," in its glorious Iſſue, are deeply imprinted in every Breaſt; I ſhall therefore wave the Recital.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:009334_0040_1030E92164E724C0"/>THE Exaltation of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to the Summit of earthly Grandeur and Glory, was reſerved in the Counſels of GOD for the Age and Reign of GEORGE the <hi>Third,</hi>—"Bleſſed are our Eyes for they ſee, our Ears for they hear," thoſe great Things, which our Anceſtors "deſired to ſee and hear, but did not."</p>
            <p>WE ſee a King on the Throne (ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his royal Grandfather, of immortal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory) rejoicing, that, to every other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, this of Birth is added, to endear his Subjects to him, to attach him to their Laws and Conſtitutions, and engage him to Vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and Zeal for their Protection. While the venerable Foundations of all we hold dear, are guarded with the ſtricteſt Care, while the loweſt Subject is ſafe as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in every Enjoyment he can deſire; the moſt powerful Enemies, the moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Combination of them, have fallen into "the Pit which they themſelves digged."</p>
            <p>AUSPICIOUS Day! when Britain, the ſpecial Care of Heaven, bleſſed with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot Sovereign, ſerved by wiſe and faithful Councellors, brave Commanders, ſucceſsful

Fleets and Armies, ſeconded in her Efforts by all her Children, and by none more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly than by thoſe of <hi>New-England,</hi> (I don't ſay gives Law to, a free State deteſts the arrogant tyrannic Phraſe, but) has it in her Power to demand Peace of the moſt powerful Enemies, on Terms, juſt and equal, ſafe, highly advantageous and glorious, beyond what were expected or even ſought for, through a Deluge of Blood.</p>
            <p>HAPPY Sovereign of ſuch a People, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Olive-Tree; whoſe Branches ſpread out, whoſe Fruit is diſperſed for the Healing of the Nations! Happy Iſland of his Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; bleſſed the Womb that bare him! It is GEORGE the <hi>Third,</hi> who gives Peace to half the World. How can Faction but be dumb, contending Parties but melt into gentle Harmony.</p>
            <p>IN theſe Events, the LORD GOD hath ſpoken, who can but prophecy, "In his Days ſhall the Righteous flouriſh, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Peace ſo long as the Moon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth: He ſhall have Dominion from Sea to Sea: They that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his Enemies ſhall

lick the Duſt: The Kings of Tarſhiſh and the Iſles ſhall bring Preſents; the Kings of Sheba and Seba ſhall offer Gifts: He ſhall deliver the Needy when he crieth, the Poor alſo, and him that hath no Helper: He ſhall redeem their Soul from Deceit and Violence; and precious ſhall their Blood be in his Sight. And he ſhall live, and to him ſhall be given of the Gold of Sheba: Prayer alſo ſhall be made for him continually, and daily ſhall he be praiſed. His Name ſhall endure forever, his Name ſhall be continued as long as the Sun."</p>
            <p>BUT chiefly thou, O <hi>America,</hi> mayeſt well rejoice, the Children of <hi>New-England</hi> may be glad and triumph, in Reflection on Events paſt, and Proſpect of the future. Encompaſſed with native Savages, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having eſcaped from Oppreſſion, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt felt by pious Minds, carried their Lives in their Hands, ſubjected to Captivities, to inhuman Cruelties and Maſſacres Encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with crafty, faithleſs <hi>Europeans,</hi> who ſought their Ruin, what Proſpect could they have before them. The dearer and more valuable the Rights they had earned, the more gloomy the Fore-thought of loſing

them. And if we their Offspring, call to Mind the Ideas which poſſeſſed us in the Year I756, with what Exultation muſt we ſing, "The Snare is broken and we are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped."</p>
            <p>NOW commences the AEra of our quiet Enjoyment of thoſe Liberties, which our Fathers purchaſed with the Toil of their whole Lives, their Treaſure, their Blood. Safe from the Enemy of the Wilderneſs, ſafe from the griping Hand of arbitrary Sway and cruel Superſtition; Here ſhall be the late founded Seat of Peace and Freedom. Here ſhall our indulgent Mother, who has moſt generouſly reſcued and protected us, be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and honoured by growing Numbers, with all Duty, Love and Gratitude, till Time ſhall be no more. Here ſhall be a perennial Source of her Strength and Riches. Here ſhall Arts and Sciences, the Companions of Tranquility, flouriſh. Here ſhall her new Subjects and their Poſterity, bleſs the Day, when their imagined Enemies Victories proved to them the Beginning of the moſt valuable Freedom. Here ſhall dwell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted Faith, the pure Worſhip of GOD, in its primitive Simplicity, unawed,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009334_0044_1030E93034FA9770"/>
uninterrupted; here ſhall it extend itſelf and its benign Influences among thoſe who have hitherto "ſat in Darkneſs, in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and under the Shadow of Death." "Truth ſhall ſpring out of the Earth, and Righteouſneſs ſhall look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yea the Lord ſhall give that which is is good; Righteouſneſs ſhall go before him, and ſhall ſet us in the Way of his Steps."</p>
            <p>O that neither we, nor thoſe who come after us, may wantonly forfeit theſe Bleſſings and theſe Hopes; but by a wiſe Uſe of our diſtinguiſhed Privileges, a moderate and virtuous Enjoyment of the Bleſſings of Peace, and ſteady living up to the Maxims of our holy Religion, may derive upon ourſelves and ours, the Continuance of them; for "the Mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting, upon them that fear him, and his Righteouſneſs unto Children's Children, to ſuch as keep his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandments, to do them."</p>
