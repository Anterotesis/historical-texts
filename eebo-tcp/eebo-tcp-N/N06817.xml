            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>RULES of <hi>Succeſs</hi> in TRADE.</head>
            <p>MY latter years have been ſpent moſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the trading part of mankind; and I have received many obligations from them: and I think myſelf bound to do them this right, to let the world know, that I have found more honour and gratitude, more clearneſs and integrity amongſt this ſort of men, than I ever could amongſt others, whoſe quality and education raiſed my expectations higher: it will be therefore no ſmall ſatisfaction to me, if any endeavours of mine can render them any conſiderable ſervice.</p>
            <p>There is no condition of life free from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and difficulties, apt to embroil our happineſs, and infect our innocence, and therefore neither this of traders; the evils they are ſubject to, may be reduced to two heads; their miſcarrying in trade, or in religion. I will therefore begin with ſuch rules as may ſerve to prevent the former, and then proceed to ſuch as concern the latter.</p>
            <p>If we trace the ruin of ſuch as fail or break, back to its original, we ſhall find it generally to be either idleneſs or pride. Idleneſs, the parent of all ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh vices; pride, the parent of expenſive follies and ruinous projects. I will therefore lay down theſe two rules as the foundations of the trader's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular proſperity. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he muſt be diligent and induſtrious. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he muſt not be above his profeſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:008643_0003_102FA57D25D15DB0"/>1. He muſt be diligent and induſtrious. You ſeem born for induſtry; and though ſome pretend to be ſent into the world only to enjoy a fortune, it is plain you are firſt to raiſe one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tho' there may be ſome fortunate men in the world, that ſeem to thrive rather by chance than virtue, and owe more to the care of others than their own; yet, I am ſure, in the ordinary methods of providence, diligence and induſtry are the high-way to wealth and plenty; virtue and ſobriety to wiſe and ſecure enjoyments. And I know not with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence men can promiſe themſelves the bleſſing and favour of God on any other terms. He has made nothing on purpoſe to be idle and uſeleſs: the heavenly bodies never ceaſe to yield their light and influence, nor the terreſtrial ones their fruit. We ourſelves do ſubſiſt by a continual motion; and ſhould our blood and ſpirits grow dull and ſluggiſh, our life muſt needs expire with their activity. <hi>Man is born to labour as the ſparks fly upward;</hi> our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities and endowments deſtine and urge us to it, the neceſſities and wants of this needy beggarly ſtate (in which nature, how kind ſoever it was to the golden age, does not furniſh us with any thing, without art and induſtry) exact and demand it, and the laws of human ſociety oblige us to it: for it is but fit that every one ſhould contribute his ſhot for the entertainment of the publick; and that he ſhould not, like a drone, be feaſted and maintained by the labour and travail of others. And ſo far, laſtly, is Chriſtianity from abrogating this law of nature, that it earneſtly enforces it. <hi>Let ours learn to maintain good works for neceſſary uſes, that they be not unfruitful;</hi> that is, that they be not a ſhame
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008643_0004_102FA57F1E68D210"/>
and burden to themſelves and families, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or Chriſtian profeſſion. Propoſe not then (I addreſs myſelf here to apprentices and beginners) propoſe not to exempt yourſelves from that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal law of labour and travail to which the whole creation is ſubject; you eſpecially who lie under more immediate and particular obligations to it. It is an unaccountable folly for one, who is to make his fortune in the world, to apply himſelf to trade, rather as a diverſion than a buſineſs, and to deſign it only as a ſupport and fund for ſloth and luxury. It is madneſs and phrenſie in any one to propoſe to be Maſter of his time before he is Maſter of his trade; and to indulge his pleaſures, before he has made proviſion to defray the expence of them; and yet this, I doubt, is too, too general a practice. Whereas, would young men conſider the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they would find that they do but prevent their pleaſures, by gathering them before they are ripe; and do but make their troubles and vexations end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by indulging their eaſe and lazineſs too ſoon. Contradictious projects! to propoſe at once to live idly, and yet to thrive! to live pleaſurably, and grow rich! it is true, there are many traders, who live in much eaſe and plenty, and make a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome figure in the world, and it is but fit there ſhould be ſuch. Trade is the ſupport and ornament of kingdoms; and no man of ſenſe will any more envy the man of trade his wealth, than the man of the ſword his honour, or the man of letters and abilities his places and preferments. But, if I could, I would have men grow up to all theſe by labour and induſtry, by an apprenticeſhip of ſobriety and virtue. I would have enjoyment be the reward of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008643_0005_102FA580E0C9FF48"/>
merit. I would not have eaſe and pleaſure be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed by the looſe and unworthy; but regularly poſſeſſed by ſuch as have taken pains to purchaſe both, and have ſenſe, experience, and virtue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to enjoy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The trader muſt not be above his call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Pride and vanity are generally ſworn ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both to the content and proſperity of traders; but then it muſt be remembred, ſome are but lightly tinged, others more thoroughly and deeply dyed with theſe vices. In ſome they produce only little comical affectations and almoſt innocent excurſions; but in others, very fatal diſorders and irregularities. There is no gracefulneſs in any motion that is not natural. A man of low ſtature may add ſomething to his height, but nothing to his comelineſs, by ſtrutting upon ſtilts. Nor is there only an ungrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, but an uneaſineſs in all affected motions. We are all a little purblind and dim-ſighted in this world; and therefore walk more ſecurely in the ways we are acquainted with. But, for my part, when an error is only comical, and expoſes men no further than to a little raillery and cenſure, it is ſcarce worth my while to preſcribe to it; and I cannot tell whether it be worth every man's while to be at the charge of correcting a humour, which if it do a little expoſe him, does yet pleaſe him too. The pride and ambition which I would extirpate, is ſuch a one as I have obſerved fatal to the tradeſman's fortune and repoſe; ſuch as tempts him to deſpiſe and neglect his trade, or puts him upon expences which it cannot maintain, or engages him in bold or hazardous projects. This is an error which I
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008643_0006_102FA58268C4FB30"/>
would fain reform; and methinks a few ſober re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections ſhould here prevail. What, can it be ſenſe to make a ſhew abroad, at the expence of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and peace at home? what, is it not much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be modeſt and ſafe, to be humble and at eaſe, than to ſuffer daily anxieties and perplexities, and to have your mind always upon the rack, how to anſwer and ſatisfy the importunities of pride and vanity? It is worſe yet when a ſhort piece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry ends in perpetual infamy; when this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunant humour is nouriſhed by robbery and injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by fraud and cheat, committed upon widows and orphans, acquaintance and friends, and the neareſt relations. I muſt confeſs, I am amazed to think, that any one's pride ſhould be tickled by a falſe and fatal grandeur, upheld only by wrong and injuſtice, and reſolving in a moment into indelible ſhame and unretrievable ruin. For my part, I ſhould in this caſe look upon bravery, not as the marks of greatneſs, but ornaments of a ſacrifice; not as the pomp of a triumph, but a funeral; and my luſcious morſels, how pleaſing ſoever to my palate, would be ready to riſe and recoil in my ſtomach. As to thoſe who ſeem to ſcorn their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, I have but this to ſay. Let them find out a more thriving one before they leave the old one, before they deſert the profeſſion they were bred to, for its meanneſs. Let them make ſure of a more honourable employment; or elſe the ſcorn they load their trade with, will be want of ſenſe, not greatneſs of ſpirit; a lazy pride, not a generous ambition. And, if ſo, I am ſure there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſo mean as that of ſloth and looſeneſs.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The ſecond ſort of rules are ſuch as concern the religion of the trader or artiſan: for it is to little purpoſe that he thrive in his ſecular, if he run out in his Chriſtian calling; for this is to be fortunate, and yet miſerable. Therefore,

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That his attendance on the buſineſs of this world, do not extinguiſh his concern for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and his trade devour his religion, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s lean kine did the fat ones.</item>
                  <item>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> He muſt be ſure that his calling be lawful; that is, ſuch as is neither forbidden by any law of God, or the magiſtrate, nor does, in its own nature, miniſter to vice. But that I may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex mens minds with unneceſſary ſcruples, and tempt them to doubt of the lawfulneſs of all trades, that are any way made the inſtruments of ſin and folly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you muſt know, ſome things miniſter to ſin directly and neceſſarily; others only accidentally, and not by the immediate intention of the artiſt or trader, but the abuſe of others. The former ſort of trades are unlawful in themſelves, and no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can ſanctify the uſe of them: he that directly and immediately miniſters to a ſin, communicates
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008643_0008_102FA58713918580"/>
in the guilt of it; as he that purveys for the luſt of others, partakes of the ſin of the adulterer and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator: but thoſe which miniſter not purpoſely and immediately, but accidentally, are yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves lawful. Nor ſhall the trader communicate in thoſe abuſes to which the luſts and vanities of others proſtitute them. Thus taverns are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, becauſe abuſed by intemperance; nor are all ſhops of clothing to be ſhut, becauſe thence peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple furniſh themſelves with ſuch things as inflame their immodeſty and pride: the reaſon is plainly this, becauſe the ſin may be ſeparated from the trade; that wine, whoſe full draughts are by ſome made uſe of to the defacing reaſon and enkindling luſt, may as well refreſh the weary and delight the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; thoſe garments which adorn the proud and wanton, may be made uſe of to add a luſtre to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The inconvenience would be inſufferable, if every profeſſion which did but indirectly and caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adminiſter to vice, were therefore ſinful: the courts of juſtice muſt be laid aſide, becauſe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the bar and bench have contributed to oppreſs, injure, and rob in form of law. The pulpit muſt be forever ſilenced, becauſe men have ſometimes ſown the ſeeds of ſedition and ſlavery from hence. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>il the arts, either of war or peace, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerved the cruelty of the one, and luxury of the other, and by conſequence would be baniſhed out of all commonwealths. Yet here it muſt be confeſſed, that the more or leſs tendency any trade hath to the promoting vice, it is in the ſame proportion the more or leſs comfortable. And that it imports men, who love their peace and happineſs more than gain, not to debauch their callings themſelves, by proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008643_0009_102FA58CD96CF110"/>
them to extravagancies and exorbitances: and projecting profit from the intemperances and ſins, that is, the ruin of others: for it is not ſufficient to the peace and comfort of a good man's mind, that his calling be innocent, if his conduct of it be not ſo too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Trade ought to be managed with truth, juſtice and charity: for without theſe it is only a more cleanly art of cheating or oppreſſion; ſins, which I doubt, can receive but little excuſe or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the cuſtom and practice of them: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe, trade cannot be regular and eaſy, nor gain comfortable and delightful; ſince no man can have any confidence in the protection of God, when the methods of his thriving are ſuch as merit ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, not a bleſſing. Nor can I ſee any thing that can betray men into lying and knavery, but the want of true ſenſe, as well as true faith; ſince tho' many by under ways have more ſuddenly enriched themſelves; yet it is evident, that the wealth which is more regularly purchaſed, is more pleaſant, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and laſting; and that honeſt and equitable dealing is the ſureſt, if not the ſpeedieſt way to wealth. Nor are there, I believe, many inſtances of men, who, if they underſtood their buſineſs, have ever ſuffered much by their uprightneſs and integrity in dealing; it being very hard to imagine, that a trader ſhould be a loſer by thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which advance credit and reputation. But however this be, I am not now enquiring after wealth, but happineſs; to the obtainment of which I am very poſitive, that the obſervation of theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures is indiſpenſible, ſince the contrary muſt needs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008643_0010_102FA58FEEA96F40"/>
pervert the mind, &amp; intangle life: and as they extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh in the ſoul all ſparks of honour and greatneſs; ſo muſt they its courage and confidence, tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and peace, which can reſult from nothing, but the due moderation of our affections, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our integrity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The trader's attendance on his calling muſt not diſcharge him from his attendance on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is true, it is commonly ſaid, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally admited that the duty of every one's ſecular calling is a part of religion; but this ought to be well underſtood, that ſo neither a veneration for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion breed a neglect of your callings, nor an over fond opinion of the merit of induſtry in your call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as if all virtue were compriſed in it) breed a contempt of religion: it is fit therefore to put you in mind, that arts and trades have not in themſelves any direct or immediate tendency, either to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provment of reaſon, or the production of virtue; they miniſter to the neceſſities of this world, not the glories of another; nor are they ſo much the works of a rational and ſpiritual, as of a mortal and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent being: from whence it follows, that tho' they are neceſſary to the preſent ſtate of things, yet can they deſerve to employ you no longer than either the public benefit or private convenience require it; and that you are then only wiſely taken up about theſe, when neither your endowments nor fortunes capacitate you for a relief more immediately and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſerviceable to the purpoſes of reaſon and reva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: and finally, that the works of a ſecular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are only acceptable ſacrifices to God, when conſecrated by wiſe principles and virtues cleaving
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008643_0011_102FA591757D7F28"/>
to and mingling with them. Do not therefore think, that a pretence of buſineſs can cancel your obligations to the duties of Chriſtianity. If a man could fanſie, which I never can, buſineſs and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion incompatible; it is evident which were to be preferred; ſince if God's will were ſo, it is much better to be ſtarved than to be damned. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carrying the matter ſo far, it is plain that virtue and religion, with a competency, render men abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more happy than wealth can do, if attended with the neglect or contempt of either: it is the riches of the mind make men great and happy; the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and irreligious can never be either. Let no man therefore think that he ſuffers any damage, if he muſt maintain his virtue and religion by the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his trade; tho' I cannot comprehend that there can be a neceſſity of this: for I have never yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any man ſo oppreſſed and overcharged with buſineſs, as not to find time for pleaſure, when he has pretended he could find none for religion. In a word, the neglect of religion is capable of no excuſe; not only becauſe your future, but preſent happineſs, depends upon it. Modeſty or moderation, to curb a vain and ambitious thirſt of wealth; faith or confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the providence of God, to reſtrain you from mean, baſe and unlawful courſes; ſelf-reſignation to prevent anxiety, and thoſe fears to which the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, changes and revolutions of times and trade make men ſubject, ſeem to me as neceſſary to the peace and happineſs of a trader, as a competent ſtock, induſtry or ſkill, can be to his worldly ſucceſs or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity: and tho' men who allow themſelves no time, either for attendance upon public religion, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meditation, may talk finely of theſe virtues by
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008643_0012_102FA59563844900"/>
way of notion and ſpeculation, it is impoſſible they ſhould be really poſſeſſed of them. <hi>How can he get wiſdom that holdeth the plough, and that glorieth in the good, that driveth oxen, and is occupied in their labours, and whoſe talk is of bullocks?</hi> which the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> by a parity of reaſon, extends further to all traders and artiſans, who are in like manner wholly taken up in their art. I could there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſh that thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>What ſhall it profit a man, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul,</hi> were writ in capital letters in the moſt conſpicuous place of the counting houſe, and the ſhop, that you might ever and anon be put in mind, that there is one thing more neceſſary, even than the diligent and proſperous management of the trade, namely, religion. For to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it, that your books are well kept, that there is order and regularity in the whole conduct of your trades, if at the ſame time your neglected hearts lie, like the field of the ſluggard waſte, and open, and over-grown with briers, and thorns, and weeds; or like the confuſed ſtock of a careleſs or unſkiful trader, which waſtes and decays each day? to what purpoſe is it that you be punctual dealers towards men, if you be bankrupts towards God? to what purpoſe is it that you have credit and honour upon the <hi>Change,</hi> if you be poor and beggarly, ſhameful and ſneaking in yourſelves within, having your ſouls deſtitue of any true peace, wealth or courage; and ſhift the accuſations and importunities of conſcience, as much as a wretched debtor would a ſevere and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable creditor? ah! while you purſue the world, forget not that there is a heaven; and while you make proviſion for time, make ſome too for eternity:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008643_0013_102F74BF5D983F88"/>
let your ſtating your accounts with men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> put you in mind of clearing your accounts with God; and let theſe two things never be out of your thoughts; firſt, that it is God who gives man power to get wealth; and next, that it is not a clear eſtate, but a clear ſoul that makes man happy; I mean, a ſoul freed from ſilly and vile affections, and enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a knowledge and love of God and goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The trader muſt propoſe to himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and rational ends of trading: for whoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to himſelf vain and falſe ones, will entangle his life in manifold troubles and temptations, and loſe his reaſon religion and tranquility, in the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and mazes of wretched fancies and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble projects. The ends of trading I take to be theſe: <hi>Firſt,</hi> a competent and honeſt ſupport of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families. <hi>Secondly,</hi> a charitable ſuccour and relief of others. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> a timely retreat from a ſecular calling, to a contemplative life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A competent and honeſt ſupport of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families. This end is pointed out by the Apoſtle, Tit. 3.14. and called neceſſary uſes, <hi>i.e.</hi> we muſt deſign in trade the ſupport of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not luſts of nature. And were not all trades over-ſtocked, and conſequently the obſervation ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, I ſhould tell you, that public as well as private neceſſities, were here to be underſtood. Nor is your care here limited to your own neceſſities on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but thoſe alſo for your children and poſterity demand their ſhare in it; but then, leſt under this pretence you extend your deſires beyond all bounds, you are to remember, that in reſolving the meaſures
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008643_0014_102FA59BF1B3CCF8"/>
of this proviſion, you are not to take counſel of your own ambition, or the wanton expectations of your children; that proviſion for them is wiſeſt, which lays a ſufficient foundation for their induſtry to build on, and leaves them under an obligation to buſineſs and employment. And is not this enough? to what purpoſe ſhould men toil, cark, and pinch, to make their families rich and great, that is, lazy and wanton, to leave them an eſtate which their own example proves more than neceſſary; for moſt of thoſe that do ſo, have made little uſe of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: miſtake me not; I do not think it unlawful to be rich, or to leave one's family ſo; but I think it fooliſh and ſinful too, to ſacrifice the peace of one's mind, and the eaſe of one's life, to the luſt of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: I think it ſilly and vitious to raiſe a family by meanneſs and ſordidneſs, or to lay the foundation of children's greatneſs in one's infamy. In ſhort it is not wealth but an inordinate paſſion for it, which I condemn: proſperity is the gift of God, a common reward of Chriſtian virtues: for Chriſtianity is ſaid to <hi>have the promiſes of this life and that which is to come.</hi> Wealth then may be received, but it muſt not be deſigned as your firſt and chief end. Thus fame, honour, and power, are great bleſſings and favours of heaven; but whoever immoderately thirſts after the one or the other is ambitious and vain glorious. You may receive temporal good things with gratitude, and enjoy them with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; but if you dote upon them, you violate the vow of your baptiſm, and virtually renounce your faith: for would not this be to forget that heaven were your kingdom and country, and earth the place of your exile, or, at beſt, pilgrimage? This is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008643_0015_102FA59F127B3F38"/>
that leſſon which cannot be too often inculcated: not only on the account of that violent oppoſition it is almoſt every where encountred with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo the vaſt importance it is of, to the quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a trading life: this one thing is the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy the trader ſhould be ever ſtudying, the wiſdom he ſhould be daily purſuing; that is, a true and juſt moderation of his deſires of wealth. Did man know how to bound his deſires by the neceſſities or conveniences of human life; could he regulate his appetites by the modeſty and moderation of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, not by cuſtom and fancy; I am confident, this one thing alone would reſcue him from the far greater part of evil incumbrances which infeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life: vanity and ambition, envy and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wantonneſs and fancy, create moſt of thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and neceſſities which ſtain the beauty, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the peace and order, and deſtroy the pleaſure of life. When men's deſires and aims are too big for their callings, they are unavoidably plunged into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and doubtful projects; and if they ſink not finally into ruin, they cannot be held up but by ſuch an anxious and reſtleſs perſecution of the world, as looks rather like hurry or diſtraction, than trade or employment. I can therefore never think a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happy, till he has modeſty enough to find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in the revenue of a moderate and eaſy trade; till he underſtands what are the bounds his nature and his ſtation ſets him; tho' he know how to enjoy a great fortune, does never want one; has ſenſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to uſe it, and virtue enough not to let his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depend upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> A charitable ſuccor and relief of others.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008643_0016_102FA5A09D26A198"/>
It is confeſſed by all, that men are born, not for themſelves only, but for others too; and God, the diſpenſer of temporal wealth, commands ſuch as are rich in this world, to be rich in good works too: but it is always to be provided, that juſtice do firſt take place, and then charity. This direction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſes the trader's accounts to ſtand fair; it ſuppoſes him to have diſcharged the duties which he owes to his relatives and dependents, or elſe to have none. I will not inſiſt on the obligation or pleaſure of charity; I will not preſs you to it by the intereſt of your preſent, and future happineſs: for the truth is, to do right to the trading world, there is no rank or order of men in the kingdom, that is more ſenſible of the duty of charity, or more inclin'd and diſpoſed to it; none that give more eminent proofs of it while living, or leave more glorious monuments of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. One thing only I will take upon me to recommend to you; that is, the advice of <hi>Solomon; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> findeth to do, do it with thy might: for there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wiſdom, in the grave whither thou goeſt:</hi> that is, whatever good you deſign to do, do it ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily as much as in you lies, be your own executors. How often are excellent purpoſes ſtrangled in the birth by an unexpected death! how frequently are they perverted by the corruption and negligence of thoſe to whoſe inſpection they are committed! be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this way you ſhall reap the fruit of your own plantations you will enjoy the pleaſure and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſulting from the perfection, beauty, and good contrivance of the foundation you have laid; or you will be able to ſupply the defects, or correct the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of your model, and prevent thoſe future miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008643_0017_102FA5A2251560B0"/>
which ſuch deſigns are liable to. Tho' all this be very much, yet it is but the leaſt part of what you will reap from being yourſelves the executors of your own bounty; you will be ſure that you dedicate it to charity, not vanity; that you are building alms-houſes for the living, not tombs and pyramids for the dead; you will eſcape the common cheat and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture the rich put upon themſelves while they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelves in covetouſneſs all their lives, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of deſigning mighty things after death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The tradeſman ought to propoſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a timely retreat, <hi>i. e.</hi> if the neceſſities of this indigent ſtate will give way to it; which ſeems to me natural, to finiſh buſineſs before we finiſh life; to lay down our burthen before we tire and fall under the weight of it; and quit troubleſome em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, before our bungling diſcharge of them proclaim the decay of our parts and ſtrength, and the increaſe of our avarice and ambition: nay, the very continuance of the ſame cares for the world, which looked before like prudence, will, in old age, be reckoned ſin and folly. To trade, is but to make proviſion for life; and therefore ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe will tell us, that we muſt not be always providing for life, and never live; it is plain men ought, if they can, at length break off their trade, or at leaſt ſo contract it, that it may be rather diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion than labour. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſends us to the ants to learn induſtry, ſo might he to learn wiſdom too; the enjoyment of their treaſure in winter being no leſs an inſtance of the one, than their labour of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it up in the ſummer, of the other. Beſides, in ripe years, the advice of the prophet ſeems to be
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008643_0018_102FA5A4EACE7730"/>
addreſſed to every man: <hi>Set thy houſe in order, for thou ſhalt die, and not live.</hi> State your accounts, ſettle your fortune, compoſe the differences of your family, and fix your children, ſo that you may be able to diſcern what courſe they will ſteer when you are gone, and to correct any error they are apt to fall into, while you live, which may otherwiſe, when you are dead, prove incorrigible and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. If theſe motives, taken from decency, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and morality, ſeem too light, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of more weight and moment behind; that is, the conſideration of your eternal intereſt. It is highly neceſſary to leave the world before you be torn from it, and to acquaint yourſelves more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly with another world, before you paſs into it, to make your abode in it for ever. Certainly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome time to prepare the ſoul for death and judgment; and that man will be very unfit for either, who is carried from the counter to the grave, and from the intanglements of ſecular cares to the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of God. But beſides the benefits which you will find in retirement, the proſpect and propoſal of it has many in it; the hopes of a ſabbatic year in life, will eaſe the weight and travail of thoſe that precede it; and a deſign of retreating from trade and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will be apt to induce men to paſs their firſt years with more moderation and abſtinence, that they may the ſooner provide the means of an eaſy or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable retirement.</p>
            <p>Theſe rules well obſerved, would free the negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating life from all the great evils and inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it is ſubject to. Buſineſs, as it was in the time of innocence, would be, not the curſe, but the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008643_0019_102FA5A815DA19D8"/>
of mankind; and trade would be as eaſy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if not as pleaſant, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Huſbandry in his garden: for thus induſtry would be without drudgery, and care without anxiety; commerce would be carried on without any mean or ill artifice, without impatient and tormenting deſigns, of tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and vexatious diſappointments. What need would there be of ſhifts and equivocaitions, of fraud and circumvention, if a man had ſaith enough to believe, that God's bleſſing upon his induſtry were the only way to grow truly rich; I mean, to get, if not ſo much as he would, yet as much as would be good for him? what temptation would men lie under to bondage and drudgery, or to perplexity and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, if he could contain his deſires within thoſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row bounds which nature and his ſtation have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed him? what fears could diſquiet the mind, which were formed into an intire reſignation to, and dependence upon God? or, how could the world in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare that ſoul, which allots a proper time for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic religion, and private meditation? in a word, theſe rules being followed, men would not only avoid the common rocks on which the happineſs and fortune of the trader generally daſhes, but alſo attain the end of this ſort of active life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would get eſtates in their younger years, and enjoy them in their riper: nay, no portion of life would want its proper and ſeaſonable enjoyments; they would in the midſt of buſineſs preſerve their innocence, and when they did retire from it, they would perfect that religion which they could before but begin; and enrich, and adorn, and entertain the ſoul, which they could but guard and defend before, and ſcarcely maintain in life; I mean, ſpiritual life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
