            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MANY ſelections of excellent matter have lately been made for the benefit of young perſons. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of this kind are of ſo great utility, that freſh productions of them, and new attempts to improve the young mind, will ſcarcely be deemed ſuperfluous, if the writer make his compilation inſtructive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, and ſufficiently diſtinct from others.</p>
            <p>THE preſent work, as the title expreſſes, aims at the attainment of three objects: to improve youth in the art of reading; to meliorate their language and ſentiments; and to inculcate ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant principles of piety and virtue.</p>
            <p>THE pieces ſelected, not only give exerciſe to a great variety of emotions, and the correſpondent tones and variations of voice, but contain ſentences and members of ſentences, which are diverſified, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and pointed with accuracy. Exerciſes of this nature are, it is preſumed, well calculated to teach youth to read with propriety and effect. A ſelection of ſentences, in which variety and proportion, with exact punctuation, have been carefully, obſerved, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all their parts as well as with reſpect to one another, will probably have a much greater effect, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> properly teaching the art of reading, than is commonly imagined.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:035851_0005_1007AA452AA655C0"/>
In ſuch conſtructions, every thing is accommodated to the underſtanding and the voice; and the common dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in learning to read well, are obviated. When the learner has acquired a habit of reading ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, with juſtneſs and facility, he will readily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that habit, and the improvements he has made, to ſentences more complicated and irregular, and of a conſtruction entirely different.</p>
            <p>THE language of the pieces choſen for this collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has been carefully regarded. Purity, propriety, perſpicuity, and, in many inſtances, elegance of diction, diſtinguiſh them. They are extracted from the works of the moſt correct and elegant writers. From the ſources whence the ſentiments are drawn, the reader may expect to find them connected and regular, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently important and impreſſive, and diveſted of every thing that is either trite or eccentric. The frequent peruſal of ſuch compoſition, naturally tends to infuſe a taſte for this ſpecies of excellence; and to produce a habit of thinking, and of compoſing, with judgment and accuracy.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Grammatical Student, in his progreſs through this work, will meet with numerous inſtances of compoſition, in ſtrict conformity to the rules for promoting perſpicuous and elegant writing, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Appendix to the Author's Engliſh Grammar. By occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally examining this conformity, he will be confirmed in the utility of thoſe rules; and be enabled to apply them with caſe and dexterity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THAT this collection may alſo ſerve the purpoſe of promoting piety and virtue, the Compiler has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced many extracts, which place religion in the moſt amiable light; and which recommend a great variety
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:035851_0006_1007AA47AD09C518"/>
of moral duties, by the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. Theſe ſubjects are exhibited in a ſtyle and manner, which are calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to arreſt the attention of youth; and to make ſtrong and durable impreſſions on their minds.<note n="*" place="bottom">In ſome of the pieces, the Compiler has made a few alterations, chiefly verbal, to adapt them the better to the deſign of his work.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Compiler has been careful to avoid every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſentiment, that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the leaſt degree, offend the eye or ear of innocence. This he conceives to be peculiarly incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every perſon who writes for the benefit of youth. It would, indeed, be a great and happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in education, if no writings were allowed to come under their notice, but ſuch as are perfectly innocent; and if, on all proper occaſions, they were encouraged to peruſe thoſe which tend to inſpire a due reverence for virtue, and an abhorrence of vice, as well as to animate them with ſentiments of piety and goodneſs. Such impreſſions deeply engraven on their minds, and connected with all their attainments, could ſcarcely fail of attending them through life; and of producing a ſolidity of principle and character, that would be able to reſiſt the danger ariſing from future intercourſe with the world.</p>
            <p>THE Author has endeavoured to relieve the grave and ſerious parts of his collection, by the occaſional admiſſion of pieces which amuſe as well as inſtruct. If, however, any of his readers ſhould think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains too great a proportion of the former, it may be
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:035851_0007_1007AA4C1B8C7998"/>
ſome apology, to obſerve that, in the exiſting publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſigned for the peruſal of young perſons, the preponderance is greatly on the ſide of gay and amuſing productions. Too much attention may be paid to this medium of improvement. When the imagination, of youth eſpecially, is much entertained, the ſober dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the underſtanding are regarded with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; and the influence of the good affections, is either feeble, or tranſient. A temperate uſe of ſuch entertainment ſeems therefore requiſite, to afford pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſcope for the operations of the underſtanding and the heart.</p>
            <p>THE reader will perceive, that the Compiler has been ſolicitous to recommend to young perſons, the peruſal of the ſacred Scriptures, by interſperſing through his work, ſome of the moſt beautiful and intereſting paſſages of thoſe invaluable writings. To excite an early taſte and veneration for this great rule of life, is a point of ſo high importance, as to warrant the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to promote it on every proper occaſion.</p>
            <p>To improve the young mind, and to afford ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to tutors, in the arduous and important work of education, were the motives which led to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. If the Author ſhould be ſo ſucceſsful as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh theſe ends, even in a ſmall degree, he will think his time and pains well employed, and himſelf amply rewarded.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION. OBSERVATIONS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF GOOD READING.</head>
            <p>TO read with propriety is a pleaſing and important at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; productive of improvement both to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the heart. It is eſſential to a complete reader, that he minutely perceive the ideas, and enter into the feelings, of the author whoſe ſentiments he profeſſes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat; for how is it poſſible to repreſent clearly to others, what we have but faint or inaccurate conceptions of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? If there were no other benefits reſulting from the art of reading well, than the neceſſity it lays us under, of preciſely aſcertaining the meaning of what we read; and the habit thence acquired, of doing this with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, both when reading ſilently and aloud, they would conſtitute a ſufficient compenſation for all the labour we can beſtow upon the ſubject. But the pleaſure derived to ourſelves and others, from a clear communication of ideas and feelings; and the ſtrong and durable impreſſions made thereby on the minds of the reader and the audience, are conſiderations, which give additional importance to the ſtudy of this neceſſary and uſeful art. The perfect attainment
<note place="bottom">For many of the obſervations contained in this preliminary tract, the Author is indebted to the writings of Dr. Blair, and to the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</note>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:035851_0009_1007AA5291C1B338"/>
of it doubtleſs requires great attention and practice, joined to extraordinary natural powers: but as there are many degrees of excellence in the art, the ſtudent whoſe aims fall ſhort of perfection, will find himſelf amply rewarded for every exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he may think proper to make.</p>
            <p>To give rules for the management of the voice in reading, by which the neceſſary pauſes, emphaſis, and tones, may be diſcovered and put in practice, is not poſſible. After all the directions that can be offered on theſe points, much will remain to be taught by the living inſtructer: much will be attainable by no other means, than the force of example influencing the imitative powers of the learner. Some rules and principles on theſe heads will, however, be found uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to prevent erroneous and vicious modes of utterance; to give the young reader ſome taſte of the ſubject; and to aſſiſt him in acquiring a juſt and accurate mode of delivery. The obſervations which we have to make, for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, may be compriſed under the following heads: PROPER LOUDNESS OF VOICE; DISTINCTNESS; SLOWNESS; PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIETY OF PRONUNCIATION; EMPHASIS; TONES; PAUSES; and MODE OF READING VERSE.</p>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECTION 1. Proper Loudneſs of Voice.</head>
               <p>THE firſt attention of every perſon who reads to others, doubtleſs, muſt be, to make himſelf be heard by all thoſe to whom he reads. He muſt endeavour to fill with his voice the ſpace occupied by the company. This power of voice, it may be thought, is wholly a natural talent. It is, in a good meaſure, the gift of nature; but it may receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable aſſiſtance from art. Much depends, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on the proper pitch and management of the voice.
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:035851_0010_1007AA541BB48780"/>
Every perſon has three pitches in his voice; the HIGH, the MIDDLE, and the LOW one. The high, is that which he uſes in calling aloud to ſome perſon at a diſtance. The low is, when he approaches to a whiſper. The middle is, that which he employs in common converſation, and which he ſhould generally uſe in reading to others. For it is a great miſtake, to imagine that one muſt take the higheſt pitch of his voice, in order to be well heard in a large company. This is confounding two things which are different, loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſtrength of ſound, with the key or note on which we ſpeak. There is a variety of ſound within the compaſs of each key. A ſpeaker may therefore render his voice louder, without altering the key: and we ſhall always be able to give moſt body, moſt perſevering force of ſound, to that pitch of voice, to which in converſation we are accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed. Whereas, by ſetting out on our higheſt pitch or key, we certainly allow ourſelves leſs compaſs, and are likely to ſtrain our voice before we have done. We ſhall fatigue ourſelves, and read with pain; and whenever a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſpeaks with pain to himſelf, he is always heard with pain by his audience. Let us therefore give the voice full ſtrength and ſwell of ſound; but always pitch it on our ordinary ſpeaking key. It ſhould be a conſtant rule, never to utter a greater quantity of voice, than we can afford without pain to ourſelves, and without any extraordinary effort. As long as we keep within theſe bounds, the oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> organs of ſpeech will be at liberty to diſcharge their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> offices with eaſe; and we ſhall always have our voice under command. But whenever we tranſgreſs theſe bounds, we give up the reins, and have no longer any management of it. It is a uſeful rule too, in order to be well heard, to fix our eye on ſome of the moſt diſtant perſons in the company, and to conſider ourſelves as reading to them. We naturally and mechanically utter our words with ſuch a degree of
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:035851_0011_1007AA5880DCCF58"/>
ſtrength, as to make ourſelves be heard by the perſon whom we addreſs, provided he is within the reach of our voice. As this is the caſe in converſation, it will hold alſo in reading to others. But let us remember, that in reading as well as in converſation, it is poſſible to offend by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too loud. This extreme hurts the car, by making the voice come upon it in rumbling indiſtinct maſſes.</p>
               <p>By the habit of reading, when young, in a loud and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement manner, the voice becomes fixed in a ſtrained and unnatural key; and is rendered incapable of that variety of elevation and depreſſion, which conſtitutes the true har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of utterance, and affords caſe to the reader, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to the audience. This unnatural pitch of the voice, and diſagreeable monotony, are moſt obſervable in perſons who were taught to read in large rooms; who were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſtand at too great diſtance, when reading to their teachers; whoſe inſtructers were very imperfect in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; or who were taught by perſons, that conſidered loud expreſſion as the chief requiſite in forming a good reader. Theſe are circumſtances which demand the ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every one to whom the education of youth is committed.</p>

               <p>IN the next place, to being well heard and clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, diſtinctneſs of articulation contributes more than mere loudneſs of ſound. The quantity of ſound neceſſary to fill even a large ſpace, is ſmaller than is commonly imagined: and, with diſtinct articulation, a perſon with a weak voice will make it reach farther, than the ſtrongeſt voice can reach without it. To this, therefore, every reader ought to pay
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:035851_0012_1007AA5B19FA5460"/>
great attention. He muſt give every ſound which he utters, its due proportion; and make every ſyllable, and even every letter in the word which he pronounces, be heard diſtinctly; without ſlurring, whiſpering, or ſuppreſſing any of the proper ſounds.</p>
               <p>An accurate knowledge of the ſimple, elementary ſounds of the language, and a facility in expreſſing them, are ſo neceſſary to diſtinctneſs of expreſſion, that if the learner's attainments are, in this reſpect, imperfect, (and many there are in this ſituation,) it will be incumbent on his teacher, to carry him back to theſe primary articulations; and to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his progreſs, till he become perfectly maſter of them. It will be in vain to preſs him forward, with the hope of forming a good reader, if he cannot completely articulate every elementary ſound of the language.</p>

               <p>IN order to expreſs ourſelves diſtinctly, moderation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite with regard to the ſpeed of pronouncing. Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy of ſpeech confounds all articulation, and all mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is ſcarcely neceſſary to obſerve, that there may be alſo an extreme on the oppoſite ſide. It is obvious that a lifeleſs drawling manner of reading, which allows the minds of the hearers to be always outrunning the ſpeaker, muſt render every ſuch performance inſipid and fatiguing. But the extreme of reading too faſt is much more common; and requires the more to be guarded againſt, becauſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:035851_0013_1007912817AD7E30"/>
and it cannot be too much recommended to them. Such a pronunciation gives weight and dignity to the ſubject. It is a great aſſiſtance to the voice, by the pauſes and reſts which it allows it more eaſily to make; and it enables the reader to ſwell all his ſounds, both with more force and more harmony.</p>

               <p>AFTER the fundamental attentions to the pitch and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the voice, to diſtinct articulation, and to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per degree of ſlowneſs of ſpeech, what the young reader muſt, in the next place, ſtudy, is propriety of pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, giving to every word which he utters, that ſound which the beſt uſage of the language appropriates to it; in oppoſition to broad, vulgar, or provincial pronunciation. This is requiſite both for reading intelligibly, and for reading with correctneſs and eaſe. Inſtructions concerning this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle may beſt be given by the living teacher. But there is one obſervation, which it may not be improper here to make. In the Engliſh language, every word which conſiſts of more ſyllables than one, has one accented ſyllable. The accent reſts ſometimes on the vowel, ſometimes on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ant. The genius of the language, requires the voice to mark that ſyllable by a ſtronger percuſſion, and to paſs more ſlightly over the reſt. Now, after we have learned the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſeats of theſe accents, it is an important rule, to give every word juſt the ſame accent in reading as in common diſcourſe. Many perſons err in this reſpect. When they read to others, and with ſolemnity, they pronounce the ſyllables in a different manner from what they do at other times. They dwell upon them, and protract them; they
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:035851_0014_1007AA5D74E69E28"/>
multiply accents on the ſame word; from a miſtaken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it gives gravity and importance to their ſubject, and adds to the energy of their delivery. Whereas, this is one of the greateſt faults that can be committed in pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation: it makes what is called a pompous or mouthing manner; and gives an artificial affected air to reading, which detracts greatly both from its agreeableneſs, and its impreſſion.</p>
               <p>Sheridan and Walker have publiſhed dictionaries, for aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the true and beſt pronunciation of the words of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. By attentively conſulting them, particularly "Walker's Pronouncing Dictionary," the young reader will be much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, in his endeavours to attain a correct pronunciation of the words belonging to the Engliſh language.</p>

               <head>SECTION V. Emphaſis.</head>
               <p>BY Emphaſis is meant a ſtronger and fuller ſound of voice, by which we diſtinguiſh ſome word or words, on which we deſign to lay particular ſtreſs, and to ſhow how they affect the reſt of the ſentence. Sometimes the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic words muſt be diſtinguiſhed by a particular tone of voice, as well as by a particular ſtreſs. On the right ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the emphaſis depends the life of pronunciation. If no emphaſis be placed on any words, not only is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe rendered heavy and lifeleſs, but the meaning left often ambiguous. If the emphaſis be placed wrong, we pervert and confound the meaning wholly.</p>
               <p>Emphaſis may be divided into the SUPERIOR and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

preſuppoſed by the author as general knowledge, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves an ambiguity, where a paſſage may have more ſenſes than one. The inferior emphaſis <hi>enforces, graces,</hi> and <hi>enlivens,</hi> but does not <hi>fix,</hi> the meaning of any paſſage. The words to which this latter emphaſis is given, are, in general, ſuch as ſeem the moſt important in the ſentence, or, on other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, to merit this diſtinction. The following paſſage will ſerve to exemplify the ſuperior emphaſis.</p>

               <p>Suppoſing that originally other beings, beſides men, had diſobeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the circumſtance were well known to us, there would fall an emphaſis upon the word <hi>man's</hi> in the firſt line; and hence it would be read thus:

                  </q>

               </p>
               <p>Again, admitting death (as was really the caſe) to have been an unheard of and dreadful puniſhment, brought upon man in conſequence of his tranſgreſſion; on that ſuppoſition the third line would be read,

               </p>
               <p>But if we were to ſuppoſe, that mankind knew there was ſuch an evil as death in other regions, though the place they inhabited had been free from it till their tranſgreſſion, the line would run thus:

               <p>The ſuperior emphaſis, in reading as in ſpeaking, muſt be determined entirely by the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the paſſage, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made <hi>alike:</hi> but as to the inferior emphaſis, <hi>taſte</hi> alone ſeems to have the right of fixing its ſituation and quantity.</p>
               <p>Among a number of perſons, who have had proper oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of learning to read, in the beſt manner it is now taught, very few could be ſelected, who, in a given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, would uſe the inferior emphaſis alike, either as to place or quantity. Some perſons, indeed, uſe ſcarcely any degree of it: and others do not ſcruple to carry it much beyond any thing to be found in common diſcourſe; and even ſometimes throw it upon words ſo very trifling in themſelves, that it is evidently done with no other view,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:035851_0017_1007AA64DD13CD48"/>
than to give variety to the modulation.<note n="*" place="bottom">By modulation is meant that pleaſing variety of voice, which is perceived in uttering a ſentence, and which, in its nature, is perfectly diſtinct from emphaſis, and the tones of emotion and paſſion. The young reader ſhould be careful to render his modulation correct and eaſy; and, for this purpoſe, ſhould form it upon the model of the moſt judicious and accurate ſpeakers.</note> Notwithſtanding this diverſity of practice, there are certainly proper bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, within which this emphaſis muſt be reſtrained, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make it meet the approbation of ſound judgment and correct taſte. It will doubtleſs have different degrees of exertion, according to the greater or leſs degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the words upon which it operates; and there may be very properly ſome variety in the uſe of it; but its application is not arbitrary, depending on the caprice of readers.</p>
               <p>As emphaſis often falls on words in different parts of the ſame ſentence, ſo it is frequently required to be continued, with a little variation, on two, and ſometimes more words together. The following ſentences exemplify both the parts of this poſition: <q>If you ſeek to make one <hi>rich,</hi> ſtudy not to <hi>increaſe his ſtores,</hi> but to <hi>diminiſh, his deſires.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q>The Mexican figures, or picture-writing, repreſent <hi>things,</hi> not <hi>words:</hi> they exhibit <hi>images to the eye,</hi> not <hi>ideas to the underſtanding.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſentences are ſo full and comprehenſive, that almoſt every word is emphatical: as, "Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, "woods, and plains!" or, as that pathetic expoſtulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel, "Why will ye die!"</p>
               <p>Emphaſis, beſides its other offices, is the great regulator of quantity. Though the quantity of our ſyllables is fixed, in words ſeparately pronounced, yet it is mutable, when theſe words are ranged in ſentences; the long being changed
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:035851_0018_1007AA6764901798"/>
into ſhort, the ſhort into long, according to the importance of the words with regard to meaning. Emphaſis alſo, in particular caſes, alters the ſeat of the accent. This is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable from the following examples. <q>He ſhall <hi>in</hi>creaſe, but I ſhall <hi>de</hi>creaſe.</q> 
                  <q>There is a difference between giving and <hi>for</hi>giving.</q> 
                  <q>In this ſpecies of compoſition, <hi>plauſi</hi>bility is much more eſſential than <hi>prob</hi>ability.</q> In theſe examples, the emphaſis requires the accent to be placed on ſyllables, to which it does not commonly belong.</p>
               <p>In order to acquire the proper management of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, the great rule to be given, is, that the reader ſtudy to attain a juſt conception of the force and ſpirit of the ſentiments which he is to pronounce. For to lay the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis with exact propriety, is a conſtant exerciſe of good ſenſe and attention. It is far from being an inconſiderable attainment. It is one of the moſt deciſive trials of a true and juſt taſte; and muſt ariſe from feeling delicately our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and from judging accurately of what is fitteſt to ſtrike the feelings of others.</p>
               <p>There is one error, againſt which it is particularly proper to caution the learner; namely, that of multiplying em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical words too much, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the emphaſis indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately. It is only by a prudent reſerve and diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the uſe of them, that we can give them any weight. If they recur too often; if a reader attempts to render every thing he expreſſes of high importance, by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſtrong emphaſis, we ſoon learn to pay little regard to them. To crowd every ſentence with emphatical words, is like crowding all the pages of a book with Italic charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which, as to the effect, is juſt the ſame as to uſe no ſuch diſtinctions at all.</p>

               <p>TONES are different both from emphaſis and pauſes; conſiſting in the notes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> variations of ſound which we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, in the expreſſion of our ſentiments. Emphaſis affects particular words and phraſes, with a degree of tone or inflection of voice; but tones, peculiarly ſo called, affect ſentences, paragraphs, and ſometimes even the whole of a diſcourſe</p>
               <p>To ſhow the uſe and neceſſity of tones, we need only obſerve, that the mind, in communicating its ideas, is in a conſtant ſtate of activity, emotion, or agitation, from the different effects which thoſe ideas produce in the ſpeaker. Now the end of ſuch communication being, not merely to lay open the ideas, but alſo the different feelings which they excite in him who utters them, there muſt be other ſigns than words, to manifeſt thoſe feelings; as words ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a monotonous manner, can repreſent only a ſimilar ſtate of mind, perfectly free from all activity or emotion. As the communication of theſe internal feelings, was of much more conſequence in our ſocial intercourſe, than the mere conveyance of ideas, the Author of our being did not, as in that conveyance, leave the invention of the language of emotion, to man; but impreſſed it himſelf upon our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in the ſame manner as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> has done with regard to the reſt of the animal world; all of which expreſs their various feelings, by various tones. Ours, indeed, from the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior rank that we hold, are in a high degree more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; as there is not an act of the mind, an exertion of the fancy, or an emotion of the heart, which has not its
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:035851_0020_1007AA6AC3C09A10"/>
peculiar tone, or note of the voice, by which it is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; and which is ſuited exactly to the degree of internal feeling. It is chiefly in the proper uſe of theſe tones, that the life, ſpirit, beauty, and harmony of delivery conſiſt.</p>
               <p>The limits of this introduction, do not admit of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to illuſtrate the variety of tones belonging to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent paſſions and emotions. We ſhall, however, ſelect one, which is extracted from the beautiful lamentation of David over Saul and Jonathan, and which will, in ſome degree, elucidate what has been ſaid on this ſubject. <q>The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath; publiſh it not in the ſtreets of Aſkelon: leſt the daughters of the Philiſtines rejoice; leſt the daughters of the uncircumciſed triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the ſhield of the mighty was vilely caſt away; the ſhield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oyl.</q> The firſt of theſe diviſions, expreſſes ſorrow and lamentation; therefore the note is low. The next contains a ſpirited command, and ſhould be pronounced much higher. The other ſentence, in which he makes a pathetic addreſs to the mountains where his friends had been ſlain, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a note quite different from the two former; not ſo low as the firſt, nor ſo high as the ſecond, in a manly, firm, and yet plaintive tone.</p>
               <p>The correct and natural language of the emotions, is not ſo difficult to be attained, as moſt readers ſeem to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. If we enter into the ſpirit of the author's ſentiments, as well as into the meaning of his words, we ſhall not fail to deliver the words in properly varied tones. For there are few people, who ſpeak Engliſh without a provincial
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:035851_0021_1007AA6FEB96C870"/>
note, that have not an accurate uſe of tones, when they utter their ſentiments in earneſt diſcourſe. And the reaſon that they have not the ſame uſe of them, in reading aloud the ſentiments of others, may be traced to the very defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and erroneous method, in which the art of reading is taught; whereby all the various, natural, expreſſive tones of ſpeech, are ſuppreſſed; and a few artificial, unmeaning reading notes, are ſubſtituted for them.</p>
               <p>But when we recommend to readers, an attention to the tone and language of emotions, we muſt be underſtood to do it with proper limitation. Moderation is neceſſary in this point, as it is in other things. For when reading becomes ſtrictly imitative, it aſſumes a theatrical manner, and muſt be highly improper, as well as give offence to the hearers; becauſe it is inconſiſtent with that delicacy and modeſty, which are indiſpenſable on ſuch occaſions. The ſpeaker who delivers his own emotions, muſt be ſuppoſed to be more vivid and animated, than would be proper in the perſon who relates them at ſecond hand.</p>
               <p>We ſhall conclude this ſection with the following rule, for the tones that indicate the paſſions and emotions. <q>In read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let all your tones of expreſſion be borrowed from thoſe of common ſpeech, but, in ſome degree, more faintly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſed. Let thoſe tones which ſignify any diſagreeable paſſion of the mind, be ſtill more faint than thoſe which indicate agreeable emotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, on all occaſions, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve yourſelves ſo far from being affected with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as to be able to proceed through it, with that eaſy and maſterly manner, which has its good effects in this, as well as in every other art.</q>

               <p>PAUSES or reſts, in ſpeaking or reading, are a total ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the voice, during a perceptible, and, in many caſes, a meaſurable ſpace of time. Pauſes are equally neceſſary to the ſpeaker, and the hearer. To the ſpeaker, that he may take breath, without which he cannot proceed far in delivery; and that he may, by theſe temporary reſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the organs of ſpeech, which otherwiſe would be ſoon tired by continued action: to the hearer, that the ear alſo may be relieved from the fatigue, which it would otherwiſe endure from a continuity of ſound; and that the underſtanding may have ſufficient time to mark the diſtinction of ſentences, and their ſeveral members.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds of pauſes; firſt, emphatical pauſes; and next, ſuch as mark the diſtinctions of ſenſe. An em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical pauſe is generally made, <hi>after</hi> ſomething has been ſaid of peculiar moment, and on which we deſire to fix the hearer's attention. Sometimes, <hi>before</hi> ſuch a thing is ſaid, we uſher it in with a pauſe of this nature. Such pauſes have the ſame effect as a ſtrong emphaſis; and are ſubject to the ſame rules: eſpecially to the caution, of not repeating them too frequently. For as they excite uncommon attention, and of courſe raiſe expectation, if the importance of the matter be not fully anſwerable to ſuch expectation, they occaſion diſappointment and diſguſt.</p>
               <p>But the moſt frequent and the principal uſe of pauſes, is, to mark the diviſions of the ſenſe, and at the ſame time to allow the reader to draw his breath; and the proper and delicate adjuſtment of ſuch pauſes, is one of the moſt nice
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:035851_0023_1007AA747077D258"/>
and difficult articles of delivery. In all reading, the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>h requires a good deal of care, ſo as not to oblige us to divide words from one another, which have ſo intimate a connexion, that they ought to be pronounced with the ſame breath, and without the leaſt ſeparation. Many a ſentence is miſerably mangled, and the force of the emphaſis totally loſt, by diviſions being made in the wrong place. To avoid this, every one, while he is reading, ſhould be very careful to provide a full ſupply of breath, for what he is to utter. It is a great miſtake to imagine, that the breath muſt be drawn only at the end of a period, when the voice is allowed to fall. It may eaſily be gathered at the intervals of the period, when the voice is ſuſpended only for a moment; and, by this management, one may always have a ſufficient ſtock for carrying on the longeſt ſentence, without improper interruptions.</p>
               <p>Pauſes in reading muſt generally be formed upon the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which we utter ourſelves in ordinary, ſenſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; and not upon the ſtiff artificial manner, which is acquired from reading books according to the common punctuation. It will by no means be ſufficient to attend to the points uſed in printing: for theſe are far from marking all the pauſes, which ought to be made in reading. A me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical attention to theſe reſting places, has perhaps been one cauſe of monotony, by leading the reader to a ſimilar tone at every ſtop, and a uniform cadence at every period. The primary uſe of points, is to aſſiſt the reader in diſcerning the grammatical conſtruction; and it is only as a ſecondary object, that they regulate his pronunciation. On this head, the following direction may be of uſe: <q>Though in reading great attention ſhould be paid to the ſtops, yet a greater ſhould be given to the ſenſe; and their correſpondent
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:035851_0024_1007AA76D4833880"/>
times occaſionally lengthened beyond what is uſual in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To render pauſes pleaſing and expreſſive, they muſt not only be made in the right place, but alſo accompanied with a proper tone of voice, by which the nature of theſe pauſes is intimated; much more than by the length of them, which can ſeldom be exactly meaſured. Sometimes it is only a ſlight and ſimple ſuſpenſion of voice that is proper; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a degree of cadence in the voice is required; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that peculiar tone and cadence which denote the ſentence to be finiſhed. In all theſe caſes, we are to regulate ourſelves by attending to the manner in which nature teaches us to ſpeak, when engaged in real and earneſt diſcourſe with others. The following ſentence exemplifies the <hi>ſuſpending</hi> and the <hi>cloſing</hi> pauſes: "Hope, the balm of life, ſooths us under "every misfortune." The firſt and ſecond pauſes are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by an inflection of voice, that gives the hearer an expectation of ſomething further to complete the ſenſe: the inflection attending the third pauſe, ſignifies that the ſenſe is completed.</p>
               <p>The preceding example is an illuſtration of the ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pauſe, in its ſimple ſtate: the following inſtance exhibits that pauſe with a degree of cadence in the voice: <q>If content cannot remove the diſquietudes of mankind, it will at leaſt alleviate them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſuſpending pauſe is often, in the ſame ſentence, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with both the riſing and the falling inflection of voice; as will be ſeen in this example: <q>Moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and habitual temperance, ſtrengthen the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The riſing inflection is denoted by the acute, the falling by the grave accent.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:035851_0025_1007AA7A66B36CC8"/>
As the ſuſpending pauſe may be thus attended with both the riſing and the falling inflection, it is the ſame with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the cloſing pauſe: it admits of both. The falling inflection generally accompanies it; but it is not unfrequently connected with the riſing inflection. Interrogative ſentences, for inſtance, are often terminated in this manner: as, "Am I ungrateful?" "Is he in earneſt?"</p>
               <p>But where a ſentence is begun by an interrogative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noun or adverb, it is commonly terminated by the falling inflection: as, "What has he gained by his folly?" "Who will aſſiſt him?" "Where is the meſſenger?" "When did he arrive?"</p>
               <p>Where two queſtions are united in one ſentence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected by the conjunction <hi>or,</hi> the firſt takes the riſing, the ſecond the falling inflection: as, <q>Does his conduct ſupport diſcipline, or deſtroy it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The riſing and falling inflections muſt not be confounded with emphaſis. Though they may often coincide, they are, in their nature, perfectly diſtinct. Emphaſis ſometimes controls thoſe inflections.</p>
               <p>The regular application of the riſing and falling inflections, confers ſo much beauty on expreſſion, and is ſo neceſſary to be ſtudied by the young reader, that we ſhall inſert a few more examples, to induce him to pay greater attention to the ſubject. In theſe inſtances, all the inflections are not marked. Such only are diſtinguiſhed as are moſt ſtriking, and will beſt ſerve to ſhow the reader their utility and importance.</p>

               <head>SECTION VIII. Manner of reading Verſe.</head>
               <p>WHEN we are reading verſe, there is a peculiar difficulty in making the pauſes juſtly. The difficulty ariſes from the melody of verſe, which dictates to the ear pauſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> reſts of its own; and to adjuſt and compound theſe properly with the pauſes of the ſenſe, ſo as neither to hurt the ear, nor offend the underſtanding, is ſo very nice a matter, that it is no wonder we ſo ſeldom meet with good readers of
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:035851_0027_1007AA7E53DED290"/>
poetry. There are two kinds of pauſes that belong to the melody of verſe: one is, the pauſe at the end of the line; and the other, the caeſural pauſe in or near the middle of it. With regard to the pauſe at the end of the line, which marks that ſtrain or verſe to be finiſhed, rhyme renders this always ſenſible; and in ſome meaſure compels us to obſerve it in our pronunciation. In reſpect to blank verſe, we ought alſo to read it ſo as to make every line ſenſible to the ear: for, what is the uſe of melody, or for what end has the poet compoſed in verſe, if in reading his lines, we ſuppreſs his numbers, by omitting the final pauſe; and degrade them, by our pronunciation, into mere proſe? At the ſame time that we attend to this pauſe, every appearance of ſing-ſong and tone muſt be carefully guarded againſt. The cloſe of the line, where it makes no pauſe in the meaning, ought not to be marked by ſuch a tone as is uſed in finiſhing a ſentence; but, without either fall or elevation of the voice, it ſhould be denoted only by ſuch a ſlight ſuſpenſion of ſound, as may diſtinguiſh the paſſage from one line to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without injuring the meaning.</p>
               <p>The other kind of melodious pauſe, is that which falls ſomewhere about the middle of the verſe, and divides it into two hemiſtichs; a pauſe, not ſo great as that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the cloſe of the line, but ſtill ſenſible to an ordinary ear. This, which is called the caeſural pauſe, may fall, in Engliſh Heroic verſe, after the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th ſyllables in the line. Where the verſe is ſo conſtructed, that this caeſural pauſe coincides with the ſlighteſt pauſe or diviſion in the ſenſe, the line can be read eaſily; as in the two firſt verſes of Pope's Meſſiah:
<q>
                     <l>"Ye nymphs of Solyma"! begin the ſong;</l>
                     <l>"To heavenly themes", ſublimer ſtrains belong."</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="xxvii" facs="unknown:035851_0028_1007AA80E8AA08C0"/>
But if it ſhall happen that words which have ſuch a ſtrict and intimate connexion, as not to bear even a momentary ſeparation, are divided from one another by this caeſural pauſe, we then feel a ſort of ſtruggle between the ſenſe and the ſound, which renders it difficult to read ſuch lines har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly. The rule of proper pronunciation in ſuch caſes, is to regard only the pauſe which the ſenſe forms; and to read the line accordingly. The neglect of the caeſural pauſe may make the line ſound ſomewhat unharmoniouſly; but the effect would be much worſe, if the ſenſe were ſacrificed to the ſound. For inſtance, in the following line of Milton,
<q>
                     <l>—"What in me is dark,</l>
                     <l>"Illumine; what is low, raiſe and ſupport."</l>
                  </q>
the ſenſe clearly dictates the pauſe after <hi>illumine,</hi> at the end of the third ſyllable, which, in reading, ought to be made accordingly; though if the melody only were to be regarded, <hi>illumine</hi> ſhould be connected with what follows, and the pauſe not made till the fourth or ſixth ſyllable. So in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing line of Pope's Epiſtle to Dr. Arbuthnot,
<q>
                     <l>"I ſit, with ſad civility I read."</l>
                  </q>
The ear plainly points out the caeſural pauſe as falling af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>ſad,</hi> the fourth ſyllable. But it would be very bad reading to make any pauſe there, ſo as to ſeparate <hi>ſad</hi> and <hi>civility.</hi> The ſenſe admits of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o other pauſe than after the ſecond ſyllable <hi>ſit,</hi> which therefore muſt be the only pauſe made in reading this part of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>There is another mode of dividing ſome verſes, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing what may be called demi-caeſuras, which require very ſlight pauſes; and which the reader ſhould manage with judgment, or he will be apt to fall into an affected ſing-ſong mode of pronouncing verſes of this kind. The following lines exemplify the demi-caeſura.</p>
               <lg>

               <p>Before the concluſion of this introduction, the Compiler takes the liberty to recommend to thoſe teachers, who may favour his compilation, to exerciſe their pupils in diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and explaining the emphatic words, and the proper tones and pauſes of every portion aſſigned them to read, previouſly to their being called out to the performance. Theſe preparatory leſſons, in which they ſhould be regularly examined, will improve their judgment and taſte; prevent the practice of reading without attention to the ſubject; and eſtabliſh a habit of readily diſcovering the meaning, force, and beauty, of every ſentence they peruſe.</p>

                     <p>The external misfortunes of life, diſappointments, poverty, and ſickneſs, are nothing in compariſon of thoſe inward diſtreſſes of mind, occaſioned by folly, by paſſion, and by guilt.</p>
                     <p>No ſtation is ſo high, no power ſo great, no cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo unblemiſhed, as to exempt men from being attacked by raſhneſs, malice, or envy.</p>
                     <p>Moral and religious inſtruction derives its efficacy, not ſo much from what men are taught to know, as from what they are brought to feel.</p>
                     <p>He who pretends to great ſenſibility towards men, and yet has no feeling for the high objects of religion, no heart to admire and adore the great Father of the univerſe, has reaſon to diſtruſt the truth and delicacy of his ſenſibility.</p>
                     <p>When, upon rational and ſober inquiry, we have eſtabliſhed our principles, let us not ſuffer them to be ſhaken by the ſcoffs of the licentions, or the cavils of the ſceptical.</p>

When we obſerve any tendency to treat religion or morals with diſreſpect and levity, let us hold it to be a ſure indication of a perverted underſtanding, or a depraved heart.</p>
                     <p>Every degree of guilt incurred by yielding to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, tends to debaſe the mind, and to weaken the generous and benevolent principles of human nature.</p>
                     <p>Luxury, pride, and vanity, have frequently as much influence in corrupting the ſentiments of the great, as ignorance, bigotry, and prejudice, have in miſleading the opinions of the multitude.</p>
                     <p>Mixed as the preſent ſtate is, reaſon and religion pronounce, that generally, if not always, there is more happineſs than miſery, more pleaſure than pain, in the condition of man.</p>
                     <p>Society, when formed, requires diſtinctions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, diverſity of conditions, ſubordination of ranks, and a multiplicity of occupations, in order to advance the general good.</p>
                     <p>That the temper, the ſentiments, the morality, and, in general, the whole conduct and character of men, are influenced by the example and diſpoſition of the perſons with whom they aſſociate, is a reflection which has long ſince paſſed into a proverb, and been ranked among the ſtanding maxims of human wiſdom, in all ages of the world.</p>

                     <p>In no ſtation, in no period, let us think ourſelves ſecure from the dangers which ſpring from our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Every age, and every ſtation they beſet; from youth to grey hairs, and from the peaſant to the prince.</p>
                     <p>Riches and pleaſures are the chief temptations to criminal deeds. Yet thoſe riches, when obtained, may very poſſibly overwhelm us with unforeſeen miſeries. Thoſe pleaſures may cut ſhort our health and life.</p>

He who is accuſtomed to turn aſide from the world, and commune with himſelf in retirement, will, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at leaſt, hear the truths which the multitude do not tell him. A more ſound inſtructer will lift his voice, and awaken within the heart thoſe latent ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, which the world had overpowered and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more amiable than a conſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to pleaſe; and an unwillingneſs to offend or hurt.</p>
                     <p>He that waits for an opportunity to do much at once, may breathe out his life in idle wiſhes; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, in the laſt hour, his uſeleſs intentions and barren zeal.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirit of true religion breathes mildneſs and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability. It gives a native, unaffected eaſe to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. It is ſocial, kind, and cheerful: far removed from that gloomy and illiberal ſuperſtition, which clouds the brow, ſharpens the temper, dejects the ſpirit, and teaches men to fit themſelves for another world, by neglecting the concerns of this.</p>
                     <p>Reveal none of the ſecrets of thy friend. Be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his intereſts. Forſake him not in danger. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the thought of acquiring any advantage by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>

                     <p>TIME once paſt never returns: the moment which is loſt, is loſt for ever.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing on earth ſo ſtable, as to aſſure us of undiſturbed reſt; nor ſo powerful, as to afford us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant protection.</p>
                     <p>The houſe of feaſting too often becomes an avenue to the houſe of mourning. Short, to the licentious, is the interval between them.</p>
                     <p>It is of great importance to us, to form a proper eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate of human life; without either loading it with imaginary evils, or expecting from it greater advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than it is able to yield.</p>
                     <p>Among all our corrupt paſſions, there is a ſtrong and intimate connexion. When any one of them is adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our family, it ſeldom quits us until it has father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us all its kindred.</p>
                     <p>Charity, like the ſun, brightens every object on which it ſhines: a cenſorious diſpoſition caſts every character into the darkeſt ſhade it will bear.</p>
                     <p>Many men miſtake the love, for the practice of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and are not ſo much good men, as the friends of goodneſs.</p>
                     <p>Genuine virtue has a language that ſpeaks to every heart throughout the world. It is a language which is underſtood by all. In every region, every clime, the homage paid to it is the ſame. In no one ſentiment were ever mankind more generally agreed.</p>
                     <p>The appearances of our ſecurity are frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful. When our ſky ſeems moſt ſettled and ſerene, in ſome unobſerved quarter gathers the little black
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035851_0046_1007AAB22CCEA078"/>
cloud, in which the tempeſt ferments, and prepares to diſcharge itſelf on our head.</p>
                     <p>The man of true fortitude may be compared to the caſtle built on a rock, which defies the attacks of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding waters: the man of a feeble and timorous ſpirit, to a hut placed on the ſhore, which every wind ſhakes, and every wave overflows.</p>
                     <p>Nothing is ſo inconſiſtent with ſelf-poſſeſſion as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent anger. It overpowers reaſon; confounds our ideas; diſtorts the appearance, and blackens the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, of every object. By the ſtorm which it raiſes within, and by the miſchiefs which it occaſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, it generally brings on the paſſionate and revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, greater miſery than he can bring on the object of his reſentment.</p>
                     <p>The palace of virtue has, in all ages, been repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as placed on the ſummit of a hill; in the aſcent of which, labour is requiſite, and difficulties are to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted; and where a conductor is needed, to direct our way, and to aid our ſteps.</p>
                     <p>In judging of others, let us always think the beſt, and employ the ſpirit of charity and candour. But in judging of ourſelves, we ought to be exact and ſevere.</p>
                     <p>Let him that deſires to ſee others happy, make haſte to give while his gift can be enjoyed; and remember, that every moment of delay, takes away ſomething from the value of his benefaction. And let him who propoſes his own happineſs reflect, that while he forms his purpoſe, the day rolls on, and "the might cometh, when no man can work."</p>
                     <p>To ſenſual perſons, hardly any thing is what it appears to be: and what flatters moſt, is always farth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt from reality. There are voices which ſing around
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035851_0047_1007AAB3B94F5F18"/>
them; but whoſe ſtrains allure to ruin. There is a banquet ſpread, where poiſon is in every diſh. There is a couch which invites them to repoſe; but to ſlumber upon it, is death.</p>
                     <p>If we would judge whether a man is really happy, it is not ſolely to his houſes and lands, to his equipage and his retinue, we are to look. Unleſs we could ſee farther, and diſcern what joy, or what bitterneſs, his heart feels, we can pronounce nothing concerning him.</p>
                     <p>The book is well written; and I have peruſed it with pleaſure and profit. It ſhows, firſt, that true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is rational and well founded; next, that it is of the higheſt importance to every other part of religion and virtue; and, laſtly, that it is moſt conducive to our happineſs.</p>
                     <p>There is certainly no greater felicity, than to be able to look back on a life uſefully and virtuouſly employed; to trace our own progreſs in exiſtence, by ſuch tokens as excite neither ſhame nor ſorrow. It ought therefore to be the care of thoſe who wiſh to paſs the laſt hours with comfort, to lay up ſuch a treaſure of pleaſing ideas, as ſhall ſupport the expenſes of that time, which is to depend wholly upon the fund already acquired.</p>

                     <p>When we have no pleaſure in goodneſs, we may with certainty conclude the reaſon to be, that our pleaſure is all derived from an oppoſite quarter.</p>
                     <p>How ſtrangely are the opinions of men altered, by a change in their condition!</p>
                     <p>How many have had reaſon to be thankful, for being diſappointed in deſigns which they earneſtly purſued, but which, if ſucceſsfully accompliſhed, they have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſeen, would have occaſioned their ruin?</p>
                     <p>What are the actions which afford in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance a rational ſatisfaction? Are they the purſuits of ſenſual pleaſure, the riots of jollity, or the diſplays of ſhow and vanity? No: I appeal to your hearts, my friends, if what you recollect with moſt pleaſure are not the innocent, the virtuous, the honourable parts of your paſt life.</p>
                     <p>The preſent employment of time ſhould frequently be an object of thought. About what are we now bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied? What is the ultimate ſcope of our preſent purſuits and cares? Can we juſtify them to ourſelves? Are they likely to produce any thing that will ſurvive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bring forth ſome fruit for futurity?</p>
                     <p>Is it not ſtrange, (ſays an ingenious writer,) that ſome perſons ſhould be ſo delicate as not to bear a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable picture in the houſe, and yet, by their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, force every face they ſee about them, to wear the doom of uneaſineſs and diſcontent?</p>

If we are now in health, peace, and ſafety; without any particular or uncommon evils to afflict our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; what more can we reaſonably look for in this vain and uncertain world? How little can the greateſt proſperity add to ſuch a ſtate? Will any future ſituation ever make us happy, if now, with ſo few cauſes of grief, we imagine ourſelves miſerable? The evil lies in the ſtate of our mind, not in our condition of fortune; and by no alteration of circumſtances is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be remedied.</p>
                     <p>When the love of unwarrantable pleaſures, and of vicious companions, is allowed to amuſe young perſons, to ingroſs their time, and to ſtir up their paſſions; the day of ruin,—let them take heed, and beware!—the day of irrecoverable ruin, begins to draw nigh. Fortune is ſquandered; health is broken; friends are offended, affronted, eſtranged; aged parents, perhaps, ſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and mourning to the duſt.</p>
                     <p>On whom does time hang ſo heavily, as on the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lazy? To whom are the hours ſo lingering? Who are ſo often devoured with ſpleen, and obliged to fly to every expedient, which can help them to get rid of themſelves? Inſtead of producing tranquillity, indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence produces a fretful reſtleſſneſs of mind; gives riſe to cravings which are never ſatisfied; nouriſhes a ſickly effeminate delicacy, which ſours and corrupts every pleaſure.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035851_0053_1007AAC5EB517E28"/>
of an ancient philoſopher: "If the gueſts are men of ſenſe, there is ſufficient for them: if they are not, I can very well diſpenſe with their company."</p>
                     <p>Socrates, though primarily attentive to the culture of his mind, was not negligent of his external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

                     <p>Eminently pleaſing and honourable was the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between David and Jonathan.

                     <p>Sir Philip Sidney, at the battle near Zutphen, was wounded by a muſket-ball, which broke the bone of his thigh. He was carried about a mile and a half, to the camp; and being faint with the loſs of blood, and probably parched with thirſt, through the heat of the weather, he called for drink. It was immediately brought to him: but, as he was putting the veſſel to his mouth, a poor wounded ſoldier, who happened at that inſtant to be carried by him, looked up to it with wiſhful eyes. The gallant and generous Sidney took the bottle from his mouth, and delivered it to the ſoldier, ſaying, "Thy neceſſity is yet greater than mine."</p>
                     <p>Alexander the Great demanded of a pirate whom he had taken, by what right he infeſted the ſeas? "By the ſame right," replied he, "that Alexander enſlaves the world.

                     <p>Antoninus Pius, the Roman Emperour, was an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and good man.

                     <p>Men are too often ingenious in making themſelves miſerable, by aggravating to their own fancy, beyond bounds, all the evils which they endure.

Would they look with a more impartial eye on the world, they would ſee themſelves ſurrounded with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers; and find that they are only drinking out of that mixed cup which Providence has prepared for all.—"I will reſtore thy daughter again to life," ſaid the eaſtern ſage, to a prince who grieved immoderately for the loſs of a beloved child, "provided thou art able to engrave on her tomb, the names of three perſons who have never mourned." The prince made inquiry after ſuch perſons; but found the inquiry vain, and was ſilent.</p>

No one ought to conſider himſelf as inſignificant in the ſight of his Creator. In our ſeveral ſtations, we are all ſent forth to be labourers in the vineyard of our heavenly Father. Every man has his work allotted, his talent committed to him; by the due improvement of which he may, in one way or other, ſerve God, promote virtue, and be uſeful in the world.</p>
                     <p>The love of praiſe ſhould be preſerved under proper ſubordination to the principle of duty. In itſelf, it is a uſeful motive to action; but when allowed to extend its influence too far, it corrupts the whole character; and produces guilt, diſgrace, and miſery. To be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deſtitute of it, is a defect. To be governed by it, is depravity. The proper adjuſtment of the ſeveral principles of action in human nature, is a matter that deſerves our higheſt attention. For when any one of them becomes either too weak or too ſtrong, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangers both our virtue and our happineſs.</p>
                     <p>The deſires and paſſions of a vicious man, having once obtained an unlimited ſway, trample him under their feet. They make him feel that he is ſubject to various, contradictory, and imperious maſters, who often pull him different ways. His ſoul is rendered the receptacle of many repugnant and jarring diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and reſembles ſome barbarous country cantoned out into different principalities, which are continually waging war on one another.</p>
                     <p>Diſeaſes, poverty, diſappointment, and ſhame, are far from being, in every inſtance, the unavoidable doom of man. They are much more frequently the offſpring of his own miſguided choice. Intemperance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders diſeaſe, ſloth produces poverty, pride creates diſappointments, and diſhoneſty expoſes to ſhame.

The ungoverned paſſions of men betray them into a thouſand follies; their follies into crimes; and their crimes into misfortunes.</p>
                     <p>When we reflect on the many diſtreſſes which abound in human life; on the ſcanty proportion of happineſs which any man is here allowed to enjoy; on the ſmall difference which the diverſity of fortune makes on that ſcanty proportion; it is ſurpriſing, that envy ſhould ever have been a prevalent paſſion among men, much more that it ſhould have prevailed among Chriſtians. Where ſo much is ſuffered in common, little room is left for envy. There is more occaſion for pity and ſympathy, and inclination to aſſiſt each other.</p>
                     <p>At out firſt ſetting out in life, when yet unacquainted with the world and its ſnares, when every pleaſure enchants with its ſmile, and every object ſhines with the gloſs of novelty; let us beware of the ſeducing appearances which ſurround us; and recollect what others have ſuffered from the power of headſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. If we allow any paſſion, even though it be eſteemed innocent, to acquire an abſolute aſcendant, our inward peace will be impaired. But if any which has the taint of guilt, take early poſſeſſion of our mind, we may date, from that moment, the ruin of our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.</p>
                     <p>Every man has ſome darling paſſion, which generally affords the firſt introduction to vice. The irregular gratifications into which it occaſionally ſeduces him, appear under the form of venial weakneſſes; and are indulged, in the beginning, with ſcrupulouſneſs and reſerve. But, by longer practice, theſe reſtraints weaken, and the power of habit grows. One vice brings in another to its aid. By a ſort of natural

                     <p>WHENCE ariſes the miſery of this preſent world? It is not owing to our cloudy atmoſphere, our changing ſeaſons, and inclement ſkies. It is not owing to the debility of our bodies, or to the unequal diſtribution of the goods of fortune.

                     <p>By diſappointments and trials the violence of our paſſions is tamed, and our minds are formed to ſobriety and reflection. In the varieties of life, occaſioned by the viciſſitudes of worldly fortune, we are inured to habits both of the active and the ſuffering virtues. How much ſoever we complain of the vanity of the world, facts plainly ſhow, that if its vanity were leſs, it could not anſwer the purpoſe of ſalutary diſcipline.

Charged with rich gifts from the king, he preſents himſelf before the prophet; and accoſts him in terms of the higheſt reſpect. During the conference which they held together, Eliſha fixed his eye

ſtedfaſtly on the countenance of Hazael; and diſcerning, by a prophetic ſpirit, his future tyranny and cruelty, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AHASUERUS, who is ſuppoſed to be the prince known among the Greek hiſtorians by the name of Artaxerxes, had advanced to the chief dignity in his kingdom, Haman, an Amalekite, who inherited all the ancient enmity of his race to the Jewiſh nation. He appears, from what is recorded of him, to have been a very wicked miniſter. Raiſed to greatneſs without merit, he employed his power ſolely for the gratification of his paſſions. As the honours which he poſſeſſed were next to royal, his pride was every day fed with that ſervile homage, which is peculiar to Aſiatic courts; and all the ſervants of the king pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated themſelves before him. In the midſt of this general adulation, one perſon only ſtooped not to Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. This was Mordecai the Jew; who, knowing this Amalekite to be an enemy to the people of God, and, with virtuous indignation, deſpiſing that inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of proſperity with which he ſaw him lifted up, "bowed not, nor did him reverence." On this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of diſreſpect from Mordecai, Haman "was full of wrath: but he thought ſcorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone." Perſonal revenge was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſatisfy him. So violent and black were his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he reſolved to exterminate the whole nation to which Mordecai belonged. Abuſing, for this cruel purpoſe, the favour of his credulous ſovereign, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a decree to be ſent forth, that, againſt a certain
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035851_0066_1007AAE7DD056D98"/>
day, all the Jews throughout the Perſian dominions ſhould be put to the ſword. Meanwhile, confident of ſucceſs, and blind to approaching ruin, he continued exulting in his proſperity. Invited by Ahaſuerus to a royal banquet, which Eſther the queen had prepared, "he went forth that day joyful, and with a glad heart." But behold how ſlight an incident was ſufficient to poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon his joy! As he went forth, he ſaw Mordecai in the king's gate; and obſerved, that he ſtill refuſed to do him homage: "He ſtood not up, nor was moved for him;" although he well knew the formidable deſigns, which Haman was preparing to execute. One private man, who deſpiſed his greatneſs, and diſdained ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, while a whole kingdom trembled before him; one ſpirit, which the utmoſt ſtretch of his power could neither ſubdue nor humble, blaſted his triumphs. His whole ſoul was ſhaken with a ſtorm of paſſion. Wrath, pride, and deſire of revenge, roſe into fury. With difficulty he reſtrained himſelf in public; but as ſoon as he came to his own houſe, he was forced to diſcloſe the agony of his mind. He gathered together his friends and family, with Zereſh his wife. "He told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and of all the things wherein the king had promoted him; and how he had advanced him above the princes and ſervants of the king. He ſaid, moreover, Yea, Eſther the queen ſuffered no man to come in with the king, to the banquet that ſhe had prepared, but myſelf; and to-morrow alſo am I invited to her with the king." After all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, what is the concluſion?—"Yet all this avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me nothing, ſo long as I ſee Mordecai the Jew ſitting at the king's gate."</p>

country, in ſearch of ſome one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he ſtood on the top of a hill, ſhaded with cypreſs, in doubt whither to direct his ſteps, his father appeared on a ſudden ſtanding before him. "Ortogrul," ſaid the old man, "I know thy perplexity; liſten to thy father; turn thine eye on the oppoſite mountain." Ortogrul looked, and ſaw a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tumbling down the rocks, roaring with the noiſe of thunder, and ſcattering its foam on the impending woods. "Now," ſaid his father, "behold the valley that lies between the hills." Ortogrul looked, and eſpied a little well, out of which iſſued a ſmall rivulet. "Tell me now," ſaid his father, "doſt thou wiſh for ſudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent; or for a ſlow and gradual increaſe, reſembling the rill gliding from the well?" "Let me be quickly rich," ſaid Ortogrul; "let the golden ſtream be quick and violent." "Look round thee," ſaid his father, "once again." Ortogrul looked, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the channel of the torrent dry and duſty; but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake, which the ſupply, ſlow and conſtant, kept always full. He awoke, and determined to grow rich by ſilent profit, and perſevering induſtry.</p>
                     <p>Having ſold his patrimony, he engaged in merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; and in twenty years purchaſed lands, on which he raiſed a houſe, equal in ſumptuouſneſs to that of the vizier, to which he invited all the miniſters of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, expecting to enjoy all the felicity which he had imagined riches able to afford.

Ortogrul heard his flatterers without delight, becauſe he found himſelf unable to believe them. His own heart told him its frailties; his own underſtanding reproached him with his faults. "How long," ſaid he, with a deep ſigh, "have I been labouring in vain to amaſs wealth, which at laſt is uſeleſs! Let no man hereafter wiſh to be rich, who is already too wiſe to be flattered!"</p>

                     <p>She was carefully educated in the principles of the Reformation; and her wiſdom and virtue rendered her a ſhining example to her ſex. But it was her lot to continue only a ſhort period on this ſtage of being; for, in early life, ſhe fell a ſacrifice to the wild ambition of the Duke of Northumberland; who promoted a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between her and his ſon, Lord Guilford Dudley; and raiſed her to the throne of England, in oppoſition to the rights of Mary and Elizabeth. At the time of their marriage, ſhe was only about eighteen years of age, and her huſband was alſo very young: a ſeaſon of life very unequal to oppoſe the intereſted views of artful and aſpiring men; who, inſtead of expoſing them to danger, ſhould have been the protectors of their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and youth.</p>

This extraordinary young perſon, beſides the ſolid endowments of piety and virtue, poſſeſſed the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging diſpoſition, the moſt accompliſhed parts; and being of an equal age with King Edward VI, ſhe had received all her education with him, and ſeemed even to poſſeſs a greater facility in acquiring every part of manly and claſſical literature. She had attained a knowledge of the Roman and Greek languages, as well as of ſeveral modern tongues; had paſſed moſt of her time in an application to learning; and expreſſed a great indifference for other occupations and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſual with her ſex and ſtation.

her own judgment. But this honour was of very ſhort continuance. The nation declared for Queen Mary; and the Lady Jane, after wearing the vain pageantry of a crown during ten days, returned to a private life, with much more ſatisfaction than ſhe felt when the royalty was tendered to her.</p>
                     <p>Queen Mary, who appears to have been incapable of generoſity or clemency, determined to remove every perſon, from whom the leaſt danger could be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. Warning, was, therefore, given the Lady Jane to prepare for death; a doom which ſhe had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and which the innocence of her life, as well as the misfortunes to which ſhe had been expoſed, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no unwelcome news to her. The Queen's bigotted zeal, under colour of tender mercy to the priſoner's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Lady Jane had preſence of mind, in thoſe melancholy circumſtances, not only to defend her religion by ſolid arguments, but alſo to write a letter to her ſiſter, in the Greek language; in which, beſides ſending her a copy of the Scriptures in that tongue, ſhe exhorted her to maintain, in every fortune, a like ſteady perſeverance. On the day of her execution; her huſband, Lord Guilford, deſired permiſſion to ſee her; but ſhe refuſed her conſent, and ſent him word, that the tenderneſs of their parting would overcome the fortitude of both; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>It had been intended to execute the Lady Jane and Lord Guilford together on the ſame ſcaffold, at Tower-hill; but the council, dreading the compaſſion of the people for their youth, beauty, innocence, and noble birth, changed their orders, and gave directions that ſhe ſhould be beheaded within the verge of the Tower. She ſaw her huſband led to execution; and having given him from the window ſome token of her remembrance, ſhe waited with tranquillity till her own appointed hour ſhould bring her to a like fate. She even ſaw his headleſs body carried back in a cart; and found herſelf more confirmed by the reports, which ſhe heard of the conſtancy of his end, than ſhaken by ſo tender and melancholy a ſpectacle. Sir John Gage, conſtable of the Tower, when he led her to execution, deſired her to beſtow on him ſome ſmall preſent, which he might keep as a perpetual memorial of her. She gave him her table-book, in which ſhe had juſt written three ſentences, on ſeeing her huſband's dead body; one in Greek, another in Latin, a third in Engliſh. The purport of them was, "that human juſtice was againſt his body, but the Divine Mercy would be favourable to his ſoul: and that if her fault deſerved puniſhment, her youth, at leaſt, and her imprudence, were worthy of excuſe; and that God and poſterity, ſhe truſted, would ſhow her father." On the ſcaffold, ſhe made a ſpeech to the bye-ſtanders, in which the mildneſs of her diſpoſition led her to take the blame

benevolence, and diſpoſe it for contemplation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic country, till curioſity began to give way to wearineſs; and I ſat down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with moſs; where the ruſtling of the falling leaves, the daſhing of waters, and the hum of the diſtant city, ſoothed my mind into the moſt perfect tranquillity; and ſleep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly ſtole upon me, as I was indulging the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reveries, which the objects around me naturally inſpired.</p>
                     <p>I immediately found myſelf in a vaſt extended plain, in the middle of which aroſe a mountain higher than I had before any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people, chiefly youth; many of whom preſſed forward with the livelieſt expreſſion of ardour in their countenance, though the way was in many places ſteep and difficult. I obſerved, that thoſe who had but juſt begun to climb the hill, thought themſelves not far from the top; but as they proceeded, new hills were continually riſing to their view: and the ſummit of the higheſt they could before diſcern ſeemed but the foot of another, till the mountain at length appeared to loſe itſelf in the clouds. As I was gazing on theſe things with aſtoniſhment, a friendly inſtructer ſuddenly appeared: "The mountain before thee," ſaid he, "is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple of Truth, whoſe head is above the clouds, and a veil of pure light covers her face. Obſerve the progreſs of her votaries; be ſilent and attentive."</p>
                     <p>After I had noticed a variety of objects, I turned my eye towards the multitudes who were climbing the ſteep aſcent; and obſerved amongſt them a youth of a lively look, a piercing eye, and ſomething fiery and

irregular in all his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like an eagle up the mountain; and left his companions gazing after him with envy and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but his progreſs was unequal, and interrupted by a thouſand caprices. When Pleaſure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her train. When Pride beckoned towards the precipice, he ventured to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried paths; and made ſo many excurſions from the road, that his feebler companions often outſtripped him. I obſerved that the Muſes beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned and turned aſide her face. While Genius was thus waſting his ſtrength in eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric flights, I ſaw a perſon of a very different appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, named Application. He crept along with a ſlow and unremitting pace, his eyes fixed on the top of the mountain, patiently removing every ſtone that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed his way, till he ſaw moſt of thoſe below him, who had at firſt derided his ſlow and toilſome progreſs. Indeed, there were few who aſcended the hill with equal, and uninterrupted ſteadineſs; for, beſides the difficulties of the way, they were continually ſolicited to turn aſide, by a numerous crowd of Appetites, Paſſions, and Pleaſures, whoſe importunity, when once complied with, they became leſs and leſs able to reſiſt: and though they often returned to the path, the aſperities of the road were more ſeverely felt; the hill appeared more ſteep and rugged; the fruits which were wholeſome and refreſhing, ſeemed harſh and ill-taſted; their ſight grew dim; and their feet tript at every little obſtruction.</p>
                     <p>I ſaw, with ſome ſurpriſe, that the Muſes, whoſe buſineſs was to cheer and encourage thoſe who were

toiling up the aſcent, would often ſing in the bowers of Pleaſure, and accompany thoſe who were enticed away at the call of the Paſſions. They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always forſook them when they loſt ſight of the hill. The tyrants then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives; and led them away, without reſiſtance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the manſions of Miſery. Amongſt the innumerable ſeducers, who were endeavouring to draw away the votaries of Truth from the path of Science, there was one, ſo little formidable in her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and ſo gentle and languid in her attempts, that I ſhould ſcarcely have taken notice of her, but for the numbers ſhe had imperceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for ſo ſhe was called,) far from proceeding to open hoſtilities, did not attempt to turn their feet out of the path, but contented herſelf with retarding their progreſs; and the purpoſe ſhe could not force them to abandon, ſhe perſuaded them to delay. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which withered the ſtrength of thoſe who came within its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Her unhappy captives ſtill turned their faces towards the temple, and always hoped to arrive there; but the ground ſeemed to ſlide from beneath their feet, and they found themſelves at the bottom, before they ſuſpected they had changed their place. The placid ſerenity, which at firſt appeared in their countenance, changed by degrees into a melancholy languor, which was tinged with deeper and deeper gloom, as they glided down the ſtream of Inſignificance; a dark and ſluggiſh water, which is curled by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a dead ſea, where ſtartled paſſengers are awakened by the ſhock, and the next moment buried in the gulph of Oblivion.</p>

Of all the unhappy deſerters from the paths of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, none ſeemed leſs able to return than the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Indolence. The captives of Appetite and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, could often ſeize the moment when their tyrants were languid or aſleep, to eſcape from their enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the dominion of Indolence was conſtant and unremitted; and ſeldom reſiſted, till reſiſtance was in vain.</p>
                     <p>After contemplating theſe things, I turned my eyes towards the top of the mountain, where the air was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways pure and exhilarating, the path ſhaded with lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and other evergreens, and the effulgence which beamed from the face of Science, ſeemed to ſhed a glory round her votaries. Happy, ſaid I, are they who are permitted to aſcend the mountain!—but while I was pronouncing this exclamation, with uncommon ardour, I ſaw, ſtanding beſide me, a form of diviner features, and a more benign radiance. "Happier," ſaid ſhe, "are they whom Virtue conducts to the manſions of Content!" "What," ſaid I, "does Virtue then reſide in the vale?" "I am found," ſaid ſhe, "in the vale, and I illuminate the mountain. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the ſage at his meditation. I mingle in the crowd of cities, and bleſs the hermit in his cell. I have a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in every heart that owns my influence; and to him that wiſhes for me, I am already preſent. Science may raiſe thee to eminence, but I alone can guide thee to felicity!"—While Virtue was thus ſpeaking, I ſtretched out my arms towards her, with a vehemence which broke my ſlumber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the ſhades of evening ſtretched over the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. I haſtened homeward; and reſigned the night to ſilence and meditation.</p>

                     <p>OBIDAH, the ſon of Abenſina, left the caravanſera early in the morning, and purſued his journey through the plains of Indo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was freſh and vigorous with reſt; he was animated with hope; he was incited by deſire; he walked ſwiftly forward over the vallies, and ſaw the hills gradually riſing before him. As he paſſed along, his ears were delighted with the morning ſong of the bird of paradiſe; he was fanned by the laſt flutters of the ſinking breeze, and ſprinkled with dew by groves of ſpices. He ſometimes contemplated the towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and ſometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primroſe, eldeſt daughter of the ſpring: all his ſenſes were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and all care was baniſhed from his heart.</p>
                     <p>Thus he went on, till the ſun approached his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the increaſing heat preyed upon his ſtrength; he then looked round about him for ſome more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious path. He ſaw, on his right hand, a grove that ſeemed to wave its ſhades as a ſign of invitation; he entered it, and found the coolneſs and verdure irreſiſtibly pleaſant. He did not, however, forget whither he was travelling; but found a narrow way bordered with flowers which appeared to have the ſame direction with the main road; and was pleaſed, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite pleaſure with buſineſs, and to gain the rewards of diligence without ſuffering its fatigues. He, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſtill continued to walk for a time, without the leaſt remiſſion of his ardour, except that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:035851_0080_1007AB0DADF34E40"/>
tempted to ſtop by the muſic of the birds, which the heat had aſſembled in the ſhade; and ſometimes amuſed himſelf with plucking the flowers that covered the banks on either ſide, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At laſt, the green path began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from its firſt tendency, and to wind among hills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with water-falls. Here Obidah pauſed for a time, and began to conſider whether it were longer ſafe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the known and common track; but remembering that the heat was now in its greateſt violence, and that the plain was duſty and uneven, he reſolved to purſue the new path, which he ſuppoſed only to make a few meanders, in compliance with the varieties of the ground, and to end at laſt in the common road.</p>
                     <p>Having thus calmed his ſolicitude, he renewed his pace, though he ſuſpected that he was not gaining ground. This uneaſineſs of mind inclined him to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every ſenſation that might ſooth or divert him. He liſtened to every echo; he mounted every hill for a freſh proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; he turned aſide to every caſcade; and pleaſed himſelf with tracing the courſe of a gentle river that rolled among the trees, and watered a large region with innumerable circumvolutions. In theſe amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the hours paſſed away unaccounted; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

head. He was now rouſed by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of his folly; he now ſaw how happineſs is loſt when eaſe is conſulted; he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>He now reſolved to do what yet remained in his power, to tread back the ground which he had paſſed, and try to find ſome iſſue where the wood might open into the plain. He proſtrated himſelf on the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of Nature. He roſe with confidence and tranquillity, and preſſed on with reſolution. The beaſts of the deſert were in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and fear, and ravage and expiration. All the horrors of darkneſs and ſolitude ſurrounded him: the winds roared in the woods; and the torrents tumbled from the hills.</p>
                     <p>Thus forlorn and diſtreſſed, he wandered through the wild, without knowing whither he was going, or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to ſafety or to deſtruction. At length, not fear, but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour began to overcome him; his breath grew ſhort, and his knees trembled; and he was on the point of lying down in reſignation to his fate, when he beheld, through the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced towards the light; and finding that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called humbly at the door, and obtained admiſſion. The old man ſet before him ſuch proviſions as he had collected for himſelf, on which Obidah fed with eagerneſs and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>

When the repaſt was over, "Tell me," ſaid the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, "by what chance thou haſt been brought hither? I have been now twenty years an inhabitant of the wilderneſs, in which I never ſaw a man before."—Obidah then related the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or palliation.</p>
                     <p>"Son," ſaid the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and eſcape of this day, ſink deep into thy heart. Remember, my ſon, that human life is the journey of a day. We riſe in the morning of youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we ſet forward with ſpirit and hope, with gaiety and with diligence, and travel on a while in the direct road of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the manſions of reſt. In a ſhort time, we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find ſome mitigation of our duty, and ſome more eaſy means of obtaining the ſame end. We then relax our vigour, and reſolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a diſtance; but rely upon our own conſtancy, and venture to approach what we reſolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of eaſe, and repoſe in the ſhades of ſecurity. Here the heart ſoftens, and vigilance ſubſides; we are then willing to inquire whether another advance can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made, and whether we may not, at leaſt, turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleaſure. We approach them with ſcruple and heſitation; we enter them, but enter timorous and trembling; and always hope to paſs through them without loſing the road of virtue, which, for a while, we keep in our ſight, and to which we purpoſe to return. But temptation ſucceeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we in time loſe the happineſs of innocence, and ſolace our diſquiet with ſenſual gratifications. By de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

we let fall the remembrance of our original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and quit the only adequate object of rational deſire. We entangle ourſelves in buſineſs, immerge ourſelves in luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconſtancy; till the darkneſs of old age begins to invade us, and diſeaſe and anxiety obſtruct our way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with ſorrow, with repentance; and wiſh, but too often vainly wiſh, that we had not forſaken the ways of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Happy are they, my ſon, who ſhall learn from thy example, not to deſpair; but ſhall remember, that, though the day is paſt, and their ſtrength is waſted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is never hopeleſs, nor ſincere endeavours ever unaſſiſted; that the wanderer may at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn after all his errors; and that he who implores ſtrength and courage from above, ſhall find danger and difficulty give way before him.

                     <p>I CONSIDER a human ſoul, without education, like marble in the quarry; which ſhows none of its inherent beauties, until the ſkill of the poliſher fetches out the colours, makes the ſurface ſhine, and diſcovers every ornamental cloud, ſpot, and vein that runs through the body of it. Education, after the ſame manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without ſuch helps, are never able to make their appearance.</p>
                     <p>If my reader will give me leave to change the alluſion ſo ſoon upon him, I ſhall make uſe of the ſame inſtance to illuſtrate the force of education, which Ariſtotle has brought to explain his doctrine of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial forms, when he tells us, that a ſtatue lies hid in a block of marble; and that the art of the ſtatuary only clears away the ſuperfluous matter, and removes the rubbiſh. The figure is in the ſtone, and the ſcul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>, education is to a human ſoul. The philoſopher, the ſaint, or the hero, the wiſe, the good, or the great man, very often lies hid and concealed in a plebian, which a proper education might have diſinterred, and have

brought to light. I am therefore much delighted with reading the accounts of ſavage nations; and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating thoſe virtues which are wild and uncul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated: to ſee courage exerting itſelf in fierceneſs, reſolution in obſtinacy, wiſdom in cunning, patience in ſullenneſs and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Mens' paſſions operate variouſly, and appear in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kinds of actions, according as they are more or leſs rectified and ſwayed by reaſon. When one hears of negroes, who upon the death of their maſters, or upon changing their ſervice, hang themſelves upon the next tree, as it ſometimes happens in our American plantations, who can forbear admiring their fidelity, though it expreſſes itſelf in ſo dreadful a manner? What might not that ſavage greatneſs of ſoul, which appears in theſe poor wretches on many occaſions, be raiſed to, were it rightly cultivated? And what colour of excuſe can there be, for the contempt with which we treat this part of our ſpecies; that we ſhould not put them upon the common foot of humanity; that we ſhould only ſet an inſignificant fine upon the man who murders them; nay, that we ſhould as much as in us lies, cut them off from the proſpects of happineſs in another world, as well as in this; and deny them that which we look upon as the proper means for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it?</p>
                     <p>It is therefore an unſpeakable bleſſing, to be born in thoſe parts of the world where wiſdom and knowledge flouriſh; though, it muſt be confeſſed, there are, even in theſe parts, ſeveral poor uninſtructed perſons, who are but little above the inhabitants of thoſe nations of which I have been here ſpeaking; as thoſe who have had the advantages of a more liberal education, riſe

above one another by ſeveral different degrees of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For, to return to our ſtatue in the block of marble, we ſee it ſometimes only begun to be chipped, ſometimes rough-hewn, and but juſt ſketched into a human figure; ſometimes, we ſee the man appearing diſtinctly in all his limbs and features; ſometimes, we find the figure wrought up to great elegancy; but ſeldom meet with any to which the hand of a Phidias or a Praxiteles could not give ſeveral nice touches and finiſhings.</p>

                     <p>THERE is not a more pleaſing exerciſe of the mind, than gratitude. It is accompanied with ſuch inward ſatisfaction, that the duty is ſufficiently rewarded by the performance. It is not, like the practice of many other virtues, difficult and painful, but attended with ſo much pleaſure, that were there no poſitive command which enjoined it, nor any recompenſe laid up for it hereafter, a generous mind would indulge in it, for the natural gratification which it affords.</p>
                     <p>If gratitude is due from man to man, how much more from man to his Maker?—The Supreme Being does not only confer upon us thoſe bounties which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed more immediately from his hand, but even thoſe benefits which are conveyed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>THE moſt plain and natural ſentiments of equity concur with divine authority, to enforce the duty of forgiveneſs. Let him who has never in his life done wrong, be allowed the privilege of remaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable. But let ſuch as are conſcious of frailties and crimes, conſider forgiveneſs as a debt which they owe to others. Common failings are the ſtrongeſt leſſon of mutual forbearance. Were this virtue unknown among men, order and comfort, peace and repoſe, would be ſtrangers to human life. Injuries retaliated according to the exorbitant meaſure which paſſion preſcribes, would excite reſentment in return. The injured perſon would become the injurer; and thus wrongs, retaliations, and freſh injuries, would circulate in endleſs ſucceſſion, till the world was rendered a field of blood. Of all the paſſions which invade the human breaſt, revenge is the moſt direful. When al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to reign with full dominion, it is more than ſufficient to poiſon the few pleaſures which remain to man in his preſent ſtate. How much ſoever a perſon may ſuffer from injuſtice, he is always in hazard of ſuffering more from the proſecution of revenge. The violence of an enemy cannot inflict what is equal to the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035851_0088_1007AB22D3555358"/>
torment he creates to himſelf, by means of the fierce and deſperate paſſions which he allows to rage in his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe evil ſpirits who inhabit the regions of miſery, are repreſented as delighting in revenge and cruelty. But all that is great and good in the univerſe, is on the ſide of clemency and mercy. The almighty Ruler of the world, though for ages offended by the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and inſulted by the impiety of men, is "long-ſuffering and ſlow to anger." His Son, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in our nature, exhibited, both in his life, and his death, the moſt illuſtrious example of forgiveneſs which the world ever beheld. If we look into the hiſtory of mankind, we ſhall find that in every age, they who have been reſpected as worthy, or admired as great, have been diſtinguiſhed for this virtue. Revenge dwells in little minds. A noble and magnanimous ſpirit is always ſuperior to it. It ſuffers not from the injuries of men thoſe ſevere ſhocks which others feel. Collected within itſelf, it ſtands unmoved by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent aſſaults; and with generous pity, rather than with anger, looks down on their unworthy conduct.—It has been truly ſaid, that the greateſt man on earth can no ſooner commit an injury, than a good man can make himſelf greater, by forgiving it.</p>

which in our turn we claim. It is pride which fills the world with ſo much harſhneſs and ſeverity. In the fulneſs of ſelf-eſtimation, we forget what we are. We claim attentions, to which we are not entitled. We are rigorous to offences, as if we had never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; unfeeling to diſtreſs, as if we know not what it was to ſuffer. From thoſe airy regions of pride and folly, let us deſcend to our proper level. Let us ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the natural equality on which Providence has placed man with man, and reflect on the infirmities common to all. If the reflection on natural equality and mutual offences, be inſufficient to prompt humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, let us at leaſt remember what we are in the ſight of our Creator. Have we none of that forbearance to give one another, which we all ſo earneſtly intreat from heaven?

But after paſſion or pride has ſubſided, we look around in vain for the mighty miſchiefs we dreaded. The fabric, which our diſturbed imagination had reared, totally diſappears. But though the cauſe of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has dwindled away, its conſequences remain. We have alienated a friend; we have embittered an enemy; we have ſown the ſeeds of future ſuſpicion, malevolence, or diſguſt.—Let us ſuſpend our violence

Let us reflect how little we have any proſpect of gaining by fierce contention; but how much of the true happineſs of life we are certain of throwing away. Eaſily, and from the ſmalleſt chink, the bitter waters of ſtrife are let forth; but their courſe cannot be foreſeen; and he ſeldom fails of ſuffering moſt from their poiſonous effect, who firſt allowed them to flow.</p>

                     <head>SECTION V. A ſuſpicious Temper the Source of Miſery to its Poſſeſſor.</head>
                     <p>As a ſuſpicious ſpirit is the ſource of many crimes and calamities in the world, ſo it is the ſpring of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain miſery to the perſon who indulges it. His friends will be few; and ſmall will be his comfort in thoſe whom he poſſeſſes. Believing others to be his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he will of courſe make them ſuch. Let his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ever ſo great, the aſperity of his thoughts will often break out in his behaviour; and in return for ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting and hating, he will incur ſuſpicion and hatred. Beſides the external evils which he draws upon himſelf, ariſing from alienated friendſhip, broken confidence, and open enmity, the ſuſpicious temper itſelf is one of the worſt evils which any man can ſuffer. If "in all fear there is torment," how miſerable muſt be his ſtate who, by living in perpetual jealouſy, lives in perpetual dread? Looking upon himſelf to be ſurrounded with ſpies, enemies, and deſigning men, he is a ſtranger to reliance and truſt. He knows not to whom to open
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035851_0091_1007AB2A8E1ABBA8"/>
himſelf. He dreſſes his countenance in forced ſmiles, while his heart throbs within from apprehenſions of ſecret treachery. Hence fretfulneſs and ill-humour, diſguſt at the world, and all the painful ſenſations of an irritated and embittered mind.</p>
                     <p>So numerous and great are the evils ariſing from a ſuſpicious diſpoſition, that, of the two extremes, it is more eligible to expoſe ourſelves to occaſional diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from thinking too well of others, than to ſuffer continual miſery by thinking always ill of them. It is better to be ſometimes impoſed upon, than never to truſt. Safety is purchaſed at too dear a rate, when, in order to ſecure it, we are obliged to be always clad in armour, and to live in perpetual hoſtility with our fellows. This is, for the ſake of living, to deprive ourſelves of the comfort of life. The man of candour enjoys his ſituation, whatever it is, with cheerfulneſs and peace. Prudence directs his intercourſe with the world; but no black ſuſpicions haunt his hours of reſt. Accuſtomed to view the characters of his neighbours in the moſt favourable light, he is like one who dwells amidſt thoſe beautiful ſcenes of nature, on which the eye reſts with pleaſure. Whereas the ſuſpicious man, having his imagination filled with all the ſhocking forms of human falſehood, deceit, and treachery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles the traveller in the wilderneſs, who diſcerns no objects around him but ſuch as are either dreary or terrible; caverns that open, ſerpents that hiſs, and beaſts of prey that howl.</p>

                     <head>SECTION VI. Comforts of Religion.</head>
                     <p>THERE are many who have paſſed the age of youth and beauty; who have reſigned the pleaſures of that ſmiling ſeaſon; who begin to decline into the vale of years, impaired in their health, depreſſed in their fortunes, ſtript of their friends, their children, and perhaps ſtill more tender connexions. What reſource can this world afford them? It preſents a dark and dreary waſte, through which there does not iſſue a ſingle ray of comfort. Every deluſive proſpect of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is now at an end; long experience of mankind, an experience very different from what the open and generous ſoul of youth had fondly dreamt of, has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the heart almoſt inacceſſible to new friendſhips. The principal ſources of activity are taken away, when thoſe for whom we labour are cut off from us; thoſe who animated, and thoſe who ſweetened all the toils of life. Where then can the ſoul find refuge, but in the boſom of Religion? There ſhe is admitted to thoſe proſpects of Providence and futurity, which alone can warm and fill the heart. I ſpeak here of ſuch as retain the feelings of humanity; whom misfortunes have ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and perhaps rendered more delicately ſenſible: not of ſuch as poſſeſs that ſtupid inſenſibility, which ſome are pleaſed to dignify with the name of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</p>
                     <p>It might therefore be expected, that thoſe philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, who think they ſtand in no need themſelves of the aſſiſtance of religion to ſupport their virtue, and who never feel the want of its conſolations, would yet
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035851_0093_1007AB2F638D7C78"/>
have the humanity to conſider the very different ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt of mankind; and not endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of what habit at leaſt, if they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be nature, has made neceſſary to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and to their happineſs. It might be expected, that humanity would prevent them from breaking into the laſt retreat of the unfortunate, who can no longer be objects of their envy or reſentment; and tearing from them their only remaining comfort. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ridicule religion may be agreeable to ſome, by relieving them from reſtraint upon their pleaſures: and may render others very miſerable, by making them doubt thoſe truths, in which they were moſt deeply intereſted; but it can convey real good and happineſs to no one individual.</p>

                     <p>We are ſome of us very fond of knowledge, and apt to value ourſelves upon any proficiency in the ſciences: one ſcience, however, there is, worth more than all the reſt, and that is, the ſcience of living well; which ſhall remain, when "tongues ſhall ceaſe," and "know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall vaniſh away." As to new notions, and new doctrines, of which this age is very fruitful, the time will come, when we ſhall have no pleaſure in them: nay, the time ſhall come when they ſhall be exploded, and would have been forgotten, if they had not been preſerved in thoſe excellent books, which contain a confutation of them; like infects preſerved for ages in amber, which otherwiſe would ſoon have returned to the common maſs of things. But a firm belief of Chriſtianity, and a practice ſuitable to it, will ſupport and invigorate the mind to the laſt; and moſt of all, at laſt, at that important hour, which muſt decide our hopes and apprehenſions: and the wiſdom, which, like our Saviour, cometh from above, will, through his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, bring us thither.

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035851_0095_1007AB3525C5C4F0"/>
and are to render account at the laſt. That portion of it which he has allotted us, is intended partly for the concerns of this world, partly for thoſe of the next. Let each of theſe occupy, in the diſtribution of our time, that ſpace which properly belongs to it. Let not the hours of hoſpitality and pleaſure interfere with the diſcharge of our neceſſary affairs; and let not what we call neceſſary affairs, encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. To every thing there is a ſeaſon, and a time for every purpoſe under the heaven. If we delay till to-morrow what ought to be done to-day, we overcharge the morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. We load the wheels of time, and prevent them from carrying us along ſmoothly. He who every morning plans the tranſactions of the day, and follows out that plan, carries on a thread which will guide him through the labyrinth of the moſt buſy life. The orderly arrangement of his time is like a ray of light, which darts itſelf through all his affairs. But, where no plan is laid, where the diſpoſal of time is ſurrendered merely to the chance of incidents, all things lie huddled together in one chaos, which admits neither of diſtribution nor review.</p>
                     <p>The firſt requiſite for introducing order into the management of time, is to be impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of its value. Let us conſider well how much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it, and how faſt it flies away. The bulk of men are in nothing more capricious and inconſiſtent, than in their appreciation of time. When they think of it, as the meaſure of their continuance on earth, they highly prize it, and with the greateſt anxiety ſeek to lengthen it out. But when they view it in ſeparate parcels, they appear to hold it in contempt, and ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035851_0096_1007AB37B70A02F8"/>
it with inconſiderate profuſion. While they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that life is ſhort, they are often wiſhing its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods at an end. Covetous of every other poſſeſſion, of time only they are prodigal. They allow every idle man to be maſter of this property, and make every frivolous occupation welcome that can help them to conſume it. Among thoſe who are ſo careleſs of time, it is not to be expected that order ſhould be obſerved in its diſtribution. But, by this fatal neglect, how many materials of ſevere and laſting regret are they laying up in ſtore for themſelves! The time which they ſuffer to paſs away in the midſt of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, bitter repentance ſeeks afterwards in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. What was omitted to be done at its proper moment, ariſes to be the torment of ſome future ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Manhood is diſgraced by the conſequences of neglected youth. Old age, oppreſſed by cares that belonged to a former period, labours under a burden not its own. At the cloſe of life, the dying man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds with anguiſh that his days are finiſhing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly commenced. Such are the effects of a diſorderly waſte of time, through not attending to its value. Every thing in the life of ſuch perſons is miſplaced. Nothing is performed aright, from not being performed in due ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p>But he who is orderly in the diſtribution of his time, takes the proper method of eſcaping thoſe manifold evils. He is juſtly ſaid to redeem the time. By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per management, he prolongs it. He lives much in little ſpace; more in a few years than others do in many. He can live to God and his own ſoul, and at the ſame time attend to all the lawful intereſts of the preſent world. He looks back on the paſt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides

for the future. He catches and arreſts the hours as they fly. They are marked down for uſeful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and their memory remains. Whereas thoſe hours fleet by the man of confuſion like a ſhadow. His days and years are either blanks of which he has no remembrance, or they are filled up with ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and irregular ſucceſſion of unfiniſhed tranſactions, that though he remembers he has been buſy, yet he can give no account of the buſineſs which has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him.</p>

                     <p>THE moſt excellent and honourable character which can adorn a man and a Chriſtian, is acquired by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the torrent of vice, and adhering to the cauſe of God and virtue againſt a corrupted multitude. It will be found to hold in general, that all thoſe, who, in any of the great lines of life, have diſtinguiſhed themſelves for thinking profoundly, and acting nobly, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed popular prejudices; and departed, in ſeveral things, from the common ways of the world. On no occaſion is this more requiſite for true honour, than where religion and morality are concerned. In times of prevailing licentiouſneſs, to maintain unblemiſhed virtue, and uncorrupted integrity; in a public or a private cauſe, to ſtand firm by what is fair and juſt, amidſt diſcouragements and oppoſition; deſpiſing groundleſs cenſure and reproach; diſdaining all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with public manners, when they are vicious and unlawful; and never aſhamed of the punctual
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035851_0098_1007AB3DA9E03ED0"/>
diſcharge of every duty towards God and man;—this is what ſhows true greatneſs of ſpirit, and will force approbation even from the degenerate multitude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. "This is the man," (their conſcience will oblige them to acknowledge,) "whom we are unable to bend to mean condeſcenſions. We ſee it in vain either to flatter or to threaten him; he reſts on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple within, which we cannot ſhake. To this man we may, on any occaſion, ſafely commit our cauſe. He is incapable of betraying his truſt, or deſerting his friend, or denying his faith."</p>
                     <p>It is, accordingly, this ſteady inflexible virtue, this regard to principle, ſuperior to all cuſtom and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which peculiarly marked the characters of thoſe in any age, who have ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre; and has conſecrated their memory to all poſterity. It was this that obtained to ancient Enoch the moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular teſtimony of honour from heaven. He continued to "walk with God," when the world apoſtatiſed from him. He pleaſed God, and was beloved of him; ſo that living among ſinners, he was tranſlated to heaven without ſeeing death; "Yea, ſpeedily was he taken away, leſt wickedneſs ſhould have altered his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or deceit beguiled his ſoul." When Sodom could not furniſh ten righteous men to ſave it, Lot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unſpotted amidſt the contagion. He lived like an angel among ſpirits of darkneſs; and the deſtroying flame was not permitted to go forth, till the good man was called away by a heavenly meſſenger from his devoted city. When "all fleſh had corrupted their way upon the earth," then lived Noah, a righteous man, and a preacher of righteouſneſs. He ſtood alone, and was ſcoffed by the profane crew. But they by

the deluge were ſwept away; while on him, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence conferred the immortal honour, of being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of a better race, and the father of a new world. Such examples as theſe, and ſuch honours conferred by God on them who withſtood the multitude of evil doers, ſhould often be preſent to our minds. Let us oppoſe them to the numbers of low and corrupt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which we behold around us; and when we are in hazard of being ſwayed by ſuch, let us fortify our virtue, by thinking of thoſe who, in former times, ſhone like ſtars in the midſt of ſurrounding darkneſs, and are now ſhining in the kingdom of heaven, as the brightneſs of the firmament, for ever and ever.</p>

                     <p>THOUGH no condition of human life is free from uneaſineſs, yet it muſt be allowed, that the uneaſineſs belonging to a ſinful courſe, is far greater, than what attends a courſe of well-doing. If we are weary of the labours of virtue, we may be aſſured, that the world, whenever we try the exchange, will lay upon us a much heavier load. It is the outſide, only, of a licentious life, which is gay and ſmiling. Within, it conceals toil, and trouble, and deadly ſorrow. For vice poiſons human happineſs in the ſpring, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing diſorder into the heart. Thoſe paſſions which it ſeems to indulge, it only ſeeds with imperfect grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications; and thereby ſtrengthens them for preying, in the end, on their unhappy victims.</p>
                     <p>

It is a great miſtake to imagine, that the pain of ſelf-denial is confined to virtue. He who follows the world, as much as he who follows Chriſt, muſt "take up his croſs;" and to him aſſuredly, it will prove a more oppreſſive burden. Vice allows all our paſſions to range uncontrolled; and where each claims to be ſuperior, it is impoſſible to gratify all. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant deſire can only be indulged at the expenſe of its rival. No mortifications which virtue exacts, are more ſevere than thoſe, which ambition impoſes upon the love of eaſe, pride upon intereſt, and covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs upon vanity. Self-denial, therefore, belongs, in common, to vice and virtue; but with this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference, that the paſſions which virtue requires us to mortify, it tends to weaken; whereas, thoſe which vice obliges us to deny, it, at the ſame time, ſtrengthens. The one diminiſhes the pain of ſelf-denial, by moderating the demand of paſſion; the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes it, by rendering thoſe demands imperious and violent. What diſtreſſes, that occur in the calm life of virtue, can be compared to thoſe tortures, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience inflicts on the wicked; to thoſe ſevere humiliations, ariſing from guilt combined with misfortunes, which ſink them to the duſt; to thoſe violent agitations of ſhame and diſappointment, which ſometimes drive them to the moſt fatal extremities, and make them abhor their exiſtence? How often, in the midſt of thoſe diſaſtrous ſituations, into which their crimes have brought them, have they execrated the ſeductions of vice; and, with bitter regret, looked back to the day on which they firſt forſook the path of innocence!</p>

                     <head>SECTION XI. On Contentment.</head>
                     <p>CONTENTMENT produces, in ſome meaſure, all thoſe effects which the alchymiſt uſually aſcribes to what he calls the philoſopher's ſtone; and if it does not bring riches, it does the ſame thing by baniſhing the deſire of them. If it cannot remove the diſquietudes ariſing from a man's mind, body, or fortune, it makes him eaſy under them. It has indeed a kindly influence on the ſoul of man, in reſpect of every being to whom he ſtands related. It extinguiſhes all murmur, repining, and ingratitude, towards that Being who has allotted him his part to act in this world. It deſtroys all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ambition, and every tendency to corruption, with regard to the community wherein he is placed. It gives ſweetneſs to his converſation, and a perpetual ſerenity to all his thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Among the many methods which might be made uſe of for acquiring this virtue, I ſhall mention only the two following. Firſt of all, a man ſhould always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much he has more than he wants; and ſecondly, how much more unhappy he might be than he really is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, a man ſhould always conſider how much he has more than he wants. I am wonderfully pleaſed with the reply which Ariſtippus made to one, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doled him upon the loſs of a farm: "Why," ſaid he, "I have three farms ſtill, and you have but one; ſo that I ought rather to be afflicted for you than you for me." On the contrary, fooliſh men are more apt to conſider what they have loſt, than what they poſſeſs;
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035851_0102_10079243688031D0"/>
and to fix their eyes upon thoſe who are richer than themſelves, rather than on thoſe who are under greater difficulties. All the real pleaſures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compaſs; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward; and ſtraining after one who has got the ſtart of them in wealth and honour. For this reaſon, as none can be properly called rich, who have not more than they want, there are few rich men in any of the politer nations, but among the middle ſort of people, who keep their wiſhes within their fortunes, and have more wealth than they know how to enjoy. Perſons of a higher rank live in a kind of ſplendid poverty; and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually wanting, becauſe, inſtead of acquieſcing in the ſolid pleaſures of life, they endeavour to outvie one another in ſhadows and appearances. Men of ſenſe have at all times behold, with a great deal of mirth, this ſilly game that is playing over their heads; and, by contracting their deſires, enjoy all that ſecret ſatisfaction which others are always in queſt of. The truth is, this ridiculous chaſe after imaginary pleaſures, cannot be ſufficiently expoſed, as it is the great ſource of thoſe evils which generally undo a nation. Let a man's eſtate be what it may, he is a poor man, if he does not live within it; and naturally ſets himſelf to ſale to any one that can give him his price. When Pittacus, after the death of his brother, who had left him a good eſtate, was offered a great ſum of money by the king of Lydia, he thanked him for his kindneſs; but told him, he had already more by half than he knew what to do with. In ſhort, content is equivalent to wealth, and luxury to poverty; or, to give the thought a more agreeable turn, "Content is natural wealth,"
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035851_0103_100792590BAFE1E0"/>
ſays Socrates; to which I ſhall add, Luxury is artificial poverty. I ſhall therefore recommend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe, who are always aiming at ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and imaginary enjoyments, and who will not be at the trouble of contracting their deſires, an excellent ſaying of Bion the philoſopher, namely, "That no man has ſo much care, as he who endeavours after the moſt happineſs."</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, every one ought to reflect how much more unhappy he might be, than he really is.—The former conſideration took in all thoſe, who are ſufficiently provided with the means to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eaſy; this regards ſuch as actually lie under ſome preſſure or misfortune. Theſe may receive great alleviation, from ſuch a compariſon as the unhappy perſon may make between himſelf and others; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the misfortune which he ſuffers, and greater misfortunes which might have befallen him.</p>
                     <p>I like the ſtory of the honeſt Dutchman, who, upon breaking his leg by a fall from the main-maſt, told the ſtanders-by, it was a great mercy that it was not his neck. To which, ſince I am got into quotations, give me leave to add the ſaying of an old philoſopher, who, after having invited ſome of his friends to dine with him, was ruffled by a perſon that came into the room in a paſſion, and threw down the table that ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: "Every one," ſays he, "has his calamity; and he is a happy man that has no greater than this." We find an inſtance to the ſame purpoſe, in the life of Doctor Hammond, written by Biſhop Fell. As this good man was troubled with a complication of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, when he had the gout upon him, he uſed to thank God that it was not the ſtone; and when he had

the ſtone, that he had not both theſe diſtempers on him at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>I cannot conclude this eſſay without obſerving, that there never was any ſyſtem beſides that of Chriſtianity, which could effectually produce in the mind of man the virtue I have been hitherto ſpeaking of. In order to make us contented with our condition, many of the preſent philoſophers tell us, that our diſcontent only hurts ourſelves, without being able to make any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our circumſtances; others, that whatever evil befalls us is derived to us by a fatal neceſſity, to which ſuperior beings themſelves are ſubject; while others, very gravely, tell the man who is miſerable, that it is neceſſary he ſhould be ſo, to keep up the harmony of the univerſe; and that the ſcheme of Providence would be troubled and perverted, were he otherwiſe. Theſe, and the like conſiderations, rather ſilence than ſatisfy a man. They may ſhow him that his diſcontent is unreaſonable, but they are by no means ſufficient to relieve it. They rather give deſpair than conſolation. In a word, a man might reply to one of theſe comforters, as Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus did to his friend, who adviſed him not to grieve for the death of a perſon whom he loved, becauſe his grief could not fetch him again: "It is for that very reaſon," ſaid the emperour, "that I gri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>On the contrary, religion bears a more tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to human nature. It preſcribes to every miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man the means of bettering his condition: nay, it ſhows him, that bearing his afflictions as he ought to do, will naturally end in the removal of them. It makes him eaſy here, becauſe it can make him happy hereafter.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XII. Rank and Riches afford no Ground for Envy.</head>
                     <p>OF all the grounds of envy among men, ſuperiority in rank and fortune is the moſt general. Hence, the malignity which the poor commonly bear to the rich, as engroſſing to themſelves all the comforts of life. Hence, the evil eye with which perſons of inferior ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſcrutiniſe thoſe who are above them in rank; and if they approach to that rank, their envy is generally ſtrongeſt againſt ſuch as are juſt one ſtep higher than themſelves.—Alas! my friends, all this envious diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which agitates the world, ariſes from a deceitful figure which impoſes on the public view. Falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are hung out; the real ſtate of men is not what it ſeems to be. The order of ſociety requires a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ranks to take place; but in point of happineſs, all men come much nearer to equality than is commonly imagined; and the circumſtances, which form any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference of happineſs among them, are not of that nature which renders them grounds of envy. The poor man poſſeſſes not, it is true, ſome of the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and pleaſures of the rich; but, in return, he is free from many embarraſſments to which they are ſubject. By the ſimplicity and uniformity of his life, he is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that variety of cares, which perplex thoſe who have great affairs to manage, intricate plans to purſue, many enemies, perhaps, to encounter in the purſuit. In the tranquillity of his ſmall habitation, and private family, he enjoys a peace which is often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known at courts. The gratifications of nature, which are always the moſt ſatisfactory, are poſſeſſed by him
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035851_0106_10079263252F8800"/>
to their full extent; and if he be a ſtranger to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined pleaſures of the wealthy, he is unacquainted alſo with the deſire of them, and by conſequence, feels no want. His plain meal ſatisfies his appetite, with a reliſh, probably, higher than that of the rich man, who ſits down to his luxurious banquet. His ſleep is more found; his health more firm; he knows not what ſpleen, languor, and liftleſsneſs are. His accuſtomed employments or labours are not more oppreſſive to him, than the labour of attendance on courts and the great, the labours of dreſs, the fatigue of amuſements, the very weight of idleneſs, frequently are to the rich. In the mean time, all the beauty of the face of nature, all the enjoyments of domeſtic ſociety, all the gaiety and cheerfulneſs of an eaſy mind, are as open to him as to thoſe of the higheſt rank. The ſplendour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, the found of titles, the appearances of high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, are indeed ſoothing, for a ſhort time, to the great. But, become familiar, they are ſoon forgotten. Cuſtom effaces their impreſſion. They ſink into the rank of thoſe ordinary things, which daily recur, without raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any ſenſation of joy.—Let us ceaſe, therefore, from looking up with diſcontent and envy to thoſe, whom birth or fortune has placed above us. Let us adjuſt the balance of happineſs fairly. When we think of the enjoyments we want, we ſhould think alſo of the troubles from which we are free. If we allow their juſt value to the comforts we poſſeſs, we ſhall find rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reſt ſatisfied, with a very moderate, though not an opulent and ſplendid, condition of fortune. Often, did we know the whole, we ſhould be inclined to pity the ſtate of thoſe whom we now envy.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XIII. Patience under Provocations our Intereſt as well as Duty.</head>
                     <p>THE wide circle of human ſociety is diverſified by an endleſs variety of characters, diſpoſitions, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Uniformity is, in no reſpect, the genius of the world. Every man is marked by ſome peculiarity which diſtinguiſhes him from another: and no where can two individuals be found, who are exactly, and in all reſpects, alike. Where ſo much diverſity obtains, it cannot but happen, that, in the intercourſe which men are obliged to maintain, their tempers ſhall often be ill adjuſted to that intercourſe; ſhall jar, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with each other. Hence, in every ſtation, the higheſt as well as the loweſt, and in every condition of life, public, private, and domeſtic, occaſions of irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion frequently ariſe. We are provoked, ſometimes, by the folly and levity of thoſe with whom we are connected; ſometimes, by their indifference or neglect; by the incivility of a friend, the haughtineſs of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, or the inſolent behaviour of one in lower ſtation. Hardly a day paſſes, without ſomewhat or other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, which ſerves to ruffle the man of impatient ſpirit. Of courſe, ſuch a man lives in a continual ſtorm. He knows not what it is to enjoy a train of good humour. Servants, neighbours, friends, ſpouſe, and children, all, through the unreſtrained violence of his temper, become ſources of diſturbance and vexation to him. In vain is affluence; in vain are health and proſperity. The leaſt trifle is ſufficient to diſcompoſe his mind, and poiſon his pleaſures. His very amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are mixed with turbulence and paſſion.</p>

I would beſeech this man to conſider, of what ſmall moment the provocations which he receives, or at leaſt imagines himſelf to receive, are really in themſelves; but of what great moment he makes them, by ſuffering them to deprive him of the poſſeſſion of himſelf. I would beſeech him, to conſider, how many hours of happineſs he throws away, which a little more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience would allow him to enjoy; and how much he puts it in the power of the moſt inſignificant perſons to render him miſerable. "But who can expect," we hear him exclaim, "that he is to poſſeſs the inſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a ſtone? How is it poſſible for human nature to endure ſo many repeated provocations? or to bear calmly with ſuch unreaſonable behaviour?"—My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! if thou canſt bear with no inſtances of unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour, withdraw thyſelf from the world. Thou art no longer fit to live in it. Leave the intercourſe of men. Retreat to the mountain, and the deſert; or ſhut thyſelf up in a cell. For here, in the midſt of ſociety, <hi>offences muſt come.</hi> We might as well expect, when we beheld a calm atmoſphere, and a clear ſky, that no clouds were ever to riſe, and no winds to blow, as that our life was long to proceed, without receiving provocations from human frailty. The careleſs and the imprudent, the giddy and the fickle, the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and the intereſted, every where meet us. They are the briers and thorns, with which the paths of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life are beſet. He only, who can hold his courſe among them with patience and equanimity, he who is prepared to bear what he muſt expect to happen, is worthy of the name of a man.</p>
                     <p>If we preſerved ourſelves compoſed but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhould perceive the inſignificancy of moſt of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035851_0109_1007926D1B96CA38"/>
thoſe provocations which we magnify ſo highly. When a few ſuns more have rolled over our heads, the ſtorm will, of itſelf, have ſubſided; the cauſe of our preſent impatience and diſturbance will be utterly forgotten. Can we not then, anticipate this hour of calmneſs to ourſelves; and begin to enjoy the peace which it will certainly bring? If others have behaved improperly, let us leave them to their own folly, without becoming the victim of their caprice, and puniſhing ourſelves on their account.—Patience, in this exerciſe of it, cannot be too much ſtudied by all who wiſh their life to flow in a ſmooth ſtream. It is the reaſon of a man, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the paſſion of a child. It is the enjoyment of peace, in oppoſition to uproar and confuſion.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XIV. Moderation in our Wiſhes recommended.</head>
                     <p>THE active mind of man ſeldom or never reſts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with its preſent condition, how proſperous ſoever. Originally formed for a wider range of objects, for a higher ſphere of enjoyments, it finds itſelf, in every ſituation of fortune, ſtraitened and confined. Senſible of deficiency in its ſtate, it is ever ſending forth the fond deſire, the aſpiring wiſh, after ſomething beyond what is enjoyed at preſent. Hence, that reſtleſſneſs which prevails ſo generally among mankind. Hence, that diſguſt of pleaſures which they have tried; that paſſion for novelty; that ambition of riſing to ſome degree of eminence or felicity, of which they have formed to themſelves an indiſtinct idea. All which
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035851_0110_1007926EA11FF718"/>
may be conſidered as indications of a certain native, original greatneſs in the human ſoul, ſwelling beyond the limits of its preſent condition; and pointing at the higher objects for which it was made. Happy, if theſe latent remains of our primitive ſtate, ſerved to direct our wiſhes towards their proper deſtination, and to lead us into the path of true bliſs!"</p>
                     <p>But in this dark and bewildered ſtate, the aſpiring tendency of our nature unfortunately takes an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite direction, and feeds a very miſplaced ambition. The flattering appearances which here preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſenſe; the diſtinctions which fortune confers; the advantages and pleaſures which we imagine the world to be capable of beſtowing, fill up the ultimate wiſh of moſt men. Theſe are the objects which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs their ſolitary muſings, and ſtimulate their active labours; which warm the breaſts of the young, animate the induſtry of the middle aged, and often keep alive the paſſions of the old, until the very cloſe of life.</p>
                     <p>Aſſuredly, there is nothing unlawful in our wiſhing to be freed from whatever is diſagreeable, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a fuller enjoyment of the comforts of life. But when theſe wiſhes are not tempered by reaſon, they are in danger of precipitating us into much extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and folly. Deſires and wiſhes are the firſt ſprings of action. When they become exorbitant, the whole character is likely to be tainted. If we ſuffer our fancy to create to itſelf worlds of ideal happineſs, we ſhall diſcompoſe the peace and order of our minds, and foment many hurtful paſſions. Here, then, let Moderation begin its reign; by bringing within rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable bounds the wiſhes that we form. As ſoon as they become extravagant, let us check them, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

reflections on the fallacious nature of thoſe objects, which the world hangs out to allure deſire.</p>
                     <p>You have ſtrayed, my friends, from the road which conducts to felicity; you have diſhonoured the native dignity of your ſouls, in allowing your wiſhes to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate on nothing higher than worldly ideas of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or happineſs. Your imagination roves in a land of ſhadows. Unreal forms deceive you. It is no more than a phantom, an illuſion of happineſs, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts your fond admiration; nay, an illuſion of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which often conceals much real miſery.</p>
                     <p>Do you imagine, that all are happy, who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to thoſe ſummits of diſtinction, towards which your wiſhes aſpire? Alas! how frequently has experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhown, that where roſes were ſuppoſed to bloom, nothing but briers and thorns grew? Reputation, beauty, riches, grandeur, nay, royalty itſelf, would, many a time, have been gladly exchanged by the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors, for that more quiet and humble ſtation, with which you are now diſſatisfied. With all that is ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and ſhining in the world, it is decreed that there ſhould mix many deep ſhades of woe. On the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſituations of fortune, the great calamities of life chiefly fall. There, the ſtorm ſpends its violence, and there, the thunder breaks; while, ſafe and unhurt, the inhabitant of the vale remains below.—Retreat, then, from thoſe vain and pernicious excurſions of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant deſire. Satisfy yourſelves with what is rational and attainable. Train your minds to moderate views of human life, and human happineſs. Remember, and admire, the wiſdom of Agar's petition: "Remove far from me vanity and lies. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Feed me with food convenient for me:

                     <head>SECTION XV. Omniſcience and Omnipreſence of the Deity, the Source of Conſolation to good Men.</head>
                     <p>I WAS yeſterday, about ſun-ſet, walking in the open fields, till the night inſenſibly fell upon me. I at firſt amuſed myſelf with all the richneſs and variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which appeared in the weſtern parts of heaven. In proportion as they faded away and went out, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtars and planets appeared one after another, till the whole firmament was in a glow. The blueneſs of the ether was exceedingly heightened and enlivened, by the ſeaſon of the year, and the rays of all thoſe lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries that paſſed through it. The galaxy appeared in its moſt beautiful white. To complete the ſcene, the full moon roſe, at length, in that clouded majeſty, which Milton takes notice of; and opened to the eye a new picture of nature, which was more finely ſhaded, and diſpoſed among ſofter lights than that which the ſun had before diſcovered to us.</p>
                     <p>As I was ſurveying the moon walking in her bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and taking her progreſs among the conſtellations, a thought aroſe in me, which I believe very often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes and diſturbs men of ſerious and contemplative natures. David himſelf fell into it in that reflection: "When I conſider the heavens, the work of thy fingers; the moon and the ſtars which thou haſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035851_0113_1007932C535B42E0"/>
the ſon of man that thou regardeſt him!" In the ſame manner, when I conſidered that infinite hoſt of ſtars, or, to ſpeak more philoſophically, of ſuns, which were then ſhining upon me; with thoſe innumerable ſets of planets or worlds, which were moving round their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſuns; when I ſtill enlarged the idea, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed another heaven of ſuns and worlds, riſing ſtill above this which we diſcovered; and theſe ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by a ſuperior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at ſo great a diſtance, that they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the inhabitants of the former, as the ſtars do to us; in ſhort, while I purſued this thought, I could not but reflect on that little inſignificant figure, which I myſelf bore amidſt the immenſity of God's works.</p>
                     <p>Were the ſun, which enlightens this part of the creation, with all the hoſt of planetary worlds that move about him, utterly extinguiſhed and annihilated, they would not be miſſed, more than a grain of ſand upon the ſea-ſhore. The ſpace they poſſeſs is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly little in compariſon of the whole, it would ſcarcely make a blank in the creation. The chaſm would be imperceptible to an eye, that could take in the whole compaſs of nature, and paſs from one end of the creation to the other; as it is poſſible there may be ſuch a ſenſe in ourſelves hereafter, or in creatures which are at preſent more exalted than ourſelves. By the help of glaſſes, we ſee many ſtars, which we do not diſcover with our naked eyes; and the finer our teleſcopes are, the more ſtill are our diſcoveries.—Huygenius carries this thought ſo far, that he does not think it impoſſible there may be ſtars, whoſe light has not yet travelled down to us, ſince their firſt creation. There is no queſtion that the univerſe has certain
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035851_0114_1007939FF00810F8"/>
bounds ſet to it; but when we conſider that it is the work of infinite Power, prompted by infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with an infinite ſpace to exert itſelf in, how can our imagination ſet any bounds to it?</p>
                     <p>To return, therefore, to my firſt thought, I could not but look upon myſelf with ſecret horror, as a being that was not worth the ſmalleſt regard of one who had ſo great a work under his care and ſuperintendency. I was afraid of being overlooked amidſt the immenſity of nature; and loſt among that infinite variety of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which, in all probability, ſwarm through all theſe immeaſurable regions of matter.</p>
                     <p>In order to recover myſelf from this mortifying thought, I conſidered that it took its riſe from thoſe narrow conceptions, which we are apt to entertain of the Divine nature. We ourſelves cannot attend to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different objects at the ſame time. If we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to inſpect ſome things, we muſt of courſe neglect others. This imperfection which we obſerve in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is an imperfection that cleaves, in ſome degree, to creatures of the higheſt capacities, as they are creatures, that is, beings of finite and limited natures. The preſence of every created being is confined to a certain meaſure of ſpace; and conſequently his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is ſtinted to a certain number of objects. The ſphere in which we move, and act, and underſtand, is of a wider circumference to one creature, than another, according as we riſe one above another in the ſcale of exiſtence. But the wideſt of theſe our ſpheres has its circumference. When, therefore, we reflect on the Divine nature, we are ſo uſed and accuſtomed to this imperfection in ourſelves, that we cannot forbear, in ſome meaſure, aſcribing it to HIM, in whom there is no
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035851_0115_100793A2C970ABF8"/>
ſhadow of imperfection. Our reaſon indeed aſſures us, that his attributes are infinite; but the poorneſs of our conceptions is ſuch, that it cannot forbear ſetting bounds to every thing it contemplates, till our reaſon comes again to our ſuccour, and throws down all thoſe little prejudices, which riſe in us unawares, and are natural to the mind of man.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall therefore utterly extinguiſh this melancholy thought, of our being overlooked by our Maker, in the multiplicity of his works, and the infinity of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects among which he ſeems to be inceſſantly employed, if we conſider, in the firſt place, that he is omnipreſent; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the ſecond, that he is omniſcient.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider him in his omnipreſence, his being paſſes through, actuates, and ſupports, the whole frame of nature. His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is nothing he has made, that is either ſo diſtant, ſo little, or ſo inconſiderable, which he does not eſſentially inhabit. His ſubſtance is within the ſubſtance of every being, whether material or imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, and as intimately preſent to it, as that being is to itſelf. It would be an imperfection in him, were he able to move out of one place into another; or to withdraw himſelf from any thing he has created, or from any part of that ſpace which he diffuſed and ſpread abroad to infinity. In ſhort, to ſpeak of him in the language of the old philoſophers, he is a being whoſe centre is every where, and his circumference no where.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, he is omniſcient as well as om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent. His omniſcience indeed neceſſarily and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally flows from his omnipreſence. He cannot but be conſcious of every motion that ariſes in the whole
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035851_0116_100793A7BB128348"/>
material world, which he thus eſſentially pervades; and of every thought that is ſtirring in the intellectual world, to every part of which he is thus intimately united. Were the ſoul ſeparate from the body, and with one glance of thought ſhould ſtart beyond the bounds of the creation; ſhould it, for millions of years, continue its progreſs through infinite ſpace, with the ſame activity, it would ſtill find itſelf within the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace of its Creator, and encompaſſed by the immenſity of the Godhead.</p>
                     <p>In this conſideration of the Almighty's omnipreſence and omniſcience, every uncomfortable thought va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes. He cannot but regard every thing that has being, eſpecially ſuch of his creatures who ſear they are not regarded by him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this occaſion: for, as it is impoſſible he ſhould overlook any of his creatures, ſo we may be confident that he regards, with an eye of mercy, thoſe who endeavour to recommend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his notice; and, in unfeigned humility of heart, think themſelves unworthy that he ſhould be mindful of them.</p>

                     <p>ALL men purſue good, and would be happy, if they knew how: not happy for minutes, and miſerable for hours; but happy, if poſſible, through every part of their exiſtence. Either, therefore, there is a good of this ſteady, durable kind, or there is not. If not, then all good muſt be tranſient and uncertain; and if ſo, an object of the loweſt value, which can little deſerve our attention or inquiry. But if there be a better good, ſuch a good as we are ſeeking; like every other thing, it muſt be derived from ſome cauſe; and that cauſe muſt either be external, internal, or mixed; in as much as, except theſe three, there is no other poſſible. Now a ſteady, durable good, cannot be derived from an external cauſe; ſince all derived from externals muſt fluctuate as they fluctuate. By the ſame rule, it cannot be derived from a mixture of the two; becauſe the part which is external, will proportionably deſtroy its eſſence. What then remains but the cauſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? the very cauſe which we have ſuppoſed, when we place the ſovereign good in mind,—in rectitude of conduct.</p>

                     <p>I FIND myſelf exiſting upon a little ſpot, ſurrounded every way by an immenſe unknown expanſion.—Where am I? What ſort of a place do I inhabit! Is it exactly accommodated in every inſtance to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience? Is there no exceſs of cold, none of heat, to offend me? Am I never annoyed by animals, either of my own, or a different kind? Is every thing ſubſervient to me, as though I had ordered all myſelf? No—nothing like it—the fartheſt from it poſſible. The world appears not, then, originally made for the private convenience of the alone?—It does not. But is it not poſſible ſo to accommodate it, by my own particular induſtry? If to accommodate man and beaſt, heaven and earth, if this be beyond me, it is not poſſible. What conſequence then follows; or can there be any other than this—If I ſeek an intereſt of my own detached from that of others, I ſeek an intereſt which is chimerical, and which can never have exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>How then muſt I determine? Have I no intereſt at all? If I have not, I am ſtationed here to no purpoſe. But why no intereſt? Can I be contented with none but one ſeparate and detached? Is a ſocial intereſt, joined with others, ſuch an abſurdity as not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted? The bee, the beaver, and the tribes of herding animals, are ſufficient to convince me, that the thing is ſomewhere at leaſt poſſible. How, then, am I aſſured that it is not equally true of man? Admit it; and what follows? If ſo, then honour and juſtice
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035851_0119_100793B1A9322C50"/>
are my intereſt; then the whole train of moral virtues are my intereſt; without ſome portion of which, not even thieves can maintain ſociety.</p>
                     <p>But, farther ſtill—I ſtop not here—I purſue this ſocial intereſt as far as I can trace my ſeveral relations. I paſs from my own ſtock, my own neighbourhood, my own nation, to the whole race of mankind, as diſperſed throughout the earth. Am I not related to them all, by the mutual aids of commerce, by the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of arts and letters, by that common nature of which we all participate?</p>
                     <p>Again—I muſt have food and cloathing. Without a proper genial warmth, I inſtantly periſh. Am I not related, in this view, to the very earth itſelf? to the diſtant ſun, from whoſe beams I derive vigour? to that ſtupendous courſe and order of the infinite hoſt of heaven, by which the times and ſeaſons ever uniformly paſs on? Were this order once confounded, I could not probably ſurvive a moment; ſo abſolutely do I depend on this common general welfare. What, then, have I to do, but to enlarge virtue into piety! Not only honour and juſtice, and what I owe to man, is my intereſt; but gratitude alſo, acquieſcence, reſignation, adoration, and all I owe to this great polity, and its great Governour our common Parent.</p>

                     <p>A SUSPICIOUS, uncharitable ſpirit is not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with all ſocial virtue and happineſs, but it is
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:035851_0120_100793B7370DCBB8"/>
alſo, in itſelf, unreaſonable and unjuſt. In order to form ſound opinions concerning characters and actions, two things are eſpecially requiſite, information and impartiality. But ſuch as are moſt forward to decide unfavourably, are commonly deſtitute of both. Inſtead of poſſeſſing, or even requiring, full information, the grounds on which they proceed are frequently the moſt ſlight and frivolous. A tale, perhaps, which the idle have invented, the inquiſitive have liſtened to, and the credulous have propagated; or a real incident which rumour, in carrying it along, has exaggerated and diſguiſed, ſupplies them with materials of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident aſſertion, and deciſive judgment. From an action they preſently look into the heart, and infer the motive. This ſuppoſed motive they conclude to be the ruling principle; and pronounce at once concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole character.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more contrary both to equity and to ſound reaſon, than ſuch precipitate judgments. Any man who attends to what paſſes within himſelf, may eaſily diſcern what a complicated ſyſtem the human character is; and what a variety of circumſtances muſt be taken into the account, in order to eſtimate it truly. No ſingle inſtance of conduct whatever, is ſufficient to determine it. As from one worthy action, it were credulity, not charity, to conclude a perſon to be free from all vice; ſo from one which is cenſurable, it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unjuſt to infer that the author of it is without conſcience, and without merit. If we knew all the attending circumſtances, it might appear in an excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable light; nay, perhaps, under a commendable form. The motives of the actor may have been entirely diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:035851_0121_100793B9EDD6F858"/>
from thoſe which we aſcribe to him; and where we ſuppoſe him impelled by bad deſign, he may have been prompted by conſcience and miſtaken principle. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the action to have been in every view crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, he may have been hurried into it through inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency and ſurpriſe. He may have ſincerely repented; and the virtuous principle may have now regained its full vigour. Perhaps this was the corner of frailty; the quarter on which he lay open to the incurſions of temptation; while the other avenues of his heart were firmly guarded by conſcience.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore evident, that no part of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of temper deſerves attention more, than to keep our minds pure from uncharitable prejudices, and open to candour and humanity in judging of others.—The worſt conſequences, both to ourſelves and to ſociety, follow from the oppoſite ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>WE find man placed in a world, where he has by no means the diſpoſal of the events that happen. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities ſometimes befall the worthieſt and the beſt, which it is not in their power to prevent, and where nothing is left them, but to acknowledge and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the high hand of Heaven. For ſuch viſitations of trial, many good and wiſe reaſons can be aſſigned, which the preſent ſubject leads me not to diſcuſs. But
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:035851_0122_100793BBA7D3F7F8"/>
though thoſe unavoidable calamities make a part, yet they make not the chief part, of the vexations and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows that diſtreſs human life. A multitude of evils beſet us, for the ſource of which we muſt look to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter.—No ſooner has any thing in the health, or in the circumſtances of men, gone croſs to their wiſh, than they begin to talk of the unequal diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the good things of this life; they envy the condition of others; they repine at their own lot, and fret againſt the Ruler of the world.</p>
                     <p>Full of theſe ſentiments, one man pines under a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken conſtitution. But let us aſk him, whether he can, fairly and honeſtly, aſſign no cauſe for this but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known decree of Heaven? Has he duly valued the bleſſing of health, and always obſerved the rules of virtue and ſobriety? Has he been moderate in his life, and temperate in all his pleaſures? If now he is only paying the price of his former, perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has he any title to complain, as if he were ſuffering unjuſtly? Were we to ſurvey the chambers of ſickneſs and diſtreſs, we ſhould often find them peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the victims of intemperance and ſenſuality, and with the children of vitious indolence and ſloth. Among the thouſands who languiſh there, we ſhould find the proportion of innocent ſufferers to be ſmall. We ſhould ſee faded youth, premature old age, and the proſpect of an untimely grave, to be the portion of multitudes who, in one way or other, have brought thoſe evils on themſelves; while yet theſe martyrs of vice and folly have the aſſurance to arraign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But you, perhaps, complain of hardſhips of another kind; of the injuſtice of the world; of the poverty
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035851_0123_100793BE825DFCD0"/>
which you ſuffer, and the diſcouragements under which you labour; of the croſſes and diſappointments of which your life has been doomed to be full.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you give too much ſcope to your diſcontent, let me deſire you to reflect impartially upon your paſt train of life. Have not ſloth, or pride, or ill temper, or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful paſſions, miſled you often from the path of ſound and wiſe conduct? Have you not been wanting to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in improving thoſe opportunities which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence offered you, for bettering and advancing your ſtate? If you have choſen to indulge your humour, or your taſte, in the gratifications of indolence or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, can you complain becauſe others, in preference to you, have obtained thoſe advantages which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to uſeful labours, and honourable purſuits? Have not the conſequences of ſome falſe ſteps, into which your paſſions, or your pleaſures, have betrayed you, purſued you through much of your life; tainted, perhaps, your characters, involved you in embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or ſunk you into neglect?—It is an old ſaying, that every man is the artificer of his own fortune in the world. It is certain, that the world ſeldom turns wholly againſt a man, unleſs through his own fault. "Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is," in general, "profitable unto all things." Virtue, diligence, and induſtry, joined with good temper and prudence, have ever been found the ſureſt road to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; and where men fail of attaining it, their want of ſucceſs is far oftener owing to their having deviated from that road, than to their having encountered inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable bars in it. Some, by being too artful, forfeit the reputation of probity. Some, by being too open, are accounted to fail in prudence. Others, by being ſickle and changeable, are diſtruſted by all.—The caſe
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035851_0124_100793C2CD3A1008"/>
commonly is, that men ſeek to aſcribe their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to any cauſe, rather than to their own miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and when they can deviſe no other cauſe, they lay them to the charge of Providence. Their folly leads them into vices; their vices into misfortunes; and in their misfortunes they "murmur againſt Providence." They are doubly unjuſt towards their Creator. In their proſperity, they are apt to aſcribe their ſucceſs to their own diligence, rather than to his bleſſing; and in their adverſity, they impute their diſtreſſes to his providence, not to their own miſbehaviour. Whereas, the truth is the very reverſe of this. "Every good and every perfect gift cometh from above;" and of evil and miſery, man is the author to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>When from the condition of individuals, we look abroad to the public ſtate of the world, we meet with more proofs of the truth of this aſſertion. We ſee great ſocieties of men torn in pieces by inteſtine diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, tumults, and civil commotions. We ſee mighty armies going forth, in formidable array, againſt each other, to cover the earth with blood, and to fill the air with the cries of widows and orphans. Sad evils theſe are, to which this miſerable world is expoſed.—But are theſe evils, I beſeech you, to be imputed to God? Was it he who ſent forth ſlaughtering armies into the field, or who filled the peaceful city with maſſacres and blood? Are theſe miſeries any other, than the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fruit of men's violent and diſorderly paſſions? Are they not clearly to be traced to the ambition and vices of princes, to the quarrels of the great, and to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence of the people?—Let us lay them entirely out of the account, in thinking of Providence; and let us think only of the "fooliſhneſs of man." Did man control

his paſſions, and form his conduct according to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of wiſdom, humanity, and virtue, the earth would no longer be deſolated by cruelty; and human ſocieties would live in order, harmony and peace. In thoſe ſcenes of miſchief and violence which fill the world, let man behold, with ſhame, the picture of his vices, his ignorance, and folly. Let him be humbled by the mortifying view of his own perverſeneſs; but let not "his heart fret againſt the Lord."</p>

                     <head>SECTION V. On diſintereſted Friendſhip.</head>
                     <p>I AM informed that certain Greek writers (philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, it ſeems, in the opinion of their countrymen) have advanced ſome very extraordinary poſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to friendſhip; as, indeed, what ſubject is there, which theſe ſubtle geniuſes have not tortured with their ſophiſtry?</p>
                     <p>The authors to whom I refer, diſſuade their diſciples from entering into any ſtrong attachments, as unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably creating ſupernumerary diſquietudes to thoſe who engage in them; and, as every man has more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to call forth his ſolicitude, in the courſe of his own affairs, it is a weakneſs they contend, anxiouſly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himſelf in the concerns of others. They recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it alſo, in all connexions of this kind, to hold the bands of union extremely looſe; ſo as always to have it in one's power to ſtraiten or relax them, as circumſtances and ſituations ſhall render moſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient. They add, as a capital article of their doctrine, that, "to live exempt from cares, is an eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035851_0126_100793C716E1C9C0"/>
to conſtitute human happineſs: but an ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, however, which he, who voluntarily diſtreſſes himſelf with cares, in which he has no neceſſary and perſonal intereſt, muſt never hope to poſſeſs."</p>
                     <p>I have been told likewiſe, that there is another ſet of pretended philoſophers, of the ſame country, whoſe tenets, concerning this ſubject, are of a ſtill more illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and ungenerous caſt.</p>
                     <p>The propoſition they attempt to eſtabliſh, is, that "friendſhip is an affair of ſelf-intereſt entirely; and that the proper motive for engaging in it, is, not in order to gratify the kind and benevolent affections, but for the benefit of that aſſiſtance and ſupport which is to be derived from the connexion." Accordingly they aſſert, that thoſe perſons are moſt diſpoſed to have recourſe to auxiliary alliances of this kind, who are leaſt qualified by nature, or fortune, to depend upon their own ſtrength and powers: the weaker ſex, for inſtance, being generally more inclined to engage in friendſhips, than the male part of our ſpecies; and thoſe who are depreſſed by indigence, or labouring under misfortunes, than the wealthy and the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous.</p>
                     <p>Excellent and obliging ſages, theſe, undoubtedly! To ſtrike out the friendly affections from the moral world, would be like extinguiſhing the ſun in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: each of them being the ſource of the beſt and moſt grateful ſatisfactions, that Heaven has conferred on the ſons of men. But I ſhould be glad to know, what the real value of this boaſted exemption from care, which they promiſe their diſciples, juſtly amounts to? an exemption flattering to ſelf-love, I confeſs; but which upon many occurrences in human life, ſhould
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:035851_0127_100793C9DDB020D0"/>
be rejected with the utmoſt diſdain. For nothing, ſurely, can be more inconſiſtent with a well-poiſed and manly ſpirit, than to decline engaging in any laudable action, or to be diſcouraged from perſevering in it, by an apprehenſion of the trouble and ſolicitude, with which it may probably be attended. Virtue herſelf, indeed, ought to be totally renounced, if it be right to avoid every poſſible means that may be productive of uneaſineſs: for who, that is actuated by her principles, can obſerve the conduct of an oppoſite character, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being affected with ſome degree of ſecret diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction? Are not the juſt, the brave, and the good, neceſſarily expoſed to the diſagreeable emotions of diſlike and averſion, when they reſpectively meet with inſtances of fraud, of cowardice, or of villainy? It is an eſſential property of every well conſtituted mind, to be affected with pain, or pleaſure, according to the nature of thoſe moral appearances that preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obſervation.</p>
                     <p>If ſenſibility, therefore, be not incompatible with true wiſdom, (and it ſurely is not, unleſs we ſuppoſe that philoſophy deadens every finer feeling of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,) what juſt reaſon can be aſſigned, why the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic ſufferings which may reſult from friendſhip, ſhould be a ſufficient inducement for baniſhing that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous affection from the human breaſt? Extinguiſh all emotions of the heart, and what difference will remain, I do not ſay between man and brute, but between man and a mere inanimate clod? Away then with thoſe auſtere philoſophers, who repreſent virtue as harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul againſt all the ſofter impreſſions of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity! The fact, certainly, is much otherwiſe. A truly good man is, upon many occaſions, extremely ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035851_0128_100793CC91CD28D0"/>
of tender ſentiments; and his heart expands with joy, or ſhrinks with ſorrow, as good or ill fortune accompanies his friend. Upon the whole, then, it may fairly be concluded, that, as in the caſe of virtue, ſo in that of friendſhip, thoſe painful ſenſations, which may ſometimes be produced by the one, as well as by the other, are equally inſufficient grounds for excluding either of them from taking poſſeſſion of our boſoms.</p>
                     <p>They who inſiſt that "utility is the firſt and prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motive, which induces mankind to enter into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friendſhips," appear to me to diveſt the aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of its moſt amiable and engaging principle. For, to a mind right<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> diſpoſed, it is not ſo much the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received, as the affectionate zeal from which they flow, that gives them their beſt and moſt valuable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation. It is ſo far indeed from being verified by fact, that a ſenſe of our wants is the original cauſe of forming theſe amicable alliances; that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it is obſervable, that none have been more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in their friendſhips than thoſe, whoſe power and opulence, but, above all, whoſe ſuperior virtue (a much firmer ſupport) have raiſed them above every neceſſity of having recourſe to the aſſiſtance of others.</p>
                     <p>The true diſtinction, then, in this queſtion is, that "although friendſhip is certainly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ductive of utility, yet utility is not the primary motive of friendſhip." Thoſe ſelfiſh ſenſualiſts, therefore, who, lulled in the lap of luxury, preſume to maintain the reverſe, have ſurely no claim to attention; as they are neither quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by reflection, nor experience, to be competent judges of the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Is there a man upon the face of the earth, who would deliberately accept of all the wealth, and all the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

                     <p>I WAS yeſterday walking alone, in one of my friend's woods; and loſt myſelf in it very agreeably, as I was running over, in my mind, the ſeveral arguments that eſtabliſh this great point; which is the baſis of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the ſource of all the pleaſing hopes and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret joys, that can ariſe in the heart of a reaſonable creature. I conſidered thoſe ſeveral proofs drawn,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the nature of the ſoul itſelf, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly its immateriality; which, though not abſolutely neceſſary to the eternity of its duration, has, I think, been evinced to almoſt a demonſtration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from its paſſions and ſentiments; as, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, from its love of exiſtence; its horror of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation; and its hopes of immortality; with that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſatisfaction which it finds in the practice of virtue; and that uneaſineſs which follows upon the commiſſion of vice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:035851_0130_100793D36E6CDB70"/>
Thirdly, from the nature of the Supreme Being, whoſe juſtice, goodneſs, wiſdom and veracity, are all concerned in this point.</p>
                     <p>But among theſe, and other excellent arguments for the immortality of the ſoul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progreſs of the ſoul to its perfection, without a poſſibility of ever arriving at it; which is a hint that I do not remember to have ſeen opened and improved by others, who have written on this ſubject, though it ſeems to me to carry a very great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the ſoul, which is capable of ſuch immenſe perfections, and of receiving new improvements to all eternity, ſhall fall away into nothing, almoſt as ſoon as it is created? Are ſuch abilities made for no purpoſe? A brute arrives at a point of perfection, that he can never paſs: in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were he to live ten thouſand more, would be the ſame thing he is at preſent. Were a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul thus at a ſtand in her accompliſhments; were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of farther enlargements; I could imagine ſhe might fall away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, and drop at once into a ſtate of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progreſs of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having juſt looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few diſcoveries of his infinite goodneſs, wiſdom, and power, muſt periſh at her firſt ſetting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries?</p>
                     <p>A man, conſidered only in his preſent ſtate, ſeems ſent into the world merely to propagate his kind. He provides himſelf with a ſucceſſor; and immediately quits

his poſt to make room for him. He does not ſeem born to enjoy life, but to deliver it down to others. This is not ſurpriſing to conſider in animals, which are formed for our uſe, and can finiſh their buſineſs in a ſhort life. The ſilk-worm, after having ſpun her taſk, lays her eggs and dies. But a man cannot take in his full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of knowledge, has not time to ſubdue his paſſions, eſtabliſh his ſoul in virtue, and come up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his nature, before he is hurried off the ſtage. Would an infinitely wiſe Being make ſuch glorious creatures for ſo mean a purpoſe? Can he delight in the production of ſuch abortive intelligences, ſuch ſhort-lived reaſonable beings? Would he give us ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents that are not to be exerted? capacities that are never to be gratified? How can we find that wiſdom which ſhines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nurſery for the next; and without believing that the ſeveral ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of rational creatures, which riſe up and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in ſuch quick ſucceſſions, are only to receive their firſt rudiments of exiſtence here, and afterwards to be tranſplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may ſpread and flouriſh to all eternity?</p>
                     <p>There is not, in my opinion, a more pleaſing and triumphant conſideration in religion, than this of the perpetual progreſs, which the ſoul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in it. To look upon the ſoul as going on from ſtrength to ſtrength; to conſider that ſhe is to ſhine for ever with new acceſſions of glory, and brighten to all eternity; that ſhe will be ſtill adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge; carries in it ſomething wonderfully agreeable to that ambition, which is natural

to the mind of man. Nay, it muſt be a proſpect pleaſing to God himſelf, to ſee his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes; and drawing nearer to him, by greater degrees of reſemblance.</p>
                     <p>Methinks this ſingle conſideration, of the progreſs of a finite ſpirit to perfection, will be ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguſh all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in ſuperior. That cherub, which now appears as a god to a human ſoul, knows very well, that the period will come about in eternity, when the human ſoul ſhall be as perfect as he himſelf now is: nay, when ſhe ſhall look down upon that degree of perfection as much as ſhe now falls ſhort of it. It is true, the higher nature ſtill advances, and by that means preſerves his diſtance and ſuperiority in the ſcale of being; but he knows that how high ſoever the ſtation is of which he ſtands poſſeſſed at preſent, the inferior nature will at length mount up to it; and ſhine forth in the ſame degree of glory.</p>
                     <p>With what aſtoniſhment and veneration, may we look into our own ſouls, where there are ſuch hidden ſtores of virtue and knowledge, ſuch inexhauſted ſources of perfection! We know not yet what we ſhall be; nor will it ever enter into the heart of man, to conceive the glory that will be always in reſerve for him. The ſoul, conſidered with its Creator, is like one of thoſe mathematical lines, that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a poſſibility of touching it: and can there be a thought ſo tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to conſider ourſelves in theſe perpetual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to HIM, who is the ſtandard not only of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but of happineſs!</p>

                     <p>AMONG the great bleſſings and wonders of the creation, may be claſſed the regularities of times and ſeaſons. Immediately after the flood, the ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made to man, that ſeed-time and harveſt, cold and heat, ſummer and winter, day and night, ſhould continue to the very end of all things. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, in obedience to that promiſe, the rotation is conſtantly preſenting us with ſome uſeful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alteration; and all the pleaſing novelty of life ariſes from theſe natural changes: nor are we leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to them for many of its ſolid comforts. It has been frequently the taſk of the moraliſt and poet, to mark, in poliſhed periods, the particular charms and conveniences of every change; and, indeed, ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate obſervations upon natural variety, cannot be undelightful; ſince the bleſſing, which every month brings along with it, is a freſh inſtance of the wiſdom and bounty of that Providence, which regulates the glories of the year. We glow as we contemplate; we feel a propenſity to adore, whilſt we enjoy. In the time of ſeed-ſowing, it is the ſeaſon of <hi>confidence:</hi> the grain which the huſbandman truſts to the boſom of the
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:035851_0134_100793DE340BA778"/>
earth ſhall, haply, yield its ſeven-fold rewards. Spring preſents us with a ſcene of lively <hi>expectation.</hi> That which was before ſown begins now to diſcover ſigns of ſucceſsful vegetation. The labourer obſerves the change, and anticipates the harveſt: he watches the progreſs of nature, and ſmiles at her influence; while the man of contemplation walks forth with the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, amidſt the fragrance of flowers, and promiſes of plenty; nor returns to his cottage till darkneſs cloſes the ſcene upon his eye. Then cometh the harveſt, when the large wiſh is ſatisfied, and the granaries of nature are loaded with the means of life, even to a luxury of abundance. The powers of language are unequal to the deſcription of this happy ſeaſon. It is the carnival of nature: ſun and ſhade, coolneſs and quietude, cheerfulneſs and melody, love and gratitude, unite to render every ſcene of ſummer delightful.—The diviſion of light and darkneſs is one of the kindeſt efforts of Omnipotent Wiſdom. Day and night yield us contrary bleſſings; and, at the ſame time, aſſiſt each other, by giving freſh luſtre to the delights of both. Amidſt the glare of day, and buſtle of life, how could we ſleep? Amidſt the gloom of darkneſs, how could we labour?</p>
                     <p>How wiſe, how benignant, then, is the proper divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! The hours of light are adapted to activity; and thoſe of darkneſs, to reſt. Ere the day is paſſed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and nature prepare us for the pillow; and by the time that the morning returns, we are again able to meet it with a ſmile. Thus, every ſeaſon has a charm peculiar to itſelf; and every moment affords ſome intereſting innovation.</p>

                     <p>THIS amazing fall of water is made by the River St. Lawrence, in its paſſage from lake Erie into the lake Ontario. The St. Lawrence is one of the largeſt rivers in the world; and yet the whole of its waters are here poured down, by a fall of a hundred and fifty feet perpendicular. It is not eaſy to bring the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to correſpond to the greatneſs of the ſcene. A river extremely deep and rapid, and that ſerves to drain the waters of almoſt all North America into the Atlantic Ocean, is here poured precipitately down a ledge of rocks, that riſes, like a wall, acroſs the whole bed of its ſtream. The river, a little above, is near three quarters of a mile broad; and the rocks, where it grows narrower, are four hundred yards over. Their direction is not ſtraight acroſs, but hollowing inwards like a horſe-ſhoe: ſo that the cataract, which bends to the ſhape of the obſtacle, rounding inwards, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents a kind of theatre the moſt tremendous in nature. Juſt in the middle of this circular wall of waters, a little iſland, that has braved the fury of the current, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents one of its points, and divides the ſtream at top into two parts; but they unite again long before they reach the bottom. The noiſe of the fall is heard at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſeveral leagues; and the fury of the waters, at the termination of their fall, is inconceivable. The daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing produces a miſt that riſes to the very clouds; and which forms a moſt beautiful rainbow, when the ſun ſhines. It will readily be ſuppoſed, that ſuch a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ract entirely deſtroys the navigation of the ſtream;

                     <p>OF all the ſubterraneous caverns now known, the grotto of Antiparos is the moſt remarkable, as well for its extent, as for the beauty of its ſparry incruſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This celebrated cavern was firſt explored by one Magni, an Italian traveller, about a hundred years ago, at Antiparos, an inconſiderable iſland of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago. "Having been informed," ſays he, "by the natives of Paros, that in the little iſland of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paros, which lies about two miles from the former, of a gigantic ſtatue that was to be ſeen at the mouth of a cavern in that place, it was reſolved that we (the French Conſul and himſelf) ſhould pay it a viſit. In purſuance of this reſolution, after we had landed on the iſland, and walked about four miles through the midſt of beautiful plains, and ſloping woodlands, we at length came to a little hill, on the ſide of which yawned a moſt horrid cavern, that with its gloom at firſt ſtruck us with terror, and almoſt repreſſed curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Recovering the firſt ſurpriſe, however, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered boldly; and had not proceeded above twenty paces, when the ſuppoſed ſtatue of the giant preſented itſelf to our view. We quickly perceived, that what the ignorant natives had been terrified at as a giant, was nothing more than a ſparry concretion, formed by the water dropping from the roof of the cave, and by -deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ventures in this ſubterranean abode. As we proceeded, new wonders offered themſelves; the ſpars, formed into trees and ſhruos, preſented a kind of petrified grove; ſome white, ſome green; and all receding in due perſpective. They ſtruck us with the more amazement, as we knew them to be mere productions of Nature, who, hitherto in ſolitude, had, in her playful moments, dreſſed the ſcene, as if for her own amuſement."</p>
                     <p>"We had as yet ſeen but a few of the wonders of the place; and we were introduced only into the portico of this amazing temple. In one corner of this half illuminated receſs, there appeared an opening of about three feet wide, which ſeemed to lead to a place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally dark, and which one of the natives aſſured us contained nothing more than a reſervoir of water. Upon this information, we made an experiment, by throwing down ſome ſtones, which rumbling along the ſides of the deſcent for ſome time, the ſound ſeemed at laſt quaſhed in a bed of water. In order, however, to be more certain, we ſent in a Levantine mariner, who, by the promiſe of a good reward, with a flambeau in his land, ventured into this narrow aperture. After continuing within it for about a quarter of an hour, he returned, bearing in his hand, ſome beautiful pieces of white ſpar, which art could neither imitate nor equal. Upon being informed by him that the place was full of theſe beautiful incruſtations, I ventured in once more with him, about fifty paces, anxiouſly and cautiouſly deſcending by a ſteep and dangerous way. Finding, however, that we came to a precipice which led into
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035851_0138_100793E9CD62F8B0"/>
a ſpacious amphitheatre, (if I may ſo call it,) ſtill deeper than any other part, we returned, and being provided with a ladder, flambeau, and other things to expedite our deſcent, our whole company, man by man, ventured into the ſame opening; and deſcending one after another, we at laſt ſaw ourſelves all together in the moſt magnificent part of the cavern."</p>

                     <p>"OUR candles being now all lighted up, and the whole place completely illuminated, never could the eye be preſented with a more glittering, or a more magnificent ſcene. The whole roof hung with ſolid icicles, tranſparent as glaſs, yet ſolid as marble. The eye could ſcarcely reach the lofty and noble cieling; the ſides were regularly formed with ſpars; and the whole preſented the idea of a magnificent theatre, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated with an immenſe profuſion of lights. The floor conſiſted of ſolid marble: and, in ſeveral places, magnificent columns, thrones, altars, and other objects, appeared, as if nature had deſigned to mock the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities of art. Our voices, upon ſpeaking or ſinging, were redoubled to an aſtoniſhing loudneſs; and upon the firing of a gun, the noiſe and reverberations were almoſt deafening. In the midſt of this grand amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre roſe a concretion of about fifteen feet high, that, in ſome meaſure, reſembled an altar; from which, taking the hint, we cauſed maſs to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

objects repreſented the cuſtomary ornaments of this rite."</p>
                     <p>"Below even this ſpacious grotto there ſeemed another cavern; down which I ventured with my former mariner, and deſcended about fifty paces by means of a rope. I at laſt arrived at a ſmall ſpot of level ground, where the bottom appeared different from that of the amphitheatre, being compoſed of ſoft clay, yielding to the preſſure, and in which I thruſt a ſtick to the depth of ſix feet. In this, however, as above, numbers of the moſt beautiful cryſtals were formed; one of which, particularly, reſembled a table. Upon our egreſs from this amazing cavern, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Greek inſcription upon a rock at the mouth, but ſo obliterated by time, that we could not read it diſtinctly. It ſeemed to import that one Antipater, in the time of Alexander, had come hither; but whether he penetrated into the depths of the cavern, he does not think fit to inform us." This account of ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſtriking a ſcene, may ſerve to give us ſome idea of the ſubterraneous wonders of nature.</p>

It extended to a circumference of two thouſand ſix hundred leagues; chiefly affecting the

Its motions were ſo rapid, that perſons who lay at their length, were toſſed from ſide to ſide, as upon a rolling bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. The walls were daſhed from their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and no fewer than fifty-four cities, with an incredible number of villages, were either deſtroyed or greatly damaged. The city of Catanea, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, was utterly overthrown. A traveller, who was on his way thither, perceived, at the diſtance of ſome miles, a black cloud, like night, hanging over the place. The ſea, all of a ſudden, began to roar; Mount AEtna to ſend forth great ſpires of flame; and ſoon after a ſhock enſued, with a noiſe, as if all the artillery in the world had been at once diſcharged. Our traveller, being obliged to alight inſtantly, felt himſelf raiſed a foot from the ground; and turning his eyes to the city, he with amazement ſaw nothing but a thick cloud of duſt in the air. The birds flew about aſtoniſhed; the ſun was darkened, the beaſts ran howling from the hills; and, although the ſhock did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thouſand of the inhabitants of Sicily periſhed in the ruins. Catanea, to which city the deſcriber was tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling, ſeemed the principal ſcene of ruin; its place only was to be found; and not a footſtep of its for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>IN the progreſs of the Divine works and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there arrived a period, in which this earth was to be called into exiſtence. When the ſignal moment, predeſtined from all eternity, was come, the Deity aroſe in his might; and with a word created the world.—What an illuſtrious moment was that, when, from non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſtence, there ſprang at once into being, this mighty globe, on which ſo many millions of creatures now dwell?—No preparatory meaſures were required. No long circuit of means was employed. "He ſpake; and it was done: He commanded; and it ſtood faſt. The earth was at firſt without form, and void; and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was on the face of the deep." The Almighty ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the dark abyſs; and fixed bounds to the ſeveral diviſions of nature. He ſaid, "Let there be light; and there was light." Then appeared the ſea, and the dry land. The mountains roſe; and the rivers flowed. The ſun and moon began their courſe in the ſkies. Herbs and plants clothed the ground. The air, the earth, and the waters, were ſtored with their reſpective inhabitants. At laſt, man was made after the image of God. He appeared, walking with coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance erect; and received his Creator's benediction, as the Lord of this new world. The Almighty beheld his work when it was finiſhed; and pronounced it GOOD. Superior beings ſaw with wonder this new acceſſion to exiſtence.

                     <head>SECTION VII. On Charity.</head>
                     <p>CHARITY is the ſame with benevolence or love; and is the term uniformly employed, in the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, to denote all the good affections which we ought to bear towards one another. It conſiſts not in ſpeculative ideas of general benevolence, floating in the head, and leaving the heart, as ſpeculations too often do, untouched and cold. Neither is it confined to that indolent good nature, which makes us reſt ſatisfied with being free from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our fellow-creatures, without prompting us to be of ſervice to any. True charity is an active principle. It is not properly a ſingle virtue; but a diſpoſition reſiding in the heart, as a fountain whence all the virtues of benignity, candour, forbearance, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, compaſſion, and liberality, flow, as ſo many native ſtreams. From general good-will to all, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends its influence particularly to thoſe with whom we ſtand in neareſt connexion, and who are directly within the ſphere of our good offices. From the country or community to which we belong, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the ſmaller aſſociations of neighbourhood, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and friends; and ſpreads itſelf over the whole circle of ſocial and domeſtic life. I mean not that it imports a promiſcuous undiſtinguiſhing affection, which gives every man an equal title to our love. Charity, if we ſhould endeavour to carry it ſo far, would be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an impracticable virtue; and would reſolve it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into mere words, without affecting the heart. True charity attempts not to ſhut our eyes to the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035851_0143_100793F960DFB9C8"/>
diſtinction between good and bad men; nor to warm our hearts equally to thoſe who befriend, and thoſe who injure us. It reſerves our eſteem for good men, and our complacency for our friends. Towards our enemies it inſpires forgiveneſs, humanity, and a ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for their welfare. It breathes univerſal candour, and liberality of ſentiment. It forms gentleneſs of temper, and dictates affability of manners. It prompts correſponding ſympathies with them who rejoice, and them who weep. It teaches us to ſlight and deſpiſe no man. Charity is the comforter of the afflicted, the protector of the oppreſſed, the reconciler of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, the interceſſor for offenders. It is faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the friend, public ſpirit in the magiſtrate, equity and patience in the judge, moderation in the ſovereign, and loyalty in the ſubject. In parents, it is care and attention; in children, it is reverence and ſubmiſſion. In a word, it is the ſoul of ſocial life. It is the ſun that enlivens and cheers the abodes of men. It is "like the dew of Hermon," ſays the Pſalmiſt, "and the dew that deſcendeth on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Zion, where the Lord commanded the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even life for evermore."</p>

He ſeems, indeed, to be the complete model of that perfect cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which, under the denomination of a ſage or wiſe man, the philoſophers have been fond of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hopes of ever ſeeing it reduced to practice: ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily were all his virtues tempered together; ſo juſtly were they blended; and ſo powerfully did each pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the other from exceeding its proper bounds.</p>
                     <p>He knew how to conciliate the moſt enterpriſing ſpirit with the cooleſt moderation; the moſt obſtinate perſeverance, with the eaſieſt flexibility; the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere juſtice, with the greateſt lenity; the greateſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in command with the greateſt affability of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; the higheſt capacity and inclination for ſcience, with the moſt ſhining talents for action.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XI. Character of Queen Elizabeth.</head>
                     <p>THERE are few perſonages in hiſtory, who have been more expoſed to the calumny of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen Elizabeth; and yet there ſcarcely is any, whoſe reputation has been more certainly determined by the unanimous conſent of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. The unuſual length of her adminiſtration, and the ſtrong features of her character, were able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all prejudices; and, obliging her detractors to abate much of their invectives, and her admirers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of their panegyrics, have, at laſt, in ſpite of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical factions, and what is more, of religious animoſities, produced a uniform judgment with regard to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Her vigour, her conſtancy, her magnanimity, her penetration, vigilance, and addreſs, are allowed to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the higheſt praiſes; and appear not to have been ſurpaſſed by any perſon who ever filled a throne: a conduct leſs rigorous, leſs imperious, more ſincere, more indulgent to her people, would have been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to form a perfect character. By the force of her mind, ſhe controlled all her more active and ſtronger qualities; and prevented them from running into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Her heroiſm was exempted from all temerity; her frugality from avarice; her friendſhip from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality; her enterpriſe from turbulency and a vain am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. She guarded not herſelf, with equal care, or
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035851_0149_10079408E3DA92D8"/>
equal ſucceſs, from leſs infirmities; the rivalſhip of beauty, the deſire of admiration, the jealouſy of love, and the ſallies of anger.</p>
                     <p>Her ſingular talents for government were founded equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed with a great command over herſelf, ſhe ſoon obtained an uncontrolled aſcendant over the people. Few ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns of England ſucceeded to the throne in more difficult circumſtances; and none ever conducted the government with ſuch uniform ſucceſs and felicity.—Though unacquainted with the practice of toleration, the true ſecret for managing religious factions, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her people by her ſuperior prudence, from thoſe confuſions in which theological controverſy had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved all the neighbouring nations; and though her enemies were the moſt powerful princes of Europe, the moſt active, the moſt enterpriſing, the leaſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, ſhe was able, by her vigour, to make deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on their ſtate; her own greatneſs meanwhile remaining untouched and unimpaired.</p>
                     <p>The wiſe miniſters and brave men who flouriſhed during her reign, ſhare the praiſe of her ſucceſs; but, inſtead of leſſening the applauſe due to her, they make great addition to it. They owed, all of them, their advancement to her choice; they were ſupported by her conſtancy; and, with all their ability, they were never able to acquire an undue aſcendant over her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, ſhe remained equally miſtreſs. The force of the tender paſſions was great over her, but the force of her mind was ſtill ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior: and the combat which her victory viſibly coſt her, ſerves only to diſplay the firmneſs of her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the loftineſs of her ambitious ſentiments.</p>

The ſame of this princeſs, though it has ſurmounted the prejudices both of faction and of bigotry, yet lies ſtill expoſed to another prejudice, which is more durable, becauſe more natural; and which, according to the different views in which we ſurvey her, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable either of exalting beyond meaſure, or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the luſtre of her character. This prejudice is founded on the conſideration of her ſex. When we contemplate her as a woman, we are apt to be ſtruck with the higheſt admiration of her qualities and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive capacity; but we are alſo apt to require ſome more ſoftneſs of diſpoſition, ſome greater lenity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſome of thoſe amiable weakneſſes by which her ſex is diſtinguiſhed. But the true method of eſtimating her merit, is, to lay aſide all theſe conſiderations, and to conſider her merely as a rational being, placed in authority, and intruſted with the government of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>

                     <p>THE ſlavery produced by vice appears in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence under which it brings the ſinner, to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of external fortune. One of the favourite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of liberty, is the independence it beſtows. He who is truly a freeman is above all ſervile compliances, and abject ſubjection. He is able to reſt upon himſelf; and while he regards his ſuperiors with proper defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, neither debaſes himſelf by cringing to them, nor is tempted to purchaſe their favour by diſhonourable means. But the ſinner has forfeited every privilege of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035851_0151_1007940F8138D5F0"/>
this nature. His paſſions and habits render him an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute dependent on the world, and the world's favour; on the uncertain goods of fortune, and the fickle humours of men. For it is by theſe he ſubſiſts, and among theſe his happineſs is ſought; according as his paſſions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him to purſue pleaſures; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iches, or preferments. Having no fund within himſelf whence to draw enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his only reſource is in things without. His hopes and fears all hang upon the world. He partakes in all its viciſſitudes; and is moved and ſhaken by every wind of fortune. This is to be in the ſtricteſt ſenſe a ſlave to the world.</p>
                     <p>Religion and virtue, on the other hand, confer on the mind principles of noble independence. "The upright man is ſatisfied from himſelf." He deſpiſes not the advantages of fortune, but he centers not his happineſs in them. With a moderate ſhare of them he can be contented; and contentment is felicity. Happy in his own integrity, conſcious of the eſteem of good men, repoſing firm truſt in the providence, and the promiſes of God, he is exempted from ſervile depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on other things. He can wrap himſelf up in a good conſcience, and look forward, without terror, to the change of the world. Let all things ſhift around him as they pleaſe, he believes that, by the Divine ordination, they ſhall be made to work together in the iſſue for his good: And therefore, having much to hope from God, and little to fear from the world, he can be eaſy in every ſtate. One who poſſeſſes within himſelf ſuch an eſtabliſhment of mind, is truly free. But ſhall I call that man free, who has nothing that is his own, no property aſſured; whoſe very heart is not his own, but rendered the appendage of external things, and
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035851_0152_100794120CF9CED0"/>
the ſport of fortune? Is that man free, let his outward condition be ever ſo ſplendid, whom his imperious paſſions detain at their call, whom they ſend forth at their pleaſure, to drudge and toil, and to beg his only enjoyment from the caſualties of the world? Is he free, who muſt flatter and lie to compaſs his ends, who muſt bear with this man's caprice, and that man's ſcorn; muſt profeſs friendſhip where he hates, and reſpect where he contemns; who is not at liberty to appear in his own colours, nor to ſpeak his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; who dares not be honeſt, leſt he ſhould be poor?—Believe it, no chains bind ſo hard, no fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſo heavy, as thoſe which faſten the corrupted heart to this treacherous world; no dependence is more contemptible than that under which the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, the covetous, or the ambitious man, lies to the means of pleaſure, gain, or power. Yet this is the boaſted liberty, which vice promiſes, as the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of ſetting us free from the ſalutary reſtraints of virtue.</p>

                     <p>IT will not take much time to delineate the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the man of integrity, as by its nature it is a plain one, and eaſily underſtood. He is one, who makes it his conſtant rule to follow the road of duty, according as the word of God, and the voice of his conſcience, point it out to him.

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035851_0153_1007941399DFFA48"/>
colour of virtue to a looſe and unſtable character. The upright man is guided by a fixed principle of mind, which determines him to eſteem nothing but what is honourable; and to abhor whatever is baſe and unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence we find him ever the ſame; at all times, the truſty friend, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate relation, the conſcientious man of buſineſs, the pious worſhipper, the public ſpirited citizen. He aſſumes no borrowed appearance. He ſeeks no maſk to cover him; for he acts no ſtudied part; but he is indeed what he appears to be, full of truth, candour, and humanity. In all his purſuits, he knows no path but the fair and direct one; aud would much rather fail of ſucceſs, than attain it by reproachful means. He never ſhows us a ſmiling countenance, while he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates evil againſt us in his heart. He never praiſes us among our friends; and then joins in traducing us among our enemies. We ſhall never find one part of his character at variance with another.

That paſſive tameneſs, which ſubmits, without oppoſition, to every encroachment of the violent and aſſuming, forms no part of Chriſtian duty; but, on the contrary, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of general happineſs and order. That unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035851_0154_100794184E711138"/>
complaiſance, which, on every occaſion, falls in with the opinions and manners of others, is ſo far from being a virtue, that it is itſelf a vice, and the parent of many vices. It overthrows all ſteadineſs of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and produces that ſinful conformity with the world, which taints the whole character. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent corrupted ſtate of human manners, always to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and to comply, is the very worſt maxim we can adopt. It is impoſſible to ſupport the purity and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſtian morals, without oppoſing the world on various occaſions, even though we ſhould ſtand alone. That gentleneſs therefore which belongs to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from the mean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of cowards, and the fawning aſſent of ſycophants. It renounces no juſt right from fear. It gives up no important truth from flattery. It is indeed not only conſiſtent with a firm mind, but it neceſſarily requires a manly ſpirit, and a fixed principle, in order to give it any real value. Upon this ſolid ground only, the poliſh of gentleneſs can with advantage be ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>It ſtands oppoſed, not to the moſt determined regard for virtue and truth, but to harſhneſs and ſeverity, to pride and arrogance, to violence and oppreſſion. It is properly, that part of the great virtue of charity, which makes us unwilling to give pain to any of our brethren. Compaſſion prompts us to relieve their wants. Forbearance prevents us from retaliating their injuries. Meekneſs reſtrains our angry paſſions; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, our ſevere judgments. Gentleneſs corrects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is offenſive in our manners; and, by a conſtant train of humane attentions, ſtudies to alleviate the burden of common miſery. Its office, therefore, is
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035851_0155_1007941B64387600"/>
extenſive. It is not, like ſome other virtues, called forth only on peculiar emergencies; but it is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in action, when we are engaged in intercourſe with men. It ought to form our addreſs, to regulate our ſpeech, and to diffuſe itſelf over our whole beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                     <p>We muſt not, however, confound this gentle "wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above," with that artificial courteſy, that ſtudied ſmoothneſs of manners, which is learned in the ſchool of the world. Such accompliſhments, the moſt frivolous and empty may poſſeſs. Too often they are employed by the artful, as a ſnare; too often affected by the hard and unfeeling, as a cover to the baſeneſs of their minds. We cannot, at the ſame time, avoid obſerving the homage, which, even in ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the world is conſtrained to pay to virtue. In order to render ſociety agreeable, it is found ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to aſſume ſomewhat, that may at leaſt carry its appearance. Virtue is the univerſal charm. Even its ſhadow is courted, when the ſubſtance is wanting. The imitation of its form has been reduced into an art; and in the commerce of life, the firſt ſtudy of all who would either gain the eſteem, or win the hearts of others, is to learn the ſpeech, and to adopt the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of candour, gentleneſs, and humanity. But that gentleneſs which is the characteriſtic of a good man, has, like every other virtue, its ſeat in the heart: and let me add, nothing except what flows from the heart, can render even external manners truly pleaſing. For no aſſumed behaviour can at all times hide the real character. In that unaffected civility which ſprings from a gentle mind, there is a charm infinitely more powerful, than in all the ſtudied manners of the moſt finiſhed courtier.</p>
                     <p>

True gentleneſs is founded on a ſenſe of what we owe to HIM who made us, and to the common nature of which we all ſhare. It ariſes from reflection on our own failings and wants; and from juſt views of the condition, and the duty of man. It is native feeling, heightened and improved by principle. It is the heart which eaſily relents; which feels for every thing that is human; and is backward and ſlow to inflict the leaſt wound. It is affable in its addreſs, and mild in its demeanour; ever ready to oblige, and willing to be obliged by others; breathing habitual kindneſs towards friends, courteſy to ſtrangers, long-ſuffering to enemies. It exerciſes authority with moderation; adminiſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof with tenderneſs; confers favours with eaſe and modeſty. It is unaſſuming in opinion, and temperate in zeal. It contends not eagerly about trifles; ſlow to contradict, and ſtill ſlower to blame; but prompt to allay diſſention, and to reſtore peace. It neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddles unneceſſarily with the affairs, nor pries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitively into the ſecrets of others. It delights above all things to alleviate diſtreſs; and, if it cannot dry up the falling tear, to ſooth at leaſt the grieving heart. Where it has not the power of being uſeful, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver burdenſome. It ſeeks to pleaſe, rather than to ſhine and dazzle; and conceals with care, that ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority, either of talents, or of rank, which is oppreſſive to thoſe who are beneath it. In a word, it is that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and that tenour of manners, which the goſpel of Chriſt enjoins, when it commands us "to bear one another's burdens; to rejoice with thoſe who rejoice, and to weep with thoſe who weep; to pleaſe every one his neighbour for his good; to be kind and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted; to be pitiful and courteous; to ſupport the weak, and to be patient towards all men."</p>

                     <head>SECTION I. Trial and Execution of the Earl of Strafford, who fell a Sacrifice to the Violence of the Times, in the Reign of Charles the Firſt.</head>
                     <p>THE Earl of Strafford defended himſelf againſt the accuſations of the houſe of Commons, with all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, judgment, and ſagacity, that could be expected from innocence and ability. His children were placed beſide him, as he was thus defending his life, and the cauſe of his royal maſter. After he had, in a long and eloquent ſpeech, delivered without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, confuted all the accuſations of his enemies, he thus drew to a concluſion. "But, my Lords, I have troubled you too long: longer than I ſhould have done, but for the ſake of theſe dear pledges, which a ſaint in heaven has left me."—Upon this he pauſed; dropped a tear; looked upon his children; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.—"What I forfeit for myſelf is a trifle: that my indiſcretions ſhould reach my poſterity, wounds me to the heart. Pardon my infirmity.—Something I ſhould have added, but I am not able; and therefore I let it paſs. And now, my Lords, for myſelf. I have long been taught, that the afflictions of this life are overpaid by that eternal weight of glory, which awaits the innocent. And ſo, my Lords, even ſo, with the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035851_0158_100794241AD21E90"/>
utmoſt tranquillity, I ſubmit myſelf to your judgment, whether that judgment be life or death: not my will, but thine, O God, be done!"</p>
                     <p>His eloquence and innocence induced thoſe judges to pity, who were the moſt zealous to condemn him. The King himſelf went to the Houſe of Lords, and ſpoke for ſome time in his defence; but the ſpirit of vengeance, which had been chained for eleven years, was now rouſed; and nothing but his blood could give the people ſatisfaction. He was condemned by both Houſes of Parliament; and nothing remained but for the King to give his conſent to the bill of attainder. But in the preſent commotions, the conſent of the King would very eaſily be diſpenſed with; and immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger might attend his refuſal. Charles, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who loved Strafford tenderly, heſitated, and ſeemed reluctant; trying every expedient to put off ſo dreadful an office, as that of ſigning the warrant for his execution. While he continued in this agitation of mind, and ſtate of ſuſpenſe, his doubts were at laſt ſilenced by an act of great magnanimity in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Lord. He received a letter from that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate nobleman, deſiring that his life might be made a ſacrifice to obtain reconciliation between the King and his people: adding, that he was prepared to die; and that to a willing mind there could be no injury. This inſtance of noble generoſity was but ill repaid by his maſter, who complied with his requeſt. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſign the fatal bill by commiſſion; and Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford was beheaded on Tower-Hill; behaving with all that compoſed dignity of reſolution, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his character.</p>

                     <head>SECTION II. An eminent Inſtance of true Fortitude of Mind.</head>
                     <p>ALL who have been diſtinguiſhed as ſervants of God, or benefactors of men; all who, in perilous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, have acted their part with ſuch honour as to render their names illuſtrious through ſucceeding ages, have been eminent for fortitude of mind. Of this we have one conſpicuous example in the Apoſtle Paul, whom it will be inſtructive for us to view in a remarkable occurrence of his life. After having long acted as the apoſtle of the Gentiles, his miſſion called him to go to Jeruſalem, where he knew that he was to encounter the utmoſt violence of his enemies. Juſt before he ſet ſail, he called together the elders of his favourite church at Epheſus; and, in a pathetic ſpeech, which does great honour to his character, gave them his laſt farewell. Deeply affected by their knowledge of the certain dangers to which he was expoſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, all the aſſembly were filled with diſtreſs, and melted into tears. The circumſtances were ſuch, as might have conveyed dejection even into a reſolute mind; and would have totally overwhelmed the feeble. "They all wept ſore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kiſſed him; ſorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpoke, that they ſhould ſee his face no more."—What were then the ſentiments, what was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of this great and good man? Hear the words which ſpoke his firm and undaunted mind. "Behold, I go bound in the ſpirit, to Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there; ſave that the
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:035851_0160_1007942A33D5A740"/>
Holy Spirit witneſſeth in every city, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me; neither count I my life dear to myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God." There was uttered the voice, there breathed the ſpirit, of a brave and a virtuous man. Such a man knows not what it is to ſhrink from danger, when conſcience points out his path. In that path he is determined to walk; let the conſequences be what they may.</p>
                     <p>This was the magnanimous behaviour of that great Apoſtle, when he had perſecution and diſtreſs full in view. Attend now to the ſentiments of the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent man, when the time of his laſt ſuffering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; and remark the majeſty, and the eaſe, with which he looked on death. "I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight. I have finiſhed my courſe. I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs." How many years of life does ſuch a dying moment overbalance? Who would not chooſe, in this manner, to go off the ſtage, with ſuch a ſong of triumph in his mouth, rather than prolong his exiſtence through a wretched old age, ſtained with ſin and ſhame?</p>

to fall upon us with their heavieſt preſſure, it lightens the load by many conſolations to which others are ſtrangers. While bad men trace, in the calamities with which they are viſited, the hand of an offended ſovereign, Chriſtians are taught to view them as the well-intended chaſtiſements of a merciful Father. They hear amidſt them, that ſtill voice which a good conſcience brings to their ear: "Fear not, for I am with thee; be not diſmayed, for I am thy God." They apply to themſelves the comfortable promiſes with which the goſpel abounds. They diſcover in theſe the happy iſſue decreed to their troubles; and wait with patience till Providence ſhall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed its great and good deſigns. the mean time, Devotion opens to them its bleſſed and holy ſanctuary: That ſanctuary in which the wounded heart is healed, and the weary mind is at reſt; where the cares of the world are forgotten, where its tumults are huſhed, and its miſeries diſappear; where greater objects open to our view than any which the world preſents; where a more ſerene ſky ſhines, and a ſweeter and calmer light beams on the afflicted heart. In thoſe moments of devotion, a pious man, pouring out his wants and ſorrows to an almighty Supporter, feels that he is not left ſolitary and forſaken in a vale of woe. God is with him; Chriſt and the Holy Spirit are with him; and, though he ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of every friend on earth, he can look up in heaven to a Friend that will never deſert him.</p>

                     <head>SECTION IV. The Cloſe of Life.</head>
                     <p>WHEN we contemplate the cloſe of life; the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of man's deſigns and hopes; the ſilence that now reigns among thoſe who, a little while ago, were ſo buſy, or ſo gay; who can avoid being touched with ſenſations at once awful and tender? What heart but then warms with the glow of humanity? In whoſe eye does not the tear gather, on revolving the fate of paſſing and ſhort-lived man?</p>
                     <p>Behold the poor man who lays down at laſt the burden of his weariſome life. No more ſhall he groan under the load of poverty and toil. No more ſhall he hear the inſolent calls of the maſter, from whom he received his ſcanty wages. No more ſhall he be raiſed from needful ſlumber on his bed of ſtraw, nor be hurried away from his homely meal, to undergo the repeated labours of the day. While his humble grave is preparing, and a few poor and decayed neighbours are carrying him thither, it is good for us to think, that this man too was our brother; that for him the aged and deſtitute wife, and the needy child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, now weep; that, neglected as he was by the world, he poſſeſſed perhaps both a ſound underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a worthy heart; and is now carried by angels to reſt in Abraham's boſom.—At no great diſtance from him, the grave is opened to receive the rich and proud man. For, as it is ſaid with emphaſis in the parable, "the rich man alſo died, and was buried." He alſo died. His riches prevented not his ſharing
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:035851_0163_10079432E7C65F80"/>
the ſame fate with the poor man; perhaps, through luxury, they accelerated his doom. Then, indeed, "the mourners go about the ſtreets;" and while, in all the pomp and magnificence of woe, his funeral is prepared, his heirs, impatient to examine his will, are looking on one another with jealous eyes, and already beginning to diſpute about the diviſion of his ſubſtance.—One day, we ſee carried along the coffin of the ſmiling infant; the flower juſt nipped as it began to bloſſom in the parent's view: and the next day, we behold the young man, or young woman, of blooming form and promiſing hopes, laid in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely grave. While the funeral is attended by a numerous unconcerned company, who are diſcourſing to one another about the news of the day, or the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary affairs of life, let our thoughts rather follow to the houſe of mourning, and repreſent to themſelves what is paſſing there. There, we ſhould ſee a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate family, ſitting in ſilent grief, thinking of the ſad breach that is made in their little ſociety; and, with tears in their eyes, looking to the chamber that is now left vacant, and to every memorial that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf of their departed friend. By ſuch attention to the woes of others, the ſelfiſh hardneſs of our hearts will be gradually ſoftened, and melted down into hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
                     <p>Another day, we follow to the grave, one who, in old age, and after a long career of life, has in full maturity ſunk at laſt into reſt. As we are going along to the manſion of the dead, it is natural for us to think, and to diſcourſe, of all the changes which ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has ſeen during the courſe of his life. He has paſſed, it is likely, through varieties of fortune. He
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035851_0164_10079435B7B5D358"/>
has experienced proſperity, and adverſity. He has ſeen families and kindreds riſe and fall. He has ſeen peace and war ſucceeding in their turns; the face of his country undergoing many alterations; and the very city in which he dwelt riſing, in a manner, new around him. After all he has beheld, his eyes are now cloſed for ever. He was becoming a ſtranger in the midſt of a new ſucceſſion of men. A race who knew him not, had ariſen to fill the earth. Thus paſſes the world away. Throughout all ranks and conditions, "one generation paſſeth, and another ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration cometh;" and this great inn is by turns eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated, and repleniſhed, by troops of ſucceeding pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims.—O vain and inconſtant world! O fleeting and tranſient life! When will the ſons of men learn to think of thee as they ought! When will they learn humanity from the afflictions of their brethren; or moderation and wiſdom from the ſenſe of their own fugitive ſtate.</p>

                     <p>BESIDES the felicity which ſprings from perfect love, there are two circumſtances which particularly enhance the bleſſedneſs of that "multitude who ſtand before the throne;" theſe are, acceſs to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted ſociety, and renewal of the moſt tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions. The former is pointed out in the Scripture, by "joining the innumerable company of angels, and the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born; by

fitting down with Abraham, and Iſaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven;" a promiſe which opens the ſublimeſt proſpects to the human mind. It allows good men to entertain the hope, that ſeparated from all the dregs of the human maſs, from that mixed and polluted crowd in the midſt of which they now dwell, they ſhall be permitted to mingle with prophets, patriarchs, and apoſtles, with all thoſe great and illuſtrious ſpirits, who have ſhone in former ages as the ſervants of God, or the benefactors of men; whoſe deeds we are accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to celebrate; whoſe ſteps we now follow at a diſtance; and whoſe names we pronounce with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>United to this high aſſembly, the bleſſed, at the ſame time, renew thoſe ancient connexions with virtuous friends which had been diſſolved by death. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this awakens in the heart, the moſt pleaſing and tender ſentiment that perhaps can fill it, in this mortal ſtate. For of all the ſorrows which we are here doomed to endure, none is ſo bitter as that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the fatal ſtroke which ſeparates us, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for ever, from thoſe to whom either nature or friendſhip had intimately joined our hearts. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, from time to time, renews the anguiſh; opens the wound which ſeemed once to have been cloſed; and, by recalling joys that are paſt and gone, touches every ſpring of painful ſenſibility. In theſe agonizing moments, how relieving the thought, that the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is only temporary, not eternal; that there is a time to come of re-union with thoſe with whom our happieſt days were ſpent; whoſe joys and ſorrows once were ours; whoſe piety and virtue cheered and encouraged us; and from whom, after we ſhall have

                     <p>No human character exhibited in the records of Scripture, is more remarkable or inſtructive than that of the patriarch Joſeph. He is one whom we behold tried in all the viciſſitudes of fortune; from the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſlave, riſing to be ruler of the land of Egypt; and in every ſtation acquiring, by his virtue and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, favour with God and man. When overſeer of Potiphar's houſe, his fidelity was proved by ſtrong temptations, which he honourably reſiſted. When thrown into priſon by the artifice of a falſe woman, his integrity and prudence ſoon rendered him conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, even in that dark manſion. When called into the preſence of Pharaoh, the wiſe and extenſive plan which he formed for ſaving the kingdom from the miſeries of impending famine, juſtly raiſed him to a high ſtation, wherein his abilities were eminently diſplayed in the public ſervice. But in his whole hiſtory, there is no circumſtance ſo ſtriking and intereſting, as his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his brethren who had ſold him into ſlavery. The moment in which he made himſelf known to them, was the moſt critical one of his life, and the moſt deciſive of his character. It is ſuch as rarely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the courſe of human events; and is calculated
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035851_0167_1007943E5E3CE7E0"/>
to draw the higheſt attention of all who are endowed with any degree of ſenſibility of heart.</p>
                     <p>From the whole tenour of the narration it appears, that though Joſeph, upon the arrival of his brethren in Egypt, made himſelf ſtrange to them, yet from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning he intended to diſcover himſelf; and ſtudied ſo to conduct the diſcovery, as might render the ſurpriſe of joy complete. For this end, by affected ſeverity, he took meaſures for bringing down into Egypt all his father's children. They were now arrived there; and Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min among the reſt, who was his younger brother by the ſame mother, and was particularly beloved by Joſeph. Him he threatened to detain; and ſeemed willing to allow the reſt to depart. This incident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their diſtreſs. They all knew their father's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme anxiety about the ſafety of Benjamin, and with what difficulty he had yielded to his undertaking this journey. Should he be prevented from returning, they dreaded that grief would overpower the old man's ſpirits, and prove fatal to his life. Judah, therefore, who had particularly urged the neceſſity of Benjamin's accompanying his brothers, and had ſolemnly pledged himſelf to their father for his ſafe return, craved, upon this occaſion, an audience of the governour; and gave him a full account of the circumſtances of Jacob's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more intereſting and pathetic than this diſcourſe of Judah. Little knowing to whom he ſpoke, he paints in all the colours of ſimple and natural eloquence, the diſtreſſed ſituation of the aged patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, haſtening to the cloſe of life; long afflicted for the loſs of a favourite ſon, whom he ſuppoſed to have been turn in pieces by a beaſt of prey; labouring now
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035851_0168_1007943FEEE6C660"/>
under anxious concern about his youngeſt ſon, the child of his old age, who alone was left alive of his mother, and whom nothing but the calamities of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere famine could have moved a tender father to ſend from home, and expoſe to the dangers of a foreign land. "If we bring him not back with us, we ſhall bring down the grey hairs of thy ſervant, our father, with ſorrow to the grave. I pray thee therefore let thy ſervant abide, inſtead of the young man, a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to our lord. For how ſhall I go up to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Benjamin not with me? leſt I ſee the evil that ſhall come on my father."</p>
                     <p>Upon this relation, Joſeph could no longer reſtrain himſelf. The tender ideas of his father and his father's houſe, of his ancient home, his country and his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, of the diſtreſs of his family, and his own exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all ruſhed too ſtrongly upon his mind to bear any farther concealment. "He cried, cauſe every man to go out from me; and he wept aloud." The tears which he ſhed were not the tears of grief. They were the burſt of affection. They were the effuſions of a heart overflowing with all the tender ſenſibilities of nature. Formerly he had been moved in the ſame manner, when he firſt ſaw his brethren before him. "His bowels yearned upon them; he ſought for a place where to weep. He went into his chamber; and then waſhed his face and returned to them." At that period his generous plans were not completed. But now, when there was no farther occaſion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining himſelf, he gave free vent to the ſtrong emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his heart. The firſt miniſter to the king of Egypt was not aſhamed to ſhow, that he felt as a man,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035851_0169_10079442D6A3DE30"/>
and a brother. "He wept aloud; and the Egyptians, and the houſe of Pharaoh heard him."</p>
                     <p>The firſt words which his ſwelling heart allowed him to pronounce, are the moſt ſuitable to ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting ſituation that were ever uttered;—"I am Joſeph; doth my father yet live?—What could he, what ought he, in that impaſſioned moment, to have ſaid more? This is the voice of Nature herſelf, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own language; and it penetrates the heart: No pomp of expreſſion; no parade of kindneſs; but ſtrong affection haſtening to utter what it ſtrongly felt. "His brethren could not anſwer him; for they were troubled at his preſence." Their ſilence is as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of thoſe emotions of repentance and ſhame, which, on this amazing diſcovery, filled their breaſts, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their utterance, as the few words which Joſeph ſpeaks, are expreſſive of the generous agitations which ſtruggled for vent within him. No painter could ſeize a more ſtriking moment for diſplaying the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical features of the human heart, than what is here preſented. Never was there a ſituation of more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and virtuous joy, on the one hand; nor, on the other, of more overwhelming confuſion and conſcious guilt. In the ſimple narration of the ſacred hiſtorian, it is ſet before us with greater energy and higher ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, than if it had been wrought up with all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of the moſt admired modern eloquence.</p>

                     <p>THE ſad evening before the death of that noble youth, whoſe laſt hours ſuggeſted theſe thoughts, I was with him. No one was there, but his phyſician, and an intimate whom he loved, and whom he had ruined. At my coming in, he ſaid,—"You and the phyſician are come too late.—I have neither life nor hope. You both aim at miracles. You would raiſe the dead!"</p>
                     <p>Heaven, I ſaid, was merciful—"Or," exclaimed he,—"I could not have been thus guilty. What has it not done to bleſs, and to ſave me?—I have been too ſtrong for Omnipotence! I have plucked down ruin."—I ſaid, the bleſſed Redeemer,—"Hold! hold! you wound me!—That is the rock on which I ſplit—I denied his name!"</p>
                     <p>Refuſing to hear any thing from me, or take any thing from the phyſician, he lay ſilent, as far as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den darts of pain would permit, till the clock ſtruck: Then with vehemence;—"Oh! time! time! it is fit thou ſhouldſt thus ſtrike thy murderer to the heart!—How art thou fled for ever!—A month!—Oh, for a ſingle week! I aſk not for years; though an age were too little for the much I have to do."</p>

                     <p>His friend being much touched, even to tears at this—(who could forbear? I could not)—with a moſt affectionate look, he ſaid, "Keep thoſe tears for thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I have undone thee.—Doſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here his friend, too much affected, would have left him.—"No, ſtay—thou ſtill mayſt hope;—there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear me. How madly have I talk'd! How madly haſt thou liſtened, and believed! but look on my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, as a full anſwer to thee, and to myſelf. This body is all weakneſs and pain; but my ſoul, as if ſtung up by torment to greater ſtrength and ſpirit, is full powerful to reaſon; full mighty to ſuffer. And that, which thus triumphs within the jaws of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, is, doubtleſs, immortal—And as for a Deity, nothing leſs than an Almighty could inflict what I feel."</p>
                     <p>I was about to congratulate this paſſive, involuntary confeſſor, on his aſſerting the two prime articles of his creed, extorted by the rack of nature, when he thus, very paſſionately:—"No, no! let me ſpeak on. I have not long to ſpeak.—My much injured friend! my ſoul, as my body, lies in ruins; in ſcattered frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of broken thought—Remorſe for the paſt, throws my thought on the future.

he cried out:—"My principles have poiſoned my friend; my extravagance has beggared my boy! my unkindneſs has murdered my wife!—And is there another hell?—Oh! thou blaſphemed, yet indulgent LORD GOD! Hell itſelf is a refuge, if it hide me from thy frown!"</p>
                     <p>Soon after his underſtanding failed. His terrified imagination uttered horrors not to be repeated, or ever forgotten. And ere the ſun (which, I hope, has ſeen few like him) aroſe, the gay, young, noble, ingenious, accompliſhed, and moſt wretched Altamont expired!</p>
                     <p>If this is a man of pleaſure, what is a man of pain? How quick, how total, is their tranſit! In what a diſmal gloom they ſet for ever! How ſhort, alas! the day of their rejoicing!—For a moment they glitter—they dazzle. In a moment, where are they? Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion covers their memories. Ah! would it did! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy ſnatches them from oblivion. In the long-living annals of infamy their triumphs are recorded. Thy ſufferings ſtill bleed in the boſom, poor Altamont! of the heart-ſtricken friend—for Altamont had a friend. He might have had many.

The world is ridiculous, and I laugh at it: it is deplorable, and thou lamenteſt over it. Every perſon views it in his own way, and according to his own temper. One point is unqueſtionable, that mankind are prepoſterous: to think right, and to act well, we muſt think and act differently from them. To ſubmit to the authority, and follow the example of the greater part of men, would render us fooliſh and miſerable.</p>

                        <p>No:—the more profound our ſearches are into the nature of things, the more uncertainty we ſhall find; and the moſt ſubtle minds ſee objections and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in every ſyſtem, which are overlooked or undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable by ordinary underſtandings.</p>

                        <p>It would be better than to be no philoſopher, and to continue in the vulgar herd of mankind, that one may have the convenience of thinking that one knows ſomething. I find that the eyes which nature has given me, ſee many things very clearly, though ſome are out of their reach, or diſcerned but dimly. What opinion ought I to have of a phyſician, who ſhould offer me an eye-water, the uſe of which would at firſt ſo ſharpen my ſight, as to carry it farther than ordinary
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035851_0182_10079465310D05A8"/>
viſion; but would in the end put them out? Your philoſophy is to the eyes of the mind, what I have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the doctor's noſtrum to be to thoſe of the body. It actually brought your own excellent underſtanding, which was by nature quick-ſighted, and rendered more ſo by art and a ſubtilty of logick peculiar to yourſelf—it brought, I ſay, your very acute underſtanding to ſee nothing clearly; and enveloped all the great truths of reaſon and religion in miſts of doubt.</p>

                        <p>Yes; it is good for human nature to know its own weakneſs. When we arrogantly preſume on a ſtrength we have not, we are always in great danger of hurting ourſelves, or at leaſt of deſerving ridicule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, by vain and idle efforts.</p>

                        <p>I agree with you, that human nature ſhould know its own weakneſs; but it ſhould alſo feel its ſtrength, and try to improve it. This was my employment as a philoſopher. I endeavoured to diſcover the real pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the mind, to ſee what it could do, and what it
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035851_0183_100794681FF72E88"/>
could not; to reſtrain it from efforts beyond its ability; but to teach it how to advance as far as the faculties given to it by nature, with the utmoſt exertion and moſt proper culture of them, would allow it to go. In the vaſt ocean of philoſophy, I had the line and the plummet always in my hands. Many of its depths I found myſelf unable to fathom; but, by caution in ſounding, and the careful obſervations I made in the courſe of my voyage, I found out ſome truths of ſo much uſe to mankind, that they acknowledge me to have been their benefactor.</p>

                        <p>Their ignorance makes them think ſo. Some other philoſopher will come hereafter, and ſhew thoſe truths to be falſehoods. He will pretend to diſcover other truths of equal importance. A later ſage, will ariſe, perhaps among men now barbarous and unlearned, whoſe ſagacious diſcoveries will diſcredit the opinions of his admired predeceſſor. In philoſophy, as in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all changes its form, and one thing exiſts by the deſtruction of another.</p>

But ſome opinions there are, even in matters not obvious to the common ſenſe of mankind, which the mind has received on ſuch rational grounds of aſſent, that they are as immoveable as the pillars of heaven; or (to ſpeak philoſophically) as the great laws of Nature, by which, under God, the univerſe is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

Can you ſeriouſly think, that, becauſe the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of your countryman Deſcartes, which was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an ingenious, well-imagined romance, has been lately exploded, the ſyſtem of Newton, which is built on experiments and geometry, the two moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain methods of diſcovering truth, will ever fail; or that, becauſe the whims of fanatics and the divinity of the ſchoolmen, cannot now be ſupported, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of that religion, which I, the declared enemy of all enthuſiaſm and falſe reaſoning, firmly believed and maintained, will ever be ſhaken?</p>

Your ſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm is more affected than real. You found it a ſhorter way to a great reputation, (the only wiſh of your heart,) to object, than to defend; to pull down than to ſet up. And your talents were admirable for that kind of work. Then your huddling together in a Critical Dictionary, a pleaſant tale, or obscene jeſt, and a grave argument againſt the Chriſtian religion, a witty confutation of ſome abſurd author, and an artful ſophiſm to impeach ſome reſpectable truth, was particularly commodious to all our young ſmarts and ſmatterers in free-thinking. But what miſchief have you not done to human ſociety? You have endeavoured, and with ſome degree of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,

to ſhake thoſe foundations, on which the whole moral world, and the great fabric of ſocial happineſs, entirely reſt. How could you, as a philoſopher, in the ſober hours of reflection, anſwer for this to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, even ſuppoſing you had doubts of the truth of a ſyſtem, which gives to virtue its ſweeteſt hopes, to impenitent vice its greateſt fears, and to true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence its beſt conſolations; which reſtrains even the leaſt approaches to guilt, and yet makes thoſe allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for the infirmities of our nature, which the Stoic pride denied to it, but which its real imperfection, and the goodneſs of its infinitely benevolent Creator, ſo evidently require?</p>

                        <p>The root of theſe evils, you well know, was falſe religion: but you ſtruck at the true. Heaven and hell are not more different, than the ſyſtem of faith I defended, and that which produced the horrors of which you ſpeak. Why would you ſo fallaciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them together in ſome of your writings, that it requires much more judgment, and a more diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, than ordinary readers have, to ſeparate them again, and to make the proper diſtinctions?

                     <p>THE time is come, Fathers, when that which has long been wiſhed for, towards allaying the envy your order has been ſubject to, and removing the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations againſt trials, is effectually put in our power. An opinion has long prevailed, not only here at home, but likewiſe in foreign countries, both dangerous to you, and pernicious to the ſtate,—that, in proſecutions, men of wealth are always ſafe, however clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed. There is now to be brought upon his trial before you, to the confuſion, I hope, of the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of this ſlanderous imputation, one whoſe life and actions condemn him in the opinion of all impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſons; but who, according to his own reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declared dependence upon his riches, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acquitted; I mean Caius Verres. I demand juſtice of you, Fathers, upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of the public treaſury, the oppreſſor of Aſia Minor and Pamphylia, the invader of the rights and privileges of Romans, the ſcourge and curſe of Sicily. If that ſentence is paſſed upon him which his crimes deſerve, your authority, Fathers, will be venerable and ſacred in
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:035851_0191_1007AB476BD0F6F8"/>
the eyes of the public; but if his great riches ſhould bias you in his favour, I ſhall ſtill gain one point,—to make it apparent to all the world, that what was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this caſe, was not a criminal nor a proſecutor, but juſtice and adequate puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>To paſs over the ſhameful irregularities of his youth, what does his quaeſtorſhip, the firſt public employment he held, what does it exhibit, but one continued ſcene of villanies? Cneius Carbo plundered of the public money by his own treaſurer, a conſul ſtripped and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and army deſerted and reduced to want, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince robbed, the civil and religious rights of a people violated. The employment he held in Aſia Minor and Pamphylia, what did it produce but the ruin of thoſe countries? in which, houſes, cities, and temples were robbed by him. What was his conduct in his praetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here at home? Let the plundered temples, and public works neglected, that he might embezzle the money intended for carrying them on, bear witneſs. How did he diſcharge the office of a judge? Let thoſe who ſuffered by his injuſtice anſwer. But his praetor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Sicily crowns all his works of wickedneſs, and finiſhes a laſting monument to his infamy. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs done by him in that unhappy country, during the three years of his iniquitous adminiſtration, are ſuch, that many years, under the wiſeſt and beſt of praetors, will not be ſufficient to reſtore things to the condition in which he found them: for it is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that, during the time of his tyranny, the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians neither enjoyed the protection of their own original laws; of the regulations made for their benefit by the Roman ſenate, upon their coming under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the commonwealth; nor of the natural and
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:035851_0192_1007AB48F4BBC950"/>
unalienable rights of men. His nod has decided all cauſes in Sicily for theſe three years. And his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions have broken all law, all precedent, all right. The ſums he has, by arbitrary taxes and unheard of impoſitions, extorted from the induſtrious poor, are not to be computed. The moſt faithful allies of the commonwealth have been treated as enemies. Roman citizens have, like ſlaves, been put to death with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The moſt atrocious criminals, for money, have been exempted from the deſerved puniſhments; and men of the moſt unexceptionable characters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and baniſhed unheard. The harbours, though ſufficiently fortified, and the gates of ſtrong towns, have been opened to pirates and ravagers. The ſoldiery and ſailors, belonging to a province under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the commonwealth, have been ſtarved to death. Whole fleets, to the great detriment of the province, ſuffered to periſh. The ancient monuments of either Sicilian or Roman greatneſs, the ſtatues of heroes and princes have been carried off; and the temples ſtripped of the images.—Having, by his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous ſentences, filled the priſons with the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and deſerving of the people, he then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to order numbers of Roman citizens to be ſtrangled in the gaols: ſo that the exclamation, "I am a citizen of Rome!" which has often, in the moſt diſtant regions, and among the moſt barbarous people, been a protection, was of no ſervice to them; but, on the contrary, brought a ſpeedier and more ſevere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment upon them.</p>
                     <p>I aſk now, Verres, what thou haſt to advance againſt this charge? Wilt thou pretend to deny it? Wilt thou pretend, that any thing falſe, that even any thing
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:035851_0193_1007AB4B553CEB90"/>
aggravated, is alleged againſt thee? Had any prince, or any ſtate, committed the ſame outrage againſt the privilege of Roman citizens, ſhould we not think we had ſufficient ground for demanding ſatisfaction? What puniſhment ought, then, to be inflicted upon a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater diſtance than Sicily, within ſight of the Italian coaſt, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Coſanus, only for his having aſſerted his privilege of citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and declared his intention of appealing to the juſtice of his country, againſt a cruel oppreſſor, who had unjuſtly confined him in priſon at Syracuſe, whence he had juſt made his eſcape? The unhappy man, arreſted as he was going to embark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance diſtorted with cruelty, he orders the helpleſs victim of his rage to be ſtripped, and rods to be brought; accuſing him, but without the leaſt ſhadow of evidence, or even of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, of having come to Sicily, as a ſpy. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man citizen: I have ſerved under Lucius Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tius, who is now at Panormus, and will atteſt my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence." The blood-thirſty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted. Thus, Fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen publicly mangled with ſcourging; whilſt the only words he uttered, amidſt his cruel ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With theſe he hoped to defend himſelf from violence and infamy. But of ſo little ſervice was this privilege to him, that, while he was thus aſſerting his citizenſhip, the order
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:035851_0194_100792301B703738"/>
was given for his execution,—for his execution upon the croſs!—</p>
                     <p>O liberty!—O ſound once delightful to every Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ear!—O ſacred privilege of Roman citizenſhip!—once ſacred!—now trampled upon!—But what then? Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magiſtrate, a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within ſight of Italy, bind, ſcourge, torture with fire and red hot plates of iron, and at laſt put to the infamous death of the croſs, a Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence expiring in agony, nor the tears of pitying ſpectators, nor the majeſty of the Roman commonwealth, nor the fear of the juſtice of his country, reſtrain the licentious and wanton cruelty of a monſter, who, in confidence of his riches, ſtrikes at the root of liberty, and ſets mankind at defiance?</p>
                     <p>I conclude with expreſſing my hopes, that your wiſdom and juſtice, Fathers, will not, by ſuffering the atrocious and unexampled inſolence of Caius Verres to eſcape due puniſhment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total ſubverſion of authority, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of general anarchy and confuſion.</p>

                     <p>IT is known to you, that king Micipſa, my father, on his death-bed, left in charge to Jugurtha, his adopted ſon, conjunctly with my unfortunate brother Hiempſal
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035851_0195_1007AB5110DC2980"/>
and myſelf, the children of his own body, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the kingdom of Numidia, directing us to conſider the ſenate and people of Rome as proprietors of it. He charged us to uſe our beſt endeavours to be ſerviceable to the Roman commonwealth; aſſuring us, that your protection would prove a defence againſt all enemies; and would be inſtead of armies, fortifications, and treaſures.</p>
                     <p>While my brother and I were thinking of nothing but how to regulate ourſelves according to the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our deceaſed father—Jugurtha—the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous of mankind!—breaking through all ties of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and of common humanity, and trampling on the authority of the Roman commonwealth, procured the murder of my unfortunate brother; and has driven me from my throne and native country, though he knows I inherit, from my grandfather Maſſiniſſa, and my father Micipſa, the friendſhip and alliance of the Romans.</p>
                     <p>For a prince to be reduced, by villany, to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful circumſtances, is calamity enough; but my misfortunes are heightened by the conſideration—that I find myſelf obliged to ſolicit your aſſiſtance, Fathers, for the ſervices done you by my anceſtors, not for any I have been able to render you in my own perſon. Jugurtha has put it out of my power to deſerve any thing at your hands; and has forced me to be burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, before I could be uſeful to you. And yet, if I had no plea, but my undeſerved miſery—a once pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful prince, the deſcendent of a race of illuſtrious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, now, without any fault of my own, deſtitute of every ſupport, and reduced to the neceſſity of begging foreign aſſiſtance, againſt an enemy who has ſeized my throne and my kingdom—if my unequalled diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:035851_0196_1007AB52992D1180"/>
were all I had to plead—it would become the greatneſs of the Roman commonwealth, to protect the injured, and to check the triumph of daring wickedneſs over helpleſs innocence. But, to provoke your reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the utmoſt, Jugurtha has driven me from the very dominions, which the ſenate and people of Rome gave to my anceſtors; and, from which, my grandfather, and my father, under your umbrage, expelled Syphax and the Carthaginians. Thus, Fathers, your kindneſs to our family is defeated; and Jugurtha, in injuring me, throws contempt upon you.</p>
                     <p>O wretched prince! Oh cruel reverſe of fortune! Oh father Micipſa! is this the conſequence of thy generoſity; that he, whom thy goodneſs raiſed to an equality with thy own children, ſhould be the murderer of thy children? Muſt, then, the royal houſe of Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia always be a ſcene of havoc and blood? While Carthage remained, we ſuffered, as was to be expected, all ſorts of hardſhips from their hoſtile attacks; our enemy near; our only powerful ally, the Roman commonwealth, at a diſtance. When that ſcourge of Africa was no more, we congratulated ourſelves on the proſpect of eſtabliſhed peace. But, inſtead of peace, behold the kingdom of Numidia drenched with royal blood! and the only ſurviving ſon of its late king, flying from an adopted murderer, and ſeeking that ſafety in foreign parts, which he cannot command in his own kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Whither—Oh! whither ſhall I fly? If I return to the royal palace of my anceſtors, my father's throne is ſeized by the murderer of my brother. What can I there expect, but that Jugurtha ſhould haſten to imbrue, in my blood, thoſe hands which are now reeking with
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035851_0197_1007AB55952A3680"/>
my brother's? If I were to fly for refuge, or for aſſiſtance, to any other court, from what prince can I hope for protection, if the Roman commonwealth give me up? From my own family or friends I have no expectations. My royal father is no more. He is beyond the reach of violence, and out of hearing of the complaints of his unhappy ſon. Were my brother alive, our mutual ſympathy would be ſome alleviation. But he is hurried out of life, in his early youth, by the very hand which ſhould have been the laſt to injure any of the royal family of Numidia. The bloody Jugurtha has butchered all whom he ſuſpected to be in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Some have been deſtroyed by the lingering torment of the croſs. Others have been given a prey to wild beaſts; and their anguiſh made the ſport of men more cruel than wild beaſts. If there be any yet alive, they are ſhut up in dungeons, there to drag out a life more intolerable than death itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Look down, illuſtrious ſenators of Rome! from that height of power to which you are raiſed, on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exampled diſtreſſes of a prince, who is, by the cruelty of a wicked intruder, become an outcaſt from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Let not the crafty inſinuations of him who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns murder for adoption, prejudice your judgment. Do not liſten to the wretch who has butchered the ſon and relations of a king, who gave him power to ſit on the ſame throne with his own ſons.—I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; that he labours by his emiſſaries to prevent your determining any thing againſt him in his abſence; pretending that I magnify my diſtreſs, and might, for him, have ſtaid in peace in my own kingdom. But if ever the time comes, when the due vengeance from above ſhall overtake him, he will then diſſemble as I do. Then he, who now, hardened in wickedneſs,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035851_0198_1007AB57F6BCE4C8"/>
triumphs over thoſe whom his violence has laid low, will, in his turn, feel diſtreſs, and ſuffer for his impious ingratitude to my father, and his blood-thirſty cruelty to my brother.</p>
                     <p>Oh murdered, butchered brother! Oh deareſt to my heart—now gone for ever from my ſight!—but why ſhould I lament his death? He is, indeed, deprived of the bleſſed light of heaven, of life, and kingdom, at once, by the very perſon who ought to have been the firſt to hazard his own life, in defence of any one of Micipſa's family. But, as things are, my brother is not ſo much deprived of theſe comforts, as delivered from terror, from flight, from exile, and the endleſs train of miſeries which render life to me a burden. He lies full low, gored with wounds, and feſtering in his own blood. But he lies in peace. He feels none of the miſeries which rend my ſoul with agony and diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while I am ſet up a ſpectacle to all mankind, of the uncertainty of human affairs. So far from having it in my power to puniſh his murderer, I am not maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the means of ſecuring my own life.

                     <p>AGRIPPA ſaid unto Paul, thou art permitted to ſpeak for thyſelf. Then Paul ſtretched forth the hand, and anſwered for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>I think myſelf happy, king Agrippa, becauſe I ſhall anſwer for myſelf this day before thee, concerning all the things whereof I am accuſed by the Jews: eſpecially, as I know thee to be expert in all cuſtoms and queſtions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I beſeech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
                     <p>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the firſt among my own nation at Jeruſalem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, (if they would teſtify,) that after the ſtraiteſt ſect of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, I lived a Phariſee. And now I ſtand, and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made by God to our fathers: to which promiſe, our twelve tribes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſerving God day and night, hope to come: and for this hope's ſake, king Agrippa, I am accuſed by the Jews.</p>
                     <p>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead? I verily thought with myſelf, that I ought to do man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth: and this I did in Jeruſalem. Many of the ſaints I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief prieſts: and when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them. And I often puniſhed them in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme; and being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035851_0200_1007ABBD93CAF4A0"/>
mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange cities. But as I went to Damaſcus, with authority and commiſſion from the chief prieſts, at mid-day, O king! I ſaw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining round about me, and them who journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice ſpeaking to me, and ſaying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And I ſaid, who art thou, Lord? And he replied, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. But riſe, and ſtand upon thy feet: for I have appeared to thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter, and a witneſs both of theſe things, which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in which I will appear to thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I now ſend thee, to open their eyes; and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins, and inheritance amongſt them who are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, O king Agrippa! I was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion: but ſhowed firſt to them of Damaſcus, and at Jeruſalem, and through all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> theſe cauſes, the Jews caught me in the temple; and went about to kill me. Having, however, obtained help from God, I continue, to this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great, ſaying no other things than thoſe which the prophets and Moſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhould come: that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; that he would be the firſt who ſhould riſe from the dead; and
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035851_0201_1007ABBF1BECF8B8"/>
that he would ſhow light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>
                     <p>And as he thus ſpoke for himſelf, Feſtus ſaid, with a loud voice, "Paul, thou art beſide thyſelf; much learning hath made thee mad." But he replied, I am not mad, moſt noble Feſtus; but ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs. For the king knoweth theſe things, before whom alſo I ſpeak freely. I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that none of theſe things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believeſt thou the prophets? I know that thou believeſt. Then Agrippa ſaid to Paul, "almoſt thou perſuadeſt me to be a Chriſtian." And Paul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "I would to God, that not only thou, but alſo all that hear me this day, were both almoſt, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuch as I am, except theſe bonds."<note n="*" place="bottom">How happy was this great Apoſtle, even in the moſt perilous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances! Though under bonds and oppreſſion, his mind was free, and raiſed above every fear of man. With what dignity and compoſure does he defend himſelf, and the noble cauſe he had eſpouſed; whilſt he diſplays the moſt compaſſionate and generous feelings, for thoſe who were ſtrangers to the ſublime religion by which he was animated!</note>

                     </opener>
                     <p>WHEN I conſider the importance of this bill to your Lordſhips, I am not ſurpriſed it has taken up ſo much of your conſideration. It is a bill, indeed, of no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon magnitude; it is no leſs than to take away from two thirds of the legiſlative body of this great king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, certain privileges and immunities of which they have been long poſſeſſed. Perhaps there is no ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the human mind can be placed in, that is ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and ſo trying, as when it is made a judge in its own cauſe. There is ſomething implanted in the breaſt of man ſo attached to ſelf, ſo tenacious of privileges once obtained, that, in ſuch a ſituation, either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs with impartiality, or decide with juſtice, has ever been held the ſummit of all human virtue. The bill now in queſtion puts your Lordſhips in this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; and I doubt not but the wiſdom of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion will convince the world, that where ſelf-intereſt and juſtice are in oppoſite ſcales, the latter will ever preponderate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> your Lordſhips.</p>
                     <p>Privileges have been granted to legiſlators in all ages, and in all countries. The practice is founded in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and indeed, it is peculiarly eſſential to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this country, that the members of both Houſes ſhould be free in their perſons, in caſes of civil ſuits: for there may come a time when the ſafety and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035851_0203_1007ABC514989D10"/>
welfare of this whole empire, may depend upon their attendance in parliament. I am far from adviſing any meaſure that would in future endanger the ſtate: but the bill before your Lordſhips has, I am confident, no ſuch tendency; for it expreſsly ſecures the perſons of members of either Houſe in all civil ſuits. This being the caſe, I confeſs, when I ſee many noble lords, for whoſe judgment I have a very great reſpect, ſtanding up to oppoſe a bill which is calculated merely to faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litate the recovery of juſt and legal debts, I am aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and amazed. They, I doubt not, oppoſe the bill upon public principles: I would not wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that private intereſt had the leaſt weight in their determination.</p>
                     <p>The bill has been frequently propoſed, and as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has miſcarried: but it was always loſt in the Lower Houſe. Little did I think, when it had paſſed the Commons, that it poſſibly could have met with ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition here. Shall it be ſaid, that you, my Lords, the grand council of the nation, the higheſt judicial and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body of the realm, endeavour to evade, by privilege, thoſe very laws which you enforce on your fellow-ſubjects? Forbid it Juſtice!—I am ſure, were the noble Lords as well acquainted as I am, with but half the difficulties and delays occaſioned in the courts of juſtice, under pretence of privilege, they would not, nay they could not, oppoſe this bill.</p>
                     <p>I have waited with patience to he what arguments might be urged againſt the bill; but I have waited in vain: the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh againſt it. The juſtice and expediency of the bill are ſuch as render it ſelf-evident. It is a propoſition of that nature, that can neither be weak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ned by argument,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035851_0204_1007ABC76ED67698"/>
nor entangled with ſophiſtry. Much, indeed, has been ſaid by ſome noble lords, on the wiſdom of our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and how differently they thought from us. They not only decreed, that privilege ſhould prevent all civil ſuits from proceeding during the ſitting of parliament, but likewiſe granted protection to the very ſervants of members. I ſhall ſay nothing on the wiſdom of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; it might perhaps appear invidious: that is not neceſſary in the preſent caſe. I ſhall only ſay, that the noble Lords who flatter themſelves with the weight of that reflection, ſhould remember, that as circumſtances alter, things themſelves ſhould alter. Formerly, it was not ſo faſhionable either for maſters or ſervants to run in debt, as it is at preſent. Formerly, we were not that great commercial nation we are at preſent; nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were merchants and manufacturers members of parliament, as at preſent. The caſe is now very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: both merchants and manufacturers are, with great propriety, elected members of the Lower Houſe. Commerce having thus got into the legiſlative body of the kingdom, privilege muſt be done away. We all know, that the very ſoul and eſſence of trade are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular payments; and ſad experience teaches us, that there are men, who will not make their regular pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without the compulſive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rticular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a ſoleciſm of the groſſeſt nature.</p>
                     <p>But I will not trouble your Lordſhips with arguments for that, which is ſufficiently evident without any. I ſhall only ſay a few words to ſome noble lords, who foreſee much inconveniency, from the perſons of their
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035851_0205_1007ABC8F7221708"/>
ſervants being liable to be arreſted. One noble lord obſerves, That the coachman of a peer may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, while he is driving his maſter to the Houſe, and, that, conſequently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parliament. If this were actually to happen, there are ſo many methods by which the member might ſtill get to the Houſe, that I can hardly think the noble lord is ſerious in his objection. Another noble peer ſaid, That, by this bill, one might loſe his moſt valuable and honeſt ſervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms! for he can neither be a valuable ſervant, nor an honeſt man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by the law. If my ſervant, by unforeſeen accidents, has got into debt, and I ſtill wiſh to retain him, I certainly would pay the demand. But upon no principal of liberal legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever, can my ſervant have a title to ſet his creditors at defiance, while for forty ſhillings only, the honeſt tradeſman may be torn from his family, and locked up in a gaol. It is monſtrous injuſtice! I flatter myſelf, however, the determination of this day will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely put an end to all ſuch partial proceedings for the future, by paſſing into a law the bill now under your Lordſhips' conſideration.</p>
                     <p>I come now to ſpeak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, for the part I have taken in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ill. It has been ſaid, by a noble lord on my left hand, that I likewiſe am running the race of popularity. If the noble Lord means by popularity, that applauſe beſtowed by after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been ſtruggling in that race: to what purpoſe, all-trying Time can alone determine. But if the noble lord
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035851_0206_1007ABCB567D9180"/>
means that muſhroom popularity, which is raiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out merit, and loſt without a crime, he is much miſtaken in his opinion. I defy the noble Lord to point out a ſingle action of my life, in which the popularity of the times ever had the ſmalleſt influence on my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I thank God I have a more permanent and ſteady rule for my conduct,—the dictates of my own breaſt. They who have foregone that pleaſing adviſer, and given up their mind to be the ſlave of every popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar impulſe, I ſincerely pity: I pity them ſtill more, if their vanity leads them to miſtake the ſhouts of a mob, for the trumpet of Fame. Experience might inform them, that many, who have been ſaluted with the huzzas of a crowd one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as ſpotleſs patriots, have, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, appeared upon the hiſtorian's page, when truth has triumphed over deluſion, the aſſaſſins of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Why then the noble lord can think I am am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious of preſent popularity, that echo of folly, and ſhadow of renown, I am at a loſs to determine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I do not know that the bill now before your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will be popular: it depends much upon the caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that caſe, the preſent muſt be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your Lordſhips may remember, that, not long ago, the popular cry was for the extenſion of privilege; and ſo far did they carry it at that time, that it was ſaid, the privilege protected members even in criminal actions; nay, ſuch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

very deciſions of ſome of the courts were tinctured with that doctrine. It was u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>doubtedly an abominable doctrine; I thought ſo then, and I think ſo ſtill; but, nevertheleſs, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from thoſe who are called the friends of liberty; how deſervedly, time will ſhow. True liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in my opinion, can only exiſt when juſtice equally adminiſtered to all; to the king and to the beggar. Where is the juſtice then, or where is the law that protects a member of parliament more than any other man, from the puniſhment due to his crimes? The laws of this country allow of no place, nor any employment, to be a ſanctuary for crimes; and where I have the honour to ſit as judge, neither royal favour, nor popular applauſe, ſhall ever protect the guilty.</p>
                     <p>I have now only to beg pardon for having employed ſo much of your Lordſhips' time; and I am ſorry a bill, fraught with ſo many good conſequences, has not met with an abler advocate: but I doubt not your Lordſhips' determination will convince the world, that a bill, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to contribute ſo much to the equal diſtribution of juſtice as the preſent, requires with your Lordſhips but very little ſupport.</p>

                     <p>I INTEND, in this addreſs, to ſhow you the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of beginning early to give ſerious attention to your conduct. As ſoon as you are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, you muſt perceive that there is a right and a wrong, in human actions. You ſee, that thoſe who
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035851_0208_1007ABD155B4A018"/>
are born with the ſame advantages of fortune, are not all equally proſperous in the courſe of life. While ſome of them, by wiſe and ſteady conduct, attain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction in the world, and paſs their days with comfort and honour; others, of the ſame rank, by mean and vicious behaviour, forfeit the advantages of their birth; involve themſelves in much miſery; and end in being a diſgrace to their friends, and a burden on ſociety. Early, then, may you learn, that it is not on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal condition in which you find yourſelves placed, but on the part which you are to act, that your welfare or unhappineſs, your honour or infamy, depends. Now, when beginning to act that part, what can be of greater moment, than to regulate your plan of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with the moſt ſerious attention, before you have yet committed any fatal or irretrievable errors? If, inſtead of exerting reflection for this valuable purpoſe, you deliver yourſelves up, at ſo critical a time, to ſloth and pleaſure; if you refuſe to liſten to any counſellor but humour, or to attend to any purſuit except that of amuſement; if you allow yourſelves to float looſe and careleſs on the tide of life, ready to receive any direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the current of faſhion may chance to give you; what can you expect to follow from ſuch begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings? While ſo many around you are undergoing the ſad conſequences of a like indiſcretion, for what reaſon ſhall not thoſe conſequences extend to you? Shall you attain ſucceſs without that preparation, and eſcape dangers without that precaution, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of others? Shall happineſs grow up to you, of its own accord, and ſolicit your acceptance, when, to the reſt of mankind, it is the fruit of long cultivation, and the acquiſition of labour and care?—Deceive
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035851_0209_1007ABD2DFB49B90"/>
not yourſelves with ſuch arrogant hopes. Whatever be your rank, Providence will not, for your ſake, reverſe its eſtabliſhed order. The Author of your being hath enjoined you to "take heed to your ways; to ponder the paths of your feet; to remember your Creator in the days of your youth." He hath decreed, that they only "who ſeek after wiſdom, ſhall find it; that fools ſhall be afflicted, becauſe of their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and that whoever refuſeth inſtruction, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his own ſoul." By liſtening to theſe admonitions, and tempering the vivacity of youth with a proper mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſerious thought, you may enſure cheerfulneſs for the reſt of life; but by delivering yourſelves up at preſent to giddineſs and levity, you lay the foundation of laſting heavineſs of heart.</p>
                     <p>When you look forward to thoſe plans of life, which either your circumſtances have ſuggeſted, or your friends have propoſed, you will not heſitate to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that in order to purſue them with advantage, ſome previous diſcipline is requiſite. Be aſſured, that whatever is to be your profeſſion, no education is more neceſſary to your ſucceſs, than the acquirement of virtuous diſpoſitions and habits. This is the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal preparation for every character, and every ſtation in life. Bad as the world is, reſpect is always paid to virtue. In the uſual courſe of human affairs, it will be found, that a plain underſtanding, joined with acknowledged worth, contributes more to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, than the brighteſt parts without probity or honour. Whether ſcience or buſineſs, or public life, be your aim, virtue ſtill enter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> a principal ſhare, into all thoſe great departments of ſociety. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with eminence, in every liberal art; with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:035851_0210_100792484E2D3620"/>
in every branch of fair and uſeful buſineſs; with diſtinction, in every public ſtation. The vigour which it gives the mind, and the weight which it adds to character; the generous ſentiments which it breathes; the undaunted ſpirit which it inſpires; the ardour of diligence which it quickens; the freedom which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures from pernicious and diſhonourable avocations; are the foundations of all that is highly honourable, or greatly ſucceſsful among men.</p>
                     <p>Whatever ornamental or engaging endowments you now poſſeſs, virtue is a neceſſary requiſite, in order to their ſhining with proper luſtre. Feeble are the attractions of the faireſt form, if it be ſuſpected that nothing within correſponds to the pleaſing appearance without. Short are the triumphs of wit, when it is ſuppoſed to be the vehicle of malice. By whatever means you may at firſt attract the attention, you can hold the eſteem, and ſecure the hearts of others, only by amiable diſpoſitions, and the accompliſhments of the mind. Theſe are the qualities whoſe influence will laſt, when the luſtre of all that once ſparkled and dazzled has paſſed away.</p>
                     <p>Let not then the ſeaſon of youth be barren of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, ſo eſſential to your future felicity and honour. Now is the ſeed-time of life; and according to "what you ſow, you ſhall reap." Your character is now, under Divine aſſiſtance, of your own form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; your fate is, in ſome meaſure, put into your own hands. Your nature is as yet pliant and ſoft. Habits have not eſtabliſhed their dominion. Prejudices have not pre-occupied your underſtanding. The world has not had time to contract and debaſe your affections. All your powers are more vigorous, diſembarraſſed,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035851_0211_1007ABD543E6CB68"/>
and free, than they will be at any future period. Whatever impulſe you now give to your deſires and paſſions, the direction is likely to continue. It will form the channel in which your life is to run; nay, it may determine its everlaſting iſſue. Conſider then the employment of this important period, as the higheſt truſt which ſhall ever be committed to you; as in a great meaſure, deciſive of your happineſs, in time, and in eternity. As in the ſucceſſion of the ſeaſons, each, by the invariable laws of Nature, affects the productions of what is next in courſe; ſo, in human life, every period of our age, according as it is well or ill ſpent, influences the happineſs of that which is to follow. Virtuous youth gradually brings forward accompliſhed and flouriſhing manhood; and ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood paſſes of itſelf, without uneaſineſs, into reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and tranquil old age. But when nature is turned out of its regular courſe, diſorder takes place in the moral, juſt as in the vegetable world. If the Spring put forth no bloſſoms, in Summer there will be no beauty, and in Autumn, no fruit. So, if youth be trifled away without improvement, manhood will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be contemptible, and old age miſerable. If the beginnings of life have been "vanity," its latter end can ſcarcely be any other than "vexation of ſpirit."</p>
                     <p>I ſhall finiſh this addreſs, with calling your attention to that dependence on the bleſſing of Heaven, which, amidſt all your endeavours after improvement, you ought continually to preſerve. It is too common with the young, even when they reſolve to tread the path of virtue and honour, to ſet out with preſumptuous confidence in themſelves.

                     <p>AN account of this dreadful earthquake, is given by the celebrated Father Kircher. It happened whilſt he was on his journey to viſit Mount AEtna, and the reſt of the wonders that lie towards the ſouth of Italy.

                        </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorus. Our deſtination was for the city of Euphaemia, in Calabria; where we had ſome buſineſs to tranſact; and where we deſigned to tarry for ſome time. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Providence ſeemed willing to croſs our deſign; for we were obliged to continue three days at Pelorus, on account of the weather: and though we often put out to ſea, yet we were as often driven back. At length, wearied with the delay, we reſolved to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our voyage; and, although the ſea ſeemed more than uſually agitated, we ventured forward. The gulph of Charybdis, which we approached, ſeemed
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035851_0214_1007ABDC74452638"/>
whirled round in ſuch a manner, as to form a vaſt hollow, verging to a point in the centre. Proceeding onward, and turning my eyes to AEtna, I ſaw it caſt forth large volumes of ſmoke, of mountainous ſizes, which entirely covered the iſland, and blotted out the very ſhores from my view. This, together with the dreadful noiſe, and the ſulphurous ſtench which was ſtrongly perceived, filled me with apprehenſions, that ſome more dreadful calamity was impending. The ſea itſelf ſeemed to wear a very unuſual appearance: they who have ſeen a lake in a violent ſhower of rain, covered all over with bubbles, will conceive ſome idea of its agitations. My ſurpriſe was ſtill increaſed, by the calmneſs and ſerenity of the weather; not a breeze, not a cloud, which might be ſuppoſed to put all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus into motion. I therefore warned my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that an earthquake was approaching; and, after ſome time, making for the ſhore with all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"But our triumphs at land were of ſhort duration; for we had ſcarcely arrived at the Jeſuits' College, in that city, when our ears were ſtunned with a horrid ſound, reſembling that of an infinite number of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, driven fiercely forward; the wheels rattling, and the thongs cracking. Soon after this, a moſt dreadful earthquake enſued; ſo that the whole tract upon which we ſtood, ſeemed to vibrate, as if we were in the ſcale of a balance, that continued wavering. This motion, however, ſoon grew more violent; and being no longer able to keep my legs, I was thrown proſtrate upon the ground. In the mean time, the univerſal ruin round

me redoubled my amazement. The craſh of falling houſes, the tottering of towers, and the groans of the dying, all contributed to raiſe my terror and deſpair. On every ſide of me, I ſaw nothing but a ſcene of ruin; and danger threatening wherever I ſhould fly. I commended myſelf to God, as my laſt great refuge. At that hour, O how vain was every ſublunary happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Wealth, honour, empire, wiſdom, all mere uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſounds, and as empty as the bubbles in the deep! Juſt ſtanding on the threſhold of eternity, nothing but God was my pleaſure; and the nearer I approached, I only loved him the more. After ſome time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, finding that I remained unhurt, amidſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concuſſion, I reſolved to venture for ſafety; and running as faſt as I could, I reached the ſhore, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt terrified out of my reaſon. I did not ſearch long here, till I found the boat in which I had landed; and my companions alſo, whoſe terrors were even greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>terrors."</p>
                     <p>"Leaving this ſeat of deſolation, we proſecuted our voyage along the coaſt; and the next day came to Rochetta, where we landed, although the earth ſtill continued in violent agitations. But we were ſcarcely arrived at our inn, when we were once more obliged to return to the boat; and, in about half an hour, we ſaw the greater part of the town, and the inn at which we had ſet up, daſhed to the ground, and burying the inhabitants beneath the ruins."</p>
                     <p>"In this manner, proceeding onward in our little veſſel, finding no ſafety at land, and yet, from the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035851_0216_1007ABE24D4C4C00"/>
ſmallneſs of our boat, having but a very dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance at ſea, we at length landed at Lopizium, a caſtle midway between Tropaea and Euphaemia, the city to which, as I ſaid before, we were bound. Here, wherever I turned my eyes, nothing but ſcenes of ruin and horror appeared; towns and caſtles levelled to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ground; Strombalo, though at ſixty miles diſtance, belching forth flames in an unuſual manner, and with a noiſe which I could diſtinctly hear. But my attention was quickly turned from more remote, to contiguous danger. The rumbling ſound of an approaching earthquake, which we by this time were grown ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, alarmed us for the conſequences; it every moment ſeemed to grow louder, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach nearer. The place on which we ſtood now began to ſhake moſt dreadfully; ſo that being unable to ſtand, my companions and I caught hold of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhrub grew next to us, and ſupported ourſelves in that manner."</p>
                     <p>"After ſome time, this violent paroxyſm ceaſing, we again ſtood up, in order to proſecute our voyage to Euphaemia, which lay within ſight. In the mean time, while we were preparing for this purpoſe, I turned my eyes towards the city, but could ſee only a fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dark cloud, that ſeemed to reſt upon the place. This the more ſurpriſed us, as the weather was ſo very ſerene. We waited therefore, till the cloud had paſſed away; then turning to look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="180" facs="unknown:035851_0217_1007ABE4A9B9EA50"/>
Thus proceeding penſively along, in queſt of ſome human being that could give us a little information, we at length ſaw a boy ſitting by the ſhore, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſtupified with terror. Of him, therefore, we inquired concerning the fate of the city; but he could not be prevailed on to give us an anſwer. We en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, with every expreſſion of tenderneſs and pity, to tell us; but his ſenſes were quite wrapt up in the contemplation of the danger he had eſcaped. We offered him ſome victuals, but he ſeemed to loath the ſight. We ſtill perſiſted in our offices <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Such was the fate of the city of Euphaemia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as we continued our melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly courſe along the ſhore, the whole coaſt, for the ſpace of two hundred miles, preſented nothing but the remains of cities; and men ſcattered, without a habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, over the fields. Proceeding thus along, we at length ended our diſtreſsful voyage, by arriving at Naples, after having eſcaped a thouſand dangers both at ſea and land."</p>

life! She had all the wiſdom of age, and diſcretion of a matron, joined with youthful ſweetneſs and virgin modeſty. With what an engaging fondneſs did ſhe behave to her father! How kindly and reſpectfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his friends! How affectionately treat all thoſe who, in their reſpective offices, had the care and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her! She employed much of her time in reading, in which ſhe diſcovered great ſtrength of judgment; ſhe indulged herſelf in few diverſions, and thoſe with much caution. With what forbearance, with what patience, with what courage did ſhe endure her laſt illneſs! She complied with all the directions of her phyſicians; ſhe encouraged her ſiſter, and her father; and, when all her ſtrength of body was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, ſupported herſelf by the ſingle vigour of her mind. That, indeed, continued, even to her laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unbroken by the pain of a long illneſs, or the terrors of approaching death; and it is a reflection which makes the loſs of her ſo much the more to be lamented. A loſs infinitely ſevere! and more ſevere by the particular conjuncture in which it happened! She was contracted to a moſt worthy youth; the wedding day was fixed, and we were all invited.—How ſad a change from the higheſt joy, to the deepeſt ſorrow! How ſhall I expreſs the wound that pierced my heart, when I heard Fundamus himſelf, (as grief is ever finding out circumſtances to aggravate its afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) ordering the money he had deſigned to lay out upon clothes and jewels for her marriage, to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in myrrh and ſpices for her funeral? He is a man of great learning and good ſenſe, who has applied himſelf from his earlieſt youth, to the nobleſt and moſt elevated ſtudies; but all the maxims of fortitude,

We ſhall excuſe, we ſhall even approve his ſorrow, when we conſider what he has loſt.

If his friend Marcellinus ſhall think proper to write to him, upon the ſubject of ſo reaſonable a grief, let me remind him not to uſe the rougher arguments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and ſuch as ſeem to carry a ſort of reproof with them; but thoſe of kind and ſympathizing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Time will render him more open to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon: for as a freſh wound ſhrinks back from the hand of the ſurgeon, but by degrees ſubmits to, and even requires the means of its cure; ſo a mind, under the firſt impreſſions of a misfortune, ſhuns and rejects all arguments of conſolation; but at length, if applied with tenderneſs, calmly and willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſces in them.

                     <head>SECTION IV. On Diſcretion.</head>
                     <p>I HAVE often thought, if the minds of men were laid open, we ſhould ſee but little difference between that of the wiſe man, and that of the fool.</p>
                     <p>There are infinite reveries, numberleſs extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances, and a ſucceſſion of vanities, which paſs through both. The great difference is, that the firſt knows how to pick and cull his thoughts for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:035851_0221_1007ABEFE61F9CF0"/>
by ſuppreſſing ſome, and communicating others; whereas the other lets them all indifferently fly out in words. This ſort of diſcretion, however, has no place in private converſation between intimate friends. On ſuch occaſions, the wiſeſt men very often talk like the weakeſt; for indeed the talking with a friend is nothing elſe but <hi>thinking aloud.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tully has therefore very juſtly expoſed a precept, delivered by ſome ancient writers, That a man ſhould live with his enemy in ſuch a manner, as might leave him room to become his friend; and with his friend, in ſuch a manner, that, if he became his enemy, it ſhould not be in his power to hurt him. The firſt part of this rule, which regards our behaviour towards an enemy, is indeed very reaſonable, as well as very prudential; but the latter part of it, which regards our behaviour towards a friend, favours more of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than of diſcretion; and would cut a man off from the greateſt pleaſures of life, which are the freedoms of converſation with a boſom friend. Beſides that, when a friend is turned into an enemy, the world is juſt enough to accuſe the perfidiouſneſs of the friend, rather than the indiſcretion of the perſon who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in him.</p>
                     <p>Diſcretion does not only ſhow itſelf in words, but in all the circumſtances of action; and is like an under-agent of Providence, to guide and direct us in the ordinary concerns of life.</p>
                     <p>There are many more ſhining qualities in the mind of man, but there is none ſo uſeful as diſcretion. It is this, indeed, which gives a value to all the reſt; which ſets them at work in their proper times and places; and turns them to the advantage of the perſon
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:035851_0222_1007ABF2637EC2F0"/>
who is poſſeſſed of them. Without it, learning is pedantry, and wit impertinence; virtue itſelf looks like weakneſs; the beſt parts only qualify a man to be more ſprightly in errors, and active to his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
                     <p>Diſcretion does not only make a man the maſter of his own parts, but of other men's. The diſcreet man finds out the talents of thoſe he converſes with; and knows how to apply them to proper uſes. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, if we look into particular communities and diviſions of men, we may obſerve, that it is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man, not the witty, nor the learned, nor the brave, who guides the converſation, and gives mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to the ſociety. A man with great talents, but void of diſcretion, is like Polyphemus in the fable, ſtrong and blind; endued with an irreſiſtible force, which, for want of ſight, is of no uſe to him.</p>
                     <p>Though a man have all other perfections, and want diſcretion, he will be of no great conſequence in the world; but if he have this ſingle talent in perfection, and but a common ſhare of others, he may do what he pleaſes in his particular ſtation of life.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame time that I think diſcretion the moſt uſeful talent a man can be maſter of, I look upon cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be the accompliſhment of little, mean, unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous minds. Diſcretion points out the nobleſt ends to us; and purſues the moſt proper and laudable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of attaining them: cunning has only private ſelfiſh aims; and ſticks at nothing which may make them ſucceed. Diſcretion has large and extended views; and, like a well-formed eye, commands a whole horizon: cunning is a kind of ſhort-ſightedneſs, that diſcovers the minuteſt objects which are near at
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035851_0223_1007ABF5A0292B68"/>
hand, but is not able to diſcern things at a diſtance. Diſcretion, the more it is diſcovered, gives a greater authority to the perſon who poſſeſſes it; cunning, when it is once detected, loſes its force, and makes a man incapable of bringing about even thoſe events which he might have done, had he paſſed only for a plain man. Diſcretion is the perfection of reaſon; and a guide to us in all the duties of life; cunning is a kind of inſtinct, that only looks out after our immediate intereſt and welfare. Diſcretion is only found in men of ſtrong ſenſe and good underſtandings: cunning is often to be met with in brutes themſelves; and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are but the feweſt removes from them. In ſhort, cunning is only the mimic of diſcretion; and it may paſs upon weak men, in the ſame manner as vivacity is often miſtaken for wit, and gravity, for wiſdom.</p>
                     <p>The caſt of mind which is natural to a diſcreet man, makes him look forward into futurity, and conſider what will be his condition millions of ages hence, as well as what it is at preſent. He knows that the miſery or happineſs which is reſerved for him in another world, loſes nothing of its reality by being placed at ſo great a diſtance from him. The objects do not appear little to him becauſe they are remote. He conſiders, that thoſe pleaſures and pains which lie hid in eternity, approach nearer to him every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and will be preſent with him in their full weight and meaſure, as much as thoſe pains and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which he feels at this very inſtant. For this reaſon, he is careful to ſecure to himſelf that which is the proper happineſs of his nature, and the ultimate deſign of his being. He carries his thoughts to the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035851_0224_1007ABF802C6B950"/>
end of every action; and conſiders the moſt diſtant, as well as the moſt immediate effects of it.

                     <p>A MULTITUDE of caſes occur, in which we are no leſs accountable for what we think, than for what we do.</p>
                     <p>As, firſt, when the introduction of any train of thought depends upon ourſelves, and is our voluntary act; by turning our attention towards ſuch objects, awakening ſuch paſſions, or engaging in ſuch employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as we know muſt give a peculiar determination to our thoughts. Next, when thoughts, by whatever accident they may have been originally ſuggeſted, are indulged with deliberation and complacency. Though the mind has been paſſive in their reception, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, free from blame; yet, if it be active in their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, the guilt becomes its own. They may have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded at firſt, like unbidden gueſts; but if, when enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are made welcome, and kindly entertained, the caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035851_0225_1007ABF9B6F0D990"/>
we are no leſs ſo, in the laſt place, for thoſe which find admittance into our hearts from ſupine negligence, from total relaxation of attention, from allowing our imagination to rove with entire licence, "like the eyes of the fool, towards the ends of the earth." Our minds are, in this caſe, thrown open to folly and vanity. They are proſtituted to every evil thing which pleaſes to take poſſeſſion. The conſequences muſt all be charged to our account; and in vain we plead excuſe from human infirmity. Hence it appears, that the great object at which we are to aim in governing our thoughts, is, to take the moſt effectual meaſures for preventing the introduction of ſuch as are ſinful, and for haſtening their expulſion, if they ſhall have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced themſelves without conſent of the will.</p>
                     <p>But when we deſcend into our breaſts, and examine how far we have ſtudied to keep this object in view, who can tell, "how oft he hath offended?" In no article of religion or morals are men more culpably remiſs, than in the unreſtrained indulgence they give to fancy; and that too, for the moſt part without remorſe. Since the time that Reaſon began to exert her powers, Thought, during our waking hours, has been active in every breaſt, without a moment's ſuſpenſion or pauſe. The current of ideas has been always flowing. The wheels of the ſpiritual engine have circulated with perpetual motion. Let me aſk, what has been the fruit of this inceſſant activity with the greater part of mankind? Of the innumerable hours that have been employed in thought, how few are marked with any permanent or uſeful effect? How many have either paſſed away in idle dreams; or have been abandoned to anxious diſcontented muſings, to unſocial and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant

paſſions, or to irregular and criminal deſires! Had I power to lay open that ſtorehouſe of iniquity which the hearts of too many conceal; could I draw out and read to them a liſt of all the imaginations they have deviſed, and all the paſſions they have indulged in ſecret; what a picture of men ſhould I preſent to themſelves! What crimes would they appear to have perpetrated in ſecrecy, which to their moſt intimate companions they durſt not reveal!</p>
                     <p>Even when men imagine their thoughts to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently employed, they too commonly ſuffer them to run out into extravagant imaginations, and chimerical plans of what they would wiſh to attain, or chooſe to be, if they could frame the courſe of things according to their deſire. Though ſuch employments of fancy come under the ſame deſcription with thoſe which are plainly criminal, yet wholly unblamable they ſeldom are.

                     <p>WHEN man revolted from his Maker, his paſſions rebelled againſt himſelf; and, from being originally the miniſters of reaſon, have become the tyrants of the ſoul. Hence, in treating of this ſubject, two things may be aſſumed as principles: firſt, that through the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                           <desc>••••</desc>
                        </gap>nt weakneſs of the underſtanding, our paſſions are often directed towards improper objects; and next, that even when their direction is juſt, and their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are innocent, they perpetually tend to run into exceſs; they always hurry us towards their gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with a blind and dangerous impetuoſity. On theſe, two points then turns the whole government of our paſſions: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to aſcertain the proper objects of their purſuit; and next, to reſtrain them in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, when they would carry us beyond the bounds of reaſon. If there be any paſſion which intrudes itſelf unſeaſonably into our mind, which darkens and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles our judgment, or habitually diſcompoſes our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which unfits us for properly diſcharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or diſqualifies us for cheerfully enjoying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of life, we may certainly conclude it to have gained a dangerous aſcendant. The great object which we ought to propoſe to ourſelves, is, to acquire a firm and ſteadfaſt mind, which the infatuation of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall not ſeduce, nor its violence ſhake; which, reſting on fixed principles, ſhall, in the midſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending emotions, remain free, and maſter of itſelf;
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035851_0228_1007AC0298080DC8"/>
able to liſten calmly to the voice of conſcience, and prepared to obey its dictates without heſitation.</p>
                     <p>To obtain, if poſſible, ſuch command of paſſion, is one of the higheſt attainments of the rational nature. Arguments to ſhow its importance crowd upon us from every quarter. If there be any fertile ſource of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to human life, it is, beyond doubt, the miſrule of paſſion. It is this which poiſons the enjoyment of individuals, overturns the order of ſociety, and ſtrews the path of life with ſo many miſeries, as to render it indeed the vale of tears. All thoſe great ſcenes of public calamity, which we behold with aſtoniſhment, and horror, have originated from the ſource of violent paſſions. Theſe have overſpread the earth with blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. Theſe have pointed the aſſaſſin's dagger, and filled the poiſoned bowl. Theſe, in every age, have furniſhed too copious materials for the orator's pathetic declamation, and for the poet's tragical ſong.</p>
                     <p>When from public life we deſcend to private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, though paſſion operates not there in ſuch a wide and deſtructive ſphere, we ſhall find its influence to be no leſs baneful. I need not mention the black and fierce paſſions, ſuch as envy, jealouſy and revenge, whoſe effects are obviouſly noxious, and whoſe agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are immediate miſery. But take any of the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſenſual kind. Suppoſe it to have unlimited ſcope; trace it throughout its courſe; and we ſhall find that gradually, as it riſes, it taints the ſoundneſs, and troubles the peace of his mind over whom it reigns; that, in its progreſs, it engages him in purſuits which are marked either with danger or with ſhame; that, in the end, it waſtes his fortune, deſtroys his health, or debaſes his character; and aggravates all the miſeries
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035851_0229_1007AC0420739630"/>
in which it has involved him, with the concluding pangs of bitter remorſe. Through all the ſtages of this fatal courſe, how many have heretofore run! What multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes do we daily behold purſuing it, with blind and headlong ſteps!</p>

                     <head>SECTION VII. On the proper State of our Temper, with reſpect to one another.</head>
                     <p>IT is evident, in the general, that if we conſult ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther public welfare or private happineſs, Chriſtian charity ought to regulate our diſpoſition in mutual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. But as this great principle admits of ſeveral diverſified appearances, let us conſider ſome of the chief forms under which it ought to ſhow itſelf in the uſual tenour of life.</p>
                     <p>What, firſt, preſents itſelf to be recommended, is a peaceable temper; a diſpoſition averſe to give offence, and deſirous of cultivating harmony, and amicable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ciety. This ſuppoſes yielding and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending manners, unwillingneſs to contend with others about trifles, and, in conteſts that are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, proper moderation of ſpirit. Such a temper is the firſt principle of ſelf-enjoyment. It is the baſis of all order and happineſs among mankind. The poſitive and contentious, the rude and quarrelſome, are the bane of ſociety. They ſeem deſtined to blaſt the ſmall ſhare of comfort which nature has here alloted to man. But they cannot diſturb the peace of others, more than they break their own. The hurricane rages firſt in their own boſom, before it is let forth upon the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:035851_0230_1007AC079C7CE090"/>
world. In the tempeſts which they raiſe, they are always toſt; and frequently it is their lot to periſh.</p>
                     <p>A peaceable temper muſt be ſupported by a candid one, or a diſpoſition to view the conduct of others with fairneſs and impartiality. This ſtands oppoſed to a jealous and ſuſpicious temper, which aſcribes every action to the worſt motive, and throws a black ſhade over every character. If we would be happy in ourſelves, or in our connexions with others, let us guard againſt this malignant ſpirit. Let us ſtudy that charity "which thinketh no evil;" that temper which, without degenerating into credulity, will diſpoſe us to be juſt; and which can allow us to obſerve an error, without imputing it as a crime. Thus we ſhall be kept free from that continual irritation, which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary injuries raiſe in a ſuſpicious breaſt; and ſhall walk among men as our brethren, not as our enemies.</p>
                     <p>But to be peaceable, and to be candid, is not all that is required of a good man. He muſt cultivate a kind, generous, and ſympathizing temper, which feels for diſtreſs, wherever it is beheld; which enters into the concerns of his friends with ardour; and to all with whom he has intercourſe, is gentle, obliging, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane. How amiable appears ſuch a diſpoſition, when contraſted with a malicious or envious temper, which wraps itſelf up in its own narrow intereſt, looks with an evil eye on the ſucceſs of others, and, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſatisfaction, feeds on their diſappointments or miſeries! How little does he know of the true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, who is a ſtranger to that intercourſe of good offices and kind affections, which, by a pleaſing charm, attaches men to one another, and circulates joy from heart to heart!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="194" facs="unknown:035851_0231_1007AC09F78CBFB8"/>
We are not to imagine, that a benevolent temper finds no exerciſe, unleſs when opportunities offer of performing actions of high generoſity, or of extenſive utility. Theſe may ſeldom occur. The condition of the greater part of mankind, in a good meaſure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them. But, in the ordinary round of human affairs, many occaſions daily preſent themſelves of miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the vexations which others ſuffer; of ſoothing their minds; of aiding their intereſt; of promoting their cheerfulneſs, or eaſe. Such occaſions may relate to the ſmaller incidents of life. But let us remember, that of ſmall incidents the ſyſtem of human life is chiefly compoſed. The attentions which reſpect theſe, when ſuggeſted by real benignity of temper, are often more material to the happineſs of thoſe around us, than actions which carry the appearance of greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſplendour. No wiſe or good man ought to account any rules of behaviour as below his regard, which tend to cement the great brotherhood of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in comfortable union.</p>
                     <p>Particularly amidſt that familiar intercourſe which belongs to domeſtic life, all the virtues of temper find an ample range. It is very unfortunate, that within that circle, men too often think themſelves at liberty, to give unreſtrained vent to the caprice of paſſion and humour. Whereas there, on the contrary, more than any where, it concerns them to attend to the government of their heart; to check what is violent in their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and to ſoften what is harſh in their manners. For there the temper is formed. There, the real character diſplays itſelf. The forms of the world diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe men when abroad. But within his own family, every man is known to be what he truly is.—In all
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:035851_0232_1007AC0C59C47368"/>
our intercourſe then with others, particularly in that which is cloſeſt and moſt intimate, let us cultivate a peaceable, a candid, a gentle and friendly temper. This is the temper to which, by repeated injunctions, our holy religion ſeeks to form us. This was the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Chriſt. This is the temper of Heaven.</p>

                     <p>Poetry is ſublime, when it awakens in the mind any great and good affection, as piety, or patriotiſm. This is one of the nobleſt effects of the heart. The Pſalms are remarkable, beyond all other writings, for their power of inſpiring devout emotions. But it is not in this reſpect only, that they are ſublime. Of the Divine nature, they contain the moſt magnificent

deſcriptions, that the ſoul of man can comprehend.

                     <head>SECTION XI. The Pleaſures of virtuous Senſibility.</head>
                     <p>THE good effects of true ſenſibility on general vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and happineſs, admit of no diſpute. Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its effect on the happineſs of him who poſſeſſes it, and the various pleaſures to which it gives him acceſs. If he is maſter of riches or influence, it affords him the means of increaſing his own enjoyment, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the wants, or increaſing the comforts of others. If he commands not theſe advantages, yet all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which he ſees in the poſſeſſion of the deſerving, become in ſome ſort his, by his rejoicing in the good which they enjoy. Even the face of nature yields a ſatisfaction to him, which the inſenſible can-never know. The profuſion of goodneſs which he beholds poured forth on the univerſe, dilates his-heart with
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035851_0239_1007AC2002B509F8"/>
the thought, that innumerable multitudes around him are bleſt and happy. When he ſees the labours of men appearing to proſper, and views a country flouriſhing in wealth and induſtry; when he beholds the ſpring coming forth in its beauty, and reviving the decayed face of nature; or in autumn beholds the fields loaded with plenty, and the year crowned with all its fruits; he lifts his affections with gratitude to the great Father of all, and rejoices in the general felicity and joy.</p>
                     <p>It may indeed be objected, that the ſame ſenſibility lays open the heart to be pierced with many wounds, from the diſtreſſes which abound in the world; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes us to frequent ſuffering from the participation which it communicates of the ſorrows, as well as of the joys, of friendſhip. But let it be conſidered, that the tender melancholy of ſympathy, is accompanied with a ſenſation, which they who feel it would not exchange for the gratifications of the ſelfiſh. When the heart is ſtrongly moved by any of the kind affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, even when it pours itſelf forth in virtuous ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, a ſecret attractive charm mingles with the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful emotion; there is a joy in the midſt of grief. Let it be farther conſidered, that the griefs which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility introduces, are counterbalanced by pleaſures which flow from the ſame ſource. Senſibility height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens in general the human powers, and is connected with acuteneſs in all our feelings. If it makes us more alive to ſome painful ſenſations, in return, it renders the pleaſing ones more vivid and animated. The ſelfiſh man languiſhes in his narrow circle of pleaſures. They are confined to what affects his own intereſt. He is obliged to repeat the ſame gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:035851_0240_1007AC22934FC960"/>
till they become inſipid. But the man of virtuous ſenſibility moves in a wider ſphere of felicity. His powers are much more frequently called forth into occupations of pleaſing activity. Numberleſs oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions open to him of indulging his favourite taſte, by conveying ſatisfaction to others. Often it is in his power, in one way or other, to ſooth the afflicted heart; to carry ſome conſolation into the houſe of woe. In the ſcenes of ordinary life, in the domeſtic and ſocial intercourſes of men, the cordiality of his affections cheers and gladdens him. Every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, every deſcription of innocent happineſs, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by him. Every native expreſſion of kindneſs and affection among others, is felt by him, even though he be not the object of it. Among a circle of friends, enjoying one another, he is as happy as the happieſt. In a word, he lives in a different ſort of world from what the ſelfiſh man inhabits. He poſſeſſes a new ſenſe, that enables him to behold objects which the ſelfiſh cannot ſee. At the ſame time, his enjoyments are not of that kind which remain merely on the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the mind. They penetrate the heart. They enlarge and elevate, they refine and ennoble it. To all the pleaſing emotions of affection, they add the dignified conſciouſneſs of virtue.—Children of men! men formed by nature to live and to feel as brethren! how long will ye continue to eſtrange yourſelves from one another by competitions and jealouſies, when in cordial union ye might be ſo much more bleſt? How long will ye ſeek your happineſs in ſelfiſh gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations alone, neglecting thoſe purer and better ſources of joy, which flow from the affections and the heart?</p>

                     <p>THE proper honour of man ariſes not from ſome of thoſe ſplendid actions and abilities, which excite high admiration. Courage and proweſs, military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, ſignal victories and conqueſts, may render the name of a man famous, without rendering his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter truly honourable. To many brave men, to many heroes renowned in ſtory, we look up with wonder. Their exploits are recorded. Their praiſes are ſung. They ſtand as on an eminence above the reſt of mankind. Their eminence, nevertheleſs, may not be of that ſort, before which we bow with inward eſteem and reſpect. Something more is wanted for that purpoſe, than the conquering arm, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid mind. The laurels of the warrior muſt at all times be dyed in blood, and bedewed with the tears of the widow and the orphan. But if they have been ſtained by rapine and inhumanity; if ſordid avarice has marked his character; or low and groſs ſenſuality has degraded his life; the great hero ſinks into a little man. What at a diſtance, or on a ſuperficial view, we admired, becomes mean, perhaps odious, when we examine it more cloſely. It is like the Coloſſal ſtatue, whoſe immenſe ſize ſtruck the ſpectator afar off with aſtoniſhment; but when nearly viewed, it appears diſproportioned, unſhapely, and rude.</p>
                     <p>Obſervations of the ſame kind may be applied to all the reputation derived from civil accompliſhments; from the refined politics of the ſtateſman; or the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:035851_0242_1007AC26AD556860"/>
efforts of genius and erudition. Theſe beſtow, and, within certain bounds, ought to beſtow, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and diſtinction on men. They diſcover talents which in themſelves are ſhining; and which become highly valuable, when employed in advancing the good of mankind. Hence, they frequently give riſe to ſame. But a diſtinction is to be made between <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame and true honour. The ſtateſman, the orator, or the poet, may be famous; while yet the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is far from being honoured.

Inſtances of this ſort are too often found in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of ancient or modern hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>From all this it follows, that, in order to diſcern where man's true honour lies, we muſt look, not to any adventitious circumſtance of fortune; not to any ſingle ſparkling quality; but to the whole of what forms a man; what entitles him, as ſuch, to rank high among that claſs of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>WHATEVER promotes and ſtrengthens virtue, whatever calms and regulates the temper, is a ſource of happineſs. Devotion produces thoſe effects in a remarkable degree. It inſpires compoſure of ſpirit, mildneſs, and benignity; weakens the painful, and cheriſhes the pleaſing emotions; and, by theſe means, carries on the life of a pious man in a ſmooth and placid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> exerting this habitual influence on the mind, devotion opens a field of enjoyments, to which the vicious are entire ſtrangers; enjoyments the more valuable, as they peculiarly belong to retirement, when the world leaves us; and to adverſity, when it
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:035851_0244_100935F8851FD420"/>
becomes our foe. Theſe are the two ſeaſons, for which every wiſe man would moſt wiſh to provide ſome hidden ſtore of comfort. For let him be placed in the moſt favourable ſituation which the human ſtate admits, the world can neither always amuſe him, nor always ſhield him from diſtreſs. There will be many hours of vacuity, and many of dejection, in his life. If he be a ſtranger to God, and to devotion, how dreary will the gloom of ſolitude often prove! With what oppreſſive weight will ſickneſs, diſappointment, or old age, fall upon his ſpirits! But, for thoſe penſive periods, the pious man has a relief prepared. From the tireſome repetition of the common vanities of life, or from the painful corroſion of its cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, devotion tranſports him into a new region; and ſurrounds him there with ſuch objects, as are the moſt fitted to cheer the dejection, to calm the tumults, and to heal the wounds of his heart. If the world has been empty and deluſive, it gladdens him with the proſpect of a higher and better order of things, about to ariſe. If men have been ungrateful and baſe, it diſplays before him the faithfulneſs of that Supreme Being, who, though every other friend fail, will never forſake him. Let us conſult our experience, and we ſhall find, that the two greateſt ſources of inward joy, are, the exerciſe of love directed towards a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving object, and the exerciſe of hope terminating on ſome high and aſſured happineſs. Both theſe are ſupplied by devotion; and therefore we have no reaſon to be ſurpriſed, if, on ſome occaſions, it fills the hearts of good men with a ſatisfaction not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>

The refined pleaſures of a pious mind are, in many reſpects, ſuperior to the coarſe gratifications of ſenſe. They are pleaſures which belong to the higheſt powers, and beſt affections of the ſoul; whereas the gratifications of ſenſe reſide in the loweſt region of our nature. To the latter, the ſoul ſtoops below its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dignity. The former, raiſe it above itſelf. The latter, leave always a comfortleſs, often a mortifying, remembrance behind them. The former, are reviewed wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The pleaſures of ſenſe reſemble a foaming torrent, which, after a diſorderly courſe, ſpeedily runs out, and leaves an empty and offenſive channel. But the pleaſures of devotion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the equable current of a pure river, which enlivens the fields through which it paſſes, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes verdure and fertility along its banks. To thee, O Devotion! we owe the higheſt improvement of our nature, and much of the enjoyment of our life. Thou art the ſupport of our virtue, and the reſt of our ſouls, in this turbulent world. Thou compoſeſt the thoughts. Thou calmeſt the paſſions. Thou exalteſt the heart. Thy communications, and thine only, are imparted to the low, no leſs than to the high; to the poor, as well as to the rich. In thy preſence, worldly diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ceaſe; and under thy influence, worldly ſorrows are forgotten. Thou art the balm of the wounded mind.

Are we ready to cry out in a tranſport of ſurpriſe, "How mighty is the Being who kindled ſuch a prodigious fire; and keeps alive, from age to age, ſuch an enormous maſs of flame!" let us attend our philoſophic guides, and we ſhall be brought acquainted with ſpeculations more enlarged and more inflaming.</p>
                     <p>This ſun, with all its attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univerſe; every ſtar, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that glitters upon a lady's ring, is really a vaſt globe, like the ſun in ſize and in glory; no leſs ſpacious, no leſs luminous, than the radiant ſource of day. So that every ſtar, is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent ſyſtem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, all which are loſt to our ſight in unmeaſurable wilds of ether. That the ſtars appear like ſo many diminutive and ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable points, is owing to their immenſe and inconceivable diſtance. Immenſe and inconceivable indeed it is, ſince a ball, ſhot from the loaded cannon, and flying with unabated rapidity, muſt travel, at this impetuous rate, almoſt

ſeven hundred thouſand years, before it could reach the neareſt of theſe twinkling luminaries.</p>
                     <p>While, beholding this vaſt expanſe, I learn my own extreme meanneſs, I would alſo diſcover the abject littleneſs of all terreſtrial things. What is the earth, with all her oſtentatious ſcenes, compared with this aſtoniſhing grand furniture of the ſkies? What, but a dim ſpeck, hardly perceivable in the map of the univerſe? It is obſerved by a very judicious writer, that if the ſun himſelf, which enlightens this part of the creation, were extinguiſhed, and all the hoſt of planetary worlds, which move about him, were anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, they would not be miſſed by an eye that can take in the whole compaſs of nature, any more than a grain of ſand upon the ſea-ſhore. The bulk of which they conſiſt, and the ſpace which they occupy, are ſo exceedingly little in compariſon of the whole, that their loſs would ſcarcely leave a blank in the immenſity of God's works. If then, not our globe only, but this whole ſyſtem, be ſo very diminutive, what is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or a county? What are a few lordſhips, or the ſo much admired patrimonies of thoſe who are ſtyled wealthy? When I meaſure them with my own little pittance, they ſwell into proud and bloated dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: but when I take the univerſe for my ſtandard, how ſcanty is their ſize, how contemptible their figure! They ſhrink into pompous nothings.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XV. On the Power of Cuſtom, and the Uſes to which it may be applied.</head>
                     <p>THERE is not a common ſaying, which has a better turn of ſenſe in it, than what we often hear in the mouths of the vulgar, that 'Cuſtom is a ſecond nature.' It is indeed able to form the man anew; and give him inclinations and capacities altogether different from thoſe he was born with. A perſon who is addicted to play or gaming, though he took but little delight in it at firſt, by degrees contracts ſo ſtrong an inclination towards it, and gives himſelf up ſo entirely to it, that it ſeems the only end of his being. The love of a retired or buſy life will grow upon a man inſenſibly, as he is converſant in the one or the other, till he is utterly unqualified for reliſhing that to which he has been for ſome time diſuſed. Nay, a man may ſmoke, or drink, or take ſnuff, till he is unable to paſs away his time without it; not to mention how our delight in any particular ſtudy, art, or ſcience, riſes and improves, in proportion to the application which we beſtow upon it. Thus, what was at firſt an exerciſe, becomes at length an entertainment. Our employments are changed into diverſions. The mind grows fond of thoſe actions it is accuſtomed to; and is drawn with reluctancy from thoſe paths in which it has been uſed to walk.</p>
                     <p>If we attentively conſider this property of human nature, it may inſtruct us in very fine moralities. In the firſt place, I would have no man diſcouraged with
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:035851_0250_1007AC38A16D57B0"/>
that kind of life, or ſeries of action, in which the choice of others, or his own neceſſities, may have engaged him. It may perhaps be very diſagreeable to him, at firſt; but uſe and application will certainly render it not only leſs painful, but pleaſing and ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place, I would recommend to every one, the admirable precept, which Pythagoras is ſaid to have given to his diſciples, and which that philoſopher muſt have drawn from the obſervation I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> the moſt excellent, and cuſtom will render it the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful." Men, whoſe circumſtances will permit them to chooſe their own way of life, are inexcuſable if they do not purſue that which their judgment tells them is the moſt laudable. The voice of reaſon is more to be regarded, than the bent of any preſent inclination; ſince, by the rule above mentioned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination will at length come over to reaſon, though we can never force reaſon to comply with inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, this obſervation may teach the moſt ſenſual and irreligious man, to overlook thoſe hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and difficulties, which are apt to diſcourage him from the proſecution of a virtuous life. "The Gods," ſaid Heſiod, "have placed labour before virtue; the way to her is at firſt rough and difficult, but grows more ſmooth and eaſy the farther we advance in it." The man who proceeds in it with ſteadineſs and reſolution, will in a little time, find that "her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and that all her paths are peace."</p>
                     <p>To enforce this conſideration, we may further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the practice of religion will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="214" facs="unknown:035851_0251_1007AC3B4FC840B0"/>
attended with that pleaſure, which naturally accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thoſe actions to which we are habituated, but with thoſe ſupernumerary joys of heart, that riſe from the conſciouſneſs of ſuch a pleaſure; from the ſatisfaction of acting up to the dictates of reaſon; and from the proſpect of a happy immortality.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, we may learn from this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we have made on the mind of man, to take particular care, when we are once ſettled in a regular courſe of life, how we too frequently indulge ourſelves in even the moſt innocent diverſions and entertainments; ſince the mind may inſenſibly fall off from the reliſh of virtuous actions, and, by degrees, exchange that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which it takes in the performance of its duty for delights of a much inferior and an unprofitable nature.</p>
                     <p>The laſt uſe which I ſhall make of this remarkable property in human nature, of being delighted with thoſe actions to which it is accuſtomed, is, to ſhow how abſolutely neceſſary it is for us to gain habits of virtue in this life, if we would enjoy the pleaſures of the next. The ſtate of bliſs, we call Heaven, will not be capable of affecting thoſe minds which are not thus qualified for it: we muſt in this world, gain a reliſh of truth and virtue, if we would be able to taſte that knowledge and perfection, which are to make us happy in the next. The ſeeds of thoſe ſpiritual joys and raptures, which are to riſe up and flouriſh in the ſoul to all eternity, muſt be planted in it during this its preſent ſtate of probation. In ſhort, heaven is not to be looked upon only as the reward, but as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural effect, of a religious life.</p>

                        </gap>eſs of behaviour, which we ſo frequently meet with among men of the world. Smiling, very often, is the aſpect, and ſmooth are the words, of thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly are the moſt ready to think evil of others. That candour which is a Chriſtian virtue, conſiſts, not in fairneſs of ſpeech, but in fairneſs of heart. It may want the blandiſhment of external courteſy, but ſupplies its place with humane and generous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of ſentiment. Its manners are unaffected, and its profeſſions cordial. Exempt, on one hand, from the dark jealouſy of a ſuſpicious mind, it is no leſs removed, on the other, from that eaſy credulity which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on by every ſpecious pretence. It is perfectly conſiſtent with extenſive knowledge of the world, and with due attention to our own ſafety. In that various intercourſe, which we are obliged to carry on with perſons of every different character, ſuſpicion, to a certain degree, is a neceſſary guard. It is only when it exceeds the bounds of prudent caution, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generates into vice. There is a proper mean between undiſtinguiſhing credulity, and univerſal jealouſy, which a ſound underſtanding diſcerns, and which the man of candour ſtudies to preſerve.</p>
                     <p>He makes allowance for the mixture of evil with good, which is to be found in every human character. He expects none to be faultleſs; and he is unwilling
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:035851_0254_1007AC446BBCB378"/>
to believe that there is any without ſome commendable quality. In the midſt of many defects, he can diſcover a virtue. Under the influence of perſonal reſentment, he can be juſt to the merit of an enemy. He never lends an open car to thoſe defamatory reports and dark ſuggeſtions, which, among the tribes of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious, circulate with ſo much rapidity, and meet with ſuch ready acceptance. He is not haſty to judge, and he requires full evidence before he will condemn. As long as an action can be aſcribed to different mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he holds it as no mark of ſagacity to impute it always to the worſt. Where there is juſt ground for doubt, he keeps his judgment undecided; and, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period of ſuſpenſe, leans to the moſt charitable conſtruction which an action can bear. When he muſt condemn, he condemns with regret; and without thoſe aggravations which the ſeverity of others adds to the crime. He liſtens calmly to the apology of the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and readily admits every extenuating circumſtance which equity can ſuggeſt. How much ſoever he may blame the principles of any ſect or party, he never confounds, under one general cenſure, all who belong to that party or ſect. He charges them not with ſuch conſequences of their tenets, as they refuſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow. From one wrong opinion, he does not infer the ſubverſion of all ſound principles; nor from one bad action, conclude that all regard to conſcience is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. When he "beholds the mote in his brother's eye," he remembers "the beam in his own." He commiſerates human frailty; and judges of others according to the principles, by which he would think it reaſonable that they ſhould judge of him. In a word, he views men and actions in the clear ſunſhine
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:035851_0255_1007AC3701DC2688"/>
of charity and good-nature; and not in that dark and ſullen ſhade which jealouſy and party-ſpirit throw over all characters.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XVIII. On the Imperfection of that Happineſs which reſts ſolely on worldly Pleaſures.</head>
                     <p>THE vanity of human pleaſures is a topic which might be embelliſhed with the pomp of much deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I ſhall ſtudiouſly avoid exaggeration, and only point out a threefold vanity in human life, which every impartial obſerver cannot but admit; diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in purſuit, diſſatisfaction in enjoyment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in poſſeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, diſappointment in purſuit. When we look around us on the world, we every where behold a buſy multitude, intent on the proſecution of various deſigns, which their wants or deſires have ſuggeſted. We behold them employing every method which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity can deviſe; ſome the patience of induſtry, ſome the boldneſs of enterprize, others the dexterity of ſtratagem, in order to compaſs their ends. Of this inceſſant ſtir and activity, what is the fruit? In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the crowd who have toiled in vain, how ſmall is the number of the ſucceſsful? Or rather, where is the man who will declare, that in every point <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> has completed his plan, and attained his utmoſt wiſh? No extent of human abilities has been able to diſcover a path which, in any line of life, leads unerringly to ſucceſs. "The race is not always to the ſwift, nor the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:035851_0256_1007924FF38B9A38"/>
battle to the ſtrong, nor riches to men of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing." We may form our plans with the moſt profound ſagacity, and with the moſt vigilant caution may guard againſt dangers on every ſide. But ſome unforeſeen occurrence comes acroſs, which baffles our wiſdom, and lays our labours in the duſt.</p>
                     <p>Were ſuch diſappointments confined to thoſe who aſpire at engroſſing the higher departments of life, the misfortune would be leſs. The humiliation of the mighty, and the fall of ambition from its towering height, little concern the bulk of mankind. Theſe are objects on which, as on diſtant meteors, they gaze from afar, without drawing perſonal inſtruction from events ſo much above them. But, alas! when we deſcend into the regions of private life, we find diſappointment and blaſted hope equally prevalent there. Neither the moderation of our views, nor the juſtice of our pretenſions, can enſure ſucceſs. But "time and chance happen to all." Againſt the ſtream of events, both the worthy and the undeſerving are obliged to ſtruggle; and both are frequently overborne alike by the current.</p>
                     <p>Beſides diſappointment in purſuit, diſſatisfaction in enjoyment is a farther vanity, to which the human ſtate is ſubject. This is the ſevereſt of all mortifications, after having been ſucceſsful in the purſuit, to be baffled in the enjoyment itſelf. Yet this is found to be an evil ſtill more general than the former. Some may be ſo fortunate as to attain what they have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; but none are rendered completely happy by what they have attained. Diſappointed hope is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; and yet ſucceſsful hope is only imperfect bliſs. Look through all the ranks of mankind. Examine the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:035851_0257_100792544277BE90"/>
condition of thoſe who appear moſt proſperous; and you will find that they are never juſt what they deſire to be. If retired, they languiſh for action; if buſy, they complain of fatigue. If in middle life, they are impatient for diſtinction; if in high ſtations, they ſigh after freedom and eaſe. Something is ſtill wanting to that plenitude of ſatisfaction, which they expected to acquire. Together with every wiſh that is gratified, a new demand ariſes. One void opens in the heart, as another is filled. On wiſhes, wiſhes grow; and to the end, it is rather the expectation of what they have not, than the enjoyment of what they have, which occupies and intereſts the moſt ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p>This diſſatisfaction in the midſt of human pleaſure, ſprings partly from the nature of our enjoyments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and partly from circumſtances which corrupt them. No worldly enjoyments are adequate to the high deſires and powers of an immortal ſpirit. Fancy paints them at a diſtance with ſplendid colours; but poſſeſſion unveils the fallacy. The eagerneſs of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beſtows upon them, at firſt, a briſk and lively reliſh. But it is their fate always to pall by familiarity, and ſometimes to paſs from ſatiety into diſguſt. Happy would the poor man think himſelf, if he could enter on all the treaſures of the rich; and happy for a ſhort time he might be: but before he had long contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated and admired his ſtate, his poſſeſſions would ſeem to leſſen, and his cares would grow.</p>
                     <p>Add to the unſatisfying nature of our pleaſures, the attending circumſtances which never fail to corrupt them. For, ſuch as they are, they are at no time poſſeſſed unmixed. To human lips it is not given to taſte the cup of pure joy. When external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:035851_0258_10079255CC0F4BA8"/>
ſhow faireſt to the world, the envied man groans in private under his own burden. Some vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſquiets, ſome paſſion corrodes him; ſome diſtreſs, either felt or feared, gnaws, like a worm, the root of his felicity. When there is nothing from without to diſturb the proſperous, a ſecret poiſon operates within. For worldly happineſs ever tends to deſtroy itſelf, by corrupting the heart. It foſters the looſe and the violent paſſions. It engenders noxious habits; and taints the mind with falſe delicacy, which makes it feel a thouſand unreal evils.</p>
                     <p>But put the caſe in the moſt favourable light. Lay aſide from human pleaſures both diſappointment in purſuit, and deceitfulneſs in enjoyment; ſuppoſe them to be fully attainable, and completely ſatisfactory; ſtill there remains to be conſidered the vanity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain poſſeſſion and ſhort duration. Were there in worldly things any fixed point of ſecurity which we could gain, the mind would then have ſome baſis on which to reſt. But our condition is ſuch, that every thing wavers and totters around us. "Boaſt not thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of to-morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth." It is much if, during its courſe, thou heareſt not of ſomewhat to diſquiet or alarm thee. For life never proceeds long in a uniform train. It is continually varied by unexpected events. The ſeeds of alteration are every where ſown; and the ſunſhine of proſperity commonly accelerates their growth. If our enjoyments be numerous, we lie more open on different ſides to be wounded. If we have poſſeſſed them long, we have greater cauſe to dread an approaching change. By ſlow degrees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:035851_0259_1007AB5B27A3E360"/>
riſes; but rapid is the progreſs of evil. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no preparation to bring it forward. The edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which it coſt much time and labour to erect, one inauſpicious event, one ſudden blow, can level with the duſt. Even ſuppoſing the accidents of life to leave us untouched, human bliſs muſt ſtill be tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; for man changes of himſelf. No courſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment can delight us long. What amuſed our youth, loſes its charm in maturer age. As years advance, our powers are blunted, and our pleaſurable feelings decline. The ſilent lapſe of time is ever carrying ſomewhat from us, till at length the period comes, when all muſt be ſwept away. The proſpect of this termination of our labours and purſuits, is ſufficient to mark our ſtate with vanity. "Our days are a hand-breadth, and our age is as nothing." Within that little ſpace is all our enterpriſe bounded. We crowd it with toils and cares, with contention and ſtrife. We project great deſigns, entertain high hopes, and then leave our plans unfiniſhed, and ſink into ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</p>
                     <p>This much let it ſuffice to have ſaid concerning the vanity of the world. That too much has not been ſaid, muſt appear to every one who conſiders how generally mankind lean to the oppoſite ſide; and how often, by undue attachment to the preſent ſtate, they both feed the moſt ſinful paſſions, and "pierce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves through with many ſorrows."</p>

In the exerciſe of good affections, and the teſtimony of an approving conſcience; in the ſenſe of peace and reconciliation with God, through the great Redeemer of mankind; in the firm confidence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted through all the trials of life, by infinite wiſdom and goodneſs; and in the joyful proſpect of arriving, in the end, at immortal felicity, they poſſeſs a happineſs which, deſcending from a purer and more perfect region than this world, partakes not of its vanity.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the enjoyments peculiar to religion, there are other pleaſures of our preſent ſtate, which, though of an inferior order, muſt not be overlooked in the eſtimate of human life. It is neceſſary to call atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe, in order to check that repining and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:035851_0261_1007AB6035362588"/>
ſpirit to which man is always too prone. Some degree of importance muſt be allowed to the comforts of health, to the innocent gratifications of ſenſe, and to the entertainment afforded us by all the beautiful ſcenes of nature; ſome to the purſuits and harmleſs amuſements of ſocial life; and more to the internal enjoyments of thought and reflection, and to the pleaſures of affectionate intercourſe with thoſe whom we love. Theſe comforts are often held in too low eſtimation, merely becauſe they are ordinary and common; although that is the circumſtance which ought, in reaſon, to enhance their value. They lie open, in ſome degree, to all; extend through every rank of life, and fill up agreeably many of thoſe ſpaces in our preſent exiſtence, which are not occupied with higher objects, or with ſerious cares.</p>
                     <p>From this repreſentation it appears that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the vanity of the world, a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of comfort is attainable in the preſent ſtate.

                     <p>THOUGH there is a great deal of pleaſure in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the material world; by which I mean, that ſyſtem of bodies, into which nature has ſo curiouſly wrought the maſs of dead matter, with the ſeveral relations that thoſe bodies bear to one another; there is ſtill, methinks, ſomething more wonderful and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, in contemplations on the world of life; by which I underſtand, all thoſe animals with which every part of the univerſe is furniſhed. The material world is only the ſhell of the univerſe: the world of life are its inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider thoſe parts of the material world, which lie the neareſt to us, and are therefore ſubject
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:035851_0263_1007AB65030ADAB8"/>
to our obſervations and inquiries, it is amazing to conſider the infinity of animals with which it is ſtocked. Every part of matter is peopled: every green leaf ſwarms with inhabitants. There is ſcarcely a ſingle humour in the body of a man, or of any other animal, in which our glaſſes do not diſcover myriads of living creatures. We find, even in the moſt ſolid bodies, as in marble itſelf, innumerable cells and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities, which are crowded with ſuch imperceptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, as are too little for the naked eye to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. On the other hand, if we look into the more bulky parts of nature, we ſee the ſeas, lakes, and rivers teeming with numberleſs kinds of living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We find every mountain and marſh, wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wood, plentifully ſtocked with birds and beaſts; and every part of matter affording proper neceſſaries and conveniences, for the livelihood of multitudes which inhabit it.</p>
                     <p>The author of "the Plurality of Worlds," draws a very good argument from this conſideration, for the peopling of every planet; as indeed it ſeems very probable, from the analogy of reaſon, that if no part of matter, with which we are acquainted, lies waſte and uſeleſs, thoſe great bodies, which are at ſuch a diſtance from us are not deſert and unpeopled; but rather, that they are furniſhed with beings adapted to their reſpective ſituations.</p>
                     <p>Exiſtence is a bleſſing to thoſe beings only which are endowed with perception; and is in a manner thrown away upon dead matter, any farther than as it is ſubſervient to beings which are conſcious of their exiſtence. Accordingly we find, from the bodies which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

made as the baſis and ſupport of animals; and that there is no more of the one than what is neceſſary for the exiſtence of the other.</p>
                     <p>Infinite Goodneſs is of ſo communicative a nature, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſeems to delight in conferring exiſtence upon every degree of perceptive being. As this is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, which I have often purſued with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to myſelf, I ſhall enlarge farther upon it, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that part of the ſcale of beings, which comes within our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome living creatures, which are raiſed but juſt above dead matter. To mention only that ſpecies of ſhell-fiſh, which is formed in the faſhion of a cone; that grows to the ſurface of ſeveral rocks; and immediately dies, on being ſevered from the place where it grew. There are many other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures but one remove from theſe, which have no other ſenſe than that of feeling and taſte. Others have ſtill an additional one of hearing; others, of ſmell; and others of ſight. It is wonderful to obſerve, by what a gradual progreſs the world of life advances, through a prodigious variety of ſpecies, before a creature is formed, that is complete in all its ſenſes: and even among theſe, there is ſuch a different degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in the ſenſe which one animal enjoys beyond what appears in another, that though the ſenſe in different animals is diſtinguiſhed by the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon denomination, it ſeems almoſt of a different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If, after this, we look into the ſeveral inward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of cunning and ſagacity, or what we generally call inſtinct, we find them riſing, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, imperceptibly one above another; and receiving additional improvements, according to the ſpecies in
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:035851_0265_1007AB68F25E0330"/>
which they are implanted. This progreſs in nature is ſo very gradual, that the moſt perfect of an inferior ſpecies, comes very near to the moſt imperfect of that which is immediately above it.</p>
                     <p>The exuberant and overflowing goodneſs of the Supreme Being, whoſe mercy extends to all his works, is plainly ſeen, as I have before hinted, in his having made ſo very little matter, at leaſt what falls within our knowledge, that does not ſwarm with life. Nor is his goodneſs leſs ſeen in the diverſity, than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he made but one ſpecies of animals, none of the reſt would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the happineſs of exiſtence: he has therefore, <hi>ſpecified,</hi> in his creation, every degree of life, every capacity of being. The whole chaſm of nature, from a plant to a man, is filled up with diverſe kinds of creatures, riſing one after another, by ſuch a gentle and eaſy aſcent, that the little tranſitions and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations from one ſpecies to another, are almoſt inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. This intermediate ſpace is ſo well huſbanded and managed, that there is ſcarcely a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which does not appear in ſome one part of the world of life. Is the goodneſs, or the wiſdom of the Divine Being, more manifeſted in this his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding?</p>
                     <p>There is a conſequence, beſides thoſe I have already mentioned, which ſeems very naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from the foregoing conſiderations. If the ſcale of being riſes, by ſuch a regular progreſs, ſo high as man, we may, by parity of reaſon, ſuppoſe, that it ſtill proceeds gradually through thoſe beings which are of a ſuperior nature to him; ſince there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater ſpace and room for different degrees
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:035851_0266_1007AB6C825E79D0"/>
of perfection, between the Supreme Being and man, than between man and the moſt deſpicable infect.</p>
                     <p>In this great ſyſtem of being, there is no creature ſo wonderful in its nature, and which ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our particular attention, as man; who fills up the middle ſpace between the animal and the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual nature, the viſible and the inviſible world; and who is that link in the chain of beings, which forms the connection between both. So that he who, in one reſpect, is aſſociated with angels and arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angels, and may look upon a being of infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as his father, and the higheſt order of ſpirits as his brethren, may in another reſpect, ſay, to "corruption, thou art my father, and to the worm, thou art my mother and my ſiſter."</p>

                     <p>MAN, conſidered in himſelf, is a very helpleſs, and a very wretched being. He is ſubject every moment to the greateſt calamities and misfortunes. He is beſet with dangers on all ſides; and may become unhappy by numberleſs caſualties, which he could not foreſee, nor have prevented had he foreſeen them.</p>
                     <p>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to ſo many accidents, that we are under the care of ONE who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the management of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the aſſiſtance we ſtand in
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:035851_0267_1007AB6ED86A2EE0"/>
need of, and is always ready to beſtow it on thoſe who aſk it of him.</p>
                     <p>The natural homage, which ſuch a creature bears to ſo infinitely wiſe and good a Being, is a firm reliance on him for the bleſſings and conveniences of life; and an habitual truſt in him, for deliverance out of all ſuch dangers and difficulties as may befal us.</p>
                     <p>The man who always lives in this diſpoſition of mind, has not the ſame dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who conſiders himſelf abſtractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the ſame time that he reflects upon his own weakneſs and imperfection, he comforts himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ith the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of thoſe divine attributes, which are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for his ſafety, and his welfare. He finds his want of foreſight made up, by the omniſcience of him who is his ſupport. He is not ſenſible of his own want of ſtrength, when he knows that his helper is almighty. In ſhort, the perſon who has a firm truſt on the Supreme Being, is powerful in his power, wiſe by his wiſdom, happy by his happineſs. He reaps the benefit of every divine attribute; and loſes his own inſufficiency in the fulneſs of infinite perfection.</p>
                     <p>To make our lives more eaſy to us, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to put our truſt in him, who is thus able to relieve and ſuccour us; the Divine goodneſs having made ſuch a reliance a duty, notwithſtanding we ſhould have been miſerable, had it been forbidden us.</p>
                     <p>Among ſeveral motives, which might be made uſe of to recommend this duty to us, I ſhall only take notice of thoſe that follow.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and ſtrongeſt is, that we are promiſed, He will not fail thoſe who put their truſt in him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="231" facs="unknown:035851_0268_1007AB7060DBB288"/>
But without conſidering the ſupernatural bleſſing, which accompanies this duty, we may obſerve, that it has a natural tendency to its own reward; or, in other words, that this firm truſt and confidence in the great Diſpoſer of all things, contributes very much to the getting clear of any affliction, or to the bearing of it manfully. A perſon who believes he has his ſuccour at hand, and that he acts in the ſight of his friend, often exerts himſelf beyond his abilities; and does wonders, that are not to be matched by one who is not animated with ſuch a confidence of ſucceſs. Truſt in the aſſiſtance of an Almighty Being, naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces patience, hope, cheerfulneſs, and all other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of mind, which alleviate thoſe calamities that we are not able to remove.</p>
                     <p>The practice of this virtue adminiſters great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the mind of man, in times of poverty and affliction: but moſt of all, in the hour of death. When the ſoul is hovering, in the laſt moments of its ſeparation; when it is juſt entering on another ſtate of exiſtence, to converſe with ſcenes, and objects, and companions, that are altogether new; what can ſupport her under ſuch tremblings of thought, ſuch fear, ſuch anxiety, ſuch apprehenſions, but the caſting of all her cares upon HIM, who firſt gave her being; who has conducted her through one ſtage of it; and who will be always preſent, to guide and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her in her progreſs through eternity?</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXII. Piety and Gratitude enliven Proſperity.</head>
                     <p>PIETY, and gratitude to God, contribute, in a high degree, to enliven proſperity. Gratitude is a pleaſing emotion. The ſenſe of being diſtinguiſhed by the kindneſs of another, gladdens the heart, warms it with reciprocal affection, and gives to any poſſeſſion which is agreeable in itſelf, a double reliſh, from its being the gift of a friend. Favours conferred by men, I acknowledge may prove burdenſome. For human virtue is never perfect; and ſometimes unreaſonable expectations on the one ſide, ſometimes a mortifying ſenſe of dependence on the other, corrode in ſecret the pleaſure of benefits, and convert the obligations of friendſhip into grounds of jealouſy. But nothing of this kind can affect the intercourſe of gratitude with Heaven. Its favours are wholly diſintereſted; and with a gratitude the moſt cordial and unſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, a good man looks up to that Almighty Benefactor, who aims at no end but the happineſs of thoſe whom he bleſſes, and who deſires no return from them, but a devout and thankful heart. While others can trace their proſperity to no higher ſource than a concurrence of worldly cauſes; and often, of mean or trifling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, which occaſionally favoured their deſigns; with what ſuperior ſatisfaction does the ſervant of God remark the hand of that Gracious Power which hath raiſed him up; which hath happily conducted him through the various ſteps of life, and crowned
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:035851_0270_1007AB762E0FCF20"/>
him with the moſt favourable diſtinction beyond his equals!</p>
                     <p>Let us farther conſider, that not only gratitude for the paſt, but a cheering ſenſe of Divine favour at the preſent, enters into the pious emotion. They are only the virtuous, who in their proſperous days hear this voice addreſſed to them, "Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a cheerful heart; for God now accepteth thy works." He who is the Author of their proſperity, gives them a title to enjoy, with complacency, his own gift. While bad men ſnatch the pleaſures of the world as by ſtealth, without countenance from the Great Proprietor of the world; the righteous ſit openly down to the feaſt of life, under the ſmile of approving Heaven. No guilty fears damp their joys. The bleſſing of God reſts upon all that they poſſeſs; his protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds them; and hence, "in the habitations of the righteous, is found the voice of rejoicing and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion." A luſtre unknown to others, inveſts, in their ſight, the whole face of nature. Their piety reflects a ſunſhine from heaven upon the proſperity of the world; unites in one point of view, the ſmiling aſpect, both of the powers above, and of the objects below. Not only have they as full a reliſh as others, of the innocent pleaſures of life, but, moreover, in theſe they hold communion with their Divine Benefactor. In all that is good or fair, they trace his hand. From the beauties of nature, from the improvements of art, from the enjoyments of ſocial life, they raiſe their affection to the ſource of all the happineſs which ſurrounds them; and thus widen the ſphere of their pleaſures, by adding intellectual, and ſpiritual, to earthly joys.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="unknown:035851_0271_1007AB77B58FFD88"/>
For illuſtration of what I have ſaid on this head, remark that cheerful enjoyment of a proſperous ſtate, which King David had when he wrote the twenty-third pſalm; and compare the higheſt pleaſures of the riotous ſinner, with the happy and ſatisfied ſpirit which breathes throughout that pſalm.—In the midſt of the ſplendour of royalty, with what amiable ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of gratitude does he look up to the Lord as "his Shepherd;" happier in aſcribing all his ſucceſs to Divine favour, than to the policy of his councils, or to the force of his arms! How many inſtances of Divine goodneſs aroſe before him in pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, when with ſuch reliſh he ſpeaks of the "green paſtures and ſtill waters, beſide which God had led him; of his cup which he had made to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow; and of the table which he had prepared for him in the preſence of his enemies!" With what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tranquillity does he look forward to the time of his paſſing through "the valley of the ſhadow of death;" unappalled by that ſpectre, whoſe moſt diſtant appearance blaſts the proſperity of ſinners! He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ars no evil, as long as "the rod and the ſtaff" of his Divine Shepherd are with him; and, through all the unknown periods of this and of future exiſtence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf to his guidance with ſecure and triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant hope: "Surely goodneſs and mercy will follow me all the days of my life; and I ſhall dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever."—What a purified, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental enjoyment of proſperity is here exhibited! How different from that groſs reliſh of worldly pleaſures, which belongs to thoſe who behold only the terreſtrial ſide of things; who raiſe their views to no higher objects than the ſucceſſion of human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies,
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:035851_0272_1007AB7A1780FBA8"/>
and the weak efforts of human ability; who have no protector or patron in the heavens, to enliven their proſperity, or to warm their hearts with gratitude and truſt!</p>

                     <p>THE city of Sidon having ſurrendered to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, he ordered Hepheſtion to beſtow the crown on him whom the Sidonians ſhould think moſt worthy of that honour. Hepheſtion being at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident with two young men of diſtinction, offered them the kingdom; but they refuſed it, telling him that it was contrary to the laws of their country, to admit any one to that honour, who was not of the royal family. He then, having expreſſed his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their diſintereſted ſpirit, deſired them to name one of the royal, race, who might remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he received the crown through their hands. Overlooking many, who would have been ambitious of this high honour, they made choice of Abdolonymus, whoſe ſingular merit had rendered him conſpicuous, even in the vale of obſcurity. Though remotely related to the royal family, a ſeries of misfortunes had reduced him to the neceſſity of cultivating a garden, for a ſmall ſtipend, in the ſuburbs of the city.</p>

They informed him that Alexander had appointed him to that office; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him immediately to exchange his ruſtic garb, and utenſils of huſbandry, for the regal robe and ſceptre. At the ſame time, they admoniſhed him, when he ſhould be ſeated on the throne, and have a nation in his power, not to forget the humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from which he had been raiſed.</p>
                     <p>All this, at the firſt, appeared to Abdolonymus as an illuſion of the fancy, or an inſult offered to his poverty. He requeſted them not to trouble him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their impertinent jeſts; and to find ſome other way of amuſing themſelves, which might leave him in the peaceable enjoyment of his obſcure habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.—At length, however, they convinced him, that they were ſerious in their propoſal; and prevailed upon him to accept the regal office, and accompany them to the palace.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was he in poſſeſſion of the government, than pride and envy created him enemies; who whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered their murmurs in every place, till at laſt they reached the ear of Alexander.

                     <p>WITH regard to my poverty, the king has, indeed, been juſtly informed. My whole eſtate conſiſts in a houſe of but mean appearance, and a little ſpot of ground; from which, by my own labour, I draw my ſupport. But if, by any means, thou haſt been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to think that this poverty renders me of leſs conſequence in my own country, or in any degree unhappy, thou art greatly deceived. I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of fortune: ſhe ſupplies me with all that nature requires; and if I am without ſuperfluities, I am alſo free from the deſire of them. With theſe, I confeſs I ſhould be more able to ſuccour the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitous, the only advantage for which the wealthy are to be envied; but ſmall as my poſſeſſions are, I can ſtill contribute ſomething to the ſupport of the ſtate, and the aſſiſtance of my friends. With reſpect to honours, my country places me, poor as I am, upon a level with the richeſt: for Rome knows no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for great employments, but virtue and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. She appoints me to officiate in the moſt auguſt ceremonies of religion; ſhe intruſts me with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her armies; ſhe confides to my care the moſt important negociations. My poverty does not leſſen the weight and influence of my counſels in the ſenate. The Roman people honour me for that very poverty
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:035851_0275_1007AB8254040600"/>
which King Pyrrhus conſiders as a diſgrace. They know the many opportunities I have had to enrich myſelf, without cenſure; they are convinced of my diſintereſted zeal for their proſperity: and if I have any thing to complain of, in the return they make me, it is only the exceſs of their applauſe. What value, then, can I put upon thy gold and ſilver? What king can add any thing to my fortune? Always attentive to diſcharge the duties incumbent upon me, I have a mind free from ſelf-reproach; and I have an honeſt ſame.</p>

                     <p>NO PRINCE, ſo little enterpriſing and ſo inoffenſive, was ever ſo much expoſed to the oppoſite extremes of calumny and flattery, of ſatire and panegyric. And the factions which began in his time, being ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, have made his character be as much diſputed to this day, as is commonly that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many virtues, however, it muſt be owned, he was poſſeſſed of; but not one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the neighbouring vices. His generoſity bordered on profuſion, his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on pedantry, his pacific diſpoſition on puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, his wiſdom on cunning, his friendſhip on light fancy, and boyiſh fondneſs. While he imagined that he was only maintaining his own authority, he may perhaps be ſuſpected in ſome of his actions, and ſtill more of his pretenſions, to have encroached on the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:035851_0276_1007AB83DD137B40"/>
liberties of his people. While he endeavoured, by an exact neutrality, to acquire the good-will of all his neighbours, he was able to preſerve fully the eſteem and regard of none. His capacity was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, but fitter to diſcourſe on general maxims, than to conduct any intricate buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>His intentions were juſt, but more adapted to the conduct of private life, than to the government of kingdoms. Awkward in his perſon, and ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command reſpect: partial and undiſcerning in his affections, he was little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper, more than of a frugal judgment; expoſed to our ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule from his vanity, but exempt from our hatred by his freedom from pride and arrogance. And, upon the whole, it may be pronounced of his character, that all his qualities were ſullied with weakneſs, and embelliſhed by humanity. Political courage he was certainly devoid of; and from thence chiefly is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived the ſtrong prejudice, which prevails againſt his perſonal bravery: an inference, however, which muſt be owned, from general experience, to be extremely fallacious.</p>

                     <head>SECTION XXVI. Charles V. Emperour of Germany, reſigns his Dominions, and retires from the World.</head>
                     <p>THIS great Emperour, in the plenitude of his power, and in poſſeſſion of all the honours which can flatter the heart of man, took the extraordinary reſolution,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:035851_0277_1007AB86376FDD30"/>
to reſign his kingdoms; and to withdraw entirely from any concern in buſineſs or the affairs of this world, in order that he might ſpend the remainder of his days in retirement and ſolitude. Though it requires neither deep reflection, nor extraordinary diſcernment, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that the ſtate of royalty is not exempt from cares and diſappointments; though moſt of thoſe who are exalted to a throne, find ſolicitude, and ſatiety, and diſguſt, to be their perpetual attendants, in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied pre-eminence; yet, to deſcend voluntarily from the ſupreme to a ſubordinate ſtation, and to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of power in order to attain the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of happineſs, ſeems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several inſtances, indeed, occur in hiſtory, of monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak princes, who took this reſolution raſhly, and repented of it as ſoon as it was taken; or unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate princes, from whoſe hands ſome ſtrong rival had wreſted their ſceptre, and compelled them to deſcend with reluctance into a private ſtation. Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian is, perhaps, the only prince capable of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reins of government, who ever reſigned them from deliberate choice; and who continued, during many years, to enjoy the tranquillity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ad abandoned.</p>
                     <p>No wonder, then, that Charles's reſignation ſhould fill all Europe with aſtoniſhment; and give riſe, both among his contemporaries, and among the hiſtorians of that period, to various conjectures concerning the motives which determined a prince, whoſe ruling
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:035851_0278_1007AB88B5D12920"/>
paſſion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-ſix, when objects of ambition operate with full force on the mind, and are purſued with the greateſt ardour, to take a reſolution ſo ſingular and unexpected.</p>
                     <p>The emperour, in purſuance of his determination, having aſſembled the ſtates of the Low Countries at Bruſſels, ſeated himſelf for the laſt time, in the chair of ſtate; on one ſide of which was placed his ſon, and on the other, his ſiſter the queen of Hungary, regent of the Netherlands, with a ſplendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and princes of the empire ſtanding behind him. The preſident of the council of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by his command, explained, in a few words, his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the ſtates. He then read the inſtrument of reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which Charles ſurrendered to his ſon Philip all his territories, juriſdiction, and authority in the Low Countries; abſolving his ſubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to transfer to Philip his lawful heir; and to ſerve him with the ſame loyalty and zeal that they had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, during ſo long a courſe of years, in ſupport of his government.</p>
                     <p>Charles then roſe from his ſeat, and leaning on the ſhoulder of the Prince of Orange, becauſe he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtand without ſupport, he addreſſed himſelf to the audience; and, from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to aſſiſt his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without oſtentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed, ſince the commencement of his adminiſtration. He obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that from the ſeventeenth year of his age, he
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:035851_0279_1007AB8BEE037310"/>
had dedicated all his thoughts and attention to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic objects, reſerving no portion of his time for the indulgence of his eaſe, and very little for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of private pleaſure; that either in a pacific or hoſtile m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nner, he had viſited Germany nine times, Spain ſix times, France four times, Italy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times, the Low Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by ſea; that while his health permitted him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his duty, and the vigour of his conſtitution was equal in any degree to the arduous office of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch extenſive dominions, he had never ſhunned labour, nor repined under fatigue; that now, when his health was broken, and his vigour exhauſted by the rage of an incurable diſtemper, his growing infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties admoniſhed him to retire; nor was he ſo fond of reigning, as to retain the ſceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his ſubjects, or to render them happy; that inſtead of a ſovereign worn out with diſeaſes, and ſcarcely half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accuſtomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attention and ſagacity of maturer years; that if, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of a long adminiſtration, he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any material error in government, or if, under the preſſure of ſo many and great affairs, and amidſt the attention which he had been obliged to give to them, he had either neglected or injured any of his ſubjects, he now implored their forgiveneſs; that, for his part, he ſhould ever retain a grateful ſenſe of their fidelity and attachment, and would carry the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his ſweeteſt conſolation, as well as the beſt reward
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:035851_0280_1007AB8D77F0A208"/>
for all his ſervices; and, in his laſt prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, would pour forth his ardent wiſhes for their welfare.</p>
                     <p>Then turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and kiſſed his father's hand, "If," ſays he, "I had left you, by my death, this rich inheritance, to which I have made ſuch large additions, ſome regard would have been juſtly due to my memory on that account; but now, when I voluntarily reſign to you what I might have ſtill retained, I may well expect the warmeſt expreſſions of thanks on your part. With theſe, however, I diſpenſe; and ſhall conſider your concern for the welfare of your ſubjects, and your love of them, as the beſt and moſt acceptable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your gratitude to me. It is in your power, by a wiſe and virtuous adminiſtration, to juſtify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, and to demonſtrate that you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the confidence which I repoſe in you. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholic faith in its purity; let the laws of your country be ſacred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and if the time ſhall ever come, when you ſhall wiſh to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a ſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with ſuch qualities, that you can reſign your ſceptre to him, with as much ſatisfaction as I give up mine to you."</p>
                     <p>As ſoon as Charles had finiſhed this long addreſs to his ſubjects, and to their new ſovereign, he ſunk into the chair, exhauſted and ready to faint with the fatigue of ſuch an extraordinary effort. During his diſcourſe, the whole audience melted into tears; ſome from
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:035851_0281_1007AB8FE1154CA0"/>
admiration of his magnanimity; others ſoftened by the expreſſions of tenderneſs towards his ſon, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepeſt ſorrow, at loſing a ſovereign, who had diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the Netherlands, his native country, with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular marks of his regard and attachment.</p>

                     <p>A FEW weeks after the reſignation of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Charles, in an aſſembly no leſs ſplendid, and with a ceremonial equally pompous, reſigned to his ſon the crowns of Spain, with all the territories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on them, both in the old and in the new world.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>; and after ſtopping there a few days, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge that tender and pleaſant melancholy, which ariſes in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on viſiting the place of his nativity, and viewing the ſcenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he purſued his journey, accompanied by his ſon Philip, his daughter the Arch-ducheſs, his ſiſters the Dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his ſon-in-law,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:035851_0282_1007AB935B582AF8"/>
and a numerous retinue of the Flemiſh nobility. Before he went on board, he diſmiſſed them, with marks of his attention or regard; and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderneſs of a father who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his ſon for the laſt time, he ſet fail under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of a large fleet of Spaniſh, Flemiſh, and Engliſh ſhips.</p>
                     <p>His voyage was proſperous and agreeable; and he arrived at Laredo in Biſcay, on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As ſoon as he landed, he fell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on the ground; and conſidering himſelf now as dead to the world, he kiſſed the earth, and ſaid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind." From Laredo he proceeded to Valladolid. There he took a laſt and tender leave of his two ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whom he would not permit to accompany him to his ſolitude, though they entreated it with tears; not only that they might have the conſolation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing, by their attendance and care, to mitigate or to ſooth his ſufferings, but that they might reap inſtruction and benefit, by joining with him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     <p>From Valladolid, he continued his journey to Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zencia in Eſtremadura. He had paſſed through that city a great many years before; and having been ſtruck at that time with the delightful ſituation of the monaſtery of St. Juſtus, belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles diſtant from that place, he had then obſerved to ſome of his attendants, that this was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ot to which Diocleſian might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with pleaſure. The impreſſion had remained ſo
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:035851_0283_1007AB95BA0A8928"/>
ſtrong on his mind, that he pitched upon it as the place of his retreat. It was ſeated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a ſmall brook, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by riſing grounds, covered with lofty trees: from the nature of the ſoil, as well as the temperature of the climate, it was eſteemed the moſt healthful and delicious ſituation in Spain. Some months before his reſignation, he had ſent an architect thither, to add a new apartment to the monaſtery, for his accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; but he gave ſtrict orders, that the ſtyle of the building ſhould be ſuch as ſuited his preſent ſtation, rather than his former dignity. It conſiſted only of ſix rooms, four of them in the form of friars' cells, with naked walls; the other two, each twenty feet ſquare, were hung with brown cloth, and furniſhed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> moſt ſimple manner. They were all on a level with the ground; with a door on one ſide into a garden, of which Charles himſelf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he propoſed to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate with his own hands. On the other ſide, they communicated with the chapel of the monaſtery, in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap> he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, hardly ſufficient for the comfortable accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve domeſtics only. He buried there, in ſolitude and ſilence, his grandeur, his ambition, together with all thoſe vaſt projects, which during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe; filling every kingdom in it by turns, with the terrour of his arms, and the dread of being ſubjected to his power.</p>
                     <p>In this retirement Charles formed ſuch a plan of life for himſelf, as would have ſuited the condition of
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:035851_0284_1007AB974615FBC0"/>
a private perſon of a moderate fortune. His table was neat but plain; his domeſtics few; his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them familiar; all the cumberſome and ceremonious forms of attendance on his perſon were entirely aboliſhed, as deſtructive of that ſocial eaſe and tranquillity, which he courted, in order to ſooth the remainder of his days. As the mildneſs of the climate, together with his deliverance from the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and cares of government, procured him, at firſt, a conſiderable remiſſion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more complete ſatisfaction in this humble ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts and projects, which had ſo long engroſſed and diſquieted him, were quite effaced from his mind. Far from taking any part in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical tranſactions of the princes of Europe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his curioſity even from any inquiry concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and he ſeemed to view the buſy ſcene which he had abandoned, with all the contempt and indifference ariſing from his thorough experience o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Engliſh Reviewers' Character of the preceding Work.</head>
            <p>"The plan of this work is highly commendable, and the execution is good. We are particularly pleaſed with the Compiler's having avoided every ſentiment that might gratify a corrupt mind, or, in the leaſt degree, offend the eye or ear of Innocence." <hi>Gentleman's Magazine, February,</hi> 1799.</p>
            <p>"There is very conſiderable merit in this compilation, the contents of which are pretty equally made up of the agreeable and the uſeful. After a careful inſpection, we feel ourſelves bound in juſtice to remark, that it compriſes much more novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any compilation of the ſame ſize, that ever came into our hands. Three objects are propoſed by Mr. Murray, in giving this volume to the world: firſt, to improve youth in the indiſpenſable art of reading; ſecondly, to meliorate their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ſentiments; and thirdly, to inculcate ſome of the moſt important principles of piety and virtue.—The articles ſelected for the firſt of theſe purpoſes, are peculiarly calculated for exerciſing the various pauſes, inflexions, and modulations of the voice: they are judiciouſly diverſified and proportioned and accurately punctuated.—In purſuance of his ſecond object Mr. Murray has made his ſelections from the moſt correct and elegant writers; and purity, propriety, and perſpicuity, of courſe, characterize them.—In his third department, we find extracts ſtrongly tending to promote piety and virtue. They place religion in the moſt amiable light; and recommend the moral duties, by proving the excellence of their nature, and the happy effects which they produce. In no part of the work do we meet with an expreſſion that might gratify a corrupt, or vitiate a pure mind; nor a ſentiment that can offend the ear of innocence. The Peruſal of the Sacred Scriptures is powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommended, by the frequent inſertion of the moſt ſublime, beautiful, and intereſting paſſages of theſe invaluable writings. But, though the general caſt of the volume partakes more of the grave than the gay, yet it is not without a conſiderable portion of rational amuſement; and as it is ſerious without enthuſiaſm or ſuperſtition, ſo it is cheerful without levity.—We do not fear diſcrediting our judgment, by recommending</p>

            <p>
               <hi>While Wars convulſe foreign Countries, and fluctuating Politics agitate the public Mind; while we are extending our commercial Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, forming Alliances, and drawing Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from every Quarter, it is hoped that this ſmall Work may contribute a Mite to increaſe our Acquaintance with thoſe, who are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with us by Treaties, as well as a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of Laws and Cuſtoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our former Intercourſe has been chiefly by War; but Peace, Commerce, and Emigrations are extending our Connections, and awake a Solicitude for more particular Accounts, than any one has yet detailed.</hi>
