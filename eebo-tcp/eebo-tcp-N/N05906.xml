            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR moſt eſteemed came to Hand on the 15th Inſtant: I duly peruſed it, and was highly pleaſed to ſee your generous Concern for the Publick, and Pity for the Individuals; and the many Schemes you had projected for the Advantage of both; which confirmed me in the Opinion I had long entertained of you, as a Gentleman of a publick benevolent Spirit; but was really ſurprized, when you deſired my Opinion concerning the Law of Bankruptcy, as to the Expediency or Non-Expediency, of having that, or one as near like it as may be, made in this Colony, for the Relief of inſolvent Debtors; for as the Study of Politicks has not been my Buſineſs, I really eſteem myſelf a very incompetent Judge: However any Service I can render, you may freely command: I will ſuggeſt ſome Thoughts on the Subject, for your private Reflection, but ſhall not be anxious in the Affair; being perſuaded your Candour will pardon a Thouſand Faults. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>I conceive there are ſcarcely any Reaſons for ſuch an Act in <hi>England,</hi> but what hold good with regard to the Plantations in <hi>America;</hi> which are much upon a Par; Debtors and Creditors being much the ſame in the Plantations as at home; and in as much as the Legiſlative Body at home, have made an Act for the Eaſe and Benefit of Bankrupts, or inſolvent Debtors; we may conclude they judged it beneficial to the State in general, all Things conſidered, tho' ſome Individuals might poſſibly ſometimes be injured by it, which I hope to prove by-and-by ſeldom happens to be the Caſe. I have long thought ſuch an Act the proper Object of our Legiſlature's Attention, for this Reaſon, that it might be of publick Service (tho' there are many others) and ſhall therefore the more chearfully give my Thoughts on the Subject, hoping it may give Occaſion to a much abler Pen [yours] to take the Affair in Hand, which I doubt not is ſufficient fully to evince the Expediency, Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Neceſſity of ſuch an Act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:007495_0003_102D73ED405F3318"/>
I ſhall conſider this Act in the
<list>
                  <item>FIRST PLACE, <hi>As beneficial to the Publick,</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>SECONDLY, <hi>Serviceable in general to the Debtor.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>THIRDLY, <hi>In general, no Diſſervice to the Creditor.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>FOURTHLY, <hi>Agreeable to Reaſon, and the Genius of our holy Religion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I can't but hope, if I ſhould be ſo happy as to prove ſuch an Act beneficial to the Publick; generally a Service to the Debtor; ſeldom a Diſſervice to the Creditor, and always conſiſtent with Reaſon, and the Genius and Temper of our holy Religion; that this Colony may be induced (through your Influence) to follow the Example of its Mother-Country; and poſſibly the rather, as one of our neighbouring Colonies have lately done the ſame: And as the ſame has lately been recommended to be done, to the Government of <hi>Virginia;</hi> what Advantage it will give thoſe Colonies over us I leave you to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> then, An Act of Bankruptcy, I conceive, may be beneficial to the Publick in two Reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it might be beneficial, as it would ſave a good deal of Expence, and prevent many ill Conſequences. Let us view a Man who is an inſolvent Debtor, proſecuted according to Form of Law, and impriſoned (I had almoſt ſaid Divine Law, and under that terrible Sentence, <hi>Thou ſhalt not come out thence till thou haſt paid the utmoſt Farthing,</hi>) there to be holden by Law till the Debt be diſcharged, How many Evils will unavoidably ariſe to the Publick! Is the Man there ever like to diſcharge the Debt? No; that Place is not a Place for Improvement but Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: What will be the Conſequence then? This without Diſpute; if the Man has 1000<hi>l.</hi> or 10,000 <hi>l.</hi> of his Creditor's Eſtate in his Hands, he will conſume it in ſuch a Manner (in a Thouſand Ways too tedious to be mentioned) that neither his Creditor or the Publick will be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitted by it: Such Loſſes are impoveriſhing to the Publick; beſides the Publick will loſe entirely the Benefit of the Man's Labour during the Time of his Confinement; if not altogether that of his Family, yet very much of it; as the Family is deſtitute of its Head and Guide. How fatal would ſuch Inſtances, if they ſhould be multiplied, prove to the Publick! for upon a moderate Computation, every Inſtance ſubjects the Publick to a Loſs of 5 or 600<hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and 'tis more than probable, that Inſtances will be multiplied to our Sorrow, if we do not prevent them by aſcertaining the Value of our Medium, the Uncertainty of which has ruined many; or paſs ſome Acts for their Relief. Now under what Obligation the Publick can be to ſuffer ſuch Loſſes (eſpecially when its
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007495_0004_102D73EEFAD8AAB0"/>
not like to ſerve any good End) I leave to thoſe that are better Judges of Obligations than I am, to determine. The Loſs is yet more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, ſhould this Man, (thus impriſoned) being an honeſt Man, (which may be the Caſe) be a Man of Skill and Experience in Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, (which by the Bye are ſuch Attainments that every Man does not attain to, tho' many are ſo happy as to blunder into an Eſtate without them) who, by the Badneſs of the Times in Trade, or by the mere Providence of GOD, has been reduced: Or ſhould he be a Man of known Ingenuity, either in Literature or in any of the mechanical Arts, which are beneficial to Mankind; as the Goal is no Place for the Improvement of a Man's Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could mention many more ill Conſequences that attend a Confinement; but I will only obſerve, that this Man (after having been fatigued, plagued and diſgraced with a four or five Years Impriſonment, which he looks upon (often juſtly) rather as a Piece of Revenge and Ill-nature, and done rather in Compliance to the malicious Temper of a haughty Creditor, than with any View to the Good of himſelf, his Creditor, or the Publick) is generally either ſo much loſt as to any Senſe of Honour or Ambition, or is ſo much depreſſed in his Spirits, and out of Humour with Mankind, or has contracted ſo ſtrong a Habit of Idleneſs, tho' he ſhould be ſo happy as to eſcape that of Intemperance in Drink, and maintain a good Conſtitution, which few under thoſe Circumſtances do; he is never like any more to be of any great Service to himſelf or any Body elſe. Theſe are ſome of the Evils ſuch an Act would prevent. Moreover, as a Priſon is generally the Conſequence of a Failure in this Government, which (under our preſent Circumſtances) in the Apprehenſion of Men, ſo much reſembles the final Puniſhment of Wickedneſs, they imagine, the Man that is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be doomed to that Place, is not only become a Bankrupt as to his Fortune, but as to his Faith and Honour; and generally treat him as ſuch; which gives Mankind ſuch terrible Apprehenſions with regard to the Conſequences of a Failure; that let a Man's Integrity be almoſt what it will, if his Fortune is declining and ſinking, 'tis ten to one, if, in order to ſave himſelf, he does not purſue ſuch Meaſures (his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations being almoſt invincible) as really bankrupts both his Faith and Fortune: Whereas did we believe, that a Man might be a Bankrupt, and yet be a Man of Honour and Fidelity; in this Caſe, a Man in declining Circumſtances, of a common Degree of Honeſty, (his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations not being in any Meaſure ſo great as in the other Caſe) would in ordinary act quite a different Part, a Part more friendly to Vertue, more
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007495_0005_102D73F0A1EEB4E0"/>
healthful to the Publick, leſs detrimental to his Creditors, and by far ſafer and more honourable for himſelf. But,</p>
            <p>Secondly, it might be beneficial, as it would be productive of much poſitive Good. When I was in <hi>England,</hi> I was informed, and I take it to be Fact, that there are Thouſands of Gentlemen who have proved Bankrupts, and have upon the Statute, delivered up their Effects to their proper Owners, began the World anew, and are now Men of diſtinguiſhed Characters in the mercantile Life; who by their Skill in and Application to Buſineſs, have procured vaſt Fortunes. This every one will allow to be a publick Good: But this could never have been the Caſe with thoſe Gentlemen, had they been under the unhappy Circumſtances that our Debtors are.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, that thoſe Men who prove inſolvent, are commonly branded as Villains, and judged unworthy any more to be entruſted with any of the Concerns of this Life: I am ſorry that this Brand is fixed on every one of this Character, ſo much without Diſtinction. Some Villains I grant there are; but then I would obſerve, that there are a great many Men, Men of Probity and Honour, who not being ſufficiently inſtructed in the Nature of Trade, have, either with a ſmall or with a large Fortune, which is much the ſame in the Quotient if they over-trade, put themſelves into Buſineſs of this Nature, and have over-traded their Stock; which has been the Cauſe of their Ruin: Theſe unfortunate Gentlemen have purchaſed their Skill at a dear Rate; but are now poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly qualified for the Buſineſs, which heretofore they were not capable of managing; if ſo, why ſhould the Publick be deprived of the Service, which by Experience (dear to themſelves) they are now capable and willing to render? Moreover, ſome Men are render'd inſolvent by the mere Providence of God, (which by Statute ſhould hurt no Man) ſhould theſe Men be deemed as Villains, becauſe they are ſubject to a Fate that is unavoidable? and becauſe God, who gives the good Things of this Life as it pleaſes him, has not given with ſo liberal a Hand to theſe Men as to others, for Reaſons beſt known to himſelf; ſhall theſe unhappy Men therefore be denied the Privilege and Pleaſure of breathing the common Air, to which the Birds and Beaſts are welcome? and becauſe God diſciplines, ſhall Men puniſh?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the Worſt, that theſe Men have render'd themſelves inſolvent by their own wicked immoral Conduct; I aſk, will it ſerve any good Purpoſes in the State, to commit theſe Men to Goal? will the Publick be benefitted by it; will their Creditors, or will they themſelves?
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007495_0006_102D73F26A5F4E28"/>
I believe neither, for Reaſons before aſſigned; then there can be no good Reaſons why they ſhould be committed, in Manner and Form notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Shall they be committed as Sinners? No certainly! as ſuch they are accountable to the higheſt Tribunal, and to that only. We may be thought to be tolerable good Judges as to Property, <hi>mea &amp; tua, commoda &amp; incommoda;</hi> but as to Virtue and Vice as ſuch, we are inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Judges: As to Virtue and Vice, there are ſo many Things to be counted upon, that He only who knows all Things is a proper Judge.</p>
            <p>I aſk Pardon for this long Digreſſion, and now obſerve more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to this Head, that an Act for the Eaſe of Bankrupts, is productive of Good to the Publick in this Reſpect, that whatever Effects the inſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Debtor has in his Hands, inſtead of conſuming of it to no good Purpoſe, he returns it to his Creditors, for them to improve, to the Advantage of themſelves, and conſequently of the Publick: This affects the Publick in a two-fold Ratio; firſt by ſaving the Intereſt, and ſecondly by applying of it to good Purpoſes; and is ſimilar to taking a Weight out of one Scale, and putting it into the other, in the general Ballance; one Pound thus applied makes two odds. 'Tis moreover productive of Good, as it is a Motive and Incitement to Induſtry. Suppoſe a Man inſolvent, that he owes large Sums of Money, and has Nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them with, if he is put into Goal, there is no Opportunity or Motive for Induſtry; his Thoughts and Concern there, are to no Manner of Purpoſe; and if after he has been diſgraced and plagued with a long Confinement, he ſhould take the Poor-Man's Oath, and in that Manner obtain Goal-Delivery, his Spirits are ſo ſunk with the Weight of his Debts, he has no Heart to contrive or work for his Relief, and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence will do Nothing to Purpoſe: He imagines (as the Proverb is) he is <hi>working for a dead Horſe;</hi> and that he is Nothing but a Slave to his Creditors; that he is like never to poſſeſs any Thing for himſelf or Family, and ſo the remaining Part of Life is loſt (and worſe than loſt) to himſelf, his Creditors, and to the Publick: Of this every Man's Experience abundantly convinces him. For my Part, I never knew an Inſtance, of any Man, under theſe Circumſtances, ever making any Thing for himſelf, or any Body elſe; but was he take Benefit by the Act of Bankruptcy, and deliver up his Effects to his Creditors, and begin the World anew, he might be encouraged to Frugality and Induſtry, and do every Thing in his Power to make an Intereſt for himſelf, as every Thing that he ſhould then acquire would be his own. But before I proceed to the next Head, I ſhall obviate the following Objection, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007495_0007_102D73F430FCA258"/>
               <hi>That the Government cannot, in Equity, diſcharge a Debt due from a Debtor to a Creditor, without the Conſent of the Creditor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Objection I anſwer in the firſt Place, that as we hold our Eſtates under the Government, and have all our Intereſts defended and protected by it, it muſt always be ſuppoſed, that the Government has an equitable Right to inſpect our Trade and Commerce one with another, and determine under all Circumſtances, when a Man ſhall be holden, and when diſcharged. Secondly, I would ſay, that a Government is to be conſidered as one great Family, and that our Eſtates, as we are Members of the ſame, are properly to be conſidered as ſo many Parts of the Common-Stock; which we are allowed to improve for our own Benefit, but in ſuch a Form as not to be detrimental to the Government: Of this the Government, or ſuch Part as ſhall be appointed for that Purpoſe, are the only proper judges; conſequently any Contracts we make, if they ſhould be judged prejudicial to the common Intereſt, may be made void, and of none Effect.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, Such an Act would be ſerviceable in general to Debtors.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'tis a Service done to them, as it gives them the Advantage of beginning the World again, and of making an Intereſt for themſelves and the Publick; which will be a ſtrong Motive to them thus induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to improve it; and as it delivers them from the Goal, and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Evils natural and moral, that generally attend it.</p>
            <p>2dly, 'Tis a Favour done them, as it delivers them from the Malice and Revenge of their Creditors. The Troubles that attend a Failure, are almoſt infinite, and ſhould really excite our Pity: Why then ſhould the Publick abandon ſuch an unhappy Man to the Fury and Reſentment of his incenſed Creditors? For, ſays an Author, <q>their Loſſes generally ſour their Tempers, and keep their Reſentments warm againſt the unhappy Occaſion of them, even to the Extinction ſometimes of Humanity: But one ſhould think, that the Lamentations of a fallen Familiar and Intimate (frequently heighten'd by the Tears of a tender Wife, and affecting Cries of their innocent Babes) would be prevailing Objects to excite Compaſſion from thoſe who have always experienced a courteous and gentle Treatment from the unhappy Sufferer; but Philanthropy is almoſt loſt amongſt us, and Mankind are grown ſo degenerate, as to become inſenſible to the Diſtreſſes of others, much leſs to defend them from, or adminiſter Relief under them; the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Man is now equally ſhunn'd with the infected one; and the <hi>beſt</hi> Uſage he finds is Slights from almoſt every Individual <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Acquaintance, whilſt the <hi>worſt</hi> is ſwelled to an immoderate Height by Inſults offered him, Contume<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ies and Reproaches thrown out againſt him; and Abuſes, Invectives and unmerited Aſperſions are frequently added, to compleat the Catalogue, and augment his Miſeries; few regard him, fewer ſtill careſs him, and the Paucity of thoſe who protect or aſſiſt him, are reduced to the loweſt Degree of Compariſon.</q> It appears then, ſuch an Act would be a Kindneſs to a Debtor, and for that Reaſon he ought to have the Benefit of it; if there be not a ſtronger Reaſon why he ſhould not from the Part of the Creditor; which will appear not to be the Caſe, if it ſhould be found to be no Prejudice to the Creditor in general, for the Debtor thus to be benefitted: Which is the Deſign of the next Head.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, I am to conſider this Act as it relates to the Creditors; and ſay, 'tis no Diſſervice in general to them.</p>
            <p>For the Proof of this, I appeal to all Mankind; for they are as good Judges of it as I am: How frequently do we obſerve Bankrupts, or inſolvent Debtors, ſpend their Creditor's Eſtates in Goal, often large Sums, and after a Length of Time are ſupported at the Expence of the Creditors until they are tired of it, and finally obtain Goal-Delivery, upon taking the Poor-Man's Oath; and the Creditors, after having ſuffered the Loſs of large Sums (which might be ſaved by the Act of Bankruptcy) found to be at a greater Remove from their juſt Dues than ever; and complain that all their Fatigue and Coſts are to no Purpoſe: And indeed, where has been a notable Inſtance to the Contrary? Upon the Whole, we have Reaſon to imagine, that the Law of Bankruptcy in general, is rather a Favour than a Prejudice even to the Creditor himſelf. But having in Part anticipated myſelf on this Head, I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, That ſuch an Act is conſiſtent with Reaſon, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Genius of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, With Reaſon: Reaſon conſiders all Trade properly as a Barter, an Exchange of one Article for another; as, when I purchaſe any Article of Merchandize of a Merchant, I give him another Article, or ſecure to give him one in exchange for it; and that Reaſon ſays, muſt be a <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> a Thing that can be mine and then his: So Reaſon underſtands it, and ſo Men underſtand it. Accordingly the Italians, and we from them practice, as underſtanding of it in this Form: For when <hi>A. B.</hi> buys 100 wt. of Piemento of <hi>C. D.</hi> on Time, the Journal poſt is not <hi>A. B.</hi> Debiter to <hi>C. D.</hi> properly for 100 wt. of Piemento bought on Time; but Piemento is Debitor to <hi>C. D.</hi> for 100 wt. bought on Time;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007495_0009_102D73F9106D7D78"/>
for this plain Reaſon, becauſe Piemento is the Ground, Foundation or Cauſe of <hi>C. D</hi>'s Demand on <hi>A. B.</hi> and not <hi>A. B.</hi> himſelf; therefore <hi>C. D.</hi> makes <hi>A. B.</hi> Dr. not to himſelf, but to Piemento 100 wt. bought on Time, at <hi>&amp;c.</hi> From whence I argue, that when I purchaſe a Quantity of Merchandize of a Merchant, the Merchandize ſo purchaſed, or the Avails of it, is Debtor to the Merchant, and not I myſelf abſtracted from the Merchandize or its Avails. And inaſmuch as it cannot, in ordinary, be determined what are the particular Avails of the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize ſo purchaſed, Reaſon will judge every Thing I ſtand poſſeſs'd of (if Things convertible) to be Avails, and conſequently accountable to the Merchant; therefore ſo long as I ſtand poſſeſſed of any ſuch Avails, the Merchant has a proper Foundation for his Demands; for theſe Avails are accountable to him, or in other Words are his Debtors properly in the Nature of Things: But if I deliver up theſe Avails to the Merchant, or through the Diſpoſition of Providence have none to deliver up his Demands ceaſe; becauſe the very Things that were accountable, or his Debotrs, ceaſe to be, or have no Exiſtence, and I in Reaſon am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: If ſo, it will from thence follow, that ſuppoſing I ſhould begin the World again with Nothing, but what I received with my Being, and ſhould acquire a ſecond Intereſt in the World, the Merchant, or my Creditor, could have no Demand on me; for as Debtor and Creditor have a joint Exiſtence, and can not exiſt ſeparately; if the Debtor die, as in this Caſe, the Creditor dies alſo. Moreover, Reaſon ſuppoſes, and the Parties ſuppoſe, that whenever a Contract is made, and one Thing is given, or ſecured to be given, in Exchange for another, that the Thing ſo given, or ſecured to be given, is an Equivalent to the Thing received: So our Courts of Juſtice underſtand it: For if <hi>A.</hi> makes a Demand on <hi>B.</hi> for One Hundred Pounds Money; in order to recover, <hi>A.</hi> is obliged to prove, that <hi>B.</hi> has received the Value of his Demand; which is the ſole Foundation of <hi>A</hi>'s Demand againſt <hi>B.</hi> Whence then is the Creditor's Demand on the Perſon of the Debtor excluſive of his Intereſt? Did the Parties underſtand, that at the Time of the Contract, the Debtor obliged his Eſtate, himſelf, Soul and Body, to anſwer the Creditor's Demand? If this was the Caſe, Reaſon ſays the Bargain ſhall be void <hi>ipſo facto;</hi> for the Debtor was over-reached, having never received the Value from the Creditor, of thoſe Things which he has ſecured to be exchanged for it: If this was their Underſtanding, the Soul was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued, (and the Debtor ought to have Remedy) if we can rely on the Judgment of Him that made it; for he tells us, that <hi>Thouſands of Rams,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:007495_0010_102DB685D051CF88"/>
               <hi>and Ten Thouſands of Rivers of Oil,</hi> are not an Equivalent: So that truly, and in the Nature of Things, the Creditor's Demand lies not againſt the Perſon, but the Eſtate, of the Debtor. But if it ſhould be objected, as a Conſequence from my Reaſoning, that the Perſon of the Debtor can in no Caſe be taken and holden; I ſhall not allow the Conſequence; for Reaſon ſuppoſes he may be taken and holden, but then 'tis with this View, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that the Creditor may come at the Eſtate of the Debtor; for the Debtor in this Caſe is conſidered only as a Key to the Creditor's Intereſt; but when the Creditor has received all the Debtor's Eſtate, be that an Equivalent to his Demand or not, Reaſon ſays, he has no Demand on his Perſon; that being a Thing that was never underſtood to be a Commodity in Trade, there being no Equivalent to it, conſequently not to be dealt for. I add, that the Law of Bankruptcy ſeems to be built upon this Foundation, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> that a Creditor's Demand lies againſt the Eſtate, and not againſt the Perſon, of the Debtor.</p>
            <p>But 'tis objected, that this is hard on the Part of the Creditor: 'Tis poſſible, I allow, he may be hurt by it, but not very probable; but the Contrary would be much harder on the Part of the Debtor; for in the firſt Caſe, the Creditor loſes only his Eſtate, but in the ſecond, the Debtor not only loſes his Eſtate (which is right) but he loſes himſelf alſo. I would ſay farther, in Anſwer to this Objection, that Men always trade on this Suppoſition, that 'tis poſſible that either the Debtor or the Creditor may loſe their Intereſt; and that Things are ſo uncertain and fluctuating in this Life, that in ordinary, a Man knows not whether his Eſtate will be moſt ſecure in his own Hands, or in the Hands of his Debtor; and that in both Caſes we muſt be concluded by the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Providence.</p>
            <p>2dly, I would ſay, ſuch an Act is agreeable to the Genius of our holy Religion. As we are Intelligences of Rank (with Gratitude be it ſpoken to the Author of our Being) we, in the Purpoſe of Heaven, are deſigned for ſocial Happineſs, in a World that is to ſucceed this: This State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we now live in, is to be conſidered as preparatory to that, and as a State of Trial and Diſcipline to qualify us for it: 'Tis neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we ſhould be ſubjected in this State to various Troubles and Diſtreſſes; as Loſs of Friends, Sickneſs, Poverty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence appears the Neceſſity why Men who are to act a Part on this troubleſome Stage, ſhould be of a benevolent, compaſſionate, forgiving Temper: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we ſee, that the ſacred Laws are calculated to beget and promote ſuch a Temper and Diſpoſition: <hi>If there be among you a poor Man of one</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:007495_0011_102DB689420F1980"/>
               <hi>of thy Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>thou ſhalt not harden thine Heart, nor ſhut thy Hand from thy poor Brother; but thou ſhalt open thine Hand wide unto him, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſufficient for his Need, in that which he wanteth: If thy Brother be waxen poor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then thou ſhalt relieve him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he may live. If,</hi> ſays JOB, <hi>I have ſeen any periſh for Want of Cloathing, or any Poor without Covering; if his Loins have not bleſſed me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then let mine Arm fall from my Shoulder-blade, and mine Arm be broken from the Bone. Whoſo hath this World's Good, and ſeeth his Brother have Need, and ſhutteth up his Bowels of Compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the Love of God in him! My little Children, let us not love in Word, neither in Tongue, but in Deed and in Truth.</hi> When we turn over the Pages of the ſacred Volume, wrote from the Mouth of our Divine Maſter, and there obſerve the ſublime Sentiments of Benevolence, Compaſſion, Forbearance, Forgiveneſs of Injuries, and Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> enforced by the moſt powerful Arguments drawn from Life and Death, and the ſame exhibited in Perfection in his own glorious Perſon; we are ready to imagine, that all that call themſelves his Diſciples, are governed by theſe noble Principles; Principles that are the Glory of the Chriſtian Religion, and the Dignity of human Nature; and indeed all ſuppoſed Excellencies, if theſe and ſuch-like are wanting, in a moral Account might juſtly be eſteemed as Cyphers; but, alas! how great our Miſtake! how few have imbibed the Sentiments, or are influenced by the Example of our benevolent, glorious moral Preceptor! How contrary will our Principles appear to thoſe of our benevolent Maſter; if, while he could forgive his Enemies and Perſecutors, and do Good to all as he had Opportunity, we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon an Affront or Injury done us, ſhould encourage a Spirit of Reſentment and Revenge, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute every ſuch Injury, tho' by legal Proceſs, to the Utmoſt; and by this Means impriſon and diſtreſs our Fellow-Men, and render Life to the laſt Degree taſteleſs, even to thoſe that have as exquiſite a Taſte for Happineſs as we, and are the Children of the ſame Father, and the Care of the ſame Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us, ſays a celebrated Author, who are his Diſciples, abhor Contention and Revenge; let us not proſecute every little Injury to the utmoſt, nor govern ourſelves by thoſe falſe Maxims of Prudence and Honour, which Pride and Self-Love have introduced on the Ruins of real Chriſtianity: Let us not even in the moſt legal Methods, ſeek the Puniſhment of others who have wronged us; except <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

and even then, let us act in a calm and diſpaſſionate Manner, pitying and loving the Perſons of the Injurious, even while, for the Sake of Society, we proſecute their Crimes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Lord tells us, that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (or the Goſpel Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation) <hi>is like to a certain King, who would take Account of his Servants; and when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which owed him Ten Thouſand Talents; but foraſmuch as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be ſold, and his Wife and Children, and all that he had, and payment to be made: The Servant therefore fell down, and worſhipped him, ſaying, Lord, have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all: Then the Lord of that Servant was moved with Compaſſion, and looſed him, and forgave him the Debt. But the ſame Servant went out, and found one of his Fellow-Servants which owed him an Hundred Pence; and he laid Hands on him, and took him by the Throat, ſaying, Pay me what thou oweſt: And his Fellow-Servant fell down at his Feet, and beſought him, ſaying, Have Patience with me, and I will pay thee all: And he would not; but went and caſt him into Priſon, till he ſhould pay the Debt. So when his Fellow-Servants ſaw what was done, they were very ſorry, and came and told unto their Lord all that was done. Then his Lord, after that he had called him, ſaid unto him, O thou wicked Servant, I forgave thee all that Debt, becauſe thou deſiredſt me: Shouldeſt not thou alſo have Compaſſion on thy Fellow-Servant, even as I had Pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him. So likewiſe ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your Hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi> We are not to underſtand, that the Goſpel obliges us, to forgive every Man his Debts, upon his deſiring the ſame; no: but then I think it may well be expected, that thoſe who are formed upon the benevolent Principles of our holy Religion, will not, can not, proſecute, diſtreſs and impriſon thoſe of their Fellow-Men, whom Providence has rendered incapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their Obligations; and that, if they are really governed by thoſe Principles, they will rather diſcharge their inſolvent Debtors, than puniſh and impriſon them; and eſpecially when they have no reaſonable Proſpect of ſerving themſelves, or the State, in ſo doing. How agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then would an Act for the Relief of inſolvent Debtors, be to the Temper and Genius of our holy Religion! and what a ſolid Foundation ſhall we lay for Happineſs, as a Body Politick, and as Individuals, if we are really governed by the Maxims and Inſtructions of our glorious Maſter! Thus much I have ſaid, that you may know how much</p>
