            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following pages contain an anſwer to one of the moſt artful, inſidious and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious pamphlets I have ever met with. It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the paſſions of the populace, at a time when their paſſions are much inflamed. At ſuch junctures, cool reaſon and judgment are too apt to ſleep: The mind is eaſily impoſed on, and the moſt violent meaſures will, <hi>therefore,</hi> be thought the moſt ſalutary. Poſitive aſſertions will paſs for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration with many, rage for ſincerity, and the moſt glaring abſurdities and falſhoods will be ſwallowed.</p>
            <p>The author of COMMON SENSE, has availed himſelf of all thoſe advantages. Under the maſk of friendſhip to America, in the preſent calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ſituation of affairs, he gives vent to his own private reſentment and ambition, and recommends a ſcheme which muſt infallibly prove ruinous. He propoſes that we ſhould renounce our allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our ſovereign, break off all connection with Great-Britain, and ſet up an independent empire of the republican kind. Senſible that ſuch a propoſal muſt, even at this time, be ſhocking to the ears of Americans; he inſinuates that the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:043050_0003_101CABC94338CC70"/>
               <hi>novelty</hi> of his ſentiments is the only obſtacle to their ſucceſs,—that, "perhaps they are not yet ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently faſhionable to procure them general favour; that a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a ſuperficial appearance of being right, and raiſes at firſt a formidable outcry in defence of cuſtom."</p>
            <p>In this he imitates all other enthuſiaſts and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary of paradoxes, who were conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the common feelings of mankind muſt revolt againſt their ſchemes: the author, however, tho' he did not intend it here, pays a compliment to the Americans; for this amounts to a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that amidſt all their grievances, they ſtill retain their allegiance and loyalty.</p>
            <p>With the ſame view, I preſume, to make his pamphlet go down the better, he prefixes the title of Common Senſe to it—by a figure in rhetoric, which is called a <hi>Catachreſis,</hi> that is, in plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, an abuſe of words. Under this title, he counteracts the cleareſt dictates of reaſon, truth, and common ſenſe. Thus have I ſeen a book written by a popiſh bigot, entitled, <hi>Mercy and Truth; or, Charity maintained;</hi> in which the author very devoutly and charitably damns all heretics.</p>
            <p>I find no <hi>Common Senſe</hi> in this pamphlet, but much <hi>uncommon</hi> phrenzy. It is an outrageous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the common ſenſe of Americans; an inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious attempt to poiſon their minds, and ſeduce them from their loyalty and trueſt intereſt. The principles of government laid down in it, are not only falſe, but ſuch as ſcarcely ever entered the head of a crazy politician. Even Hobbes would bluſh to own the author for a diſciple. He unites the violence of a republican with all the folly of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:043050_0004_101CAEAA35A517E0"/>
a fanatic. If principles of truth and common ſenſe, however, would not ſerve his ſcheme, he could not help that by any other method than by inventing ſuch as <hi>would;</hi> and this he has done.</p>
            <p>No perſon breathing, has a deeper ſenſe of the preſent diſtreſſes of America, than I have—or would rejoice more to ſee them removed, and our liberties ſettled on a permanent, conſtitutional foundation. But this author's propoſal, inſtead of removing our grievances, would aggravate them a thouſand fold. The remedy is infinitely worſe than the diſeaſe. It would be like cutting off a leg, becauſe a toe happened to ache.</p>
            <p>It is probable that this pamphlet, like others, will ſoon ſink in oblivion—that the deſtructive plan it holds out, will ſpeedily be forgotten, and vaniſh, like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion; yet while any honeſt man is in danger of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by it—whilſt there is even a poſſibility that the dreadful evils it is calculated to produce, ſhould overtake us; I think it a duty which I owe to God, to my King and country, to counteract, in this manner, the poiſon it contains. Nor do I think it leſs a duty thus to vindicate our honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Congreſs, and my injured countrymen in general, from the duplicity and criminal inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with which this pamphlet virtually charges them.</p>
            <p>The reader however muſt not expect that I ſhould ſubmit to the drudgery of returning a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct anſwer to every part of a pamphlet, in which the lines in many places are out numbered by the falſhoods; and where the author's malice and antipathy to monarchical government, miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent almoſt every thing relative to the ſubject I
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:043050_0005_101CAEAF0AC6ED28"/>
have done, notwithſtanding what I conceive to be ſufficient—I have developed his leading prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and obviated ſuch miſrepreſentations as are aptiſt to miſlead the unwary. I have, moreover, ſhewn that his ſcheme is big with ruin to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca—that it is contrary to the ſentiments of the coloniſts, and that in a reconciliation with Great-Britain, on ſolid, conſtitutional principles, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all parliamentary taxation, the happineſs and proſperity of this continent, are only to be ſought or found.</p>
            <p>I neither have, nor can poſſibly have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ſeparate from thoſe of America—any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in view but her welfare. My fate is involved in her's. If ſhe becomes a conquered country, or an independent republic, I can promiſe myſelf no advantage or emolument in either caſe; but muſt inevitably ſhare with millions in the evils that will enſue. This I can declare, before the ſearcher of hearts, is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Can the author of Common Senſe do the ſame? Can he truely and ſincerely ſay, that he has no honour, power, or profit in view, ſhould his darling republican ſcheme take place? If not, than he is an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prejudiced perſon, and very unfit to adviſe in this matter. We ſhould be diſtruſtful of his judgment, and on our guard againſt what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends.</p>
            <p>The author calls himſelf an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> but whether he is a native of <hi>Old England,</hi> or <hi>New England,</hi> is a thing I neither know nor care about. I am only to know him by the features he hath there exhibited of himſelf, which are thoſe of an avowed, violent Republican, utterly averſe and
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:043050_0006_101CAEB0C5F96B40"/>
unfriendly to the Engliſh conſtitution. He hath not prefixed his name to his pamphlet; neither ſhall I prefix mine to this. But as I fear his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties juſt as little as I love his republican cauſe, I hereby pledge myſelf, that in caſe he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and publiſh his name; I alſo, ſhould I think it neceſſary to rejoin, ſhall publiſh my name. I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour genius wherever I meet with it; but deteſt its proſtitution to bad purpoſes. The few faint glimmerings of it that are thinly ſcattered throw this pamphlet, are but a poor compenſation for its malevolent, pernicious deſign; and ſerve only to raiſe our indignation and abhorrence.</p>
            <p>I hope the reader will diſtinguiſh where there is a real difference between this Republican's cauſe, and that of America. If not, and if he is not willing to liſten calmly to truth, I adviſe him to ſtop here and lay down this pamphlet. But if the caſe be otherwiſe, I have only to beſeech him, whilſt peruſing this treatiſe, to remember that it was written to promote our reconciliation with a King and nation, whom, not long ſince, we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely loved and eſteemed. The bittereſt enmity I know is that which ſubſiſts between thoſe who were once friends, but have fallen out. On ſuch occaſions, and whilſt our reſentment is high, the advice which tends to gratify that reſentment, may be the moſt welcome. But when our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſubſide, our former affections will alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and we ſhall then look upon him to be much more our friend who would calm our reſentment, than him who would inflame it. From our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer connection with Great Britain, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready derived numberleſs advantages and benefits; from a cloſer union with her, on proper principles,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:043050_0007_101CAEB44BEE0808"/>
we may derive ſtill greater benefits in future. Duty, gratitude, intereſt, nay, Providence, by its all-wiſe diſpenſations, loudly call on both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to unite, and would join them together; and may infamy be the portion of that wretch who would put them aſunder.</p>

            <head>ANSWER TO SECTION I.</head>
            <head type="sub">Of the Origin and Deſign of Government in general; with conciſe Remarks on the Engliſh Conſtitution.</head>
            <p>WRITERS on politics, like thoſe on philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, are very apt to be warped by prejudice, and the ſyſtems they have previouſly adopted. They often draw general concluſions from particular premiſes, and form their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of human nature, not from a general view of mankind in their various ſituations; but from the conduct of a few individuals, and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtate of things at the time they wrote. Whilſt ſome of them pretend to delineate the true ſtate of human nature, perhaps they only give us a diſguſting picture of their own dark and gloomy minds. Moreover, thoſe writers are charged with founding their principles, not on nature and fact, but on their own prejudices, on improbable ſuppoſitions and imaginary caſes, which never had an exiſtance. Hence that varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of viſionary political fabricks that have been
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043050_0009_101CAEBD0F621C40"/>
raiſed, contradictory to each other, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to common ſenſe, and which will not bear the teſt of ſober examination. Some of them indeed may do very well on paper, but can never be reduced to practice, unleſs a race of beings, very different from men, can be found for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Whilſt writers of this ſort amuſe themſelves with Utopian ſyſtems, and go no further, they may be borne with, and paſs without much cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Their works may be read like other ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, or fictions. But if they preſume to looſe the bands of ſociety, and overturn governments that have been formed by the wiſdom of ages, to make way for their own crude ſyſtems, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by entail miſery and ruin upon millions; it is then abſolutely neceſſary to examine thoſe ſyſtems, point out their deſtructive tendency, and unmaſk the deceivers that propoſe them.</p>
            <p>The author of a pamphlet, falſly and abſurdly entitled COMMON SENSE, is not only chargeable with a large portion of the above defects, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other political ſyſtem-makers, but alſo with the further deſign of rending the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire aſunder. To realize his beloved ſcheme of independent republicaniſm, he would perſuade the coloniſts to renounce their allegiance to our true and lawful liege ſovereign King GEORGE III. plunge themſelves into a tedious, bloody, and moſt expenſive war with Great-Britain, and riſque their lives, liberties and property on the dubious event of that war.</p>
            <p>This is the principal object his pamphlet has in view; other things are only mentioned as condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to that end. To prepare the reader for it—
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043050_0010_101CAEBEA02222A0"/>
to take off that horror which every honeſt man and well-informed friend of America muſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally feel at a propoſal ſo wicked and ruinous; he firſt treats of ſome other matters which he faſhions to his purpoſe; he poiſons the fountain that the ſtream may be avoided: With this deſign, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers his ſentiments on government, the Engliſh conſtitution and monarchy. I ſhall now very briefly examine what he has offered on theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>He tells us, that "ſome writers have confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſociety with government;" and then ſupplies us with a diſtinction which is to ſet all right. He ſays, "Society is produced by our wants, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by our wickedneſs." We may reaſonably preſume there are neither wants nor wickedneſs in Heaven. According to this doctrine then, there can be no ſociety or government there; and yet we are aſſured of the contrary.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction is not only inaccurate, but it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> alſo founded on falſe principles; and we might expect the reverſe of both, when the errors of others are profeſſedly corrected. Our wants do not produce ſociety; nor are the firſt or principal cauſe of it. Did this gentleman ever know of any one that was born out of ſociety? Are we not by an act of providence in our birth made members of ſociety? A ſtate of ſociety is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate of man; and by the conſtitution of his mind and frame he is fitted for it. Not only his wants and weakneſs require it, but his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, his nobleſt faculties impel him to it; and the more perfect thoſe faculties are, the better is he fitted for ſociety. As nature has thus made us members of ſociety, without any choi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

or will of ours; ſo, whatever happineſs or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection we are capable of, can only be attained in ſociety.</p>
            <p>This writer's account of the origin of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is equally exceptionable with that of the origin of ſociety. I can no more aſſent to it than to Hobbes's notion,—"that mankind are naturally in a ſtate of war, and that government is founded in ſuperior power or force."</p>
            <p>Since providence hath formed us for ſociety, and placed us in it from the time of our firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance, I am of Hooker's opinion,—"that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety could not be without government, nor go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without law," tho' mankind were ever ſo virtuous. For what is government, but the regulation of ſociety by laws? It is well known to all who are converſant in hiſtory, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates, the different forms of government which have ſubſiſted in the world, have had their origin from a variety of cauſes peculiar to each. Of theſe I ſpeak not, but of government in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, herein following my republican guide.</p>
            <p>As we cannot doubt but the benevolent author of our being, wills our happineſs in the ſtate where he hath placed us, he ſurely wills alſo the means which lead to that end—thoſe means are order and government. Thus far I hold with the beſt republican writers on this ſubject, the divine right of government, whoſe end is the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; yet without appropriating that right to any particular form, excluſively of others. Were men as virtuous as angels, yet, if collected in large ſocieties, there muſt be a variety of ſtates and conditions among them; and wherever ſuch ſocieties are, government will be indiſpenſibly neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:043050_0012_101CAEC574F31D60"/>
But not to enter deeply into this ſubject, which would be foreign to my deſign, I ſhall juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that man is a moral agent, and thereby fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be governed by laws:—He is born in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, whoſe ends cannot be obtained, but by ſubordination, order and the regulation of laws; and where theſe are, there is government. I conclude, therefore, that government is agreeable to the will of the Deity—that it has its origin in the nature and ſtate of man—that in framing go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments by mutual compact, men act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of their nature, and dictates of reaſon, which thus point out the only effectual way to attain happineſs and avoid evil. I draw my principles from nature and fact, without having recourſe to ſyſtem—the never failing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of weak minds, and of party writers.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to the origin he aſſigns to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, our author ſeems to think the only buſineſs of government is to <hi>puniſh;</hi> for, he ſays, that as ſociety is a "patron," ſo government is "a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher." But to think thus, betrays an equal ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the principles of government, and of matter of fact. Numberleſs bleſſings ſlow from government beſides the ſecurity reſulting from a reſtraint of vice by puniſhing the vicious. Were there no wickedneſs, there would probably be little occaſion for penal laws; but are theſe the only laws enacted by government? The criminal law of any ſtate makes but a ſmall part of its general code. It is Livy, I think, who ſome where defines government to be, "The empire of laws, and not of men." According to this definition, the laws of our author's government, <hi>produced by wickedneſs,</hi> would exerciſe a moſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043050_0013_101CAECA738E3248"/>
ſway—being deſigned only to <hi>puniſh,</hi> they would probably reſemble the laws of Draco, which were ſaid to be written in blood. Perſons who entertain ſuch notions of government, may be well calculated to form a ſanguinary code of laws, and afterwards to execute them; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they would feel very well inclined to inflict every kind of puniſhment without ſcruples.</p>
            <p>To evince the truth of his aſſertion, that "Government is produced by wickedneſs," our author adds, "Government, like dreſs, is the badge of loſt innocence; the palaces of Kings are built on the ruins of the bowers of Paradiſe." This is mighty florid—what pity that it has no ſolidity! Juſt ſo, ſay I. Ploughing and ſowing, like dreſs, are the badges of loſt innocence: The farmer's cottage, barn, ſtable, and hog-houſe are built upon the ruins of the bowers of Paradiſe. I cannot ſee that this <hi>pretty</hi> ſentence proves any thing but the author's enmity to kings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical governments: For if he would hereby ſhew the inexpediency of either, the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will equally ſhew the inexpediency of ploughing and ſowing, of the former's cottage, barn, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Having thus laid his foundation, the author proceeds to erect his ſuperſtructure; and I aſſure you, gentle reader, the one is perfectly ſuitable to the other. "In order to gain a clear and juſt idea of the deſign and end of government," ſays he, "let us ſuppoſe a ſmall number of perſons ſettled in ſome ſequeſtered part of the earth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with the reſt; they will repreſent the firſt peopling of any country, or of the world. In this ſtate of natural liberty,"—well! what
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:043050_0014_101CAECC0C41D140"/>
would they firſt do or think of? Why,—"ſociety will be their firſt thought!" This indeed might poſſibly happen, were we to ſuppoſe that theſe perſons had dropped from the clouds, or ſprung out of the earth, and could all ſpeak the ſame language. On any other principle, the caſe here ſtated is utterly devoid of probability.</p>
            <p>The author in this, follows the example of ſome other manufacturers of political ſyſtems, who fly to fiction, when matters of fact ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: But as he has managed things, his fiction is contradictory and replete with abſurdity, For he ſuppoſes that thoſe perſons, "ſettled in ſome ſequeſtered part of the earth," had emigrated—"that the firſt difficulties of emigration had bound them together;" and yet gravely tells us, "their firſt thought," when ſettled, "would be ſociety!" I opine this thought would ſtrike them, and had been practiſed long before.</p>
            <p>But further, Amidſt "a thouſand motives that would excite them thereto," i. e. ſociety, "one" among others, he ſays, would be that—"diſeaſe, nay even misfortune would be death; for altho' neither might be mortal, yet either would diſable any individual from living, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to a ſtate in which he might rather be ſaid to periſh than to die." Here, "diſeaſe, nay even misfortune" would be "death;" yet neither be "mortal," yet ſtill either would "diſable from living;" but this would only be "periſhing" and not "dying!" I here give the author's own words—I did not make theſe contradictions and blunders, but found them.</p>
            <p>It would be a waſte of time to trace this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's wonderful colony any further; which is
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043050_0015_101CAECF39572748"/>
ſo far from "repreſenting the firſt peopling of any country," that I ſincerely believe it repreſents the firſt peopling of no one country ſince the days of Adam; at leaſt my memory does not furniſh me with one parallel inſtance at preſent; and ſome parts of his ſcheme are deſtitute even of the fainteſt probability. It is very likely however, that he had the firſt ſettlement of theſe Britiſh colonies in view, while thus helping us "to gain a clear and juſt idea of the deſign and end of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment." Many circumſtances favour this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but there is not the leaſt reſemblance between them. The firſt Britiſh emigrants to America, were in a ſtate of Society before their emigration;—in England they jointly applied for grants of land here—they received grants, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and inſtructions, which veſted them with a legal title to thoſe lands, and marked the outlines of thoſe governments that were to be formed here. When thoſe emigrants found themſelves in America, they did not then firſt think of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; for they were in a ſtate of ſociety before, and the governments they erected here, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the plans they had previouſly received in England.</p>
            <p>After finiſhing this goodly political edifice, the author is pleaſed to beſtow ſome "remarks on the ſo much boaſted conſtitution of England." He aſſures us—"he draws his idea of the form of government from a principle in nature which no art can overturn, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the more ſimple any thing is, the leſs liable it is to be diſordered, and the eaſier repaired when diſordered; and with this maxim in view, he offers his remarks." But he inſtantly forgets this promiſe, and pays no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:043050_0016_101CAED2C7D71098"/>
to this maxim. Abſolute monarchy is, paſt all doubt, the ſimpleſt form of government; yet this gentleman prefers democracy, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more complex, and the moſt liable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of any. The truth is, that this principle was uſhered in, purely to contraſt it with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex nature of the Engliſh conſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prejudice the reader againſt the latter. Let me add, that if, as he himſelf declares, "we are never in a proper condition of doing juſtice to others, while we continue under the influence of ſome leading partiality;" this partial, avowed republican is one of the unfitteſt perſons breathing to offer remarks on the Engliſh conſtitution. He cannot hold the ſcales of juſtice with an even hand.</p>
            <p>"That the conſtitution of England was noble," ſays he, "for the dark and ſlaviſh times in which it was erected, is granted." This is condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—it would be more ſo, had he informed us what "dark and ſlaviſh times" he refers to. The conſtitution of England, as it now ſtands was fixed at the revolution, in 1688—an aera ever memorable in the fair annals of liberty. It was then that the limits of royal prerogative on the one hand, and the liberties and privileges of the ſubject, on the other; were aſcertained with preciſion. But certainly that was neither a "dark nor ſlaviſh time." It would not be worth while to contend with a man that could aſſert it. The lamp of ſcience never ſhone brighter in any country than in Britain, nor did patriots of greater ſame ever adorn the cauſe of freedom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thoſe who ſtood forth to aſſert her liberties, at that diſtinguiſhed period. If our author means
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:043050_0017_101CAED7CD281A60"/>
any time before that, it is impertinent to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, nor am I concerned about it. What is it to us, what the conſtitution of England was two or three hundred or a thouſand years ago? That conſtitution, as fixed at the revolution, as it <hi>now</hi> ſtands, is what we are intereſted in.</p>
            <p>"But that it is imperfect," he continues, "ſubject to convulſions, and incapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing what it ſeems to promiſe, is eaſily demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated." If he will be pleaſed to inform me of any political conſtitution, of human contrivance, that was or is perfect, and not ſubject to convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhall be obliged to him, and readily give it the preference to that of England. But until he, or ſome other perſon does ſo, I ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in my preſent firm belief, that the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of England approaches the neareſt to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—that it is productive of the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and benefit to the ſubject, of any conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on earth. Nor ſhall I heſitate to prefer it, in theſe reſpects, to any conſtitution that antiquity can boaſt of.</p>
            <p>"But the conſtitution of England is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly complex, that the nation may ſuffer for years together, without being able to diſcover in which part the fault lies." Theſe are matters that fall not within my line—I leave them to ſuch profound, eagle-eyed politicians as our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. One thing is certain, that if any man is aggrieved, either in his perſon or property, he muſt ſoon know it; and in either caſe he has a ſpeedy remedy by the conſtitution of England. The late legal deciſion in favour of Mr. Wilkes, (no favourite of the court or miniſtry)—reſpecting general warrants, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043050_0018_101CAED95CF4DF50"/>
the ſecurity enjoyed by a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the equity and ſuperior excellence of the Engliſh conſtitution. But what is the complexneſs of that conſtitution to us? The conſtitution of the colonies is very ſimple; each being admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by a governor, council and aſſembly. Let our liberties, property and trade be once ſecured on a firm conſtitutional bottom, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexneſs of the Engliſh conſtitution cannot in the leaſt affect us.</p>
            <p>Having hitherto ſkirmiſhed only at a diſtance, our author prepares now for a nearer and more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attack on the Engliſh conſtitution; ſuch as ſeems to threaten it with total demolition. "By ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining its component parts, he finds them to be the baſe remains of two ancient tyrannies, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with ſome new republican materials. 1ſt, The remains of monarchical tyranny in the perſon of the King. 2d, The remains of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical tyranny in the perſons of the peers. 3d, The new republican materials, in the perſons of the commons; the two former being hereditary, are independent of the people, and therefore in a conſtitutional ſenſe contribute nothing towards the freedom of the ſtate."</p>
            <p>Here are ſeveral hard words; and as ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may not well underſtand them, I ſhall beg leave to explain them. The learned reader will the more readily excuſe me, as this method may beſt elucidate the ſubject before us, and deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope this vile medley of jargon and miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.</p>
            <p>It is, I think, generally agreed to by all, that there is in every ſtate, whatever its form of government may be, a ſupreme, abſolute power. The diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:043050_0019_101CAEDC8C7C8880"/>
of this power, is what conſtitutes the different forms of government; and that form is beſt, which moſt effectually ſecures the greateſt ſhare of happineſs to the whole. There are uſually reckoned three forms of governments, called <hi>ſimple,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe which are compounded of all three, or only two of the three. The firſt is monarchy, when the ſupreme power of a ſtate is lodged in one perſon. When this power is placed in the hands of a few, or ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of nobles, it is called an ariſtocracy, which is the ſecond form of ſimple government. The third is where the ſovereign power is lodged in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at large, and this is called democracy.</p>
            <p>Each of theſe forms is ſubject to abuſe, and often has been abuſed. The abuſe of monarchy is called tyranny—The abuſe of ariſtocracy is called oligarchy—The abuſe of democracy is called anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; though the word tyranny may be appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the abuſe of any of them. Our republican author applies it to the two former, even when not abuſed; and through his whole pamphlet he makes no diſtinction between the right uſe and abuſe of a thing. If he happens to diſlike it, as in the caſe of monarchy, however reſtrained and calculated for the benefit of the ſubject; it is reprobated by the groſs—it is nothing but <hi>tyranny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may not be improper to obſerve here, that monarchical governments are beſt adapted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive dominions; popular governments to a ſmall territory. It is alſo worthy of obſervation, that although there have been, and ſtill are many abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute monarchies; yet no government was ever pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſtocratical or democratical—owing probably
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:043050_0020_101CAEDE1E388AB0"/>
to the unavoidable evils incident to each—or to the impracticableneſs of forming either. This is candidly owned by Harrington, a noted repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican writer. "Though for diſcourſe," ſays he, "politicians ſpeak of pure ariſtocracy, and pure democracy, there is no ſuch thing as either of theſe in nature or example." Algernon Sidney, another republican writer, acknowledges the ſame.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his works page, 132.</note>
            </p>
            <p>As each of theſe ſimple forms would be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with numberleſs inconveniences, it has been the opinion of the wiſeſt men in every age, that a proper combination of the three, conſtitutes the beſt government. It is the peculiar, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glory of the Engliſh conſtitution, that it is a happy mixture of theſe; ſo tempered and balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that each is kept within its proper bounds, and the good of the whole thereby promoted.</p>
            <p>For what is the conſtitution—that word ſo often uſed—ſo little underſtood—ſo much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? It is, as I conceive, "that aſſemblage of laws, cuſtoms and inſtitutions which form the general ſyſtem; according to which the ſeveral powers of the ſtate are diſtributed, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective rights are ſecured to the different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the community." By impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the component parts of the Engliſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it will be found that the ſupreme power is diſtributed in the beſt manner to attain this important end, the ſecurity of their reſpective rights to all the members of the community. Theſe parts are,—</p>
            <p>I. The King; who has the executive power, and other prerogatives, which are all ſo ordered,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:043050_0021_101CAEE64CE61FC0"/>
ſo reſtrained within conſtitutional limits, as to prevent their being injurious. He can take no man's money, or property of any kind, without a law paſſed by the other branches of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for that purpoſe. He can take no man's life, before the perſon has had a trial, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by his peers. He can deprive no man of his liberty, unleſs the perſon has violated the laws of the ſtate. And this is what our candid republican calls the "baſe remains of monarchical tyranny."</p>
            <p>II. The Peers; who are one branch of the legiſlature, and in ſome caſes have a ſhare in the judicial power. They have other privileges alſo, but all circumſcribed ſo as to prevent injury to others. As theſe are chiefly hereditary, and are veſted with large property, they are equally inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the crown and people, and deeply intereſted in the welfare of the ſtate. Hence they form a ſtrong barrier againſt any encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from either of the other branches, and give ſtability to the conſtitution. Theſe are what our gentle republican calls "the baſe remains of ariſtocratical tyranny."</p>
            <p>III. The Houſe of Commons; the members of which are choſen by the people; without whoſe conſent, no money can be levied, nor law paſſed to bind the ſubject; and who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as well as others, bound by the laws that are enacted. Theſe are what our author calls the "new republican materials." But why new? The Houſe of Commons was not firſt formed at the Revolution. Its origin is hid in the remote depths of antiquity. It may be traced with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:043050_0022_101CAEE7DD4FD860"/>
for near ſix hundred years back;—ſome, eſpecially republican writers, trace it much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; although it may have undergone ſeveral variations before the revolution. Calling it new, therefore, is juſt of a piece with many other of our author's expreſſions.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme power of the ſtate is diſtributed among theſe three branches of the Britiſh legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſuch a manner, that the conſtitution has almoſt all the advantages of each of the three ſimple forms of government, and ſcarcely any of their inconveniences. On preſerving an equal poize in each of theſe branches, depends the good of the whole: No prudent man, therefore, no real friend of Britiſh liberty, will ever wiſh to ſee any of them paſs the conſtitutional limits; or attempt to throw power into any of them which would deſtroy tho balance.</p>
            <p>This is a plain, conciſe repreſentation of the Engliſh conſtitution. It is ſufficient to refute our Republican's miſrepreſentation of it, juſt as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating truth, in other caſes, is a ſufficient refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of falſhood. But left he, or my reader, ſhould think that I mean to ſkip over any thing that has the appearance of argument, I ſhall follow him a little further on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>"To ſay, that the conſtitution of England is an union of three powers reciprocally checking each other is farcical,"—he tells us. This is a new and ſhort method of confutation,—ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as nothing can withſtand. How happy is it for mankind, that this acute reaſoner has not thought proper to employ it in ſhewing the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thoſe reciprocal duties and obligations ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between huſband and wife, parent and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:043050_0023_101CAEE9C4D54A18"/>
child, maſter and ſervant! They muſt all have infallibly vaniſhed, and have been annihilated by a few farcical ſtrokes of his pen! Yet ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the beſt and wiſeſt men, the warmeſt advocates of liberty, have viewed this reciprocal check of the three branches of the legiſlature, not as farcical, unmeaning or contradictory; but as the moſt effectual method that human wiſdom could deviſe to promote happineſs and liberty.</p>
            <p>Still, however, he inſiſts,—that "to ſay the Commons are a check upon the King, preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes two things. 1. That the King is not to be truſted without being looked after." I think no man ſhould be truſted with uncontrouled power during life.—No, not even a ſelf-denying, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Republican. "Or that a thirſt of abſolute power is the natural diſeaſe of monarchy."—Not a jot more ſo than of republicaniſm. 2. That "the Commons by being appointed for that purpoſe, are either wiſer or more worthy of confidence than the King.—But as the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which gives the Commons a power to check the King, gives afterwards the King a power to check the Commons; it again ſuppoſes that the King is wiſer than thoſe, whom it has already ſuppoſed to be wiſer than him. A mere abſurdity!"</p>
            <p>There is, I confeſs, a palpable abſurdity here; but it lies in our author's ſuppoſitions concerning what the conſtitution ſuppoſes; not in the mutual check which the King and Commons have upon each other. Is it not highly abſurd to ſuppoſe, that a man, becauſe he has a conſtitutional check upon others, muſt therefore be wiſer than thoſe others? A common conſtable has, in many caſes,

            <head type="sub">Of Monarchy and hereditary Succeſſion.</head>
            <p>COME we now to our author's obſervations on "Monarchy and hereditary Succeſſion." The laſt of theſe I ſhall ſay little about, for the following reaſons. I have humility enough to think, that thoſe illuſtrious patriots who ſettled the ſucceſſion of the crown of England in the Houſe of Hanover, ſoon after the revolution, knew full as much of the matter as I do,—or as even our author knows. What they did in this reſpect, I believe was right, and therefore acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in it. Few, I imagine, will diſſent from my opinion on this head, notwithſtanding this author's objections. In the next place, the crudities here offered concerning hereditary ſucceſſion, are not new, but borrowed from other writers.—Moſt of them may be found in a ſmall treatiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">

But it will be proper to beſtow a few minutes in examining what is here alledged concerning mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in general; againſt which this republican marſhals a formidable hoſt of arguments. The reader will remember, that monarchy may be either abſolute; or mixed and combined with the other ſimple forms of government. Our author makes no diſtinction between theſe; and altho' all he ſays, and a thouſand times more that might be ſaid, were true with reſpect to the former; yet all this would not militate in the leaſt againſt the mild and tempered monarchy of Great-Britain. Let us, however, attend his arguments.</p>
            <p>"In the early ages of the world, according to ſcripture chronology, there were no kings; the conſequence of which was, there were no wars; it is the pride of kings which throws mankind into confuſion. Holland without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this laſt century, than any of the monarchical governments in Europe." It were needleſs, at preſent, to determine how early kings began to reign; eſpecially as we find by ſcripture chronology and ſcripture hiſtory, that there was murder, violence and war,—that "the earth was filled with violence"—long enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we hear a ſyllable about kings,—I may ſay, before there were any. Referring thoſe diſorders, therefore, to that origin, is unfair and untrue. Melchezidec is one of the firſt kings we read of; he lived in the times of patriarchal ſimplicity, and his character is reſpectable, being nor only a king, but alſo "the prieſt of the moſt high God." This account of kings is very different from our author's.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:043050_0027_101CAEF6D0A50C20"/>
The inſtance of Holland is injudiciouſly ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to ſhew that ſtates which have no kings, are therefore exempt from war. There has not been a general war in Europe for a century paſt, in which Holland was not deeply engaged; except the very laſt, and this was more owing to inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than any other cauſe. Every page almoſt of the hiſtory of the <hi>Seven United Provinces,</hi> is a refutation of our author's aſſertion. His inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that ſtates which have not Kings, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from, and not addicted to war, is equally groundleſs. Republics have been as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in wars as other ſtates. The ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics of Greece, inliſted under the banners of Sparta, on one ſide, or thoſe of Athens, on the other—both republics, waged a moſt bloody war for thirty years together. And what is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they were plunged into this war by Pericles, a very popular Athenian, and celebrated ſpeaker; who, being impeached for embezzling the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money, and applying it to his own private uſe, took this terrible method to divert an enquiry. The war ended in the deſtruction of Athens. The ſingle republic of Rome, made greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of the human ſpecies, ſhed more blood, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed more wretchedneſs and miſery thro' the earth, and was guilty of more cruelty, oppreſſion and tyranny, than perhaps any three monarchies that can be mentioned in the whole compaſs of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory. If a few ſmall republics of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern date, have more reſpite from war than ſome monarchies; it is more owing, like their very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtance, to their particular ſituations, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of neighbouring powers, and other ſimilar circumſtances, than to the nature of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

"Government by Kings," this writer tells us, "was firſt introduced by Heathens." And ſo, ſaw I, was Greek and Latin—ſo was ſmoaking tobacco; and yet I can read Homer and Virgil, or enjoy my pipe, with great compoſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The firſt hint of bleeding, in caſes of ſickneſs, is ſaid to have been taken from the cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile—of adminiſtring clyſters, from the ibis, an Egyptian bird. Theſe ſeem to be of worſe than heathen origin; yet mankind uſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcruple; and perhaps their diſcipline might not be amiſs for our author, conſidering his ſtate of mind. If a thing is good in itſelf, I conceive it to be a matter of very little moment, who it was that firſt introduced it. I am clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion alſo, that democracy, our author's favourite ſcheme of government, was of heatheniſh origin, as well as monarchy: And ſince he is ſo averſe to any thing heatheniſh, I would beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind him, that falſhood, deceit, and ſpeaking evil of dignities, are heatheniſh crimes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly forbidden by ſcripture.</p>
            <p>But the worſt is yet to come; for "govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Kings, was the moſt proſperous invention the devil ever ſet on foot for the promotion of idolatry. The heathens paid divine honours to their deceaſed Kings." If he was the author of this invention, for the purpoſe here alledged, then I aver the devil was miſtaken in his forecaſt; or elſe he ſoon retained all the Heathen republics in his ſervice, to promote the ſame end. For it is a moſt notorious, undeniable fact, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient republics—Rome, Carthage, Athens, &amp;c. were as infamous for every ſpecies of the groſſeſt and moſt abominable idolatry, as any monarchies
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:043050_0029_101CAEFA607F61B8"/>
whatever. Let the Floralia of Rome, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſacrifices offered at Carthage, to mention no other inſtances, ſerve as proofs of this. The truth is, that idolatry had ſpread its gloomy reign almoſt univerſally over the Heathen world. The form of government in any ſtate, neither promoted nor retarded it any more than the ſhape of their ſhields, or the form of their whiſkers. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſyſtem of religion, that Heathen antiquity can boaſt of, prevailed in Perſia, where monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy was eſtabliſhed; the remains of which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are ſaid to be preſerved to this day among the Gentoos of Indoſtan.</p>
            <p>But "Heathens paid divine honours to their deceaſed kings." The more fools they, no doubt; however, they did the ſame to their deceaſed he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, and benefactors in general, whether kings or not, whether male or female. If this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore, is of any force againſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by kings, it is of equal force againſt any improvement in agriculture; againſt cleaning ſtables, and killing ſnakes; for Heathens paid divine honours to deceaſed perſons for all thoſe exploits. It is ſcarcely poſſible to return a grave anſwer to ſuch ſophiſtry; eſpecially, when the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor may, perhaps, care as little for the bible, as he does for the alcoran or ſhaſtah, only as it may ſerve his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>From Heatheniſm, our author flies next to ſcripture for arguments againſt monarchy. Were I a parſon, I ſhould be better qualified to deal with him in this way. However, as I am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere believer in divine revelation, I ſometime read the ſcripture for inſtruction—nor am I aſhamed to own it—Boyle, Locke, and Newton, did the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:043050_0030_101CAF02C8B92F50"/>
ſame. I alſo have recourſe ſometimes to a few commentators, which the clergyman of the place where I live, hath recommended to me. Thus furniſhed, I ſhall venture to examine his ſcripture arguments. One conſolation to me is, that he ſeems to be an equal adept in theology and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence.</p>
            <p>"The will of the Almighty, as declared by Gideon and Samuel," ſays our republican, "ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly diſapproves of government by kings." So it might on thoſe particular occaſions, and for ſome peculiar reaſons; and yet our government by kings at this time, may be as acceptable to the Almighty, as any other government. "All anti-monarchical parts of ſcripture," he continues, "have been ſmoothly gloſſed over in monarchical governments." If ſo, our author has profited by the practice, and has greatly improved on it; for he has entirely ſlipt over, (without giving even a ſmooth gloſs) all the monarchical parts of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, except one, which I ſhall immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, after aſſuring the reader, that I never have met with the anti-monarchical parts of ſcripture. In the bible, I am ſure they are not. The Jewiſh polity, in which the Almighty himſelf conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to be king, (and thence called a Theocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) is rather in favour of monarchy than againſt it; tho' I am not clear, that any one ſpecies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular government is more acceptable to the deity now than another; whatever preference may be due to one above another, in point of expediency and benefit.</p>
            <p>"Render unto Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's, is the ſcripture doctrine of courts," ſays our author; and pray is it not ſcripture doctrine
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:043050_0031_101CAF0618852D08"/>
in other places, as well as courts? Is it not the doctrine of Him who is the Saviour of men? The words are part of an anſwer which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour returned to an inſidious queſtion that was propoſed to him by ſome emiſſaries from the Phariſees, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether it was lawful to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to Caeſar, i. e. the Roman Emperor, or not? Judaea was at this time ſubject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. The G<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ulonites, or Zealots, a ſect or party ſo called, affirmed that the Jews, being God's people, ſhould not acknowledge any other Lord, nor pay tribute to an heathen power—others affirmed the contrary—the determination was therefore put to Jeſus, with deſign to enſnare him. His deciſion, which was for paying the tribute, was grounded on the then practice and eſtabliſhed maxims of the Jews. They held, that wherever the money of any perſon, bearing his title and image, was current, the inhabitants thereby acknowledged that perſon for their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign. Since, therefore, the Jews owned this of Caeſar, by admitting his money, which bore his title and image, our Saviour told them, they ſhould alſo pay him tribute. For he ordered the tribute money to be brought, and the Jews own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it bore Caeſar's image and ſuperſcription, or title,—"Render therefore, (ſays he) to Caeſar, the things that are Caeſar's," i. e. Since you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his ſovereignty over you by admitting his coin, render to him the tribute which, on your own principles, is thereby due.</p>
            <p>If this text has been applied to ſupport mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical government any further than to ſhew, that we—ever is by cuſtom, law or otherwiſe juſtly due to ſovereigns, ſhould be punctually paid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:043050_0032_101CAF07D9BAB738"/>
it be tribute, obedience, honour, &amp;c.—if, I ſay, it has been applied to ſupport monarchy any further than this, it muſt be by ſome perſon who underſtood it as little as our author; though not for the reaſon he aſſigns, and which in truth makes againſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>But I haſten to the paſſages of ſcripture, in which our republican author triumphs moſt; which, he ſays, "are direct and poſitive, and admit of no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal conſtruction. That the Almighty has in them entered his proteſt againſt monarchical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is true, or elſe the ſcripture is falſe." On the contrary, I aver, that the Almighty has not there entered his proteſt againſt monarchical government, further than the Jews had departed from a former permiſſion he had given them to chuſe kings, and that the ſcripture is not falſe. Let us now ſee how a little common ſenſe, reaſon and truth will help to clear up the matter.</p>
            <p>The paſſages alluded to by the author, are in 1 Sam. viii. where the Iſraelites aſſembled in a tumultuous manner, and deſired Samuel to make them "a king, to judge them like all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;" which offended Samuel, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was diſpleaſing to the Almighty. That ſimply deſiring a king, could not be a crime, is undeniably evident; becauſe the Almighty had long before expreſſly permitted it, had directed the mode of chuſing a king, and preſcribed the line of conduct the king ſhould obſerve, when choſen. This is done in Deuteronomy xvii. 14—20; and I ſhall here lay a few of the paſſages before the reader.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When thou art come into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee, and ſhalt ſay,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:043050_0033_101CAF0B1C113610"/>
I will ſet a king over me like as all the nations that are round about me: thou ſhalt in any wiſe ſet him king over thee whom the Lord thy God ſhall chuſe: one from among thy brethren ſhalt thou ſet king over thee: thou mayeſt not ſet a ſtranger over thee which is not thy brother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Almighty then proceeds to give directions for the king's conduct, thus choſen; all wiſely ſuited to the Jewiſh ſtate, both in a religious and political view. The king "was not to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply horſes;" to prevent any intercourſe with Egypt, which ſupplied other nations with horſes; and beſides, cavalry was not ſuited to the hilly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Judaea. The king was "not to multiply wives, that his heart turn not away;" as happened to Solomon when he diſobeyed this precept: Nor "greatly multiply gold and ſilver to himſelf," which would introduce luxury and diſſolution of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The directions go on—<q>And it ſhall be when he, i. e. the king, fitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he ſhall write a copy of this law in a book, and it ſhall be with him, and he ſhall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, to keep all the words of this law, and theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes to do them: that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aſide from the commandment—to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom; he and his children in the midſt of Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now after this, I leave the reader to judge, whether government by kings could be diſpleaſing to the Almighty; or whether deſiring a king,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:043050_0034_101CAF1058941D40"/>
according to this permiſſion and theſe directions could be a crime in the Iſraelites. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that either can be true. The crime of theſe people, therefore, when they deſired a king of Samuel, "to judge them like all the nations," muſt be attributed to ſomething elſe. And upon examination, we ſhall find, that their error lay in the manner of their aſking a king—in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which they acted—in a diſregard of the venerable old prophet—but chiefly in a neglect of the directions above mentioned. This will appear evident from a bare recital of facts.</p>
            <p>Samuel, by his faithful adminiſtration, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the purity of religion, and reſcued the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the hoſtile attempts of their enemies. Debauched by proſperity, as too frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, dazzled with the luſtre of a ſplendid court, and deſirous of its pomp, the people tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſembled to deſire a king, who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the deſpotic kings which ſurrounded them. They covered their real deſign with the pretext of Samuel's age and infirmities, and his ſons irregularities, which was inſulting the prophet's misfortunes. This is evidently implied in their own words, and in the ſequel.</p>

that they have rejected. Although Samuel was ungratefully treated; yet they ſtill more wickedly neglected the directions given by the Almighty. Pride and ambition, ſtimulated them to ſeek a king, not ſuch as the Almighty had directed them to chuſe; but ſuch as the nations had; and ſuch as would overturn the theocracy. This was virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rejecting the Almighty from being their king.</p>
            <p>Samuel, however, was directed to hearken to the people; but at the ſame time to lay alſo before them, the nature of that monarchy they deſired, a monarchy like thoſe around them. The eaſtern nations, it is well known, were under deſpotic monarchs, the manner or nature of which Samuel accordingly deſcribes to the Iſraelites, to try whether they would perſiſt in their choice after hearing it. Kings of this ſort would <q>take their ſons and appoint them for himſelf, for his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, and to be his horſemen—he would take their daughters to be confectioners, and to be cooks, and to be bakers, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>

            <p>This whole paſſage is a deſcription of the eaſtern deſpotic monarchs, which Samuel held up to the Iſraelites, with deſign to deter them from chuſing ſuch; and this is the paſſage which our author ſets down, enriched with his own moſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Ambition and pride, however, got the better of duty and intereſt with the people—a caſe that happens but too frequently. They ſtill inſiſted on having the king they had ſet their hearts on—<q>That we alſo, ſay they, may be like other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</q> Hereby ſhewng the greateſt blindneſs to their own happineſs, which conſiſted in being unlike the other nations, by having God himſelf for their king; and ſuch a judge or king as would be his DEPUTY, not an abſolute prince. The Almighty at laſt condeſcended to their infirmities, and gave them a king; but as in the caſe of the ritual law, he tempered his juſtice with his mercy. He gave them Saul, who proved a ſcourge; yet he ordered matters ſo that the general end of his diſpenſation to the Jews was not defeated. Saul's ſucceſſor, was "a man after his own heart," by a zealous attachment to, and punctual execution of, the Moſaic law; and David again, in our author's phraſe, "to the evil of monarchy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that of hereditary ſucceſſion;" which it ſeems, however, the Almighty did not diſapprove of.</p>
            <p>The reader is now left to determine freely, whether theſe paſſages make in the leaſt againſt government by kings; and whether this republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can's perverſion of them, either thro' real or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance, ſhould have any weight to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence us againſt our ſovereign. For my part, I think the caſe ſo plain, that I ſhall not beſtow another word upon it; only to add the following reflections of a learned writer on the above tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action. <q>The ſecret ſpring of the people's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, (ſays he) was the ambition of their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who could live no longer without the ſplendor of a regal court—where every one of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:043050_0037_101CAF1855887380"/>
them might ſhine a diſtinguiſhed officer of ſtate. This it was that made their demand criminal; for the chuſing regal, rather than ariſtocratical, vice-roys, was a thing plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to them by the law of Moſes, Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy xvii. As therefore ambition only was in the view of the ringleaders, and no fooliſh fears for the ſtate, or hopes of bettering the public adminiſtration, it is evident to all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the genius of this time and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that compliance with their demand muſt have ended in the utter deſtruction of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic religion, as well as law.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus ambition ſet the Iſraelites on deſiring a King; our republican author ſhould reflect, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſame principle does not actuate and lead him to reject his lawful ſovereign.</p>
            <p>The author of Common Senſe, ſuſpects, "there is as much king-craft as prieſt-craft, in with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcripture from the public in Popiſh countries. For monarchy is the Popery of government." But is it not ſtrange that he himſelf ſhould be guilty of the very crime he here charges upon others? Yet he does this by with-holding from the reader every text that would develope the falſhood of his own beloved ſcheme. This I think may be called Republican-craft; and let it hereafter be added to the two ſpecies of craft above mentioned. A man of candour would deal fairly, and give both ſides of the queſtion. Had there been another text in the bible that could be preſſed into his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beſides what he has quoted, we may be ſure he would have produced it, with his own enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened comments. With his good leave, therefore, I ſhall now ſet down a few texts, which probably
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:043050_0038_101CAF1D94177A78"/>
he may call the "ſcripture doctrine of monarchy;" but which are the words of inſpired truth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. I aſſure the reader further, that I am none of your "paſſive-obedience and non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance men." The principles on which the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous revolution in 1688 was brought about, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the articles of my political creed; and were it neceſſary, I could clearly evince, that theſe are perfectly conformable to the doctrines of ſcripture. To proceed then, like a parſon, with my texts; referring in the margin, to the places in which they are contained, that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may conſult them at his leiſure.</p>
            <p>"Deſtroy him not," ſays David to Abiſhai, when about to kill Saul, who was entirely in their power. <q>Deſtroy him not; for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's anointed, and be guiltleſs<note n="a" place="bottom">1 Sam. xxvi. 9.</note>?

            <p>All theſe texts, beſides many others of the ſame kind, I find in my bible. I muſt therefore renounce my bible, if I believe this republican. But I would not renounce the bible, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the words of eternal life, for any earthly conſideration—no, not if this Gentleman were to aſſure me of being made Perpetual Dictator, or Stadtholder of his new republic. I have taken the trouble to tranſcribe the above texts, however unuſual the employment, merely to lay the plain truth, the genuine teſtimony of ſcripture on this point, before ſuch as might not be at the pains of examining it themſelves; and might therefore be miſſed by our author. I confeſs, I felt both aſtoniſhment and indignation at his abuſe of ſacred writ. Had his principles, reſpecting monarchy, been good, had truth been their baſis, certainly, this had not been neceſſary.

            <head>ANSWER TO SECTION III.</head>
            <head type="sub">Thoughts on the preſent State of American Affairs.</head>
            <p>IF the perſon who was capable of ſo vile a proſtitution of ſcripture, as we have ſeen in the preceding ſection, ſhould equally proſtitute the words, reaſon, argument, common ſenſe, in this, it is not to be wondered at. That this is the caſe, will appear by a near examination. From the author's deſultory way of writing, and want of method in delivering his thoughts, it is not eaſy to follow him,—however, I muſt do as well as I can.</p>
            <p>In this ſection before me, this Gentleman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds his grand ſcheme of a revolt from the crown of England, and ſetting up an independent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public in America. He leaves no method un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried, which the moſt experienced practioner in the art of deceiving could invent, to perſuade any people to a meaſure which was againſt their inclinations and intereſt, that was both diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and deſtructive. He unſays in one place what he had ſaid in another, if it happens to ſerve the preſent purpoſe; he cants and whines; he tries wit, raillery and declamation by turns. But his main attack is upon the paſſions of his readers, eſpecially their pity and reſentment,—the latter of which is too apt to be predominant in mankind. As for himſelf, he ſeems to be every where tranſported with rage—a rage that knows no limits, and hurries him along, like an
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:043050_0042_101CAF296F8FA8C0"/>
impetuous torrent. Every thing that falls not in with his own ſcheme, or that he happens to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, is repreſented in the moſt aggravated light, and with the moſt diſtorted features. Such a malignant ſpirit I have ſeldom met with in any compoſition. As often as I look into this ſection, I cannot forbear imaging to myſelf a guilty culprit, freſh reeking from the laſhes of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant juſtice, and raging againſt the hand that inflicted them. Yet I cannot perſuade myſelf, that ſuch fire and fury are genuine marks of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm. On the contrary, they rather indicate that ſome mortifying diſappointment is rankling at heart; that ſome tempting object of ambition is in view; or probably both. I always adopt the amiable Biſhop Berkeley's maxim in ſuch caſes,—<q>I ſee a man rage, rail and rave; I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his patriotiſm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe obſervations are juſtified by the author's own words, I ſhall now proceed to evince; and I doubt not but the candid reader will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what I ſay in the ſenſe it is meant—as directed againſt this republican's ruinous ſcheme of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency. This, and this only, is what I combat. My moſt ardent wiſh—next to future happineſs—is, to ſee tranquillity reſtored to America—our liberties, property and trade ſettled on a firm, generous, and conſtitutional plan, ſo that neither of the former ſhould be invaded, nor the latter impoliticly or unjuſtly reſtrained; that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this, a perfect reconciliation with Great-Britain were effected, an union formed, by which both countries, ſupporting and ſupported by each other, might riſe to eminence and glory, and be the admiration of mankind till time ſhall
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:043050_0043_101CAF2CD79B6178"/>
be no more. In ſuch a plan, the real intereſt of America is indubitably to be ſought; and could my influence avail, there would not be a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice in the colonies—all would unite as one man, and uſe every effort, to have ſuch a plan ſpeedily ſettled.</p>
            <p>The author of Common Senſe ſays, "He has no other preliminaries to ſettle with the reader, than that he would diveſt himſelf of prejudice and prepoſſeſſion, and ſuffer his reaſon and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to determine for themſelves." I have no objection to theſe preliminaries. They are ſuch as I myſelf would chuſe to ſettle with the reader; provided his feelings are not thoſe of rage and reſentment, which are exceedingly improper to determine in matters of ſuch moment. It is not improbable indeed, that every republican who is as prejudiced, intereſted, and vindictive as himſelf, will agree with him in all his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies; and ſo perhaps they would, though an angel from Heaven were to aſſure them that they are wrong. But I am confident the readers of that ſtamp make but a very ſmall number at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in America.</p>
            <p>After obſerving, that "many writers have embarked in the preſent controverſy, with various deſigns," he ſays, "they have all been ineffectual, and the period of debate is cloſed. Arms, as the laſt reſource, decide the conteſt; the appeal was the choice of the King, and the continent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the challenge." That an appeal was made by the King to arms for the deciſion of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy conteſt, on the 19th of April, the period our author fixes, is a matter in which I am not quite clear; but more of this preſently. If ſuch
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:043050_0044_101CAF300BDC2200"/>
a challenge was accepted by the Americans, I am ſure it was with great reluctance. They deſired it not; although this writer, by his manner of expreſſion, inſinuates they did. But be theſe matters as they will, certain it is, that the period of debate did not then cloſe. The challenge was not accepted ſo as to exclude an amicable accommodation. Since that time, the Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Continental Congreſs petitioned the King, and tranſmitted addreſſes to the inhabitants of Great-Britain and Ireland, to facilitate a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Nor can I conceive it poſſible, that any one, unleſs ſome ſanguinary wretch, who hopes to profit by our confuſions, ſhould wiſh to ſee the conteſt finally decided by arms.</p>
            <p>"By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera of politics is ſtruck—all plans, propoſals, &amp;c. prior to the 19th of April—are like the almanacks of laſt year; which, tho' proper then, are ſuperceded and uſeleſs now." I ſhall not undertake to decide on the value of old almanacks, as I am not an almanack-maker—the author may know more of the matter. But he here takes for granted what ſhould have been proved, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that the matter or conteſt was ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately referred from argument to arms. If the ſenſe of our Congreſs, and of the inhabitants of this continent at large, is any rule to judge by, all plans and propoſals, even thoſe prior to the 19th of April, are not uſeleſs. A free people, who have a juſt ſenſe of their rights and liberties, are very juſtifiable in ſhewing they will not tamely give them up without a ſtruggle. But no people, except ſome tribes of ſavages, who aim at the total extermination of their enemies, will ever
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:043050_0045_101CAF37586F6EA0"/>
loſe ſight of argument and negociation, to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſuch diſputes. To inſinuate the contrary of the Americans, is at once doing them the greateſt injuſtice, and offering them the greateſt inſult. No people under Heaven are leſs ſanguinary, or deſerve ſuch a character leſs.</p>
            <p>Our author repeats the ſame ſentiment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. "No man," ſays he, "was a warmer wiſher for reconciliation than myſelf, before the fatal 19th of April, 1775; but the moment the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened, ſullen tempered Pharaoh of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for ever; and diſdain the wretch, that with the pretended title of father of his people, can unfeelingly hear of their ſlaughter, and compoſedly ſleep with their blood upon his ſoul." This is the man, gentle reader, who declares, "he is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by motives of pride, party or reſentment, to eſpouſe the doctrine of ſeparation and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;" no, no; and if you will take his own word for it, he is by no means for "inflaming or exaggerating matters!" The reader muſt be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that a perſon who can thus ſet truth and decency at defiance, and is regardleſs of even the appearance of conſiſtency, has a great advantage over his antagoniſt.</p>
            <p>The affair of April 19, 1775, alluded to here, is the expedition to Lexington, and ſkirmiſh that enſued—a moſt raſh, ill-judged expedition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly. It was riſquing the lives of innocent and brave men on both ſides, as well as the peace of this whole continent, for no other object than deſtroying a few barrels of flour! Our author has my leave to load that expedition, with all the reproaches he can invent. I diſapprove of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:043050_0046_101CAF38E90FE6E0"/>
it as much as he—I lament its effects much more. But why is the king charged with it, or blamed for it? Did he order that expedition? No—he knew nothing of it—he gave no orders, general or particular, for it. So far from this, that I have been repeatedly aſſured from the very beſt authority, that his orders to all his commanders or generals on this continent were, to act only on the defenſive—and to avoid ſhedding the blood of his ſubjects. Now, after giving ſuch reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orders, how the blood of thoſe who were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the diſtance of three thouſand miles from him, could be "on his ſoul," is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable. Nor do I believe that he "unfeelingly heard of their ſlaughter." The King's real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is juſt the reverſe of what is here falſly and maliciouſly held up to view. I was aſſured lately in England, by thoſe who knew him well, that his temper is compaſſionate and humane,—his moral character unblemiſhed, and in religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary. If this republican, therefore, rejected his Sovereign on account of the Lexington affair, it was only becauſe he had little or no attachment to him. This accident could only be ſeized to give vent to diſaffection which ſlumbered before; for an accident it certainly was. To accuſe even a private man falſly, and lay guilt to his charge, of which he is innocent, is highly criminal; to do ſo to an ordinary magiſtrate, is ſtill more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocious: But to revile one's Sovereign thus falſly, to poiſon the minds of his ſubjects, and ſow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection among them, which may be productive of general miſery, is a crime of ſuch complicated guilt, that none but men of the moſt abandoned profligate hearts, are capable of committing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:043050_0047_101CAF3AD1B1A9C0"/>
After all, it is impoſſible to aſſign any good reaſon, why a reconciliation with Great-Britain, which was ſo proper before the Lexington affair, ſhould be ſo improper afterwards. Our author, indeed, in his uſual way, dogmatically aſſerts it; but his aſſertions will not paſs for proofs. If peace and reconciliation on conſtitutional grounds, and proper ſecurity for our ſeveral rights, was deſirable and advantageous before the 19th of April, muſt they not have been equally ſo after the event of that unfortunate day? Let reaſon and common ſenſe anſwer.</p>
            <p>"But as ſo much has been ſaid of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of reconciliation," continues our author, "it is but right that we ſhould examine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide of the argument, and inquire into the material injuries which the colonies ſuſtain, and always will ſuſtain by being connected with Great-Britain." He alledges, indeed, ſeveral evils which he ſuppoſes would attend that connection; but cautiouſly avoids any mention of the numberleſs evils and calamities which we muſt infallibly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by breaking it off. As in a former caſe, ſo in this alſo, I ſhall endeavour to ſupply his omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in due time.</p>
            <p>"Some have aſſerted," he tells us, "that as America hath flouriſhed under her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Great-Britain, that the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection is neceſſary towards her future happineſs. Nothing can be more fallacious." He adds,—"We may as well aſſert, that becauſe a child hath thrived upon milk, that it is never to have meat." However glib this quaint ſimile may run upon paper; however convincing it may appear to ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low readers; yet, in truth, when examined, it
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:043050_0048_101CAF3E74E60DA0"/>
contains a palpable impropriety, and is imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the caſe before us. Great-Britain is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively called the parent ſtate of the colonies; their connection, therefore, may be properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the relation ſubſiſting between parent and child. But to compare our connection with Great-Britain to the literal food of a child, a thing different from, and not neceſſarily belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that relation, is manifeſtly abſurd, and a violation of the propriety of language; as all who are judges of the nature of language muſt be ſenſible. The relation of parent and child ends not, when the latter has arrived to maturity, although the uſe of milk may be laid aſide; and that relation may be ſtill neceſſary to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of both; the ſame may be truly affirmed of our connection with Great-Britain. But if we muſt ſtretch the ſimile further, and find ſomething analogous to the literal food of a child, it is the literal ſupport afforded by Great-Britain to the colonies, in their infant ſtate formerly; and the adminiſtration of the colonies now, as well as the general laws of regulation ſhe may make for us. As to any ſupport now, in the above ſenſe, it is confeſſed the colonies do not require it. With reſpect to the adminiſtration of the colonies, and regulating laws proper for them, theſe ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be varied, and adapted to our maturer ſtate. The want of this is the true ſource of our preſent calamities; and the attainment of it, by a reconciliation and conſtitutional union with Great-Britain, is what every honeſt American ſhould earneſtly wiſh for. But the remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by our author, would reſemble the conduct of a raſh, froward ſtripling, who ſhould call his
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:043050_0049_101CAF43D27E6BB8"/>
mother a d-mn-d b—ch, ſwear he had no relation to her, and attempted to knock her down.</p>
            <p>"But even this," ſubjoins our author, "is admitting more than is true; for I anſwer, round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that America, would have flouriſhed as much, and probably much more had no European power taken any notice of her. The commerce by which ſhe hath enriched herſelf, are the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of life, and will always have a market while eating is the cuſtom of Europe." If no Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean power had taken any notice of America, that is to ſay, if none had been at the expence or trouble of diſcovering it, and ſettling colonies in it; there is great probability that America had not flouriſhed, but remained to this day as ſavage a wilderneſs as when Columbus or Cabbot firſt deſcried its coaſts.—But to paſs over this blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Let the reader only turn to any hiſtory of the ſettlement of the Britiſh colonies, and then judge what had been the condition of Virginia, the firſt colony, and latterly of Georgia and Nova-Scotia, if Great-Britain had not ſupported them. They muſt as infallibly have periſhed, as an infant without its proper food, had not Great-Britain afforded her aid and ſupport; which have been more or leſs extended to all the colonies. Even after they had ſurmounted their firſt difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, what had been their fate, had not Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain protected them? It ſo happens, that ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, ambition and fighting, are cuſtoms of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope as well as eating. This being the caſe, ſome other European power would indubitably have ſeized all theſe colonies, in their infant ſtate, had not Great-Britain held out her protection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:043050_0050_101CAF455FF32B30"/>
And here much matter of grief is preſented to this poor Gentleman. He pathetically laments, that—"Alas! we have been long led away by ancient prejudices, and made large ſacrifices to ſuperſtition"—by "not conſidering that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Great-Britain In protecting us, was intereſt, not attachment;" and then he ſpins out a tedious, affected ſentence of her "not protecting us from our enemies on our account, but from her enemies on her own account," &amp;c. Suppoſing this were true, where is the harm? Great-Britain actually did protect us; and it is a matter of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, what her motives were. If ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived benefit by it, ſo much the better. Mutual intereſt is the ſtrongeſt bond of union between ſtates, as the hiſtory of mankind teſtifies; and certainly that nation would act a moſt abſurd, as well as wicked part, which laviſhed away its blood and treaſure, without any proſpect of national ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in return. But I firmly believe, that his aſſertions on this head are as falſe, as they are ungenerous; and that Great-Britain, in protecting us, was actuated by motives of affection and attachment, as well as intereſt. The whole of her conduct to the colonies, till lately, evinces it—the Americans themſelves have acknowledged it. Great-Britain, no doubt, derived many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages from the colonies; but ſhould we underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue her protection on that account, or aſcribe it to ſordid motives only? It is every man's intereſt as well as duty to be honeſt; would it, therefore, be candid, generous or true, to ſuppoſe, that every honeſt man is actuated by ſelfiſhneſs only?—But candour and truth are things that have nothing to do with the procedure of this dark republican,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:043050_0051_101CAF48CFADFA20"/>
who aims at utterly effacing every trace of former affection and friendſhip between Great-Britain and the colonies; and, like a fiend that delighted in human miſery, would arm them with the moſt deadly, irreconcilable hatred againſt each other.</p>
            <p>But he denies that Britain is the parent country or thoſe colonies. He "reprobates the phraſe, as being falſe, ſelfiſh, narrow and ungenerous.—Europe, (ſays he) and not England, is the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent country of the colonies." It is an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Epictetus, <q>That if a man will contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the moſt evident truths, it will not be eaſy to find arguments wherewith to confute him—that the diſpoſition to contradict ſuch truths, proceeds from want of candour and modeſty.</q> He moreover adds,—that when ſom adventruous ſpirits in his time undertook to deny the plaineſt and moſt evident truths—<q>This denial was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by the vulgar for ſtrength of wit and great learning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever circumſtances can denominate any country to be the parent ſtate or country of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, may be truly predicated of Britain, with reſpect to theſe American colonies. They were diſcovered at the expence of the Britiſh crown—firſt ſettled by Britiſh emigrants, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments erected here were formed on the model of the Britiſh government, as nearly as the ſtate of things would admit. The coloniſts were deemed Britiſh ſubjects, and intitled to all the privileges of Engliſhmen. They were ſupported and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected at the expence of Britiſh blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Emigrants, it is true, reſorted here from other countries in great numbers; but theſe were not intitled to the privileges of Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:043050_0052_101CAF4E64EC9748"/>
till naturalized by an act of the Britiſh le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, or ſome Aſſembly here; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious confluence of ſtrangers into the colonies, is a proof of the mild and liberal ſpirit by which they were cheriſhed and adminiſtered. If theſe particulars do not intitle Britain to the appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mother country, to theſe colonies, I know not what can; and theſe particulars cannot be predicated of any other country in Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Britain.</p>
            <p>The author tells us, however—"that the phraſe parent or mother country, hath been jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itically adopted by the king and his paraſites, with a low papiſtical deſign of gaining an unfair bias on the credulous weakneſs of our minds." I conceive the preſent king, or his paraſites, as he calls them, were not the firſt or only perſons who adopted this phraſe; and therefore it could not anſwer ſuch a deſign. The phraſe hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been uſed, both here, and in Britain, ſince the firſt ſettlement of the colonies.</p>
            <p>But this curious obſervation was introduced purely to inſinuate that the king is a papiſt; which hath juſt as much truth in it as to inſinuate that he is a Mahometan or Gentoo; for there is not a firmer Proteſtant in Great-Britain, than his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Majeſty. The inſinuation might have ſome effect on the credulous weakneſs of ſome ignorant people, who have harboured ſuch an opinion; and I have heard the Quebec bill, alledged as a proof of it, by which, they ſaid, popery was eſtabliſhed in Canada, and the king had violated his coronation oath.</p>
            <p>An examination of the Quebec bill, falls not within the compaſs of my deſign. It has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:043050_0053_101CAF4FF44B2D30"/>
the ſcrutiny of much abler hands; ſome of which have affirmed, and others denied, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was thereby eſtabliſhed. I diſlike the bill, chiefly becauſe it veſts the governor and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with exorbitant power. It is certain, however, that the popiſh clergy of Canada, complain of the bill, and think themſelves in a worſe ſituation by it, than the articles of capitulation and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render left them. Be all this as it may, it is paſt any doubt, that the king did not in the leaſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his coronation oath by aſſenting to that bill. This will evidently appear by inſpecting the oath itſelf; and as the removal of mutual prejudices to faciliate a reconciliation, is my principal view; as the oath is ſhort, and has been ſeen by few, I ſhall here inſert it. The coronation oath is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered by one of the archbiſhops or biſhops, in the following words and manner—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop ſhall ſay,</hi> Will you ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and ſwear, to govern the people of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of England, and the dominions thereunto belonging, according to the ſtatutes in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreed on, and the laws and cuſtoms of the ſame? <hi>The king ſhall ſay,</hi> I ſolemnly promiſe ſo to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop.</hi> Will you, to your power, cauſe law and juſtice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments? <hi>King.</hi> I will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The archbiſhop.</hi> Will you, to the utmoſt of your power, maintain the laws of God; the true profeſſion of the goſpel, and the proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion, eſtabliſhed by law? And will you preſerve unto the biſhops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to their charge, all ſuch rights and privileges, as by the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:043050_0054_101CAF536B9228D8"/>
law do or ſhall appertain unto them, or any of them? <hi>King.</hi> All this, I promiſe to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this the king laying his hand on the holy goſpels, ſhall ſay,</hi> The things which I have here before promiſed, I will perform and keep: So help me God. <hi>And then ſhall kiſs the book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the coronation oath, and mode of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering it, as preſcribed by law; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der muſt ſee that it has no more relation to the ſtate of religion in Canada, a conquered country, than to the ſtate of religion in Minorca, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered iſland, the inhabitants of which are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and enjoy as great, if not greater privileges than the Canadians.</p>
            <p>"But admitting," continues our author, "that we were all of Engliſh deſcent, what does it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to? Nothing. Britain being now an open enemy, extinguiſhes every other name and title; and to ſay that reconciliation is a duty, is truly farcical." Here the farcical argument meets me again; and what ſhall I ſay to it? I proteſt I do not underſtand it. I have ſearched for its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in vain; and have no hope of fathoming it, till the author is pleaſed to explain it. But to the point in hand. If what would promote our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and intereſt, to mention nothing elſe, be a duty, then reconciliation is our duty.</p>
            <p>He elſewhere enlarges on this head. "Bring the doctrine of reconciliation," ſays he, "to the touch-ſtone of nature, and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honour and faithfully ſerve the power that carried fire and ſword into your land!" All this, and a great deal more of the kind, can only proceed from a ſuppoſition of the author, that others are as vindictive and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:043050_0055_101CAF5528DCC508"/>
as himſelf. When ſtates go to war, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acts of hoſtility muſt neceſſarily enſue; and to think that no reconciliation ſhould afterwards take place between them, is as contrary to every dictate of humanity and religion, as to think that a private perſon ſhould never forgive a private injury, or be reconciled to him that offered it. I lament as much as any one, the blood that has been ſhed, and the devaſtation that has been made during this conteſt: But theſe have been compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſmall, if we conſider the torrents of blood that have flowed, the wide-ſpread ruin that has taken place, in the frequent deſtructive wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and Scotland; yet theſe nations are now happily united—they mutually love, honour and faithfully ſerve each other.</p>
            <p>The author refers us to the ſtate of Boſton, and paints the diſtreſſes of its inhabitants in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt colours, to ſtimulate the revenge of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, and baniſh every idea of reconciliation with Britain. I ſincerely take part in the calamities of Boſton, and other places that have ſuffered. I feel the moſt tender ſympathetic pity for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of their inhabitants. But how the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of more blood, or ſpreading equal devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on along the whole ſea coaſt of this continent—the inevitable conſequences of not liſtening to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation—how theſe, I ſay, can alleviate the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the people of Boſton, or any other ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, is what I am not able to ſee.</p>
            <p>"Much hath been ſaid," he tells us, "of the united ſtrength of Britain and the colonies; that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world: But this is a mere preſumption; the fate of war is uncertain—the next war may not
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:043050_0056_101CAF5AE1E31838"/>
turn out like the laſt." But he chants quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tune, when he would hold up the advantages of a ſeparation from Britain. In that caſe he avers—"'Tis not in the power of England, or of Europe to conquer America—nay, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent numbers are ſufficient to repel the force of the whole world!"—This is only one ſample, among a thouſand, of the duplicity and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which run through this pamphlet.</p>
            <p>After telling us what is very true, that we have no buſineſs to "ſet the world at defiance," he adds, as an inducement to ſeparate from Britain—"Our plan is commerce; and that well attended to, will ſecure us the peace and friendſhip of Europe, becauſe it is the intereſt of Europe to have America a free port. Her trade will always be a protection, and her barrenneſs of gold and ſilver will ſecure her from invaders."—Yes, yes; no doubt but if America were once to throw off her connection with Britain, the golden age would be reſtored! The Millennial ſtate would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. <q>Men would inſtantly beat their ſwords into plough-ſhears, and their ſpears into prun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hooks. Nation would not lift up ſword againſt nation, nor learn war any more.</q> Such are the happy times our author promiſes us, if America were an independent republic! But until he can give us ſome aſſurance that may be relied on, that ambition, pride, avarice, and all that dark train of paſſions which uſually attends them, will be extinguiſhed in the human breaſt, and will no more exert their baneful influence, I muſt beg leave to doubt the truth of his aſſertions—I muſt queſtion, whether we ſhall live in perpetual peace with Europe, or even with each other, after our revolt from England.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:043050_0057_101CAF5E189BAAD8"/>
The argument or reaſon he advances for it here, is contradicted by general experience and matter of fact. A flouriſhing trade naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes wealth; and for this, and other reaſons, as naturally leads to war. Carthage, Venice and Holland—all commercial republics—were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently engaged in bloody wars, in the days of their proſperity. Nor is "barrenneſs of gold and ſilver" any ſecurity againſt war or invaſions. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and fact are equally againſt this poſition. I never heard of the gold or ſilver mines of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. The Low Countries are intirely barren of both; but they are remarkable for their fertility, good paſturage, manufactures, and formerly for trade: Yet I may ſay, each field there is a field of blood, and has been the ſcene of ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful carnage. Great-Britain and France have few or no gold and ſilver mines; yet they have been theatres of bloody wars, as long as any record we have of either reaches. On the other hand, South America ſupplies half the globe with gold and ſilver; and yet, ſtrange to tell, on our author's principles, no rival power has ever contended with Spain or Portugal for the dominion of South America! No invaders have attempted to diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them!</p>
            <p>The truth is, that mines producing thoſe metals are rather injurious than beneficial to any country. They unbrace the nerves of induſtry, induce ſloth, and damp the ſpirit of commerce. Spain was one of the moſt flouriſhing, powerful monarchies in Europe, when this continent was diſcovered. Peru and Mexico then poured their immenſe treaſures into her lap, and have been doing ſo ever ſince; yet Spain ever ſince has been
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:043050_0058_101CAF65373218B0"/>
on the decline, and is dwindled, notwithſtanding her gold and ſilver, into a ſtate, I may ſay, of inſignificance. The country that abounds in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile fields and luxuriant paſturage—that produces the neceſſaries of life in abundance—that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes the various materials for induſtry and art, and the articles for an extenſive commerce; ſuch a country, though barren of gold and ſilver, is the moſt inviting to ambition, the moſt expoſed to invaſions; and ſuch a country is North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>But our author now waxes ſo exceedingly warm, and aſſumes ſo terrific an air, that I almoſt dread to approach him. "I challenge," ſays he, "the warmeſt advocate for reconciliation, to ſhew a ſingle advantage that this country can reap by being connected with Great-Britain. I repeat the challenge, not a ſingle advantage is derived."</p>
            <p>The poſitive, dogmatical manner in which this challenge is repeated, reminds me of an obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the excellent Dr. Beattic, which applies, in the preſent caſe, as exactly, as if this bluſtering challenge had given riſe to it. "In reading ſceptical books," ſays the worthy Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <q>I have often found, that the ſtrength of the author's attachment to his paradox, is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its abſurdity. If it deviates but a little from common opinion, he gives himſelf but little trouble about it; if it be inconſiſtent with univerſal belief, he condeſcends to argue the matter, and to bring what with him paſſes for a proof of it; if it be ſuch as no man ever did or could believe, he is ſtill more conceited of his proof, and calls it demonſtration; but if it is inconceivable, it is a wonder if he does
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:043050_0059_101CAF66D11323B8"/>
not take it for granted.</q> Our republican takes it for granted, that no advantage could reſult from our future connection with Great-Britain—a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox which, I think, muſt be utterly inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to every other human underſtanding. Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, however, of this conceit, he throws down his gauntlet, and offers this challenge; leaving his readers to ſtare a convenient time, and to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate, which they ſhould admire moſt—the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of taking this point for granted—or, the <hi>fortitude of face</hi> that could advance ſuch a paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</p>
            <p>I think it no difficult matter to point out many advantages which will certainly attend our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation and connection with Great-Britain, on a firm, conſtitutional plan. I ſhall ſelect a few of theſe; and that their importance may be more clearly diſcerned, I ſhall afterwards point out ſome of the evils which inevitably muſt attend our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from Britain, and declaring for indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. On each article I ſhall ſtudy brevity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a reconciliation with Britain, a period would be put to the preſent calamitous war, by which ſo many lives have been loſt, and ſo many more muſt be loſt, if it continues. This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wiſhed for. This author ſays—"The blood of the ſlain, the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of nature cries, 'Tis time to part." I think they cry juſt the reverſe. The blood of the ſlain, the weeping voice of nature cries—It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay aſide thoſe animoſities which have puſhed on Britons to ſhed the blood of Britons; it is high time that thoſe who are connected by the endearing ties of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, kindred and country, ſhould reſume their
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:043050_0060_101CAF6876639198"/>
former friendſhip, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their intereſts are inſeparably united.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a reconciliation with Great-Britain, peace—that faireſt offspring and gift of Heaven—will be reſtored. In one reſpect, peace is like health; we do not ſufficiently know its value but by its abſence. What uneaſineſs and anxiety, what evils has this ſhort interruption of peace with the parent ſtate, brought on the whole Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire! Let every man only conſult his feelings—I except my antagoniſt—and it will require no great force of rhetoric, to convince him, that a removal of thoſe evils, and a reſtoration of peace, would be a ſingular advantage and bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Agriculture, commerce and induſtry would reſume their wonted vigour. At preſent, they languiſh and droop, both here and in Britain; and muſt continue to do ſo, while this unhappy conteſt remains unſettled.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By a connection with Great-Britain, our trade would ſtill have the protection of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt naval power in the world. England has the advantage in this reſpect of every other ſtate, whether of ancient or modern times. Her inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſituation, her nurſeries for ſeamen, the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of thoſe ſeamen above any others—theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, to mention no other, combine to make her the firſt maritime power in the univerſe; ſuch exactly is the power whoſe protection we want for our commerce. To ſuppoſe, with our author, that we ſhould have no war, were we to revolt from England, is too abſurd to deſerve a confutation. I would juſt as ſoon ſet about refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reveries of ſome brain-ſick enthuſiaſt.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:043050_0061_101CAF6C054BF8E8"/>
Paſt experience ſhews that Britain is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our commerce, and our coaſts; and we have no reaſon to doubt of her being able to do ſo for the future.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The protection of our trade, while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with Britain, will not coſt us a fiftieth part of what it muſt coſt, were we ourſelves to raiſe a naval force ſufficient for the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whilſt connected with Great-Britain, we have a bounty on almoſt every article of exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and we may be better ſupplied with goods by her, than we could elſewhere. What our author ſays is true—"That our imported goods muſt be paid for, buy them where we will;" but we may buy them dearer, and of worſe quality, in one place than another. The manufactures of Great-Britain confeſſedly ſurpaſs any in the world—particularly thoſe in every kind of metal, which we want moſt; and no country can afford linens and woolens of equal quality cheaper.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When a reconciliation is effected, and things return into the old channel, a few years of peace will reſtore every thing to its priſtine ſtate. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants will flow in as uſual from the different parts of Europe. Population will advance with the ſame rapid progreſs as formerly, and our lands will riſe in value.</p>
            <p>Theſe advantages are not imaginary, but real. They are ſuch as we have already experienced; and ſuch as we may derive from a connection with Great-Britain for ages to come. Each of theſe might eaſily be enlarged on, and others added to them; but I only mean to ſuggeſt a few hints to the reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:043050_0062_101CAF712E8EA3E0"/>
Let us now, if you pleaſe, take a view of the other ſide of the queſtion. Suppoſe we were to revolt from Great-Britain, declare ourſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and ſet up a republic of our own—what would the conſequences be?—I ſtand aghaſt at the proſpect—my blood runs chill when I think of the calamities, the complicated evils that muſt enſue, and may be clearly foreſeen—it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any man to foreſee them all. Our author cautiouſly avoids ſaying any thing of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that would attend a ſeparation. He does not even ſuppoſe that any inconvenience would attend it. Let us only declare ourſelves independent, break looſe from Great-Britain, and according to him, a paradiſaical ſtate will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low! But a prudent man will conſider and weigh matters well before he conſents to ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure—when on the brink of ſuch a dreadful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, he muſt neceſſarily recoil, and think of the conſequences, before he advances a ſtep for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Suppoſing then we declared for indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, what would follow?—I anſwer—</p>
            <p n="1">1. All property throughout the continent would be unhinged; the greateſt confuſion and moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent convulſions would take place. It would not be here, as it was in England at the revolution in 1688. That revolution was not brought about by any defeazance or diſannulling of the right of ſucceſſion. James, by abdicating the throne, left it vacant for the next in ſucceſſion; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his eldeſt daughter and her huſband ſtept in. Every other matter went on in the uſual, regular way; and the conſtitution, inſtead of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, was ſtrengthened. But in caſe of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, the old conſtitution would be totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:043050_0063_101CAF747B1FD188"/>
The common bond that tied us together, and by which our property was ſecured, would be ſnapt aſunder. It is not to be doubted but our Congreſs would endeavour to apply ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for thoſe evils; but with all deference to that reſpectable body, I do not apprehend that any remedy in their power would be adequate, at leaſt for ſome time. I do not chuſe to be more explicit; but I am able to ſupport my opinion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What a horrid ſituation would thouſands be reduced to, who have taken the oath of allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the king; yet contrary to their oath, as well as inclination, muſt be compelled to renounce that allegiance, or abandon all their property in America! How many thouſands more would be reduced to a ſimilar ſituation; who, altho' they took not the oath, yet would think it inconſiſtent with their duty, and a good conſcience, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their ſovereign! I dare ſay theſe will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear trifling difficulties to our author; but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may think, there are thouſands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who would ſooner loſe all they had in the world, nay, life itſelf, than thus wound their conſcience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By a declaration for independency, every avenue to an accommodation with Great-Britain would be cloſed; the ſword only could then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the quarrel; and the ſword would not be ſheathed till one had conquered the other. The importance of theſe colonies to Britain need not be enlarged on, it is a thing ſo univerſally known. The greater their importance is to her, ſo much the more obſtinate will her ſtruggle be, not to loſe them. The independency of America would, in the end, deprive her of the Weſt-Indies, ſhake
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:043050_0064_101CAF76AE3D8640"/>
her empire to the foundation, and reduce her to a ſtate of the moſt mortifying inſignificance. Great-Britain therefore muſt, for her own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, riſque every thing, and exert her whole ſtrength, to prevent ſuch an event from taking place. This being the caſe—</p>
            <p n="4">4. Devaſtation and ruin muſt mark the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this war along the ſea-coaſt of America. Hitherto, Britain has not exerted her power. Her number of troops and ſhips of war, here at preſent, is very little more than ſhe judged expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in time of peace—the former does not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to 12,000 men—nor the latter to 40 ſhips, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding frigates. Both ſhe, and the colonies, hoped for, and expected an accommodation; neither of them has loſt ſight of that deſirable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The ſeas have been open to our ſhips; and altho' ſome ſkirmiſhes have unfortunately hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, yet a ray of hope ſtill chear'd both ſides, that peace was not diſtant. But as ſoon as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for independency, every proſpect of this kind muſt vaniſh. Ruthleſs war, with all its aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated horrors, will ravage our once happy land; our ſea-coaſts and ports will be ruined, and our ſhips taken. Torrents of blood will be ſpilt, and thouſands reduced to beggary and wretchedneſs.</p>
            <p>This melancholy conteſt would faſt till one ſide conquered. Suppoſing Britain to be victorious; however high my opinion is of Britiſh generoſity, I ſhould be exceedingly ſorry to receive terms from her in the haughty tone of a conqueror. Or ſuppoſing ſuch a failure of her manufactures, commerce and ſtrength, that victory ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the ſide of America; yet who can ſay in that caſe, what extremities her ſenſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:043050_0065_101CAF7B9DAC6F80"/>
and ſelf-preſervation will drive Great-Britain to? For my part, I ſhould not in the leaſt be ſurpriſed, if, on ſuch a proſpect as the independency of America, ſhe would parcel out this continent to the different European powers. Canada might be reſtored to France, Florida to Spain, with additions to each—other ſtates alſo might come in for a portion. Let no man think this chimerical or improbable. The independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of America would be ſo fatal to Britain, that ſhe would leave nothing in her power undone to prevent it. I believe as firmly as I do my own exiſtence, that if every other method failed, ſhe would try ſome ſuch expedient as this, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concert our ſcheme of independency; and let any man figure to himſelf the ſituation of theſe Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh colonies, if only Canada were reſtored to France!</p>
            <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſing, once more, that we were able to cut off every regiment that Britain can ſpare or hire, and to deſtroy every ſhip ſhe can ſend—that we could beat off any other European power that would preſume to intrude upon this continent; yet a republican form of government, would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuit the genius of the people, nor the extent of America.</p>
            <p>In nothing is the wiſdom of a legiſlator more conſpicuous than in adapting his form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the genius, manners, diſpoſition, and other circumſtances of the people with whom he is concerned. If this important point is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, confuſion will enſue; his ſyſtem will ſink into neglect and ruin. Whatever checks or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers may be interpoſed, nature will always ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them, and finally prevail. It was chiefly
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:043050_0066_101CAF7D319A8838"/>
by attention to this circumſtance, that Lycurgus and Solon were ſo much celebrated; and that their reſpective republics roſe afterwards to ſuch eminence, and acquired ſuch ſtability.</p>
            <p>The Americans are properly Britons. They have the manners, habits, and ideas of Britons; and have been accuſtomed to a ſimilar form of government. But Britons never could bear the extremes, either of monarchy or republicaniſm. Some of their kings have aimed at deſpotiſm; but always failed. Repeated efforts have been made towards democracy, and they equally failed. Once indeed republicaniſm triumphed over the conſtitution; the deſpotiſm of one perſon enſued; both were finally expelled. If we may judge of future events by paſt tranſactions, in ſimilar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, this would moſt probably be the caſe of America, were a republican form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adopted in our preſent ferment. After much blood was ſhed, thoſe confuſions would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the deſpotiſm of ſome one ſucceſsful adventurer; and ſhould the Americans be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to emancipate themſelves from that thraldom, perhaps the whole would end in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited monarchy, after ſhedding as much more blood. Limited monarchy is the form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is moſt favourable to liberty—which is beſt adapted to the genius and temper of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons; altho' here and there among us a crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brained zealot for democracy, or abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, may be ſometimes found.</p>
            <p>Beſides the uſuitableneſs of the republican form to the genius of the people, America is too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive for it. That form may do well enough for a ſingle city, or ſmall territory; but would be
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:043050_0067_101CAF805FA39430"/>
utterly improper for ſuch a continent as this. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica is too unwieldy for the feeble, dilatory adminiſtration of democracy. Rome had the moſt extenſive dominions of any ancient repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. But it ſhould be remembered, that very ſoon after the ſpirit of conqueſt carried the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans beyond the limits that were proportioned to their conſtitution, they fell under a deſpotic yoke. A very few years had elapſed from the time of their conquering Greece, and firſt entering Aſia, till the battle of Pharſalia, where Julius Caeſar put an end to the liberties of his country. Caeſar himſelf was the firſt who entirely ſubdued the Gauls, though near neighbours, and that pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into Britain. Had it not been for the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valſhip between Sylla and Marius, who were a check upon each other, Rome had ſurrendered her liberties before, to one or other of thoſe tyrants. Holland is the moſt conſiderable republic in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope at preſent; yet the ſmall kingdom of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is more than twice as large as the Seven United Provinces. Holland, indeed, has conſiderable colonies in the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies; but theſe are under as rigid and arbitrary an adminiſtration as any colonies of France or Spain.</p>
            <p>The author of Common Senſe, in his abundant care and providence, lays before the public, a ſketch of the government he would recommend. We thank him for his kindneſs; but diſlike his ware. It is patch work, and would make ſad work in America. The principal outlines of this ſketch ſeem to be taken from Mr. Harrington's Rota, which was too romantic even for the times of Cromwell. Our author has made ſuch alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as he conceived would adapt it to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:043050_0068_101CAF85607BB838"/>
It is as much in the democratic ſtyle as the Rota; and as improper for America, as the other was for England. I may truly ſay of it, and its author, ſo far as he may claim authorſhip by it, what Monteſquieu ſaid of Harrington and his Occana, of which the Rota is a kind of abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—<q>For want of knowing the nature of real liberty, he buſied himſelf in purſuit of an imaginary one; and he built a Chalcedon, tho' he had before his eyes a Byzantium.</q> To make way for this crude, wretched ſyſtem, our author would deſtroy the beſt, the moſt beautiful political fabrick which the ſun ever beheld!</p>
            <p n="6">6. In fine. Let us for a moment imagine that an American republic is formed, every obſtacle having been ſurmounted; yet a very ſerious arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſtill remains to be inquired into, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence neceſſary to ſupport it. It behoves thoſe who have any property, to think of this part of the buſineſs. As for our author, it is more than probable he has nothing to loſe; and like others in the ſame predicament, is willing to truſt to the chapter of accidents and chances for ſomething in the ſcramble. He cannot loſe; but may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly gain. His own maxim is certainly true—"The more men have to loſe, the leſs willing are they to venture;<note n="*" place="bottom">Common Senſe, p. 71, ſecond edition.</note>" and vice verſa, ſay I.</p>
            <p>It would be impoſſible to aſcertain with preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the expence that would be neceſſary for the ſupport of this new republic. It would be very great undoubtedly—it would appear intolerable to the Americans, who have hitherto paid ſo few taxes. I ſhall juſt hint at a few articles.—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:043050_0069_101CAF86EF2F4CC8"/>
Our author aſſerts the neceſſity of our having a naval force, when independent. It is granted—we could not be without one. The reader, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will not expect that I ſhould either adopt, or formally refute his hopeful ſcheme, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That merchant ſhips armed ſhall be employed for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence—that is to ſay—that ſhips when on trading voyages to Europe, Africa, the Eaſtor Weſt-Indies, or taking in their ladings at that thoſe places, ſhall defend the trade and coaſts of America! "This," he ſays, "would be uniting the ſinews of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and defence, and making our ſtrength and riches play into each others hands." The thought I verily believe is original, and the plan entirely his own—it might intitle him to a diſtinguiſhed ſeat among the ſage profeſſors of Laputa, who, according to Swift, were employed in <q>extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſun beams out of cucumbers, calcining ice into gun powder, and making fire malleable,</q> with other ſuch ingenious inventions.</p>
            <p>This gentleman thinks, that "fifty or ſixty ſhips, mounting 20, 30, 40, or 50 guns, with a few guard ſhips, would keep up a ſufficient navy." Let us take a medium of thoſe numbers, and ſuppoſe the American navy to conſiſt of fifty-five ſhips, each mounting fifty guns; which would be a very moderate navy indeed for this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. In England the general calculation of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in building ſhips of war, is, that when fitted for actual ſervice, with ſix months pay and proviſions, one thouſand pounds ſterling are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended for each gun. According to this calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the building and fitting out the above navy, would coſt £.2,750,000 ſterling; i. e. two milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeven hundred and fifty thouſand pounds, ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling money; which is nearly equal to 12,222,222
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:043050_0070_101CAF8A579283F0"/>
dollars; i. e. twelve millions, two hundred and twenty-two thouſand, two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two Spaniſh dollars, reckoning each dollar: at 4s. 6d. ſterling. If the above calculation ſhould be deemed too large, as I am not certain but it may, ſince the preciſe coſt of building a fifty gun ſhip is £.14,200 ſterling: Yet, conſidering the high price of labour in America—the docks, arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, armories, foundries, &amp;c. &amp;c. which are previouſly neceſſary towards keeping up a regular naval force, and are all very expenſive; I am perſuaded the expence of fitting out this fleet would not fall ſhort of the ſum I have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>The annual expence is next to be conſidered. The certain annual expence of a fifty gun ſhip in England, and for which proviſion is made by government, amounts to £.18,200 ſterling. This is allowed for wear and tear, victualling and wages. Repairs and expence of amunition are another article, which as it cannot be aſcertained, I ſhall paſs over. The American fleet, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 55 ſhips, each mounting 50 guns, would therefore be a certain annual expence of £.1,001,000 ſterling; i. e. one million, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling.</p>
            <p>Conſidering our extenſive line of ſea coaſt, and our no leſs extenſive frontier, along which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands of ſavages are ſettled, I think Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when independent, cannot keep leſs than fourteen thouſand land forces in conſtant pay; that is 20 regiments of 700 men each. The ſmall republic of Holland has 40,000 land forces in time of peace, one half of which is employed in gariſons. The annual expence of an Engliſh
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:043050_0071_101CAF8F83033D80"/>
regiment, conſiſting of 700 privates, is nearly £.15,743 ſterling; and the expence of raiſing arming, &amp;c. of a regiment is about £.6 a man. i. e. £.4,200 for a regiment. Thus the annual expence of 14,000 men, or 20 regiments of 700 men each, would be £.314,860 ſterling. Beſides the charge of arming, &amp;c. thoſe 20 regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which amounts to £.84,000 ſterl. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we ſhould find it neceſſary, to have three or four regiments of cavalry, to be diſtributed in or near the large towns or cities. Let us ſuppoſe three regiments to be raiſed, of 300 privates each. The annual expence of an Engliſh regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of dragoons, of three hundred men, is nearly £.16,137 ſterling. The annual expence of three ſuch regiments, would be £.48,561 ſterling, beſides the charge of horſes, arming, &amp;c. which is computed at 30 guineas per man, and will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to £.28,350 ſterling.</p>
            <p>Let us now caſt up thoſe ſeveral ſums of annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al expence:—

            <p>The civil department ſtill remains; and after conſidering it with as much exactneſs as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the caſe will admit, I ſhall not heſitate to aver, that when this is added to the two former, the annual expence of America, after ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes independent, will at leaſt amount to £.1,500,000 ſterling, i. e. one million, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand pounds ſterling money; which is

nearly equal to 6,666,666 dollars; i. e. ſix mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, ſix hundred and ſixty-ſix thouſand, ſix hundred and ſixty-ſix dollars.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing, then, that Canada, Nova-Scotia and Florida, were joined to the thirteen colonies now united, the number would be ſixteen. The above ſum equally divided amongſt them, would be about £.93,750 ſterl. nearly equal to 416,666 dollars, annual expence to each colony. But it ſhould be obſerved, that Rhode Iſland is a ſmall colony—that the three counties of New-Caſtle, Kent and Suſſex on Delaware, are reckoned as a colony—that Nova-Scotia, Georgia and Florida are very young colonies; none of theſe, therefore, could poſſibly contribute an equal ſhare with the older and larger colonies; the expence of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt therefore be proportionably greater to make up the deficiency.</p>

            <p>So that each colony muſt expend the ſum of one hundred and thirty-eight thouſand, two hundred and ſeventy-one pounds ſterling, nearly equal to 642,537 dollars, i. e. ſix hundred and forty-two thouſand, five hundred and thirty-ſeven Spaniſh dollars, immediately after the war with Great-Britain was ended.</p>

I have not knowingly exaggerated a ſingle ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the above eſtimate; and were the trial to be made, I verily believe the expence would be found much greater. For I have formed this eſtimate according to the ſtate of things in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but it is well known, that wages, and the price of labour in general, are much greater in America than in England. Labour neceſſarily muſt be dear in every country where land is cheap, and large tracts of it unſettled, as is the caſe here. Hence, an American regiment coſts us more than <hi>double</hi> what a Britiſh regiment, of equal number, coſts Britain. Were it proper to be explicit, and deſcend to particulars, I could evince this paſt all poſſibility of doubt; and I appeal for the truth of it to thoſe gentlemen among us who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with theſe matters.</p>
            <p>Where the money is to come from, which will defray this enormous expence of a million and a half ſterling annually, I know not. The whole of our exports from the thirteen united colonies in the year 1769, amounted only to £.2,887,898 ſterling,<note n="*" place="bottom">See Campoell Political Survey of Great Britain, Vol. 2.</note> which is not twice as much as our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expence would be, in caſe we were indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Great-Britain. Thoſe exports, with no inconſiderable part of the profits ariſing from them, it is well known, centered finally in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to pay the merchants and manufacturers there for goods we had imported thence; and yet left us ſtill in debt. What then muſt our ſituation be, or what the ſtate of our trade, when oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch a load of annual expence! When every article of commerce, every neceſſary of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:043050_0074_101CAF99ED9B00C8"/>
life, together with our lands, muſt be taxed to defray that expence!</p>
            <p>Such is the debt and expence we ſhould incur by this writer's hopeful exchange of our preſent connection with Great-Britain for independency and republicaniſm! And all this after being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by a tedious war, and perhaps all our ſhipping and ſea ports deſtroyed! How little do thoſe who deſire ſuch an exchange, know what they are about, or what they deſire!</p>
            <p>Our author frequently refers us to Holland, as if that were the only land of liberty—crowned with every bleſſing, and exempt from every evil. But hear a little plain truth. The national debt of Holland is much greater, in proportion, than that of England. The taxes in Holland far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not only thoſe in England, but even thoſe in France; inſomuch, that a certain writer declares, he ſcarcely knows any thing they have, which has eſcaped taxation, "except the air they breathe." Nay more—the people at large have no voice in chuſing the members of their ſeveral ſenates, as we have in chuſing repreſentatives. The members of each ſenate, upon any vacancy, elect new members; and the deputies from thoſe ſenates, conſtitute the States General. So that in fact, the people have no ſhare in the government, as with us; "They have nothing to do but pay and grumble," as Lord Cheſterfield obſerves. Yet this is the country our author holds up for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if we were to follow his advice, I have not the leaſt doubt but we ſhould ſoon reſemble them in paying heavy taxes, as well as in other matters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:043050_0075_101CAF9B7AE8F2A8"/>
But here it may be ſaid—"that all the evils above ſpecified, are more tolerable than ſlavery." With this ſentiment I ſincerely agree—any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, however great, are preferable to ſlavery. But then I aſk, is there no other alternative in the preſent caſe? Is there no choice left us but ſlavery, or thoſe evils? I think there is; and that both may be equally avoided. Let us only ſhew a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to treat or negociate in earneſt—let us fall upon ſome method to ſet a treaty or negociation with Great-Britain on foot; and if once properly begun, there is a moral certainty that this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py diſpute will be ſettled to the mutual ſatisfaction and intereſt of both countries. For my part, I have not the leaſt doubt about it.</p>
            <p>It would be improper and needleſs for me to enlarge on the particulars that ſhould be adjuſted at ſuch a treaty. The matureſt deliberation will be neceſſary on the occaſion, as well as a generous regard to every part of the empire. I ſhall juſt beg leave to ſuggeſt my opinion on a few points.—I think America ſhould inſiſt, that the claim of Parliamentary taxation be either explicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed, or elſe ſuch ſecurity given as the caſe will admit, and may be equivalent to a formal relinquiſhment, that this claim ſhall not be exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When this moſt important point is gained, America ſhould conſider, that there is a great difference between having her money wreſted from her by others, and not giving any of it herſelf, when it is proper to give. While ſhe is protected, and ſhares in the advantages reſulting from being a part of the Britiſh empire, ſhe ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſomething for that protection and thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; and I never heard a ſenſible American
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:043050_0076_101CAF9D2AA4C368"/>
deny this. Moreover, ſhe ſhould ſtipulate for ſuch a freedom of trade as is conſiſtent with the general welfare of the ſtate; and that this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting object be ſettled in ſuch a manner as to preclude as much as poſſible any impolitic, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious infringements hereafter. All this may be eaſily done, if both ſides are only diſpoſed for peace; and there are many other particulars which would be exceedingly beneficial to America, and might be obtained, as they could not interfere with the intereſt of Great-Britain, or any other part of the empire.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked—What probability is there that Britain will enter on ſuch a treaty, or liſten to propoſals of this kind? Is ſhe not preparing for war, and fitting out a formidable armament againſt the colonies? I anſwer—there is every reaſon to believe that ſhe will enter on ſuch a treaty if it is deſired; and that ſhe will liſten to reaſonable propoſals. It is her intereſt to do ſo. To hold theſe colonies by the ſword only, were ſhe ever ſo powerful, would be hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by a very precarious, expenſive tenure. Such an union with the colonies as will promote their intereſts equally with her's, is the only ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual way of attaching them to her. Is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to ſuppoſe that Great-Britain does not ſee this? Or that ſhe is not ſenſible of it? Beſides, it has been openly and expreſſly declared in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that "taxation is given up" by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; and we are aſſured that ſome very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table names have been lately added to the advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of America. All theſe things are in our favour, and promiſe a proſperous iſſue to a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, if once begun. The Britiſh armament
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:043050_0077_101CAFA6004F1DE8"/>
will not in the leaſt impede a treaty. Belligerent powers, when on the eve of peace, always make vigorous preparations for war, as if there were no thoughts of peace. America is alſo preparing for war, which is no more than a prudent ſtep. It need not prevent her from treating; and ſhe may thereby obtain better terms.</p>
            <p>But a declaration for independency on the part of America, would preclude the treaty entirely; and could anſwer no good purpoſe. We actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have already every advantage of independency, without its inconveniences. By a declaration of independency, we ſhould inſtantly loſe all aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from our friends in England. It would ſtop their mouths; for were they to ſay any thing in our favour, they would be deemed rebels, and treated accordingly.</p>
            <p>Our author is much elated with the proſpect of foreign ſuccour, if we once declare ourſelves independent; and from thence promiſeth us mighty matters. This, no doubt, is intended to ſpirit up the deſponding—all who might ſhrink at the thought of America encountering, ſingly and unſupported, the whole ſtrength of Great-Britain. I believe in my conſcience, that he is as much miſtaken in this, as in any thing elſe; and that this expectation is deluſive, vain and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious. My reaſons are theſe, and I ſubmit them to the reader's judgment.</p>
            <p>The only European power from which we can receive aſſiſtance is France. But France is now at peace with Great-Britain; and is it probable that France would interrupt that peace, and hazard a war with the power which lately redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her ſo low, from a diſintereſted motive of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:043050_0078_101CAFA78E387CD8"/>
aiding and protecting theſe colonies? The fate of Corſica may teach us how ready European ſtates are to act on diſintereſted motives, in ſuch caſes. France has now a pacific king; ſhe is burthened with an enormous national debt; both which circumſtances will naturally tend to keep her quiet. If it be ſaid—That the excluſive trade of America would be a ſufficient induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for France to engage on our ſide,—I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer—That ſhe never can have our excluſive trade, till the power of Great-Britain is totally annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. Now, ſuppoſing France were able to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this—(a ſuppoſition not very probable)—yet the other European ſtates are too jealous of her—too deeply intereſted in preſerving a due balance of power, which is a principal object in European politics, ever to ſuffer ſuch an event to take place.</p>
            <p>It is well known that ſome of the French co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts, not long ſince, offered to put themſelves under the protection of England, and declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves independant of France; but England re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the offer. The example would be rather dangerous to ſtates that have colonies—to none could it be more ſo than to France and Spain, who have ſo many and ſuch extenſive colonies. The practice of courts is as much againſt us in this, as in the inſtance our author mentions. Can any one imagine, that becauſe we declared our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves independent of England, France would therefore conſider us as really independant? And before England had aquieſced, or made any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts worth mentioning to reduce us? Or can any one be ſo weak as to think, that France would run the riſk of a war with England, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:043050_0079_101CAFA922CEB4A0"/>
ſhe (France) were ſure of ſome extraordinary advantage by it, in having the colonies under her immediate juriſdiction? If England will not protect us for our trade, ſurely France will not. In truth, France need not hazard a war to have her purpoſes anſwered with reſpect to America, if we ſhould be ſo infatuated as to declare for independency. I am confident, that in leſs than ſix months, after ſuch a declaration, France would be put in quiet poſſeſſion of Canada.</p>
            <p>Indeed, were France ever ſo willing and able to aſſiſt us, the experiment would be imprudent and hazardous in the higheſt degree. There is ſcarcely an inſtance recorded in hiſtory of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being called in to aſſiſt in domeſtic quarrels, that it did not prove ruinous to thoſe that ſought their aid. The ancient Britons invited the Saxons to aſſiſt them againſt the Picts—the Picts were ſubdued and the Britons enſlaved. One inſtance more I cannot forbear mentioning. The Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians and other Greek ſtates, called in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to aſſiſt them againſt Philip of Macedon, one of Alexander's ſucceſſors. Philip was reduced, and the Roman yoke was impoſed on the Grecian ſtates. Senſible of their error, when it was too late, and anxious for deliverance from the Romans, the Etolians applied for aid to Antiochus, who then poſſeſſed the remains of Alexander's Aſiatic dominions. The Romans now employed Philip to ſubdue Antiochus and the Etolians, as before they employed the Etoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſubdue Philip. The Roman yoke was more confirmed and made heavier. Thus were the French and coloniſts to ſucceed againſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the preſent ſtruggle, the French might
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:043050_0080_101CAFAAB573EA08"/>
hereafter employ the coloniſts to ſubdue Britain.</p>
            <p>I have heard the caſe of Holland's revolt from Spain, and Queen Elizabeth's affording aid to the former, mentioned as parallel to ours. But inſtead of being parallel, the caſes differ in every cicrumſtance. Elizabeth, embarraſſed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Roman catholics at home, was then at war with Philip II. of Spain—a cruel, gloomy tyrant, who had lately introduced the inquiſition into the Low Countries, where hundreds of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſubjects were ſacrificed by that bloody court. This was the real cauſe of the Dutch revolt; though civil matters partly mingled with it. Elizabeth, by aſſiſting the Dutch, ſerved two important purpoſes. One was to protect the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, who were every where threatened with deſtruction. The other was to diſtreſs her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy, who aimed at no leſs than the utter ruin of her religion, crown and kingdom. The Dutch States offered Elizabeth the ſovereignty of their country; but ſhe refuſed it, having no deſign of that fort. It is more than probable, the French King would not be ſo diſintereſted, modeſt and ſelf-denying as Elizabeth was, were we to make him the like offer. Such was the caſe of Holland; yet ſome have been ſo ſilly as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our preſent caſe to that of the Dutch.</p>
            <p>Conſider this matter as you will, view the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of independency in what light you pleaſe, the ruin of America muſt be the inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Our author's earneſtneſs and zeal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we ſhould declare ourſelves independent, ſerves only to prove, that he himſelf is deſperate; and that he would gladly bring this whole conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent into the ſame ſituation.</p>

But our author repeatedly tells us, "That to expend millions for the ſake of getting a few vile acts repealed, is unworthy of the charge." Now, to paſs over the groſs inſult here offered to the Continental Congreſs, who had this important object principally in view, in the ſpirited meaſures they have taken; I anſwer—That if five times as many millions had been expended, America would be an immenſe gainer, provided thoſe acts are repealed, and her liberties, property and trade are ſettled on a firm baſis, by a conſtitutional union with Great-Britain. Were that meaſure once effected, the peace and proſperity of this continent would be as immutably and certainly ſecured as any thing in this world can. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have fully evinced, to the conviction of the moſt incredulous, that they have an high ſenſe of their liberties, and ſufficient ſpirit to vindicate thoſe liberties. Their numbers, ſtrength and importance will be daily increaſing; theſe will command reſpect from Great-Britain, and inſure to them a mild and equitable treatment from her. She will not hereafter be over anxious to contend, or come to blows with them. This, I think, is clear to demonſtration; and hence we may learn to ſet a proper value on the rant which this author throws out, as if America would be perpetually embroiled with England hereafter, unleſs we declare for independency.</p>
            <p>For my part, I look upon this pamphlet to be the moſt injurious, in every reſpect, to America, of any that has appeared ſince theſe troubles began. The Continental Congreſs, the ſeveral Provincial Congreſſes, and Aſſemblies, have all unanimouſly and in the ſtrongeſt terms, diſclaimed every idea
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:043050_0082_101CAFB5DB67FDC0"/>
of independency. They have repeatedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their abhorrence of ſuch a ſtep; they have as often declared their firm attachment to our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign and the parent ſtate. They have declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that placing them in the ſame ſituation that they were at the cloſe of the laſt war, was their only object; that when this was done, by repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obnoxious acts, our former harmony and friendſhip would be reſtored. I appeal to the reader whether all this has not been done from one end of the continent to the other.</p>
            <p>Yet here ſteps forth a writer, who avers with as much aſſurance as if he had the whole conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent at his back, and ready to ſupport his aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations—That independency is our duty and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt—That it was folly and raſhneſs to go to the expence we have been at for the ſake of repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe obnoxious acts; and moreover, loads with the moſt approbrious terms, that ſovereign and nation to which we had declared our attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! In what light can this be viewed in Britain? Muſt it not weaken the influence of our friends—ſtrengthen the hands of the miniſtry—and give weight to every thing our enemies have ſaid to our diſadvantage? Muſt it not induce people to ſuſpect our candour—that all our declarations were inſincere, fallacious—intended only to amuſe and deceive?—It is as much to vindicate my injured countrymen from this diſgrace, which they deſerve not, as to oppoſe the deſtructive project of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency, that I appear on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>I have now conſidered every thing in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary's pamphlet, that deſerves notice. If ſome things are paſſed over, it is not becauſe they are unanſwerable; but becauſe they are not
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:043050_0083_101CAFB925A57768"/>
worthy of an anſwer. I have on purpoſe omitted every ſubject, the diſcuſſion of which might tend to raiſe jealouſy among the coloniſts; ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the claims of ſome colonies on others, beſides many more of the ſame kind. But it was more difficult to avoid ſpeaking of theſe, than to point out what prolific ſources of animoſity, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, and bloody conteſts they muſt infallibly prove, were America to become independent. The whole is freely ſubmitted to the reader's can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, diſpaſſionate judgment.</p>
            <p>The author of Common Senſe may probably call me "a diſguiſed tory, a prejudiſed man," or what in his eſtimation "will be productive of more calamities to this continent than all others—a moderate man." But I am too conſcious of the ſincerity of my own heart, and of the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of my intentions, to pay any regard to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he is pleaſed to call me. Who indeed would be ambitious of his approbation, when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly reprobates moderation—that offspring of true wiſdom and ſound judgment? The welfare of America is what I wiſh for above any earthly thing. I am fully, firmly, and conſcientiouſly perſuaded, that in a reconciliation and union with Great-Britain, on conſtitutional principles, the welfare of America is only to be found. I am fully, firmly, and conſcientiouſly perſuaded, that our author's ſcheme of independency and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licaniſm is big with ruin—with inevitable ruin to America. Againſt this ſcheme, therefore, as an honeſt man, as a friend to human nature, I muſt and will bear teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Let the ſpirit, deſign and motives which are undeniably evident in our reſpective pamphlets, decide which ſhould be attended to moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:043050_0084_101CAFBAB4CB9C18"/>
The author of Common Senſe is a violent ſtrickler for democracy or republicaniſm only—every other ſpecies of government is reprobated by him as tyrannical. I plead for that conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has been formed by the wiſdom of ages—is the admiration of mankind—is beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to the genius of Britons, and is moſt friendly to liberty</p>
            <p>HE takes pleaſure in aggravating every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of our unhappy diſpute—would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire others with the ſame rage that inſtigates himſelf, and would ſet his fellow-ſubjects to cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting each others throats: I would moſt gladly, were it in my power, draw a veil of eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion over any errors which Great-Britain or the colonies may have fallen into—I would willingly perſeade them to mutual harmony and union; ſince on theſe their mutual happineſs and intereſt depend.</p>
            <p>HE is evidently goaded on by ambition and reſentment, to ſeek for the gratification of thoſe paſſions in an independent republic here; which would reduce America to the ſame deſperate ſtate with himſelf: I have no intereſt to ſerve but what is common to my countrymen—but what every Ameaican of property is concerned in equally with me.</p>
            <p>HE places himſelf at the head of a party; and ſpurns from him with the utmoſt contempt and indignation, all who will not enliſt under his banner: I am of no party, but ſo far as the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of America is aimed at; and I believe there are many who aim at this in every party. I have not learnt to pace with ſuch intire acquieſence in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:043050_0085_101CAFBE13F02428"/>
the trammels of any party, as not to deſert it the moment it deſerts the intereſt of my country.</p>
            <p>This, as far as I can know or ſee, is the true caſe—let heaven and earth judge between us.</p>
            <p>America is far from being yet in a deſperate ſituation. I am confident ſhe may obtain honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and advantageous terms from Great-Britain. A few years of peace will ſoon retrieve all her loſſes. She will rapidly advance to a ſtate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, whereby ſhe may not only repay the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate amply for all paſt benefits; but alſo lay it under the greateſt obligations. America, till very lately, has been the happieſt country in the univerſe. Bleſt with all that Nature could beſtow with the profuſeſt bounty, ſhe enjoyed, beſides, more liberty, greater privileges than any other land. How painful is it to reflect on theſe things, and to look forward to the gloomy proſpects now before us! But it is not too late to hope that matters may mend. By prudent management, her former happineſs may again return; and continue to encreaſe for ages to come, in a union with the parent fiate.</p>
            <p>However diſtant humanity may wiſh the period; yet in the rotation of human affairs, a period may arrive, when, (both countries being prepared for it) ſome terrible diſaſter, ſome dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion in Great-Britain, may transfer the ſeat of empire to this weſtern hemiſphere—Where the Britiſh conſtitution, like the Phoenix from its parent's aſhes, ſhall riſe with youthful vigour, and ſhine with redoubled ſplendor.</p>
            <p>But if America ſhould now miſtake her real intereſt—if her ſons, infatuated with romantic notions of conqueſt and empire, ere things are
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:043050_0086_101CAFC3183D8D18"/>
ripe, ſhould adopt this republican's ſcheme: They will infalibly deſtroy this ſmiling proſpect. They will diſmember this happy country—make it a ſcene of blood and ſlaughter, and entail wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and miſery on millions yet unborn.</p>
