            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I conſider that the Charge exhibited againſt me is of ſo criminal a Nature, ſo copious in its Circumſtances, and depends on ſuch a Multiplicity of Facts, I cannot but be very ſenſible of the Inconvenience I labour under, in being by the Practice of Courts Martial denied the Aid of Council on this Occaſion; and this the rather as I am ſo little verſed in the Method of Defence; having, during the Courſe of ſo long a Service, never yet been reduced to the Neceſſity of ſtudying it.—What I ſhall, therefore, now lay before this Court, will have nothing more than plain Truth to ſupport it—An Advocate altogether ſufficient, where the Candour and Capacity of my Judges will, I am perſuaded, ſupply any Defects and Omiſſions which may proceed from my Inadvertency or Inexperience.</p>
            <p>It is my Misfortune, to have laboured under the Diſadvantage of a popular, and almoſt national Prejudice.—For what Reaſons this Spirit has been raiſed and by what Means propagated, is not the Buſineſs of this Court to determine: but I have the Satisfaction to find the Time arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when I have an Opportunity of approving my Innocence before Judges, whoſe Integrity is above Corruption, and when my Proſecutors are Perſons (for ſuch indeed are the preſent) who deſire nothing more than equal and impartial Juſtice, and ſtand indifferent to my Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Acquittal. By this means I am at once ſecured from being borne down by popular Clamour, or cruſhed beneath the Weight of an overbearing Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:007865_0003_102DEBB065E19608"/>
It has been ſaid, and indeed very induſtriouſly ecchoed through the whole Kingdom,—That the Loſs of St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Caſtle was ſolely ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my Miſconduct; and that <hi>Minorca</hi> might have been relieved, if I had done my Duty.—As this national Calamity has been urged in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to excite a national Reproach againſt me, I muſt beg Leave, in the firſt Place, to refute this Aſperſion; and ſhould this Part of the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be once clearly anſwered, and the Prejudice removed, certain I am, the Charge of perſonal Cowardice, in the Action will ſoon vaniſh; for I am confident, had it not been convenient, nay I may ſay neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for ſome Perſons to ſhelter themſelves from the former Part of the Charge, no Man living would ever have thought of calling upon me, for a Juſtification with reſpect to the latter.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem ſomewhat ſingular, that being accuſed of two Offences, one whereof is capital, the other not, I ſhould appear more ſolicitous to acquit myſelf of that which is only a Miſdemeanour, than of that which directly affects my Life: but how little Regard ſoever, I may be repreſented, to have had for my Honour, permit me to ſay, I ſtill retain ſo juſt a Senſe of it's Value, as to prefer Death to the Diſgrace that ought to attend the Author of ſo inglorious a Calamity to his Country. If then, I can acquit myſelf of this Imputation (which I am confident I can) I ſhall with Spirit proceed to my Defence againſt the Charge of Cowardice, and treat it with the Contempt it deſerves.—One Favour I have to beg of the Court, that the two Charges may be kept diſtinct, and by no Means blended together, as the Fate of <hi>Minorca</hi> did not at all depend upon this Backwardneſs (as it is called) in Time of Action.</p>
            <p>The firſt, and what I think the principal Part of my Defence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſatisfying this Court,—That I did the utmoſt in my Power to relieve <hi>Minorca:</hi>—if in the Courſe of this, I ſhould happen, from the Neceſſity of Self-defence, to glance ſome blame upon others, I hope to ſtand excuſed; eſpecially as my Innocence, in many Reſpects, is ſo intimately connected with their Neglect, that a Vindication of the one, muſt neceſſarily enforce an Expoſition of the other: a hard Neceſſity, I muſt confeſs, and impoſed upon me much againſt my Inclination; ſince no Man in my Situation would wiſh to contend with ſuch potent Adverſaries. I deſire not to become an Accuſer: but if the Loſs of <hi>Minorca</hi> muſt be imputed, either to me, or thoſe who ſent me on the Expedition, they who have ſo falſely fixed the Imputation on me, in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007865_0004_102DEBB21848C430"/>
order to protect themſelves, can with little Shew of Juſtice complain of my retorting a Charge ſo unjuſtly applied to me.—But to proceed.</p>
            <p>In order to determine, whether I did my utmoſt on this Occaſion, I apprehend the Conſideration of what I could do, ſhould be previous to any Determination of what I ought to have done; and give me leave to lay it down as an undeniable Fact, and which I ſhall prove, That the <hi>French</hi> Fleet was ſuperior in the Size of their Ships, Weight of Metal, and Number of Men, beſides their Advantage in Point of Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which enabled them to fight, or avoid fighting, as beſt ſuited their Purpoſes. Though this Facts is now ſo notorious, yet permit me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the contrary was with an uncommon, Strain of Induſtry and Confidence aſſerted; nor indeed am I ſurprized at it's gaining an almoſt univerſal Credit, when the <hi>Gazette,</hi> a Paper ſuppoſed to be publiſhed by Authority, was proſtituted to ſpread a falſe Liſt of the Strength of both the Fleets among the People, not only by undervaluing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Force, of which it is poſſible the Writer might be ignorant, but by over-rating mine, in which it is impoſſible he ſhould be innocent.</p>
            <p>I do not plead the Superiority of the Enemy as a Reaſon for not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking them, but only why ſuch an Attempt might not only poſſibly, but moſt probably be unſucceſsful; ſince it is evident that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my previous Information of their Strength, I did not heſitate to attack, and do the utmoſt in my Power to defeat them. And I have the rather been induced, to particularize this Circumſtance, becauſe you will find, by a Letter to me from the Admiralty—That the only Reaſon pretended for the Diſmiſſion from my Command, was retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from an inferior Force.</p>
            <p>Now inſtead of my retreating from an inferior Force, that a ſuperior Force retreated from me, when the Fleet was unable to purſue, I ſhall manifeſt beyond all contradiction, and cannot help obſerving, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I am the firſt Inſtance of a Commander in Chief, whoſe Diſgrace proceeded from ſo unfortunate a Miſtake.</p>
            <p>I would aſk, with what View or Intention I was ſent out on this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition?—If it be anſwered to protect or relieve <hi>Minorca,</hi> which is the ſeeming Language of my Inſtructions.—I would again aſk, Did thoſe who ſent me, apprehend that <hi>Minorca</hi> could be invaded before my Arrival, and the Deſcent covered by a ſuperior Squadron, when they ſent me out with ſo inadequate a Force?—If they did, their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007865_0005_102DEBB4372AC1C8"/>
Conduct is unjuſtifiable,—if they did not, their Ignorance is inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>This I preſume is ſufficient to unravel the political Secret—Why the Enemy's Force has been ſo induſtriouſly leſſened, and mine ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly magnified; when at the ſame Time it is known to almoſt every Man in the Squadron I commanded, that it conſiſted of ſeveral of the worſt conditioned Ships, and moſtly the worſt manned of any perhaps in his Majeſty's Navy.</p>
            <p>I think I may venture to affirm, that it was not foreſeen or expected that the Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> would come to Action; ſince it will appear from my very Inſtructions themſelves, that no ſuch Service was ever ſuppoſed probable, or that the Enemy could have a Force ſufficient to venture an Engagement at Sea—In theſe you will find, I am ordered—If on my Arrival at <hi>Gibralter,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Fleet ſhould have paſſed out of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> to ſend a Detachment under the Command of Admiral <hi>Weſt</hi> after them to <hi>North-America.</hi> Can it be meant that I was to detach eight Ships out of the ten? as no leſs would have been neceſſary to inſure Succeſs, and make the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Force ordered in my Inſtructions.—Again, I am ordered when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Minorca,</hi> to aſſiſt the Garriſon with Lord <hi>Robert Bertie</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as many Gunners and Men as I could ſpare out of the Fleet.</p>
            <p>Does not this ſuppoſe the Sea to be open, and the Fleet unoppoſed? or the Order would be abſurd; for how could it be expected I ſhould diſarm the Squadron, by ſending Part of its proper Complement (which pleaſe to obſerve the Fuzileers were) on Shore, when the whole was too little to ſecure Succeſs at Sea?—I am further Ordered—If <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca</hi> was not attacked, to block up <hi>Toulon</hi>—What! block up a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Fleet with an inferior!—And all this Service you will pleaſe to obſerve was expected from a Fleet, which when collected, was ſtill inferior to the Enemy's: I ſay collected, becauſe as the Iſland was attacked, it is indiſputable the Ships, then at <hi>Mahon,</hi> might have been blocked up, and taken or deſtroyed by the Enemy, as they did not quit the Harbour until two Days after the <hi>French</hi> had arrived off the Iſland, and part of their Troops were landed, and in the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of <hi>Mahon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does not all this evince, that fighting was the leaſt intentional Part of my Inſtructions? And if the Admiralty had expected an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is it not to be ſuppoſed they would have ſent more Ships, as ſo
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007865_0006_102DEBB5E8484950"/>
many fine Ships manned, or nearly ſo, then lay at <hi>Spithead,</hi> and would have afforded me the uſual and neceſſary Supply of Fireſhips, Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Hoſpital and Store-Ships, inſtead of avoiding any Anſwer to my Requeſt, that a Frigate might be added to my Squadron, to repeat Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in caſe of meeting with the Enemy before I joined the Ships then in the <hi>Mediterranean?</hi>—But indeed I was poſitively aſſured before my Departure, from the higheſt Naval Authority, that the Enemy could not fit out more than ſix or ſeven Ships of the Line at moſt.</p>
            <p>Under theſe unfavourable Circumſtances, without ſuch Intelligence of the Enemy's Force as could enable me to judge of it, determined to do my Duty, I took the Command of the Squadron, ſuch as it was; many Ships foul, and one in particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> reported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the Voyage. With theſe I proceeded as expeditiouſly as poſſible; and though it has been maliciouſly given out (yet not even pretended in my Charge) that I loitered at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> I ſhall produce ſeveral Letters and Orders, which will inconteſtably prove that I departed thence the very firſt Moment I was enabled to ſail.—Why the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty poſtponed this Service to others, made me wait, and manned my Ships the laſt, I muſt leave them to account for.</p>
            <p>When arrived at <hi>Gibralter,</hi> I received certain Intelligence that a Deſcent was actually made on the Iſland of <hi>Minorca,</hi> that the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and whole Iſland was in the Enemy's Poſſeſſion, excepting the Caſtle of St. <hi>Philip,</hi> which was then beſieged by a very conſiderable Force at Land, and the Siege covered by a ſtrong Squadron at Sea, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to mine. Every Perſon there concluded the Place loſt, and all Relief impracticable; and the Engineers were of Opinion, that is was abſolutely impoſſible to land Men, even if the Sea had been open, and the Enemy had erected Batteries on the two Shores near the Entrance of the Harbour.</p>
            <p>I muſt own there appeared to me no great Probability of preſerving <hi>Minorca</hi> at this Time; but, however, have the Satisfaction to find that the Miniſters at home, for once at leaſt, agreed in Opinion with me, ſince the Moment Intelligence came that the <hi>Toulon</hi> Fleet was ſailed, and the Troops landed upon the Iſland, there was not a Man who did not diſpair of <hi>Minorca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence I diſpatched an Expreſs with this Account, which was at firſt huſhed up in Silence, afterwards repreſented (without, producing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007865_0007_102DEBB8279383F8"/>
it) as the deſponding Letter of a Man who would not fight.—What Authority theſe Gentlemen had for this invidious Prophecy, I am yet at a Loſs to account for, unleſs a declared Reſolution in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to meet the <hi>French</hi> Fleet may be deemed a juſtifiable Foundation for it;—but the Letter has been laid before the Court.</p>
            <p>It has alſo been given out, no Doubt with the ſame uniform ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Intention, to defame every Circumſtance of my Conduct; that I made unneceſſary Delays at <hi>Gibralter</hi> and this ſuppoſed to be ſolely on the account of watering.—I preſume the Propriety, and indeed the Neceſſity will readily appear of furniſhing the Fleet with a Sufficiency of Water and Proviſions, which was proceeding upon an Expedition where the only Port capable of ſupplying it's Wants was known to be in the Enemy's Poſſeſſion, and who by Intelligence appeared to be well ſupplied with all Kinds of Neceſſaries: this was not the Cauſe, but Effect of my Stay at this Place, and tranſacted during the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other Affairs directed by my Inſtructions.—I arrived at <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> Afternoon, and ſailed thence the eighth in the Morning, a ſpace of five Days only; in which Time I communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Orders to the Governor relating to a Detachment from the Garriſon, waited the Reſult of a Council of War held the 4th, then ſolicited a Reinforcement to ſupply the Deficiency of Men in Mr. <hi>Edgecumbe</hi>'s Squadron, occaſioned by the Loſs of thoſe who had been diſembarked for the Succour of St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s. A Liſt of this Reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I received the 6th, and ſhipped them the 7th, which Day the <hi>Experiment</hi> arrived, the <hi>Portland</hi> and <hi>Dolphin</hi> two Days before: theſe with the reſt of Mr. <hi>Edgecumbe</hi>'s Squadron, were mann'd and equipped in the beſt Manner I was able; and without waiting to fully water the Ships, I ſailed in the Morning of the 8th, though the Wind was Eaſterly, and arrived off <hi>Minorca</hi> the 19th.</p>
            <p>Thus far, I will preſume upon my Innocence; but why (it may be aſked) was not <hi>Minorca</hi> at this Time relieved? I anſwer, becauſe I was not ſent Time enough to prevent the Enemy's landing, and that when I was ſent, I was not ſtrong enough to beat the Enemy's Fleet, and raiſe the Siege. Let others anſwer why I came ſo late, and why I came ſo weak, with a Force not calculated for ſuch an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.—But after the Engagement, it may be ſaid, I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attacked the Enemy, and landed the Succours: I might, indeed, have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007865_0008_102DEBBBB77B56B0"/>
done the firſt, with a Certainty almoſt of being defeated; I could not have done the laſt, though I had been victorious. Had I been defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, what Refuge would have been left for the ſhattered Fleet?—what Security for <hi>Gibralter;</hi> which muſt have been expoſed to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a ſudden Siege, without a ſingle Ship to defend it? and which Place was equally recommended to my Protection.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems (ſuch is the Fatality attending my Conduct) that I am even held blameable for calling a Council of War in ſo critical a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture; yet when is Advice ſo neceſſary as on ſuch an Occaſion? I admit where Orders are poſitive to fight at all Events, and at all Hazards whatever, it is criminal to deliberate: but was I under any ſuch Orders?—let my Inſtructions ſpeak for me.— Is a Commander expected to fight in all Situations, and under all Diſadvantages? ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Extremes are culpable; and where nothing is to be gained, and all may be loſt, Fighting becomes Preſumptouſneſs, Raſhneſs or Phrenzy.—I therefore, beg Leave to recommend to your particular Conſideration, the different Situation of the two Fleets at this Time; and ſhall refer you to the Minutes of a Council of War, held on board the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millies</hi> the 24th of <hi>May,</hi> already laid before the Court; and when you ſhall have duly weighed the Opinion of this Council, the Unanimity of its Members, and their Characters, what Apprehenſions can I have of my Behaviour, on this Occaſion, falling under your Cenſure, ſince it would neceſſarily imply their Guilt.</p>
            <p>What I have now offered, being verified by the Teſtimony of the Witneſſes, will, I flatter myſelf, be abundantly ſufficient to exculpate me from the firſt general Charge; and that the Court will be of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,—That I never retarded from the Iſland 'till it was impracticable to make any further Attempt; and,—that the Place was not loſt by me, who was too weak to ſave it; but by thoſe who might have ſent double the Force two Months earlier, and neglected it.</p>
            <p>Yet permit me to complain, that in order to render me criminal in the Eyes of the People, the ſame authorized Paper before-mentioned, was likewiſe proſtituted to mangle and curtail my Letter to the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty</hi> on this Occaſion, and ſubſcribed my Name to my own Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond Part of the Charge againſt me—that of Cowardice.—And tho' I have already taken up ſo much of your Time, ſhall make no Apology for your further Patience, as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007865_0009_102DEBBD5BBE1CA0"/>
Gentlemen, your Impartiality will think no Indulgence too much, where the Life, and, what is ſtill much more, the Honour of an Officer of my Rank in the Service is at Stake: I ſhall forbear to point out the Conſequences to the Service in general, not to furniſh even my Enemies with an Opportunity of conſtruing it an Endeavour to beſpeak a Partiality.</p>
            <p>The 12th Article of War, is that, which provides a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Puniſhment for Cowardice, and runs in the following Words.—<q>Every Perſon in the Fleet, who thro' Cowardice, Negligence or Diſaffection, ſhall in Time of Action withdraw, or keep back, or not come into the Fight or Engagement, or ſhall not do his utmoſt to take or deſtroy every Ship which it ſhall be his Duty to engage; and to aſſiſt and relieve all and every of his Majeſty's Ships, or thoſe of his Allies, which it ſhall be his Duty to aſſiſt and relieve, every ſuch Perſon ſo offending and being convicted thereof by the Sentence of a Court Martial, ſhall ſuffer Death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would firſt beg leave to obſerve, that in order to bring any Perſon within the Peril of this Article, he muſt be convicted of Cowardice, Negligence or Diſaffection; for tho' he ſhould fail to engage or aſſiſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs this failure apparently proceeds from one of theſe Cauſes, He is not Guilty.—Negligence cannot be taken in ſo large a Senſe, as to mean every ſort of Neglect and Omiſſion, but ſuch groſs Negligence only, as evidently indicates Cowardice or Diſaffection, ſuch and ſuch only can be Penal, and was intended to be made Capital, any other Conſtruction might expoſe the braveſt Man that ever commanded to the ſevereſt Penalties, ſince a ſingle Error in Judgment might render him liable to the moſt capital Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>By this Rule, I muſt deſire, my Conduct may be judged; and if my Intentions appear to be good, and my Courage clear, I ought to ſtand Acquitted by all good Men, even though my Abilities ſhould be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Deficient.</p>
            <p>And I muſt beg leave to obſerve, that this Article of my Charge can only relate to my Perſonal Courage and Conduct during the Action, and therefore any Diſpoſition (admitting it could be corrected) can only be accounted an Error of Judgment.—I do not mention this to avoid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into that part of my Conduct, ſince I flatter myſelf that I ſhall be able to ſhew, conſidering the Circumſtances, ſeveral Diſpoſitions of the two Fleets, and unavoidable Accidents, that the whole as far
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007865_0010_102DEBBF73774EE8"/>
as could depend upon me, was conducted with that Propriety and Naval Military Skill which is requiſite in a Commander in Chief—But the Court will pleaſe to remember, this is no part of the Charge againſt me.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to an Account of the Action, I muſt beg Leave to offer two Obſervations, and deſire the Court never to loſe Sight of them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Succeſs muſt depend upon Execution as well as Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and that no Commander of a particular Ship has a right to deviate from the eſtabliſhed Diſcipline and Rules of the Navy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the fighting Inſtructions, and founded on Experience and juſt Obſervation; becauſe if inferior Officers may judge for themſelves, there is an End of all Diſcipline, and any Deviation from Orders, muſt tend to diſturb and diſconcert the Admiral's Plan, and throw the whole Fleet into Confuſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That as the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, ſuperior in Force, waited the Attack, there was no Reaſon to apprehend they would avoid the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement; and therefore no Occaſion to hazard a Diſorder by crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much Sail, and making the Attack with Precipitation, contrary to the invariable Practice of every prudent, good or great Officer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in ſimilar Caſes.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed, in as conciſe a Manner as I poſſibly can, to lay before the Court a faithful Narrative of the material Tranſactions of his Majeſty's Fleet under my Command off the Iſland of <hi>Minorca,</hi> from the 19th of <hi>May</hi> 1756, to the 24th, both Days incluſive.</p>
            <p>In the Morning at Day-light, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 19th of <hi>May,</hi> I arrived with the Fleet off the Iſland of <hi>Minorca;</hi> and was then about three or four Leagues diſtant from the Shore, the Wind freſh northerly.</p>
            <p>Several Ships being at that Time conſiderably aſtern, in particular the <hi>Defiance,</hi> that had been ſeparated from the Fleet, on <hi>Monday</hi> Evening before, by not being able to weather the Iſland of <hi>Cabrera,</hi> when the reſt of the Fleet did; I made the Signals for the Captains of the <hi>Phoenix, Cheſterfield</hi> and <hi>Dolphin;</hi> and ſent theſe three Frigates ahead of the Fleet, under the Direction of Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> of the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix;</hi> to whom at the ſame Time I gave a Letter for General <hi>Blake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> which Letter, though it could not be delivered, I ſhall beg Leave to read, together with a Copy of my Orders to Captain <hi>Hervey.</hi>

            <p>For all the Purpoſes contained in this Order, and ſome others, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Signals for the Captains of theſe Frigates to inform me of their Obſervations, without the Trouble and Delay of ſending Boats.</p>
            <p>About half an Hour after Nine, the Frigates having ſailed ahead of the Fleet with a freſh Gale, and doubled the Laire of <hi>Mahon,</hi> fell into light Airs of Wind and Calms, under the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About half an Hour after Ten,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fleet having alſo got round the Laire of <hi>Mahon</hi> with a freſh Gale, fell into light Airs of Wind and Calms; and with the Frigates about a Mile ahead, continued to ſtand on towards St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Caſtle,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007865_0013_102DEBC5E07B1040"/>
and the Harbour's Mouth, with what Airs of Wind offered, until within the Diſtance of about three or four Miles.</p>
            <p>At this Time we could ſee there was a frequent Exchange of Shot and Shells between the Garriſon and the Enemy, who were firing upon the Caſtle, from ſeveral Batteries to the weſtward of the Caſtle, and to the eaſtward towards Cape <hi>Mola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Fleet was ſtanding on towards the Caſtle, Captain <hi>Hervey</hi> agreeable to my Directions made a private Signal to Captain <hi>Scrope</hi> of the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> who was left with the Garriſon, and had kept the <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin</hi>'s Barge with him, in hopes that Captain <hi>Scrope</hi> would come off to the Fleet, if it was poſſible.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to explain, that each Ship in Mr. <hi>Edgecumbe</hi>'s Squadron had a diſtinguiſhing Signal to give Notice on her, Approach, that it was ſuch a Ship arrived; Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> made the diſtinguiſhing Signal for the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> to give Notice that it was the <hi>Phoenix</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching; and at the ſame Time threw out a white Pendant at his Mizen Top Maſt Head, the Signal to ſpeak with Capt. <hi>Scrope,</hi> agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Signals given out by Mr. <hi>Edgecumbe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Frigates had made the Signal for ſeeing Ships in the ſouth-eaſt Quarter; but between eleven and twelve, they were plainly diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Enemy's Fleet, of which we counted ſixteen Sail, at the Diſtance of about four or five Leagues, ſtanding towards us.</p>
            <p>The Enemy at this Time were undoubtedly Maſters of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; the light Airs of Wind off the Land, and Calms, made it very uncertain what Time any of the Frigates could get near enough to the Caſtle to make proper Obſervations; and I apprehend it needleſs to explain to my Judges the Conſequence of a Frigate's approaching Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, or rather as many Guns as the Enemy are pleaſed to bring to bear, without Wind to keep her under Command. A Swell made the <hi>Phoenix</hi> on this Occaſion in danger of being on Shore upon the Laire, and obliged Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> to get his own, and other Ship's Boats ahead, to tow him off.</p>
            <p>No Boat coming off from the Garriſon, made it probable that no Boat could come off.</p>
            <p>As the Enemy appeared to have Batteries on both Sides of the Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it was very improbable that the Frigates could not be able to cover the Paſſage of a Boat, with a Letter to the Sally-Port, much leſs the Paſſage of Boats carrying Troops.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:007865_0014_102DEBC78767EF60"/>
Yet, ſuppoſing the Frigates had been ſufficient, the Nearneſs of the Enemy's Fleet ſtanding towards us, rendered it, as I conceive, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, upon the Brink of an Action, to deprive the Fleet of the Uſe and Aſſiſtance of any of the Frigates; but more eſpecially of their Men, who were neceſſary to ſtrengthen ſuch Ships of the Line, as were moſt ſickly, or badly manned.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Robert Bertie</hi>'s Regiment, and the Detachment of about two Hundred and ſeventy Men from the Garriſon of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> made up the Ship's Complements, and ſerved in the Room of Marines.</p>
            <p>Lord <hi>Robert Bertie</hi>'s Regiment was intended to ſerve as Marines, as evidently appears by the Order to me from the Board of <hi>Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> directing the Fuziliers to ſerve in the Fleet, unleſs upon Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Governor, it ſhould be thought neceſſary to land them: And likewiſe by their Lordſhip's Order to put the Marines on board other Ships at <hi>Spithead;</hi> therefore, landing them at this Juncture, had it been practicable, would, as I apprehend, have rendered the Fleet entirely unfit for Action.</p>
            <p>All the Reinforcement then for the Garriſon, that could poſſibly be ſpared from the Fleet, was about one hundred Officers and Recruits, which was, as it appeared to me, a very inconſiderable Reinforcement, and an inſufficient reaſon for loſing Time, and delaying to attack the Enemy's Fleet when in ſight; more eſpecially as there was very little, or rather no Probability of Succeſs, from the Attempt to land them; and as thoſe very Recruits, were in a great Meaſure neceſſary to a Fleet entering into Action, badly manned in general, and with three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy one Men ſick on board the Line of Battle Ships, as may be ſeen by their weekly Accounts dated the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> which has been laid before the Court.</p>
            <p>Thus Circumſtanced, I conceive, no prudent Officer would have heſitated to conclude, that it was improper in every reſpect, to weaken his Majeſty's Fleet, by landing Men before the Action, had it been practicable; and that the moſt immediately neceſſary Step was to attack the Enemy's Fleet, and try the Fortune of a Battle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At half an Hour paſt Eleven;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore made the Signal for calling in the Frigates, bore away for the Enemy, and made the general Signal to chaſe, continuing to ſtand towards the Enemy the remaining Part of that Day, with light Airs of Wind and Calms.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>About Six in the Afternoon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Breeze of Wind ſprung up about South-weſt and by South, and both Fleets then about four Leagues diſtant continued to ſtand towards each other in the order of Battle.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Seven,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The two Fleets were diſtant about two Leagues from each other when the Enemy tacked; the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet at that Time ſtemming nearly for the Enemy's Van, who of courſe muſt have weathered us if both had ſtood on; I alſo hauled down the Signal for the Line, made the Signal to tack, and tacked nearly about the ſame Time.</p>
            <p>The Enemy's Reaſons for tacking were probably an Endeavour to preſerve the Weather-gage, and as Night was near at hand, to avoid the Confuſion of a Night Action, which no doubt would have enſued if both Fleets had continued to ſtand on.</p>
            <p>It appeared to me alſo proper to avoid a Night Action, as from many Circumſtances there was no Probability that the Enemy would decline coming to Action in the Day: and conſidering the Weather-gage of Conſequence, if an Enemy has Fireſhips, which may occaſion Diſorder in a Fleet to leeward, even if they ſhould fail in doing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, and having no Reaſon to believe that the Enemy had not Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007865_0016_102DEBCC0AEB0758"/>
I judged it moſt proper to ſtand in ſhore that Night, and take the Advantage of the Wind, uſually off the Land in the Summer Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the latter Part of the Nights and Mornings, to gain the Wind of the Enemy againſt the next Day, and therefore ſtood in ſhore until about half an Hour after Eleven, or near Twelve, and off the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Part of the Night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday the 20th,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Morning, the Wind about South Weſt by South, a thick Haze prevented our ſeeing the Enemy's Fleet, and made it uncertain in what Quarter it was; but perceiving two <hi>Tartans</hi> with each a blue Flag at his Maſt-head, in Appearance endeavouring to join the Fleet, as if they had miſtook us for the Enemy, I made the Signal for the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> to chaſe one in Hopes of procuring Intelligence, and made the Signal for the Rear Admiral to ſend Ships to chaſe the other, who ſent the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Defiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chaſing drew theſe Ships at a conſiderable Diſtance from the Fleet, the <hi>Captain</hi> and <hi>Defiance</hi> two or three Miles to leeward, and the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> four or five Miles upon the lee Quarter, or rather a-ſtern; wherefore I was apprehenſive of their being ſeparated from the Fleet, and to prevent ſuch a Separation, thought it neceſſary to tack about a quarter after Six, and ſtand towards them under an eaſy ſail. About this Time the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> made the Signal for ſeeing ten Sail in the North Weſt Quarter, which for ſome Time I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe was the Enemy's Fleet, that might have tacked to the North Weſtward again ſome Time in the Beginning of the Night.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Defiance</hi> took the <hi>Tartan</hi> ſhe chaſed, which had upwards of a hundred Soldiers on board with their Officers, part of ſix hundred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked the Day before from the Enemy's Camp at St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s, to reinforce their Fleet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Seven,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or near about Seven, a Fleet was diſcovered in the South Eaſt Quarter, which proved to be the Enemy, and I made the Signal for calling in all the chaſing Ships, which the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obſerve, but continued to chaſe; I fired ſeveral Guns from Time to Time, until ſhe did obſerve the Signal, and made the <hi>Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>'s Signal, who continued to lay by the <hi>Tartan</hi> Prize, taking out the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:007865_0017_102DEBCF199CEE38"/>
               <hi>At Ten,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chaſing Ships appearing to be in a fair Way to rejoin the Fleet, I made the Signal to tack, and tacked to the South Eaſtward towards the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At a Quarter after Ten,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head, at the Diſtance of two Cables Length aſunder, and about half an Hour paſt Ten ſquared my Main Top Sail, that the Ships ſtationed a-head of me might the ſooner get into their Stations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Ten Minutes after Eleven,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head, at the Diſtance of half a Cables Length aſunder; and immediately after the Ships ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a-head of me having got into their Stations, I made the Signal to fill, and ſtand on, ſet Topgallant Sails, and crowded Sail to gain the Wind of the Enemy, who at this Time were ſtanding to the North Weſtward in a Line of Battle a-head, and alſo crowding Sail.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At half an Hour paſt Twelve,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wind then favouring us a Point or more, the Enemy took in their Topgallant-Sails, and their Van bore away, and formed their Line to leeward; probably becauſe their whole Line not being able to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us, they otherwiſe would have run the Riſque of being ſeparated, and their Line cut by our Line.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About three Quarters after Twelve,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Van headed the Enemy about the Diſtance of two Miles to windward, and as ſoon as I headed them I kept away, the Wind nearly upon the Beam. The Enemy were twelve Ships in a ſtrait Line of Battle a-head, and five Frigates to leeward, at this Time laying with their Main Top Sails Square from the Wind alſo, and under Steerage Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At One,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or a little after, the chaſing Ships got into their Stations, and our Line appeared to be regularly cloſe, and well formed, the Enemy's Line more extended than ours.</p>
            <p>Juſt before tacking I hauled up the Main Sail, and took in Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant Sails, apprehending a Crowd of Sail inconvenient, and improper to preſerve Order, or to engage with, and unneceſſary becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy appeared to be waiting for us under Top-Sails, their Main Top-Sails ſquare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:007865_0018_102DEBD0C4DD77D8"/>
               <hi>At half an Hour after One,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Van then ſtretched a little beyond the Enemy's Rear, to give room for leading down upon them, who having their Main Top-Sails Square, could not have freſh Way; I made the Signal for the Fleet to tack altogether; and ſoon after we tacked in that Manner, and kept in a Line on the other Tack.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Two,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made the Signal to lead to Starboard, with one Gun, and ſoon after another Gun, to put the leading Captain in mind of his Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who I perceived did not ſteer away with the Enemy's leading Ship, agreeable to the 19th Article of the fighting Inſtructions, which directs. <q>If the Admiral and his Fleet have the Wind of the Enemy, and they have ſtretched themſelves in a Line of Battle, the Van of the Admiral's Fleet is to ſteer with the Van of the Enemy's, and there to engage them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>About ten Minutes after Two,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerving that the leading Ship did not ſteer away ſufficiently, I bore away about two Points more than the Ships a-head of me; the Ships next a-head of me, bore down ſoon after into their Stations a-head.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> appointed to repeat my Signals, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that the <hi>Defiance,</hi> the leading Ship, did not comply properly with the Signal to lead to Starboard, repeated it ſeveral Times, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to an Article in his additional fighting Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Viz.)</hi> 
               <q>If the Captains of the Frigates, which are appointed to repeat Signals, find the Signal not obſerved, they are to fire Guns until it is taken notice of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Twenty Minutes after Two,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appeared to me, that the leading Ship did not ſteer down ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by that Means, was drawing the Van a-breaſt of the Enemy's Van, and altering the Diſpoſition which I had made for attacking the Enemy, by ſteering down a ſlanting Courſe to avoid being raked; I therefore thought it neceſſary, to make the Signal to engage, to bring on the Action, and to empower the Ships to fire reſpectively as they got within a proper Diſtance.</p>
            <p>Upon the Signal to engage, the leading Ship bore down more, as did the Van; in general; the <hi>Intrepid</hi> appeared to bear right down before the Wind, by which means ſhe was expoſed to be raked, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the Time ſhe could begin to fire or very ſoon after; I alſo
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007865_0019_102DEBD3CB94C860"/>
ſteered away more, continuing the Signal for the Line of Battle a-head up, and with the Ships next a-head of me preſerved a Line, and ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proper ſlanting Courſe as the Circumſtances appeared to me, to fall in with and engage the Enemy, who I obſerved had head-way.</p>
            <p>The whole Van appeared to bear down more than the Rear Diviſion, which I imagine muſt have been owing to ſome Ships in the Van being extended at greater Diſtances from each other than in the Rear, and of conſequence being farther a-head with regard to the Enemy's Line, which laid them under a Neceſſity of taking that Method to get into Action with the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At half an hour after Two,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Enemy began to fire, all but the two ſternmoſt Ships, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved their Fire ſome little Time longer, but their Shot in general fell ſhort throughout their Line.</p>
            <p>About this Time I made the Signal for the <hi>Deptford</hi> to quit the Line, apprehending as ſhe was one of the weakeſt Ships, that ſhe would be of the moſt effectual Service as directed by that Signal. <hi>The firſt Article of the additional fighting Inſtructions, as given out to the Fleet by me at the Beginning of the Expedition. (Viz.)</hi> 
               <q>In Caſe of meeting with a Squadron of the Enemy's Ships, that may be leſs in Number than the Squadron under my Command; if I would have any of the ſmalleſt Ships quit the Line, that thoſe of the greateſt Force may be oppoſed to the Enemy; I will put abroad the Signal for ſpeaking with the Captain of any ſuch Ship or Ships, as I would have leave the Line, and hoiſt a Flag ſtriped yellow and white on the Flag-ſtaff at the Fore Top Maſt Head: Then the next Ships are to cloſe up the Line; and thoſe that have quitted the Line are to hold themſelves in readineſs to aſſiſt any Ship that may be diſabled or hard preſs'd, or to take her Station if ſhe is obliged to go out of the Line: In which Caſe the ſtrongeſt Ship that is withdrawn from the Line, is ſtrictly enjoined to ſupply the Place, and fill up the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after the Enemy began to fire, their Shot reached the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> and paſſed through her Sails and Rigging; but I continued going down and reſerving my Fire until I could get cloſe to the Enemy, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve declared ſuch my Intention at that Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About ten Minutes before three,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:007865_0020_102DEBD5E7BD3BA8"/>
When the Enemy's Shot paſſed over the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> and through her Sails and Rigging, and ſeveral hulled her, ſome of the Seamen, as I have been informed ſince, out of impatience at receiving the Enemy's Fire without returning it, began to fire without Orders, as the Guns were kept pointed forwards on the Enemy in going down; others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Example, on a Suppoſition that Orders were given.</p>
            <p>I was diſpleaſed at firing ſo ſoon, contrary to my Intention, and I think expreſſed my Diſſatisfaction; but being then within about half a Mile of the Enemy, with a fine Breeze; and apprehending that a very little Time would bring us down, and that it might prevent the Enemy from deliberately taking aim, and diſabling the Ship before coming to cloſe Action, I permitted the Fire to continue.</p>
            <p>In the Time of firing, I think it was Lord <hi>Robert Bertie,</hi> who firſt obſerved it through the Smoke, and acquainted me, that one of our own Ships was cloſe upon the Lee Bow, and that there was danger of firing into her, I immediately gave orders not to fire without ſeeing the Enemy's Colours, and to hale up the Fore Sail; and finding one Ship upon the Lee Bow, and another right a-head, both ſo cloſe to us, with one or both Top-Sails a-back; I was under a Neceſſity without Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of luffing the Ship up ſo as to back the Top-Sails and avoid being immediately on Board of them.</p>
            <p>And apprehending the Ships a-ſtern, might run on Board of us as we lay in a Cluſter, partly hid by the Smoke; I alſo immediately made the Signal for the Fleet to brace to, the Rear to brace to firſt, and braced the Fore Top Sail ſharp a-back, to back the <hi>Ramillies</hi> a-ſtern, and caſt her Head to Leeward of the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> in order for the more immediately making Sail a-head again.</p>
            <p>On Account of the Danger of firing upon our own Ships, all firing ceaſed at this Time, on Board the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> after about four or five Broadſides.</p>
            <p>No Signal being appointed for the Rear only to brace to, laid me under a Neceſſity, on this Emergency of making the general Signal to brace to, the Ships in the Rear to brace to firſt; but this Signal was up ſo ſhort a Time, that the Rear Admiral who according to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Practice of the Navy, repeated all other Signals, could not if he ſaw it, have time to repeat this, before it was haled down again, nor had Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> in the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> who was appointed to repeat my
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007865_0021_102DEBD78F8E77B8"/>
Signals, time to repeat it; neither did any Ships a-head of me not brought to before, bring to in obedience to it; becauſe, apprehenſive that the Ships a-head of me might bring to in Conſequence of this Signal, and intending that the Ships might fill which by bringing to had obliged me to lay a-back, I was very ſolicitios to have the Signal made as ſoon as poſſible for the Fleet to fill and ſtand on, the Ships in the Van to fill firſt: And therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About fiften or twenty Minutes after Three,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Signal to brace to was haled down, while the <hi>Ramilies</hi>'s Top Sails were a-back, and the Signal made for the Fleet to fill and ſtand on, the Ships in the Van to fill firſt. This was as ſoon as it could poſſibly be made after the Signal to brace to, and did not exceed ſix or eight Minutes.</p>
            <p>And having diſcovered that the Stop was occaſioned by the <hi>Revenge,</hi> and the Ships next a-head of me, bringing to or backing, inſtead of paſſing the <hi>Intrepide;</hi> who at this Time appeared unable to carry Sail, having loſt her Fore Top Maſt, and her Fore Sail a-back; and that by this Means there was a Separation between the Rear Admiral's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and mine, I made the Signal for the Rear to make more Sail, and cloſe the Line, almoſt at the ſame Time with the Signal to fill that theſe Ships might make Sail again and paſs the <hi>Intrepide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Smoke occaſioned by the Fire from the Ships upon the Lee Bow, as well as what had proceeded from the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> obſtructed my ſeeing the Enemy's Conduct and Situation, about the Time of laying the Top Sails a-back. But the Smoke being cleared away, I obſerved that the Enemy were then under Sail, Fore Sail and Top Sails edging down from the Wind, three or four Ships of their Van going large, and the ſecond Ship from the Rear, which the Fire from the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was principally directed at, going quartering with her Fore Sail, Fore Top Sail and Fore Top Gallant Sail ſett, and her Main Top Sail Yard ſhot down upon the Cap.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At half an Hour after Three,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Ramillies</hi> was backed a-ſtern, and her Head caſt to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Princeſs Louiſa,</hi> I filled the Top Sails and ſet the Fore Sail; and obſerving that the ſternmoſt Ship of the Enemy was ſeparated from their Line, by the Ship a-head of her having bore away, I ſent Lieutenant: <hi>Hamilton</hi> to Capt. <hi>Ward</hi> of the <hi>Culloden</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:007865_0022_102DEBDA03EEC660"/>
with Orders to make what Sail he could out of the Line, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to cut her off.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, ſhooting a-head to Leeward of the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Princeſs Louiſa,</hi> who were under their Top Sails, I ordered them to be hailed one after the other, as I ſhot up with them to make more Sail, which they did; and I immediately ſet my Main Sail, Jibb and Stay Sails.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Time the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi>'s Boat dropt on Board with a Letter from Captain <hi>Noel,</hi> acquainting me that he had loſt a Leg, and deſiring that an Officer might be ſent to command the Ship. I immediately ſent Captain <hi>Gough,</hi> then my firſt Lieutenant, with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, in his Way, to carry my Orders to Captain <hi>Amherſt</hi> of the <hi>Deptford,</hi> who was attending the <hi>Intrepide</hi> to take her Place in the Line; and I made the <hi>Cheſterfield</hi>'s Signal to attend and aſſiſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid</hi> then fallen a-ſtern out of her Station in the Line.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Four,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerving that the ſternmoſt Ship of the Enemy, had ſhot up and joined their Line, the <hi>Culloden</hi> then abaft the lee Beam of the <hi>Ramil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> at the Diſtance of about two Cables Length with Topgallant Sails ſet; I ordered Captain <hi>Ward</hi> to be hailed to get into his Station a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, judging it improper, then, to continue my Order for him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the ſternmoſt Ship of the Enemy, after ſhe had rejoined.</p>
            <p>The Enemy's Centre and Rear continued ſtretching a-head in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Line, and edging down to rejoin the Ships that had bore away, ſome of which the <hi>French</hi> Admiral fired ſeveral Shot at; and they ſome Time afterwards haled up and joined him; and I obſerved that the <hi>French</hi> under Fore-ſail and Top-ſails very much outſailed us, who had alſo Main-ſail, Jibb, and Stay-ſails ſet. On this Occaſion I could not help expreſſing my Concern to Capt. <hi>Gardiner,</hi> that I had not a few more Ships to enable me to make the general Signal to chaſe.</p>
            <p>None of the Enemy's Ships appeared unfit for Action, or had any viſible Damage in their Maſts or Yards, but the Ship that had her Main Top-ſail Yard ſhot down by the Fire from the <hi>Ramillies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they ſtretched a-head and edged down to rejoin the Ships that had bore away, they exchanged Fire with our Van, but at a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Diſtance, and their Shot ſeemed to fall ſhort.</p>
            <p>The Rear Admiral had loſt his Main Top-ſail Yard; and ſeveral
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007865_0023_102DEBDCAC9930C8"/>
Ships of the Van appeared too much ſhattered to be able to purſue the Enemy; beſides, the <hi>Intrepid</hi> totally diſabled and dropt at a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtance a-ſtern and to windward of the Fleet, with the <hi>Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> attending her.</p>
            <p>After the Enemy bore away and made ſail, as they ſo much outſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and a conſiderable Part of the Fleet was unable to purſue, I judged it improper to purſue with Part of the Fleet an Enemy ſuperior at firſt, and ſtill all of them fit for Action according to all Appearances.</p>
            <p>And there appeared to me no further Poſſibility of bringing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Action again as they declined it, without I had a ſufficient Force and Superiority to enable me to make the general Signal to chace; therefore I ſtood on with my Diviſion under Courſes, Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſails, Jibb and Stay Sails, until we rejoined the Van Diviſion.</p>
            <p>And at half an Hour after Five I made the Signal to bring to, and brought to in order to repair the Damages of ſuch Ships as had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Action.</p>
            <p>The Enemy were then upon the lee Bow, diſtant about ſix or ſeven Miles, continuing to ſtand on to the northward, the Body of them ſtill preſerving their Order; and being rejoined by the Ships that had bore away, they ſeemed to be new forming their Line.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Six,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Apprehending that the Enemy having obſerved the Situation of our diſabled Ships, might take the Advantage, and tacking make an Attack in their Turn; I made the Signal for the Fleet to fill, and ſoon after the Signal to tack, and the Ships appointed to lead on the larboard Tack to continue to lead on the ſtarboard Tack, in order to cover the diſabled Ships, by placing my own Diviſion that had ſuffered leaſt in the Action in the Rear, and firſt oppoſed to the Enemy if they ſhould make ſuch an Attempt, and likewiſe prevent a farther Separation from the <hi>Intrepid</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> at this Time about two Leagues upon the Weather Quarter of the Fleet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Seven,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerving that few of the headmoſt Ships were as yet tacked, and that tacking in the Order of Battle would take up much Time, as Night was coming on, and there was no Night Signal provided for Ships that led on the Larboard Tack to continue to lead on the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tack, I ordered the Signal for the Line to be hauled down, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007865_0024_102DEBDECE930888"/>
the Signal to tack up, that the whole Fleet might be able to tack before dark.</p>
            <p>At the Cloſe of Day the Enemy were at the Diſtance of three or four Leagues to the northward, continuing to ſtand on.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Fleet was on the other Tack, I made the Night Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to bring to, and the Fleet continued to lay to all Night in the Place of Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The 21ſt,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moderate Weather, the latter Part light Airs of Wind and Calms, the Wind in the S. W. Quarter.—In the Morning the Enemy were ſeen in the N. W. Quarter from the Maſt Heads of ſome of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt Ships.—The Fleet continued to lay to, the Ships which had received Damages in the Action employed in refitting.—The <hi>Intrepid</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> having carried Sail all Night, and being out of Sight I ordered the <hi>Phoenix, Dolphin and Experiment</hi> to make Sail in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Quarters to look for them.—At Noon Cape <hi>Mola</hi> was by our Reckoning N. W. half N. Diſtance about nine Leagues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The 22d,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Light Airs of Wind, eaſterly and hazey Weather, the Fleet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to lay to, the Ships that had received Damages employed in refitting.—I appointed Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> to command the <hi>Defiance</hi> in the room of Capt. <hi>Andrews</hi> killed in the Action.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Seven in the Morning,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerving a Boat to the Windward of the Fleet, I ſent the Schooner to tow her down, which proved to be the <hi>Lancaſter</hi>'s long Boat cut adrift during the Action.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Time I gave out a new Line of Battle, having chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Stations of ſome of the crippled Ships, and put two of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Captain,</hi> and <hi>Defiance</hi> in my own Diviſion, and the <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Kingſton</hi> in the Rear Admiral's Diviſion in their Places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Nine,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> having made a Stretch to the Southward to fetch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fleet, made the Signal for ſeeing the <hi>Intrepid</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> and ſtood towards them in the S. W. Quarter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Eleven,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I made ſail with the Fleet towards them.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon, upon Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi>'s Repreſentation that the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:007865_0025_102DEBE0EF23C3A8"/>
was very weakly manned, and but few Seamen, I ſent a Mate from on board the <hi>Ramillies</hi> with thirty Seamen to aſſiſt in refitting her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Eight in the Evening,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having joined the <hi>Intrepid</hi> and <hi>Cheſterfield,</hi> I brought to with the Fleet, their Heads to the Northward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The 23d,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Part of the Day, freſh Gales from the eaſtward and hazey, the middle and latter Part moderate, ſometimes little Wind and Calms.</p>
            <p>The Fleet laying to, the Ships that had received Damage in the Action refitting.</p>
            <p>In the Morning I ordered the Officer of the Watch to view the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the crippled Ships as they appeared to him, and minute down the Particulars, and to give me a Copy of it, which he did as follows.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> with her Fore-Yard and Fore-Topmaſt down, no Main-Top-Gallant Maſt up, and Main-topſail Yard unrigged, laying a-croſs upon the Cap, and the Sail unbent,</p>
            <p>The <hi>Defiance,</hi> with her Main-Yard, and Fore-top-gallant Maſt down, Main-top ſail furled, and Fore-top ſail double reefed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portland</hi> with her Fore Yard down, and Fore and Main-top ſails down upon the Cap.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Intrepid</hi> with jury-top Maſts.</p>
            <p>I ordered Surveys on the Damages received by the crippled Ships in the late Action, and on their Stores; and gave Capt. <hi>Lloyd</hi> an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to command the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> during Capt. <hi>Noel</hi>'s Illneſs, who had loſt a Leg in the late Action; and Lieut. <hi>Gough</hi> an Order to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> during Capt. <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Abſence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>About Six in the Evening;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eight or Nine Sail of the Enemy were ſeen in the N. E. Ouarter; the Haze prevented our ſeeing the whole, or diſcerning clearly how they ſtood.</p>
            <p>I ordered the Officer of the Watch to view the Situation of the lame Ships, and at the ſame Time to minute down the Particulars, and give me a Copy of it ſigned, which he did as follows:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Defiance</hi> with her Main and Fore Yards down, her Fore Top Maſt ſtruck, and Main Top Sail furled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Captain</hi> with her Fore Yard and Top Maſt down, and no Main Top-gallant Maſt; her Main Top-ſail Yard unrigged, and lying a-croſs upon the Cap, and the Sail unbent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007865_0026_102DEBE2A491CD18"/>
The <hi>Portland</hi> with her Fore Yard down, and Fore and Main Top-ſails upon the Cap.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Intrepid</hi> with Jury Top Maſts.</p>
            <p>The Ships of the Fleet in this Situation, did not appear to me as yet in a Condition fit to attack or receive the Enemy; and, therefore, after having conſulted with the Rear Admiral upon that Head, about half an Hour after Seven I wore with the Fleet, and ſtood under as eaſy Sail to the Southward for about four or five Miles.</p>
            <p>The remaining Part of the Night, and next Morning it was calm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the 24th,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Condition of the Fleet, and other Circumſtances, making it appear to me neceſſary, and as it was agreeable to the Rear-Admiral's Opinion, I called a Council of War, the Subject of which, together with the Reſolutions, have been already laid before this Court.</p>
            <p>What I have now laid before you, to the beſt of my Knowledge, Obſervation and Judgment, is a true Account of the Diſpoſition and Proceedings of his Majeſty's Fleet during the ſix Days off <hi>Minorca,</hi> without any Exaggeration, falſe colouring, or Concealment, of the ſmalleſt Circumſtance that can tend to give the Court any Information with Regard to the Proceedings of his Majeſty's Fleet, or my own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Conduct; nor am I conſcious of having in a ſingle Inſtance ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed Truth to Safety.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Part of this Narrative, if not the whole, has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I hope, to the Satisfaction of this Court already; and, I preſume, will appear conſiſtent with, and a proper Execution of my Duty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Rules of Prudence, the Art of War, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Diſcipline of the Navy. But I muſt here beg Leave to remark a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that ſhould any other Diſpoſition for attacking the Enemy be thought more advantageous than that I made, yet it cannot come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Limits of my Charge. For ſhould a Charge, depending upon Judgment in making the Diſpoſition, be brought againſt a Commander in Chief—I believe I may venture to affirm, that ſhould ſuch Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline be once eſtabliſhed, no Officer can be ſafe in taking upon him the Command of a Fleet.—It is evident, next to a Demonſtration, there never yet was a Diſpoſition for a Battle, either by Sea of Land, made by any Commanding Officer, whether ſucceſsful or unſucceſsful, which being minutely canvaſſed and examined, would not admit of ſome Amendment.</p>

As the Evidence may ſeem defective, ſince there are no Witneſſes to produce from the <hi>Captain</hi> or <hi>Princeſs Louiſa,</hi> and but few from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Ships in the Fleet, many of them that will appear to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and no Doubt are ſo to my more full Juſtification; I beg Leave to lay before the Court my Letters to Mr. <hi>Clevland,</hi> Secretary of the <hi>Admiralty,</hi> earneſtly requeſting ſuch Witneſſes, together with his Anſwers: which Letters will ſerve to give the Court a Specimen of the unprecedented Oppreſſion and Reſtriction of Privileges I have had to ſtruggle with.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007865_0029_102DEBE9DACAEEB8"/>
he could give upon the Occaſion; and as amongſt them were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral who muſt be preſumed under a particular Bias (as far as Truth will permit) in your Favour, their Lordſhips thought you would have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this Number of Officers of all Ranks, from different Parts of the Fleet, who from various Accidents had happened to come over, ſufficient to clear up the Matter according to the Truth and Juſtice of the Caſe; and have deſired an immediate Trial upon the Evidence now in <hi>England;</hi> but by your Letter of the 4th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> you ſent a Liſt of thirty ſeven Witneſſes as neceſſary to your Defence, twenty three of whom were then in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> their Lordſhips, tho' greatly ſurpriſed at the Number required, and well ſatisfied that they could not all be neceſſary; yet notwithſtanding the Detriment which muſt ariſe to the public Service, by calling ſo many Perſons home from the Fleet at this Time, and the long Delay of your Trial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned thereby, they ordered me to acquaint you, by my Letter of the 12th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> that all the Sea-Officers you had deſired might be ſent for, were ordered to be brought home in his Majeſty's Ship <hi>Colcheſter;</hi> and that their Lordſhips had applied to the King for Leave for all the Land-Officers you had deſired, to come at the ſame Time.</p>
                        <p>Under theſe Circumſtances they cannot help expreſſing their Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at your Application of the 6th Inſtant, with a new Liſt of no fewer than 31 Officers to be ſent for, without the leaſt Fact, Proof, or even Allegation to ſupport this Requeſt, or to excuſe it's not being made before; their Lordſhips look upon it merely as a Scheme ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſted to you to delay your being brought to a Trial, which muſt be the neceſſary Conſequence, if your Application ſhould be complied with; by the ſame Means you may put off your Trial for ever; it is but applying for a new Liſt every Month or ſix Weeks, and at laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a Deſire that the whole Fleet may be brought home. Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to a Perſon accuſed who may be innocent, requires that he ſhould have a reaſonable Opportunity of making and proving his Defence; this you have already had to the utmoſt of your own Deſire, and been indulged to ſo great an Extent as may make an Example very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Service and Diſcipline of the Navy; but Juſtice to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic requires that a Perſon accuſed, who certainly may be guilty, ſhould not under the bare Pretence of deſiring Means of Defence make his Trial abſolutely impracticable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="31" facs="unknown:007865_0030_102DEBEBFAAE1070"/>
I am therefore commanded by their Lordſhips to acquaint you, that ſo ſoon as the Witneſſes already ſent for ſhall come over, they intend to bring on your Trial, which they ſee no Reaſon to poſtpone any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, barely on Account of the new Application made by your afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Letter of the 6th Inſtant, and that you have laid no Grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Lordſhips ſufficient to induce them to give the leaſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to ſo extraordinary an Attempt.</p>

                        <p>I Have received your Letter of the 9th Inſtant, in which your Manner of reaſoning ſeems very extraordinary. I ſhall not comment upon that prejudging Expreſſion of yours, <q>an Opportunity of acquitting myſelf, if poſſible,</q> it ſeems ſufficiently to explain itſelf; but I cannot paſs by unnoticed your <q>preſuming ſeveral of the Witneſſes now in <hi>England</hi> having a particular Biaſs, as far as Truth will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in my Favour.</q> Whence ſhould that Biaſs ariſe? If from the Hopes of Reward, or Fear of Puniſhment: Rewards and Puniſhments are certainly in other Hands than mine.</p>
                        <p>And how great is my Aſtoniſhment at your mentioning their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Tenderneſs to me, and their Indulgence! Phraſes I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to meet with. Can being kept moving backward and forward from one Place of Confinement to another, for near three Weeks after my Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> ſo as to make it impoſſible for me to prepare any Thing relating to my Defence, be called by either of theſe Names? Or can my cloſe Confinement at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> without ſuffering even my menial Servants to remain in the Houſe after Dark, be called ſo? And I think I have a Right to complain of that Cruel Countenance and Belief, which ſeems to be given to a groundleſs Report, of my having attempted to make my Eſcape, and the rigid Orders given in Conſequence of it, as if intented to confirm it; a Report ſo injurious to me, and ſo abſolutely without Foundation; from which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal and Officers who have commanded the Guards here, as well as every private Centinal can fully vindicate me—And I cannot here
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007865_0031_102DEBEE9A28DE70"/>
avoid obſerving, that all Charge of keeping me in Cuſtody ſeems to be taken from the Marſhal, and committed to the Governor of the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, by the Orders given in his Name, who ſeems diligent in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing himſelf in the Service of his Country, by impoſing upon me all the Indignities and Inconveniences that Power can enable him to do.</p>
                        <p>Had their Lordſhips, as you are pleaſed to ſay, intended me the earlieſt Opportunity of acquitting myſelf, it is very difficult to conceive why they were not pleaſed to communicate their Intentions of bringing me to a Trial, at the ſame Time, that I received their Orders to ſtrike my Flag, and reſign the Command of the Fleet in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> to Sir <hi>Edward Hawke;</hi> that would have been doing me Juſtice, in giving me an Opportunity of conſidering my Conduct, and the Proof neceſſary to be given in ſupport of it, at a Time when no conſcious Guilt or Miſconduct ſuggeſted to me, that I was to be arreſted upon my Arrival in <hi>England,</hi> cloſely confined, and then brought to Trial; for ſurely no Perſon was to ſuppoſe that I was to look upon an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of an Enemy's Letter, and that Extract (if from a genuine Letter) a mere Gaſconade and abſolute Falſhood, as ſufficient to ground a Charge againſt me.</p>
                        <p>I muſt obſerve again, that in my Letter of the 4th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> I mentioned particularly the Names of all that occurred to me then; nor is it Matter of Wonder that I could not at once think of all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes neceſſary for my Defence. It would rather be Matter of Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, reſtrained and diſtreſſed by all the Methods Power can impoſe, and perſonally diſturbed Day and Night, if I had Immediately thought of all the Witneſſes, or a ſufficient Number capable of giving Teſtimony in my Behalf. But ſurely it can be no Cauſe of Aſtoniſhment, that accuſed of Crimes of the higheſt Nature, and conſcious of my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, I ſhould be deſirous of producing all ſuch Witneſſes as appear to me neceſſary.</p>
                        <p>I muſt alſo obſerve, that I could not poſſibly know for what Purpoſe any of the Officers now in <hi>England</hi> came home; and therefore could have no Idea, that they were conſidered as the Witneſſes neceſſary for my Defence. But if it was known to their Lordſhips, that theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen came to <hi>England</hi> in order to prove me guilty of Miſconduct, certainly I ſhould have had the earlieſt Opportunity of bringing home my Witneſſes. And if I had deſired an immediate Trial upon my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007865_0032_102DEBF0EF954A28"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> as your Letter ſeems to intimate, I muſt have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it before I knew of any Charge, and without Witneſſes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in my Defence.</p>
                        <p>What Fact, Proof, or Allegation their Lordſhips expected from me in ſupport of my Requeſt, is not eaſy to conceive; can any ſtronger be requiſite, than that they are neceſſary Witneſſes, and a Liſt given within a reaſonable Time, all Circumſtances conſidered, and at a Time when there is proper Opportunity of ſending for them, and of ſending other Officers to ſupply their Places.—Giving in an additional Liſt of Witneſſes is not unprecedented, and the greater the Number examined, the more conſpicuous muſt Guilt or Innocence appear. The Reaſon of their not being requeſted, or occurring to me as neceſſary ſooner, is eaſily deduced from the unparallel'd Treatment and unprecedented Hardſhips, and Inconveniences that I have had to ſtruggle with.</p>
                        <p>Far from delaying or attempting to render my Trial impracticable, I do aſſure you their Lordſhips cannot be more eager and ſollicitous to have me brought to Trial than I am; but a Trial without the neceſſary Witneſſes cannot be conſidered as any Trial at all; rather an Act of Power than an Act of Juſtice; and muſt be a Precedent much more dangerous than that hinted at in your Letter; and I cannot reſign my juſt and legal Claim to call upon Witneſſes that are neceſſary to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my Conduct, and make the Truth evident.</p>

            <p>Juſtice to myſelf demands, and I hope will be thought a ſufficient Apology, for that Freedom and Plainneſs becoming a Man in my Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.—It is far from my Purpoſe to endeavour fixing any Blame or Imputation, even on my greateſt Enemies, without Reaſon. But the Indignation and Reſentment of an incenſed Nation, is a Load much too heavy for me to bear, though it has been my Misfortune to ſtruggle under it ſo long. And therefore I muſt entreat the Court to forgive my taking up ſome Part of their Time, in proving what may at firſt View ſeem unneceſſary by the Nature of my Charge: That I may vindicate my Conduct to an incenſed and deluded Nation, taught hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto to look upon me as a principal Cauſe of the Publick's Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007865_0033_102DEBF299080908"/>
and as a Man guilty of the moſt odious of all military, and moſt contemptible of all civil Crimes.</p>
            <p>No Symptom of Cowardice, that odious and capital Part of my Charge has hitherto appeared to the Court; and my Innocence, and conſcious Diſcharge of my Duty, makes me confident that none will appear. Yet have I already ſuffered the ſevereſt Penalties that can be inflicted on it, being hung up in Effigy, traduced by Libels, tortured by Miſrepreſentations and Calumny, diſgraced and ſuperſeded, upon no better Authority than the Gaſconade of the <hi>French</hi> Admiral, arreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and confined beyond the Example of former Times, treated like a Felon with every Indignity, and my Life purſued with the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Malice. But all this I have had Fortitude enough to deſpiſe, and treat with the Contempt it deſerves, the Reſult of a Conſcience clear of all Crimes.</p>
            <p>I muſt now beg Leave to lay before the Court the Orders for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Marines, and for embarking Ld. <hi>Robert Bertie</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which laſt points out the Deſtination and Service intended for his Lordſhip's Regiment; and alſo ſome Letters of Intelligence relating to the Enemy's Embarkation, Force of their Fleet, Reinforcement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and other Particulars.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not treſpaſs any longer on the Patience of the Court, having nothing farther to add, beſides ſome Obſervations hereafter on the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if the remaining Time will admit of it. But I fear it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a much longer Time then I ſhall have to do it in, and a much abler hand than mine to diſcuſs and digeſt Minutes of ſuch a Nature, and of ſo great a Length: Therefore relying on the Candour and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my Judges, as my only and proper Council, I muſt beg that they will be pleaſed to allow for my Defects and Omiſſions, and ſupply my want of more proper Talents to explain and ſupport my Innocence.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THE Court having now heard the Evidence on both Sides, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Priſoner's Defence, and very maturely and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly conſidered the ſame, they unanimouſly came to the following Thirty ſix Reſolutions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It does not appear, that any unneceſſary Delay was made by Admiral Byng, in the Proceedings of the Squadron under his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007865_0034_102DEBF56423D8A8"/>
Command, from the Time of their Sailing, from <hi>St. Holens,</hi> on the 6th of <hi>April,</hi> to the Time of their Arrival off <hi>Minorca</hi> on the 19th of <hi>May.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That upon the Fleet's getting Sight of <hi>Minorca,</hi> on the Morning of the 19th of <hi>May;</hi> the Admiral detached three Frigates, (the <hi>Phoenix, Cheſterfield,</hi> and <hi>Dolphin</hi>) a-head, with Orders to Capt. <hi>Hervey</hi> of the <hi>Phoenix,</hi> to endeavour to land a Letter from the Admiral to Lieutenant General <hi>Blakeney,</hi> and to make Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of what Batteries or Forts the Enemy might be poſſeſſed of along the Shore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That thoſe Frigates got a-head of the Fleet, and in Shore, and the <hi>Phoenix</hi> cloſe to the Lair of <hi>Mahan,</hi> and were endevouring to execute thoſe Orders till they were called off between Eleven and Twelve o'Clock, by Signal from the Admiral, upon Diſcovery of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet in the South-Eaſt Quarter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the Fleet ſtood towards the Enemy the remaining Part of the Day, with Calms and little Winds, till they tackt in the Evening.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> The Court are of opinion, That the Admiral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded properly, upon Diſcovery of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, to ſtand towards them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That Major General <hi>Stuart,</hi> Lord <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingham,</hi> and Col. <hi>Cornwallis,</hi> with about Thirty Officers, and ſome Recruits, amounting in the Whole to about One Hundred, belonging to the different Regiments in Garriſon at <hi>St. Philip</hi>'s, were on board Ships of the Squadron.</p>
            <p n="7">7. 12 <hi>Yeas, for all the Officers, I, for the General and Field Officers only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That as ſo great a Number, of Officers were on board the Fleet, belonging to the Garriſon of <hi>St. Philip</hi>'s, where they muſt neceſſarily be much wanted, the Admiral ought to have put them on board one of the Frigates he ſent a-head, in order to have been land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if found practicable; and if not landed before he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, he ought to have left the Frigate to have endeavoured to land them, notwithſtanding he did ſee the Enemy's Fleet.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That from the Time of firſt ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> Fleet in the Morning of the 19th of <hi>May,</hi> till our Fleet weathered the <hi>French,</hi> about Noon of the 20th, the Admiral took proper
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007865_0035_102DEBF8128B6408"/>
Meaſures to gain and keep the Wind of the Enemy, and to form and cloſe the Line of Battle.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the Van of our Fleet upon the Starboard Tack, ſtretched beyond the Rear of the Enemy's Fleet, and that our whole Fleet then tackt all together, by Signal; the Enemy's Fleet lying at the ſame Time to Leeward, in a Line of Battle a-head, on the Laboard Tack, under their Topſails, with their Main-top ſails ſquare.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That immediately after our Fleet was about upon the Larboard Tack, our Rear was conſiderably farther to Windward of the Enemy's Rear, than our Van was of their Van.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> The Court are of Opinion, That when the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet, on the Starboard Tack were ſtretched abreaſt, or about the Beam of the Enemy's Line, the Admiral ſhould have tacked all together, and immediately have conducted it on a direct Courſe for the Enemy; the Van ſteering for the Enemy's Van, the Rear for their Rear, each Ship for her oppoſite Ship in the Enemy's Line, and under ſuch a Sail as might have enabled the worſt ſailing Ship, under all her plain Sail, to preſerve her Station.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That ſoon after the Fleet were upon the Larboard-Tack, the Admiral made Signals for leading two Points to Starboard, which brought the Wind upon or abaft the Beam; and the Ships continued that Courſe, nearly ahead of each other, till the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral made the Signal for Battle.</p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, that the Admiral made the Signal for, Battle, about Twenty Minutes after Two o'Clock.</p>
            <p n="14">14. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That at the Time the Signal was made for Battle, the <hi>French</hi> Fleet were ſtill lying to Leeward, with their Main-top-ſails ſquare, as before-mentioned, and that our Van was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably nearer to their Van, than our Rear was to their Rear.</p>
            <p n="15">15. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That upon the Signal being made for Battle, the Ships of our Van Diviſion; bore down properly, for the Ships oppoſed to them in the Enemy's Line, and engaged them, till the five headmoſt Ships of the Enemy, went away to Leeward, out of Gun Shot.</p>
            <p n="16">16. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the ſternmoſt Ship of our Van Diviſion, the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> having hauled up, and engaged about ten Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, or a Quarter of an Hour, loſt her Fore-top-maſt, a little before Three o'Clock.</p>
            <p n="17">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:007865_0036_102DEBF9C5CCA650"/>
17. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the <hi>Revenge,</hi> the headmoſt Ship of the Rear Diviſion, bore down for the Ship oppoſed to her in the Enemy's Line, and that ſhe brought up upon the Weather-Quarter of the <hi>Intripid,</hi> upon the <hi>Intripid</hi>'s Foretop-maſt going away; and that ſhe quickly afterwards, upon the <hi>Intripid</hi>'s ſetting her Fore-ſail, bore down under the <hi>Intripid</hi>'s Lee-Quarter, and brought up there.</p>
            <p n="18">18. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That upon the Signal being made for Battle, and the Van putting before the Wind, the Admiral in the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> edged away ſome Points, and the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> thereby becoming to Windward of him, the Admiral thereupon hauled up his Fore-ſail, backed his Mizen-top-ſails and endeavoured to back his Main-top-ſail, to allow of their getting into their Stations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in that Situation for five, ſix, or ſeven Minutes.</p>
            <p n="19">19. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It is the Opinion of the Court, that the Admiral, after the Signal was made for Battle, ſeparated the Rear from the Van Diviſion, and retarded the Rear Diviſion of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet from clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with, and engaging the Enemy, by his ſhortening Sail, by hauling up his Fore-ſail, backing his Mizen-top-ſail, and backing, or attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to back his Main-top-ſail, in order that the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Princeſs Louiſa,</hi> might get a-head again of the <hi>Ramilies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It is the Opinion of the Court, That inſtead of ſhortening Sail, the Admiral ought to have m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Trident</hi>'s and <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi>'s Signals to make more Sail; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that he ought alſo to have ſet ſo much Sail himſelf, as would have enabled the <hi>Culloden</hi> (the worſt ſailing Ship in his Diviſion) to have kept her Station with all her Plain Sail ſet, in order to have got down with as much Expedition as poſſible, to the Enemy; and thereby, have properly ſupported the Van Diviſion.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the Admiral, after ſhortening Sail, as beforementioned, again ſet his Fore-ſail, and filled his Top-ſails, and ſteered with the Wind abaft the Beam, a ſlanting Courſe towards the Enemy, under that Sail, 'till about Three o'Clock; when the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the <hi>Ramilies,</hi> began to fire without Orders, at too great a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for engageing; but the Firing was continued by the Admiral's Directions.</p>
            <p n="22">22. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That ſome little Time before this Firing began in the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> was ſeen from the

            <p n="23">23. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That when the Firing had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a little while in the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> an Alarm was given, of a Ship being cloſe under her Lee-Bow, imagined to be one of our Ships, and which proved to be the <hi>Trident:</hi> That upon this Alarm, the Admiral immediately ordered the Helm to be put a Lee, the Fore-ſail hauled up, and the Top-ſails to be backed, and Firing to ceaſe till the Men ſhould ſee <hi>French</hi> Colours, and made the Signal for the Fleet to brace to, the Rear to brace to firſt, in order that the Ships aſtern, might not run on board him; but to prevent this Signal taking Effect upon the Ships a-head, he ordered it to be hauled down in a very few Minutes, and cauſed the Signal to be hoiſted for the Fleet to fill and ſtand on, the Van to fill firſt.</p>
            <p n="24">24. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> was alſo ſeen, about the ſame Time, with her Main-top-ſail ſhivering, or aback, upon the Weather-Bow of the <hi>Ramillies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="25">25. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> The Court are of Opinion, That while the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millies</hi> was firing, in going-down, the <hi>Trident,</hi> and Ships immediately or ahead of the <hi>Ramillies,</hi> proved an Impediment to the <hi>Ramillies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to go down.</p>

            <p n="30">30. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That from the Time the Admiral firſt hauled up his Fore-ſail, and backed his Top-ſails to get clear of the <hi>Trident,</hi> to the Time of his filling, his Top-ſails, and ſetting his Fore-ſail again, was about Twenty Minutes.</p>
            <p n="31">31. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> It appears, That about the Time of the Admiral's filling, he made the Signal for the Rear of the Fleet to make more Sail and cloſe the Line, cauſed the <hi>Princeſs Louiſa</hi> and <hi>Trident</hi> to be hailed, to make Sail into their Stations, and then ſetting his Main-ſail, Jib, and Stay-ſails, paſſed to the Leeward of the <hi>Intrepid;</hi> ordered the <hi>Depford</hi> to take the <hi>Intrepid</hi>'s Place in the Line, and the <hi>Cheſterfield</hi> to take Care of the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> and ſtanding on towards our Van, joined them a little after Five o'Clock in the Evening.</p>
            <p n="32">32. <hi>Unanimouſly.</hi> The Court are of Opinion, That after the Ships which had received Damage in the Action, were as much refitted as Circumſtances would permit, the Admiral ought to have returned with the Squadron, off St. <hi>Philip's,</hi> and have endeavoured to open a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with that Caſtle, and to have uſed every Means in his Power for its Relief, before he returned to <hi>Gibralter.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>On the Thurſday following, being the 27th of <hi>January,</hi> the Court met again, and came to another Reſolution, That, as the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Article poſitively preſcribed Death, without any Alternative left to the Diſcretion of the Court, under any Variation of Circumſtances; he the ſaid <hi>John Byng,</hi> be adjudged to be ſhot to Death, at ſuch Time, and on board ſuch Ship, as the Lords Commiſſioners of the Admiralty ſhould direct.</p>
            <p>After which the Priſoner was ſent for; and being brought into Court by the Marſhal, the Sentence was pronounced.</p>
            <p>But it appearing by the Evidence of the aforeſaid <hi>Bertie, Smith, Gardner,</hi> and other Officers of the Admiral's Ship, that they ſaw no Backwardneſs in the Admiral during the Action: The Court did not believe his Miſconduct aroſe either from Cowardice or Diſaffection; and did therefore earneſtly recommend him as a proper Object of Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithſtanding which, and the many Petitions preſented in Behalf of the Admiral, by his Nephew</hi> George <hi>Lord Viſcount</hi> Torrington, <hi>and others, a Warrant was iſſued the 16th Day of</hi> February, <hi>for his Execution to be on the 28th: But inaſmuch as his Majeſty was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that a Member of the Houſe of Commons, who was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Court-Martial, which tried the ſaid Admiral, had, in his Place, applied to the Houſe, in Behalf of himſelf, and ſeveral other Members of the ſaid Court, praying the Aid of Parliament to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from the Oath of Secrecy impoſod on Courts-Martial, in order to diſcloſe the Grounds whereon Sentence of Death paſſed on the ſaid Admiral, the Reſult of which Diſcovery, might ſhew the Sentence to be improper;—His Majeſty had thought fit to reſpite the Execution of the ſame, until the 14th of</hi> March, <hi>in order that there might be an Opportunity of knowing by the ſeparate Examination of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſaid Court, upon Oath, what Ground there was for the Suggeſtion of his Sentence being improper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Reſpite, on the 2d Day of <hi>March,</hi> a Meſſage was ſent by the Houſe of Commons to the Lords of the Admiralty, with a Bill,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007865_0040_102DEC02AA2B9BC8"/>
deſiring their Concurrence, that the Members of the Court-Martial that ſit upon Admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> might be releaſed from their Oath of Secrecy.</p>
            <p>In Conſequence of which, the ſaid Court-Martial were ordered to attend the Houſe of Lords, and were examined ſeparately; and as there was but three out of the Thirteen that deſired the Act to paſs, the other Ten being ſatisfied that the Verdict they had given, did not proceed from any Influence, but was from the Integrity of their Hearts, the only Verdict they could give; the Bill was unanimouſly thrown out of that Illuſtrious Houſe. And,</p>
            <p>We are aſſured, That one of the Officers of the Court-Martial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked by a noble Lord, Whether, if he was diſcharged from his Oath of Secrecy by an Act, if what he had then to ſay, could have any Tendency to the Service of the Public, or induce His Majeſty to ſhew Mercy? To which he anſwered in the Negative: At the ſame Time, a brave Admiral ſaid, That he had voted for his being ſhot, and would if he had been his Brother.</p>
            <p>Being willing to clear up every Difficulty that may occur in the whole Extent of Mr. <hi>Byng</hi>'s Caſe, and as he and his Friends have complained, that Juſtice has been denied him, by being refuſed the Liberty of ſending for a ſecond Liſt of Witneſſes, about a Month after he had applied for and obtained the firſt; it may be proper to ſhew the Nature of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in his own Words, in his Letter to the Secretary of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty; together with ſome Remarks that have been made upon it.</p>

                     <hi>My Caſe is very ſufficiently hard, if indulged with every legal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for I have too much Reaſon to believe my Proſecution is carried on by Perſons, too powerful for me to contend againſt, whoſe Influence</hi>

            <p>Upon which Letter, a Writer to the <hi>Gentleman's Magazine</hi> makes this Obſervation, too material, he ſays, to be omitted, as it is a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Anſwer to the principal Grievance complained of by, Mr. <hi>Byng</hi> and his Advocates, I mean, the Denial of the ſecond Liſt of, Evidence, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>thoſe Witneſſes from the</hi> Ramillies, <hi>who were ſo near Eye-Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to his Conduct, which be declared could not be denied him with any</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:007865_0042_102DC729181E83C8"/>
               <hi>Appearance of Juſtice or Impartiality,</hi> and to which <hi>he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Claim.</hi> If after this, on the Arrival of the <hi>Ramillies</hi> at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> during Mr. <hi>Byng</hi>'s Trial, when the-Preſident of the Court-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial acquainted him, that he might call any Witneſſes on board her, it appears, as I am aſſured, that he declined doing it, with what View can one imagine this Application was made, and what becomes of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives founded on the Refuſal?</p>
            <p>Various are the Arguments that have been offered to vindicate the Admiral's Conduct on this memorable Occaſion; and it muſt be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are very plauſible. The Witneſſes in general acquitted him of Delay, from his Departure from St. <hi>Helen</hi>'s till he came before <hi>Mahon.</hi> His Precautions in ſending three Frigates a-head to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitre the Harbour, and his calling them off on the Appearance of the Enemy, ſeems founded on Reaſon. It muſt likewiſe be allowed, that his diſembarking his Soldiers for the Reinforcement of the Garriſon, before the Battle, would have been impolitick, as it would have weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his Fleet, and made him leſs capable of encountering the Enemy. Nor is it leſs certain, that the ſew Land Forces he had on Board were inſufficient to ſave the Citadel, much leſs the Iſland. All this is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But let it be obſerved too, that the Admiral will never be made to ſuffer for that which was not in his Power to perform; and indeed his Advocates have not ſo much as touched upon the principal Part of the Charge againſt him, and of which be was found Guilty; namely, that he did not do his utmoſt to relieve St. <hi>Philip</hi>'s Caſtle; that during the Engagement, he did not do his utmoſt to take, ſeize, and deſtroy the Enemy's Ships; nor did aſſiſt his Majeſty's Ships in the Action, as he ought to have done.</p>
            <p>Now, though it might be prudent in the Admiral not to weaken his Fleet, by ſending away his Soldiers and Marines, for Relief of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, before the Engagement, yet what hindered him afterwards, when the <hi>French</hi> fled, and did not return to renew the Fight in four Days that he ſtaid there. That a Deſcent was practicable, was ſufficiently proved by Lord <hi>Blakeney</hi> and Mr. <hi>Boyd.</hi> But not a Word of this in his Defence.</p>
            <p>That he did not do his utmoſt to take, ſeize, and deſtroy the Enemy's Ships, is proved by the concurring Evidence of moſt of the Captains in the Fleet, who unanimouſly agree, that if he had ſet up more Sail, he
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007865_0043_102DEC0854DE8B68"/>
might as eaſily have gone down to the Enemy as did the Van. Why then did he not? Why did he throw his Sails a-back, and thereby ſtop his going down? Becauſe, ſay his Advocates, he was then engaged with ſome <hi>French</hi> Ships, Yet Capt. <hi>Young,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Capt. <hi>Ward,</hi> and others were of Opinions, that had the Admiral gone down with his Diviſion, he would not only have prevented the Damage that was done the Van by the ſuperior Fire of the Enemy, but in all Probability would have gained a complete Victory.</p>
            <p>Nor did he aſſiſt his Majeſty's Ships in Diſtreſs, as it was his Duty to have done. This was the Caſe of the <hi>Intrepid,</hi> who, had ſhe not been relieved by Capt. <hi>Cornwall,</hi> muſt, in all Likelihood, have gone to the Bottom, or been taken by the Enemy; for no Signal was made by the Admiral, for removing her out of the Line, or for any other Ship to go to her Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that the Condemnation of the Admiral was founded upon good Proof and ſufficient Reaſons. And though the Court acquitted him of Cowardice and Diſaffection, yet his Neglects were ſuch a notorious Breach of the 12th Article of War, that it ſeemed not in their Power, unleſs they would ſhut their Eyes againſt the cleareſt Evidence, to paſs any other Sentence upon him than what they did.</p>
            <p>When the Admiral was ordered into Court to receive his Sentence, he went with his Friend Mr. <hi>B—n,</hi> and in ſuch full Expectation of being acquitted, that they had agreed to dine together. When they came on Board the <hi>St. George,</hi> one of the Court-Martial beckon'd the Gentleman aſide, and told him, That as he believed the Admiral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be acquitted, he thought it might ſhock him leſs, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted before he went in, that his Sentence would be Death. On his Friend's coming back to him, and looking diſorder'd, the Admiral aſk'd him, with ſome Warmth, <q>What is the Matter? Have they thrown a Slur upon me?</q> 
               <q>Sir, ſaid his Friend, it is worſe; your Sentence will be Death!</q> After a ſhort Pauſe, he anſwered, <q>Well, if my Death will appeaſe the Clamours of the People, in God's Name let them have it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Admiral heard his Sentence pronounc'd with great Compoſure; and as ſoon as it was finiſh'd, retir'd, without Reply, to his Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Shore, where a double Guard was ſet over him; but he was
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007865_0044_102DEC0A77D54238"/>
ſoon after remov'd on Board the <hi>Monarque,</hi> where he was confin'd under a Captain's Guard.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Affairs of his Trial, while the Admiral was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for his Diſſolution; and the following Letter from <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> ſhews the Manner of his Execution.</p>

N. W. and ebbing Water, it was the more difficult to get up ſo high as the <hi>Monarque</hi> lay, on board which Ship the Admiral ſuffered. Notwithſtanding it blew ſo hard, and the Sea ran very high, and with great Violence, there was a prodigious Number of Boats round the Ships on the Outſide of the Men of Wars Boats, which kept off all others. Not a Soul was ſuffered to be on Board except thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ship.

He was dreſſed in a light grey Coat, white Waiſtcoat, and white Stockings, and a large white Wig, and had in each Hand a white Handkerchief. He threw his Hat on the Deck, kneeled on it, tied one Handkerchief over his Eyes, and dropped the other as a Signal, on which a Volley from ſix Marines was fired, five of whoſe Bullets went through him, and he was, in an Inſtant no more. He inſiſted on not having any Thing before his Face, but was greatly preſſed to it, being perſuaded it was not otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and that the Marines might be intimidated from taking proper Aim.

In ſhort, he died with great Reſolution and Compoſure, without the leaſt Sign of Timidity, and the Moment the Muſkets went off, there was a blue Pendant thrown out at the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topmaſt-head, which continued flying about five Minutes, and was then ſtruck; on which all the Men of Wars Boats went off to repair on board their reſpective Ships.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ramillies,</hi> the Ship the Admiral had in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> was riding at her Moorings in the Harbour, and about Half an Hour before he ſuffered ſhe broke her Mooring-Chain and only held by the Bridle, which is looked on as a wonderful Incident by People who do not conſider the high Wind at that Time.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you have a Copy of the Paper delivered by the Admiral juſt before his Death, which has been printed and given away here.</p>

                        <hi>Theſe are my Thoughts on this Occaſion; I give them to you, that you may authenticate them, and prevent any Thing ſpurious being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed that might tend to defame me; I have given a Copy to one of my Relations.</hi>

my own Innocence; and am conſcious, that no Part of my Country's Misfortunes, can be owing to me. I heartily wiſh, that the ſhedding of my Blood, may contribute to the Happineſs and Service of my Country; but cannot reſign my juſt Claim to a faithful Diſcharge of my Duty, according to the beſt of my Judgment, and the utmoſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of my Ability, for his Majeſty's Honour, and my Country's.

                     <p>Truth has prevailed over Calumny and Falſhood, and Juſtice has wiped off the ignominious Stain of my ſuppoſed Want of perſonal Courage, or Diſaffection. My Heart acquits me of theſe Crimes. But who can be preſumptouſly ſure of his own Judgment? If my Crime is an Error in Judgment, or differing in Opinion from my Judge—and if yet, the Error of Judgment ſhould be on their Side, God forgive them, as I do; and may the Diſtreſs of their Minds, and Uneaſineſs of their Conſciences, which, in Juſtice to me, they have repreſented, be relieved, and ſubſide, as my Reſentment has done.</p>
                     <p>The ſupreme Judge ſees all Hearts, and Motives, and to him I muſt ſubmit the Juſtice of my Cauſe.</p>

            <p>TO ſatisfy your Enquiry, as to the Ceremony uſed in the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the late Admiral <hi>Byng,</hi> I am to acquaint you, that the Place where Offenders generally did by ſhooting is on the Forecaſtle; but he was ſo far indulged as to ſuffer on the Quarter-Deck.</p>
            <p>Twelve o'Clock being the Time fixed for his Death, Capt. <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> looking at his Watch, acquainted him the Time was come. The Admiral returned for Anſwer, it wanted ſome Minutes, and he would ſtay to the laſt; however he ſoon come up with a becoming Steadineſs, though there was a viſible Trembling, as the Struggles of Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hid from an obſerving Eye. A white Neckcloth he tied over

his Eyes. A Canvas Cuſhion being laid, and upon that a green Velvet one, on which he kneeled, he gave the Signal for firing, by dropping a red and white Handkerchief. Nine Marines were appointed, ſix, to fire firſt, three kneeling and three ſtanding; five Shot went through his Body into the Ship's Side, and ſo far, that they could not be bored out with a Gimblet, and one lay in his Body.—The Reaſon aſſigned for no Blood iſſuing is, that his Body was wrapped round with Cotton in ſuch a curious Manner, as that not one Drop appeared.</p>
            <p>He fell on his left Side, and made but one Shudder in the Agonies of Death, upon which a Cloak was thrown over him till the Coffin was ready to receive him, into which he was put, with all the Cloaths he had on except his Coat.</p>
            <p>The Inſcription on the Coffin is, The Hon. JOHN BYNG died <hi>March</hi> 14, 1757. aged 52.</p>
