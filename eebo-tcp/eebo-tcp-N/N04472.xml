         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a great Satisfaction to us that the moſt of us join'd with many worthy Miniſters in their Aſſembly met on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at <hi>Boſton, July</hi> 7. 1743, in yielding to the ſovereign GOD thro' CHRIST the Glory due to his Power and Grace for the late <hi>extraordinary Work</hi> of HIS SPIRIT in diverſe Parts of the Land; in <hi>awakening Multitudes to a deep Concern about their eternal Salvation, carrying on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of Sin. Righteouſneſs and Judgment in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to the ſcriptural and charitable Marks of true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as well as reviving the Power of Godlineſs in many who were accounted the regenerate Children of God before:</hi> — So we yet rejoyce that we have farther Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Praiſe him for the <hi>continued Evidence</hi> of the Grace of Chriſt in the moſt of thoſe we are acquainted with, whom from the Marks laid down in Scripture we look'd upon to be converted, and that the <hi>Livelineſs of Piety</hi> remains in many. For <hi>theſe</hi> there is alſo due a Return of Glory to God: and in Imitation of the pious Examples of the Saints in Scripture, we would earneſtly call on Them, Ourſelves, and Others, to yield it to Him.</p>
            <p>But as in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Days, in the later Days of the <hi>Reformers</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in all other Times of the extraordinary Influence of the Spirit of God and Revival of Piety, whether of a larger or leſs Extent; they have been but <hi>of a ſhort Duration;</hi> the Impreſſions
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005544_0003_10185AF24ECA8F60"/>
on many have been ineffectual to true Converſion, their Goodneſs has been like <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s of old, <hi>as the Morning Cloud and early Dew, which have quickly paſs'd away;</hi> yea, the DIVINE SPIRIT being ſlighted, he has withdrawn his Influence more than before, and given them up to a greater Blindneſs and Hardneſs than ever; yea the moſt flouriſhing Churches in Piety have ſoon loſt their vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Love to Chriſt like the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and declined to ſuch an hateful Lukewarmneſs of Religion, like that of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as to be on the Point of being utterly rejected:— So we have in our lively Times been fearful of the <hi>like Decay</hi> and <hi>Withdraw,</hi> and gave Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; and anſwerable to our Apprehenſions, they ſeem to be awfully coming to paſs, and are to be deeply lamented.</p>
            <p>And tho' in <hi>Seaſons</hi> of <hi>extraordinary Revivals,</hi> as in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Reformers</hi> Days, there were <hi>many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> among profeſſing Chriſtians; and no other cou'd be expected among us on the like Occaſion, which have been openly and repeatedly teſtified againſt by many of the Friends of this Revival in diverſe Parts of the Land: yet upon Obſervation of the ſeveral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches we reſpectively belong to, we cannot but alſo teſtify, that Diſorders and Errors have been both multiplied and magnified by unfriendly Reporters, much more than they really were where there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were any, but in many of our Churches there were none at all; and <hi>the Work of the</hi> HOLY SPIRIT in our Churches, <hi>as above deſcribed,</hi> has been grievouſly miſrepreſented and defamed, his genuine Operations overlooked or perverted, He has been denied of his deſerved Glory for them; but the <hi>Infirmities and Corruptions</hi> of Men, permitted of the righteous God as uſual to mingle with them, have been repreſented as <hi>the Work itſelf,</hi> and then under <hi>their Name</hi> this divine Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action awfully ſet at nought, as has alſo been uſual in other Revivals, to the Reproach of the World.</p>
            <p>Among other Abuſes it has been repreſented as if <hi>ſuch miſchievous Errors</hi> as <hi>theſe</hi> were <hi>prevailing</hi> among
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005544_0004_10185AF831C57868"/>
the <hi>Subjects</hi> of <hi>this Revival</hi> in <hi>theſe Churches,</hi> viz (1) That ſanctifying Grace in a Miniſter is neceſſary to render the Adminiſtration of Goſpel Ordinances valid. (2) That unconverted Miniſters are uncapable to be Inſtruments of converting People. (3) That Sanctification, [i. e. as deſcribed in the Aſſembly's ſhorter Catechiſm] is no Evidence of Juſtification. (4) That an unconverted Man ought not to pray. [5] That Aſſurance is eſſential to ſaving Faith, ſo that whoever ſavingly believes is certain of it and not in Darkneſs or Doubt about it. [6] That they ſlight the inſpired Scriptures as a perfect Rule of Faith and Duty. [7] That they may leave the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and follow Impulſes, Dreams &amp; Trances. And [8] That Good Works are vilified or ſlighted by them. For we can find but few in our Churches and in many of our Churches none at all holding any of <hi>theſe</hi> or any other <hi>Familiſtical</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Familiſtical</hi>— From a <hi>Sect</hi> who called themſelves <hi>the Family of Love:</hi> which denied the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith and Life, and that there is any Hell or Heaven but in us; and held that the Regenerate do not Sin, and that Grace within them is CHRIST himſelf &amp;c.</note> or <hi>Antinomian</hi>

                  <hi>Antinomian</hi> — i.e. <hi>Againſt the Law</hi> — a <hi>Sect</hi> who deny the moral Law to be a Rule of Life to Believers; and hold Juſtification from Eternity, that GOD ſees no Sin in his People, nor afflicts them for it, that Believers muſt not look at Grace within them or take any Comfort from the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it, and that Sanctification is no Evidence of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp;c.</note> Errors, which we teſtify againſt. But have the Pleaſure to ſee them more ſtrongly believing and more highly eſteeming <hi>the Bible</hi> than ever; that they only ſtyle <hi>our good Works</hi> as the Scriptures do — <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> conſider'd as <hi>a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to juſtify</hi> us in the Sight of the moſt holy God; and that the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>their Faith</hi> is the ſame as they have been all along inſtructed in from the Scripture Truths laid down in the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly's ſhorter Catechiſm;</hi> which has been generally receiv'd &amp; taught in the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> from it's firſt Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

for about theſe <hi>Hundred Years:</hi> which is therefore <hi>the Syſtem</hi> of Scripture Doctrine moſt generally and clearly declarative of <hi>the Faith</hi> of the <hi>New-England Churches;</hi> which Doctrines are very dear to <hi>the Subjects</hi> of this Revival in our own, being made more dear by the happy Experience of their Power and Influence; and we wiſh were as dear to thoſe who equally reproach their Perſons as their Creeds and Confeſſions of the glorious Truths of the Goſpel: and <hi>which excellent Confeſſions</hi> we are grieved to ſee even Publickly reviled among us.</p>
            <p>And as the <hi>Encouragers</hi> of <hi>this Revival,</hi> among whom we apprehend Ourſelves included, are injuriouſly charged with departing from the <hi>ancient Faith</hi> of <hi>theſe Churches;</hi> and as GOD in his Word requires us to make <hi>a publick Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>our Faith,</hi> and <hi>let the World know</hi> that <hi>we hold it faſt continually;</hi> as this is the Duty, Right and Liberty of every Chriſtian, eſpecially of every <hi>Miniſter;</hi> and we conceive no Seaſon can be more ſuitable than when we <hi>enter the Miniſtry,</hi> or are after <hi>repreſented as Erroneous,</hi> or when there are <hi>Jealouſies</hi> among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that many Miniſters have left the ancient Faith; as a <hi>meer Profeſſion</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> in CHRIST in general is no Declaration of what we really believe, inaſmuch as ſome who profeſs Him believe Him not to be GOD, others not to be <hi>Man,</hi> ſome that He is only GOD, ſome that He is only <hi>Man,</hi> and it may be ſome that He was only a <hi>meer Apparition;</hi>

               </note> yea as a late noted Writer <note n="†" place="bottom">Woolſton.</note> has in his own Example ſhown us, that a <hi>meer Profeſſion</hi> of our <hi>Belief</hi> of THE SCRIPTURE is no Declaration of our real Belief at all, inaſmuch as we may believe it <hi>not</hi> to be a <hi>real Hiſtory, but</hi> a <hi>meer Allegory:</hi> Therefore we cannot but judge that every <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and eſpecially every <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ought honeſtly and openly to make ſuch a <hi>definitive Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>their Faith</hi> in CHRIST and the SCRIPTURE, as the World may know what they really mean or would be underſtood to mean thereby. And
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005544_0006_10185AFB42486960"/>
as <hi>our Fathers</hi> made a <hi>publick Confeſſion</hi> of <hi>their Faith</hi> in <hi>their Day,</hi> and recommended it to us their Poſterity; we cannot but judge Ourſelves as <hi>Now</hi> called both by God and Man, and even obliged by Thoſe who write and ſpeak againſt us, to make ſuch <hi>a Publick Profeſſion</hi> of <hi>our own Faith</hi> to the World: and in particular <hi>openly</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> to DECLARE, that <hi>we have not departed from the ancient Faith of theſe Churches;</hi> but <hi>heartily adhere to the ſame;</hi> and look upon the ſaid <hi>Weſtminſter aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's ſhorter Catechiſm</hi> and the famous <hi>Confeſſion of Faith</hi> agreed on by our venerable <hi>Synod</hi> of 1680 (which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> for the refreſhing our Memory we have diligently read over at this Meeting) as moſt valuable Summaries of Chriſtian Doctrine, excellently expreſſing the Mind and Will of GOD as reveal'd in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice: and which <hi>Confeſſion</hi> we wiſh to be reprinted and diſperſed ſpeedily for the publick Benefit, and would earneſtly recommend both to Preachers and People, both of this and future Generations.</p>
            <p>We cannot but alſo obſerve that the <hi>principal Means</hi> of <hi>the late Revival</hi> were the <hi>more than ordinary preaching</hi> up <hi>ſuch Scripture</hi> and <hi>moſt important Doctrines</hi> as theſe — viz.

            <p>And as the <hi>more than ordinary Preaching</hi> up <hi>theſe great Truths</hi> of reveal'd Religion and experimental Piety, being the ſame which were ſo ſucceſsfully preached by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005544_0008_10185B0308026A40"/>
the firſt ſound and pious <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>New England,</hi> have been the <hi>principal Means</hi> of <hi>the late Revival;</hi> we are ſorry to ſee, that under the Name of <hi>New Light,</hi> many of the <hi>Preachers</hi> of theſe moſt important Truths, and eſpecially thoſe which concern the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> of the SPIRIT <hi>of Grace</hi> in bringing loſt and periſhing Souls to Chriſt, are by many run down and ridicul'd; as thoſe our pious <hi>Forefathers</hi> were in their Day, under the ſame or alike reproachful Terms, by many on the other Side of the Water; and <hi>they</hi> who <hi>Preach</hi> the <hi>ſame Truths</hi> of the Goſpel and experimental Piety as thoſe great Divines, <hi>Hooker, Cotton, Shepard, Goodwin, Owen, Flavel,</hi> the <hi>Mathers, Willard, Stoddard,</hi> are repreſented by ſome as <hi>New Light, Enthuſiaſtical</hi> or <hi>Antinomian</hi> Preachers: whereby the awful Danger grows of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>glorious Office</hi> of THAT DIVINE AGENT in the Work of Conviction, Converſion, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Comfort, firſt out of our Pulpits, and then out of the Land. Yea, to ſo deplorable a Paſs have ſome Traducers of this Revival brought us, that if any of the young Generation begin to leave off their Curſing, Swearing, immoderate Drinking, obſcene Diſcourſe, grow concern'd for their Souls, and repair to the Word; they are immediately branded and vilified by their vain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with the Name of <hi>New-Lights,</hi> and Efforts are made to laugh them out of their ſerious Concern for their Souls and Eternity; which we fear has been the ruinous Caſe of many.</p>
            <p>In ſuch an awful-Scituation of Things as this, we cannot but apprehend that the DIVINE HEAD of the Church now loudly calls <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>all others</hi> who ſeriouſly believe &amp; are deeply concerned for <hi>thoſe great Truths of the Goſpel</hi> as collected in the aboveſaid <hi>Catechiſm</hi> &amp; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith,</hi> with the Intereſt of <hi>vital Piety;</hi> — with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impoſing in the leaſt on Others, or aſſuming any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Conſcience of any, which we utterly abhor as directly contrary to the very Nature of Religion itſelf; — <hi>To unite</hi> our <hi>Reſolutions</hi> &amp; <hi>Endeavours,</hi> by all proper

                        <p>THE General Aſſembly being moved with Zeal for the Honour of God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, eſpecially at a Time when the Chriſtian Revelation is openly impugned, and <hi>Infidelity, Deiſm,</hi> and <hi>other Errors</hi> do ſo much prevail: They do hereby recommend to <hi>all Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Preachers,</hi> ſeriouſly to conſider &amp; obſerve the Directory of this Church concerning the Preaching of the Word, which is approven by the General aſſembly <hi>1645:</hi> And in particular, that they be careful to warn their Hearers againſt any Thing tending to <hi>Atheiſm, (1) Deiſm (2), Arianiſm (3), Socinianiſm (4), Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm (5), Bourignianiſm (6), Popery (7), Superſtition (8), Antinomianiſm (9),</hi>
                           <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the <hi>Explication</hi> of theſe Terms in the APPENDIX.</note>or <hi>any other Errors:</hi> &amp; that in their Sermons they inſiſt frequently upon the Truth, Neceſſity and Excellency of ſupernatural Revelation; the ſupreme <hi>Deity</hi> of the <hi>SON</hi> &amp; <hi>HOLY GHOST</hi> as well as of the <hi>FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER;</hi> together with the <hi>Oneneſs of the GODHEAD,</hi> our ſinful and loſt Eſtate by Nature, the Neceſſity of ſuper-natural Grace, and of Faith in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, without which the beſt Works cannot pleaſe God: and that they make it the great Scope of their Sermons, to lead Sinners from a <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> to a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> for Life and Salvation, and from <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Self</hi> to precious <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005544_0010_10185B08AD8E4AE0"/>And the General Aſſembly recommends to <hi>all who Preach</hi> the Goſpel, when they handle the Doctrines of God's redeeming Love, and of his free Grace in the Juſtification and Salvation of Sinners, the Bleſſings of the Redeemer's Purchaſe, and Priviledges of the new and better Covenant; to ſtudy to manage theſe Subjects, ſo as to lead their Hearers to an Abhorence of Sin, the Love of God and our Neighbours, and the Practice of univerſal Holineſs; ſeeing it is one great End of the Goſpel, to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and to teach Men to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World. Upon which Account, it is incumbent on <hi>all who preach</hi> the Goſpel, to inſiſt not only on the Neceſſity and Excellency of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation, but alſo upon the Neceſſity of Repentance for Sin, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from it; and to preſs the Practice of all moral Duties, both with reſpect to the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law, as indiſpenſably neceſſary, in Obedience to God's Command, to teſtify our Gratitude to Him, to evidence the ſincerity of our Faith, and for the Benefit of humane Society, the adorning, the Profeſſion of Religion, and making us meet for eternal Life, ſeeing without Holineſs no Man can ſee the Lord.</p>
                        <p>And the Aſſembly do ſeriouſly recommend to <hi>all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Preachers</hi> of the Goſpel, that in preſſing moral Duties, or Obedience to the Law, they ſhew the Nature and Excellency of Goſpel Holineſs, and enforce Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the moral Law both in Heart and Life, not from Principles of Reaſon only, but alſo and more eſpecially of Revelation. And, in order to attain thereto, it is neceſſary to ſhew Men the Corruption and Depravity of humane Nature by their Fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> their natural Impotence for and Averſion to what is ſpiritually Good; and to lead them to the true and <hi>only Source of all Grace and Holineſs, viz. Union</hi> with <hi>CHRIST,</hi> by the <hi>Holy SPIRIT's</hi> working <hi>Faith</hi> in us, and renewing us more and more after the Image of God: And to let their Hearers know that they muſt firſt be grafted into
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005544_0011_10185B0A37552558"/>
Chriſt as their Root, before their Fruit can be ſavoury unto God; that they muſt have a new Principle to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and a new End to direct them, before their Actions become gracious and acceptable in the Sight of God: And that they teach them the Neceſſity of living by Faith on the Son of God, in a conſtant Looking to and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Him, as the great Author of all gracious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, for the Performance of every Duty: And withal, that after their beſt Performances and Attainments, they muſt count them but Loſs and Dung in Point of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God; and make it their great Deſire only ;to be found in Christ and his Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>And that <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the <hi>Application</hi> of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, do endeavour rightly to divide the Word of Truth, ſpeaking distinctly to ſuch various Caſes of the <hi>Converted</hi> and <hi>Unconverted,</hi> as ariſe natively from the Subjects they have been handling: And that in the whole of their Diſcourſes, they take care to ſuit themſelves to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Hearers, as to Matter, Method and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and to the prevailing Sins of the Time and Place, with all prudent and zealous Freedom and Plainneſs: As alſo that they make <hi>Goſpel Subjects</hi> their <hi>main Theme</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> and preſs with all Earneſtneſs the Practice of moral Duties in a Goſpel Manner: And that they forbear delivering any Thing in Publick that may tend more to Amuſement than Edification; and beware of bringing into their Sermons and publick Diſcourſes Matters of doubtful Diſputation, which tend to gender Strife rather than to promote the Edification of Christians. And the Aſſembly exhort all to study to maintain the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</p>
                        <p>And finally, the General Aſſembly recommends to all <hi>Profeſſors of Divinity,</hi> to uſe their best Endeavours to have the <hi>Students</hi> under their Care, well acquainted with the true Method of Preaching the Goſpel, as above di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: And that <hi>Preſbyteries</hi> at their privy Cenſures inquire concerning the Obſervation of this Act.</p>

            <p>Thus far that excellent ACT.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005544_0012_10185B0C2F9997B8"/>And as we are perſwaded <hi>this Sort of Preaching</hi> is agreable to the main Deſign and Spirit of the Goſpel; we cannot but apprehend <hi>this</hi> to be <hi>the moſt ſeaſonable Time</hi> to recommend it, as the moſt likely way of guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all Kinds of Errors and Extreams on the Left Hand and Right; in particular the <hi>Socinian, Antinomian,</hi> and <hi>Arminian;</hi> and of preſerving both Truth and Piety with us; and earneſtly wiſh that <hi>thoſe great Goſpel Truths,</hi> and <hi>this evangelical Way of Preaching</hi> were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally encouraged and promoted both by Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>And as theſe are our ſerious Sentiments, Reſolutions and Deſires, as to the <hi>Doctrines of the Goſpel;</hi> we wou'd freely &amp; earneſtly invite <hi>all other Miniſters,</hi> who <hi>heartily approve</hi> them, <hi>to unite with us</hi> in <hi>expreſſing their Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the ſame,</hi> both <hi>Thoſe who are in the ſame Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> with us in the <hi>late Revival</hi> and <hi>Thoſe who are not;</hi> together with <hi>their Reſolutions</hi> by the Grace of God to maintain and promote the ſaid important Truths and Power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole; as in all that has been ſaid, we are far from impoſing our Sentiments on others, as if we intended to exclude them from our Communion or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; ſo we are equally grieved to find ſome endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pervert our Deſign, as if we aim'd at making <hi>new Creeds</hi> or Teſts of Communion, and others ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to be impos'd upon by ſuch an Abuſe, which we truſt they will be delivered from by this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration. And as we apprehend, this Land is yet bleſs'd with as excellent a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> for Learning, Soundneſs and Piety in general as any on Earth; we have Reaſon to fear there are <hi>groundleſs Separations</hi> from ſome, very offenſive to Chriſt, diſhonourable to his holy Religion and its late Revival among us: And we earneſtly wiſh that all of every Party would with Self-Jealouſy ſearch their Hearts and Ways, humble themſelves, turn to the Lord, and do their utmoſt to remove this and every other Scandal. We would alſo earneſtly beg the dear
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005544_0013_10185B119F42C6F0"/>
People of God, to beware of Separation and Alienation from <hi>Miniſters</hi> as if they were not <hi>pious</hi> or <hi>orthodox</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they are not in the ſame Sentiments with us in Reſpect to the late Revival, or ſee not Light to join with us in this Declaration; but exerciſe Charity towards them, without Prejudice hear them, and bear with their different Sentiments about thoſe Matters, as every Chriſtian ought, for the Honour of Chriſt and his Religion. And with Regard to <hi>ſuch Miniſters,</hi> we here take Occaſion to declare our ſelves ready to join with them in any juſt Meaſures which may have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Tendency to promote the Kingdom of God our Saviour.</p>
            <p>We conclude with Recommending the following Texts of Scripture to the ſerious Conſideration both of Miniſters and People on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Heb. x. 23. <hi>Let us hold faſt the Profeſſion of our Faith without wavering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rev. iii. 3, 11. <hi>Remember therefore how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt, and repent: Behold I come quickly! hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no Man take thy Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Col. iii. 12—14. <hi>Put on Bowels of Mercies, kindneſs, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another: If any Man have a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt any; even as</hi> CHRIST <hi>forgave you, ſo alſo do ye. And above all Things, put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1 Pet. iii. 8, 9. <hi>Be ye all of one Mind, having Compaſſion one of another; Love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, Bleſſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mat. v. 44, 45. <hi>Love your Enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you; that you may be the Children of your</hi> FATHER <hi>which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 Pet. iii. 17, 18. <hi>Ye therefore Beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe Things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfaſtneſs: But grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</hi> JESUS CHRIST: <hi>To Him be Glory both now and for ever,</hi> AMEN.</p>

            <p>AS <hi>Divines,</hi> as well as <hi>Teachers</hi> in <hi>all other Sciences,</hi> in order to a more <hi>comprehenſive</hi> Way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing, are obliged frequently to uſe <hi>many Terms</hi> which comprehend <hi>many Ideas</hi> that are commonly known among them; and as the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of SCOTLAND have accordingly made uſe of ſeveral ſuch in THEIR ACT above-recited: it is at the Deſire of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> who bear this Teſtimony, that for the Information of the <hi>People</hi> in general, there is here added ſome Explication of ſeveral Terms therein expreſſed; and this in Order as they lie in THE ACT, as follows—</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>ATheiſm</hi> — From <hi>Atheiſts:</hi> who deny the Being or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD, or his Creation or Providence.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Deiſm</hi>— From <hi>Deiſts:</hi> who tho' they believe the DEITY, yet deny the BIBLE to be given by divine Inſpiration.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Arianiſm</hi> — From <hi>Arius</hi> an <hi>Egyptian:</hi> who denied the DIVINE WORD and SPIRIT to be of the ſame Nature, Subſtance or Eſſence with the FATHER, and held the Divine SON and SPIRIT to be created Beings.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) <hi>Socinianiſm</hi>—From <hi>Socinus</hi> an <hi>Italian:</hi> who denied GOD's Omniſciency, the Deity of the SON and HOLY GHOST, original Sin, Election, the Satisfaction of CHRIST, the Imputation of his Righteouſneſs to our Juſtification, the Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT in our Regeneration; and held that we muſt believe nothing but what our ſhallow and depraved Reaſon comprehends, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">(5) <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> — From <hi>Arminius</hi> a <hi>Dutchman:</hi> A Syſtem which holds</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the Will of GOD to ſave ſuch as <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> is the whole Decree of <hi>Election</hi> to Salvation: that there is one Election to <hi>Faith,</hi> another to <hi>Salvation;</hi> ſo that Election to <hi>juſtifying Faith</hi> may be without peremptory Election to <hi>Salvation:</hi> that <hi>the good Pleaſure and Purpoſe of</hi> GOD whereof the Scripture makes mention in the Doctrine of Election, doth not conſiſt herein,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005544_0016_10185B1E0C7FA560"/>
that GOD did elect ſome certain Men rather than others; but in this, that GOD from among all poſſible Conditions, did chuſe as a <hi>Condition</hi> to Salvation, the <hi>Act of Faith</hi> in it ſelf ignoble, and the <hi>imperfect Obedience of Faith,</hi> and was graciouſly pleas'd to repute it for <hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it worthy of the Reward of everlaſting Life: That peremptory Election of ſingular Perſons is made by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>foreſeen perſevering Faith, Repentance, Sanctity, and Godlineſs:</hi> that ſome who were elected <hi>may</hi> and <hi>do</hi> for ever periſh: and that in this Life there is no Fruit, no Senſe, <hi>no Certainty</hi> of immutable Election unto Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That GOD the FATHER ordain'd his SON to the Death of the Croſs, without any certain &amp; determinate Counſel of ſaving any particular Man expreſly: That CHRIST by his Satisfaction did not certainly merit for any Man <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> but only purchaſed to his FATHER a Power or plenary Good-will of treating a new with Mankind, and of preſcribing them what new Conditions he pleaſed, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which Conditions ſhould depend on <hi>Man's free Will;</hi> and that therefore it might fall out that either no Man or every Man might fulfill them: That the <hi>New Covenant of Grace</hi> which GOD the FATHER, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of CHRIST's Death, made with Men, doth not conſiſt herein, viz. that we are juſtified before GOD and ſaved by <hi>Faith,</hi> as it apprehends the Merit of CHRIST; but herein, viz. that the Exaction of perfect legal Obedience being abrogated, GOD reputes <hi>Faith itſelf</hi> and the <hi>imperfect Obedience of Faith</hi> for <hi>perfect Obedience</hi> of the Law, and graciouſly thinks it worthy of the Reward of eternal Life; That all Men are received into the State of Reconciliation and Grace of the Covenant; ſo that no Body ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for <hi>Original Sin,</hi> nor in Reſpect of it be liable to Death or Damnation, but are all acquitted from the Guilt of that Sin: And whereas ſome, rather than others, are made Partakers of Forgiveneſs of Sins and Life eternal; that this Diverſity depends on <hi>their own Free-Will</hi> applying itſelf to Grace indifferently offered, but not upon the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Gift of Mercy</hi> effectually working in <hi>them</hi> rather than <hi>others,</hi> that they may apply this Grace unto themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That <hi>Original Sin</hi> is not of itſelf ſufficient for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all Mankind, or deſerving temporal and eternal Puniſhment: That <hi>the Will</hi> of Man was never corrupted, but only encumbered by the Darkneſs of the <hi>Underſtanding</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:005544_0017_10181383E4AF8E48"/>
and Unrulineſs of the <hi>Affections:</hi> That an <hi>unregenerate</hi> Man is <hi>not properly, nor totally dead in Sins,</hi> nor deſtitute of all Strength tending to ſpiritual Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but is able to hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs or everlaſting Life, and to offer the Sacrifice of an humble and contrite Heart, even ſuch as is acceptable to GOD: and that a <hi>corrupt and natural Man</hi> can ſo rightly uſe the Light of Nature, or thoſe Gifts which are left in him after the Fall; that by the good Uſe thereof he may attain to ſaving Grace and by Degrees at length Salvation it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That in <hi>true Converſion</hi> there cannot be infuſed by GOD any new Qualities, Habits or Gifts into <hi>the Will</hi> of Man; and ſo <hi>that Faith</hi> by which we are firſt converted and from which we are ſtyled Faithful, is not any Quality or Gift infuſed by GOD, but only an Act of Man: That the Grace whereby we are converted to GOD, is nothing elſe but a gentle Inducement perform'd by ſuaſory Motives: That no Cauſe can be alledged why even ſuch moral Grace alone ſhould not of <hi>natural</hi> Men make <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> That GOD doth not produce the Conſent of our Will otherwiſe than by Way of moral Suaſion: That GOD in regenerating a Man, doth not employ that omnipotent Strength, whereby he may powerfully and infallibly bow and bend his Will to Faith and Converſion: and that in <hi>Converſion,</hi> Grace does not in order of Cauſality go before the Action of the Will; i. e. that GOD doth not effectually help Man's Will unto Converſion before the Will of Man moveth and determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ſettleth it ſelf thereto.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That the <hi>Perſeverance</hi> of the Faithful is not an Effect of Election, or any <hi>Gift of</hi> GOD purchaſed by the Death of CHRIST; but a <hi>Condition</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> which is to be perform'd on <hi>Man</hi>'s Part by <hi>his own Free-will</hi> before his peremptory Election and Juſtification: That the <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate</hi> may not only totally and finally fall from juſtifying Faith, as alſo from Grace and Salvation; but that they do frequently fall from all Theſe and periſh eternally: That <hi>no Certainty</hi> of future <hi>Perſeverance</hi> can be had in this Life, without ſpecial Revelation: That the Doctrine maintaining <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Perſeverance and of Salvation, is of its own Nature a ſoft Pillow for the Fleſh, and hurtful to Godlineſs, good Manners, Praying, and other holy Courſes; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, that 'tis a very commendable Thing to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ſuch Perſeverance: That <hi>the Faith</hi> of thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005544_0018_10185B1F924D41C8"/>
but for a Seaſon, differs not from juſtifying and ſaving Faith, but only in Reſpect of <hi>Continuance:</hi> That 'tis not abſurd that a Man ſhould loſe his <hi>firſt Regeneration,</hi> and be again and again Regenerate; and that CHRIST never prayed for Believers infallible Perſeverance.</p>
            <p>This is a <hi>Summary</hi> of the <hi>Arminian Errors</hi> deſcribed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and refuted by the venerable and famous <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Dort</hi> in 1619. as contrary to the HOLY SCRIPTURES, as well as the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Churches.</hi>

            <p n="6">(6) <hi>Bourignoniſm</hi> — From <hi>Bourignon</hi> a popiſh enthuſiaſtical Woman of <hi>Flanders:</hi> —who held that GOD has made Man's Will independent on Himſelf, that this is Man's principal Reſemblance to GOD, and that GOD is ignorant of future humane Actions; that CHRIST had a Rebellion in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Will againſt the Will of GOD; that GOD cannot ſave by the Merits of another; that the Innocent cannot ſuffer for the Guilty, that our LORD's Body could not ſuffer for the great Crimes of ſo many Perſons; that 'tis a Falſhood to think CHRIST fully ſatisfied for us, and an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to expect Salvation fully from his Merits; that CHRIST ſubjecting Himſelf to Sufferings and becoming obedien<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>to Death, was not the <hi>Price</hi> of our Redemption, but to give us an <hi>Example</hi> of Meekneſs and Patience under our Trials; that a meritorious Addition of our Repentance, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and good Works, is neceſſary to purchaſe our Salvation; that the Doctrine of the TRINITY is an Error; that there is no vindictive Juſtice in the divine Nature; that Prayer and hearing Sermons are needleſs to Salvation; that GOD has no eternal Decrees; that <hi>Man</hi> may be in a gracious State and yet apoſtatize and periſh; and that <hi>her Writings</hi> are given by divine Inſpiration, and are <hi>new holy Scriptures.</hi> And yet with all theſe horrible Errors ſhe <hi>profeſs'd to believe the Bible.</hi> See <hi>Blackwell</hi>'s Ratio Sacra.</p>
