            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SOME may aſk, why I have not taken notice, in the following pamphlet, of Porcupine's life? to which I would anſwer, that this pamphlet was written and ready for the preſs before he publiſhed his life; and as he has brought forward no fact or argument to induce me to change my belief, but rather to confirm it, with reſpect to his being "a hireling writer;" I declined altering it, or taking any notice of his life. But if I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to write another pamphlet, "out of his own mouth will I condemn him;" and prove to the world, whatever his ſupporters may think of him, that it is true what the Reviewers have ſaid of his writings, that "they are a diſhonor to any party." And more I will prove, that he and his party had ſupported their meaſures by falſehood, and miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in proof of this I will recur to one fact only, on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It is a well known circumſtance that all the writers, in ſupport of the treaty, from Philadelphia on to the eaſtward, raiſed the "hue and cry" among the farmers, that if they would not turn out and petition in ſupport of the treaty, it would be rejected; and the conſequence finally would be, that their grain would become a mere drug, they would find no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket for it; and it would lie, and rot on their hands. But when the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was adopted to their entire ſatisfaction, and time brought round things in their natural order; what was the conſequence that actually took place, which we have heard, which we have ſeen; and which is known to every farmer from one end of the union to the other. Then I will tell you Mr. Fenno, pſhaw! its nothing more than about ſix, or ſeven weeks after the treaty was finally ratified; wheat and flour fell in New-York, and many other towns, to nearly one half leſs than it was previous to the adopting of the treaty; what think you of the treaty now Johnney? go bluſh ye fabricators! Ye falſe ſtory-tellers! and hide your heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pumpkin vines of Connecticut, and Maſſachuſetts; and amuſe your countrymen by fabricating marvellous ſtories. Go tell them! that one of Mr. Ames's conſtituents had a large turkey cock, that hatched a dozen of eggs in conſequence of the treaty's being ratified; and that the clouds poured forth ſhowers of fiſh, upon the plantation of one of Mr. Buck's conſtituents. Go tell them! that the cats would not kitten, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the yews bring forth their young, nor their young men bundle with the bonny laſſes, unleſs the treaty would be adopted. Go ye fabulators! and ſing hoſannas to the Lord, and tell your countrymen, that even the mules of Connecticut have become prolific ſince the treaty was ratified.</p>
            <p>"But Porcupine abuſes all men!" exclaimed a republican, to a well known ariſtocrat with whom I was converſing the other day; "you are miſtaken, replied the gentle ariſtocrat, he has in the hiſtory of his life paid Mr. Carey a very handſome compliment;" and ſo the matter ended between them. But in order to ſatisfy my own curioſity, I went and purchaſed the hiſtory of his life; and to my great ſurpriſe I found the compliment to be preciſely this, that Mr. Carey had acted with reſpect to Porcupine, in concealing his perſon from the public, as a man of honor; and Porcupine ſimply relates the cricumſtance, but with evident reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030155_0003_0FE4B03FE4B80A28"/>
now where is the compliment? If Porcupine by ſaying it was an act of honor in Mr. Carey to conceal his perſon, had made it become ſo, as the edict of kings has often attached honor, or diſhonor to an action; then, and not until then would he have paid Mr. Carey a compliment. For the action was itſelf an honorable one, and the opinion of Porcupine, or any other individual will neither make it more nor leſs ſo. If every man who performs an honorable action muſt be under a compliment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it eſtabliſhes at once a check upon every virtuous proceeding; and we are in future to look for honour and virtue, only among ſlaves and cowards; where we have the leaſt proſpect of finding them. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that Mr. Carey treated him with a certain degree of contempt, on his firſt interview with him; and wiſhes for another yellow fever, that he might alſo acquire a fortune. The inſinuation here conveyed is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that is, that Mr. Carey has become elate with proſperity. I have converſed with him both before and ſince the yellow fever, and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcovered any change in his conduct; and am perſuaded an hundred others in town will ſay the ſame thing. He has underwent a change it is true, but it is a change of a different nature from what Porcupine inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; it is the change of care into contentment on finding his induſtry rewarded; it is a change which every man, under the ſame circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt feel, who lives among "a people where riches fix the only conſideration," where men are eſteemed and careſſed only in proportion to their wealth.—An artful ſentiment indeed, that riches ought to fix the only conſideration, for <hi>our modern fine gentlemen of yeſterday</hi> to introduce to obtain reſpect, whoſe merit is commenſurate with their riches; and whoſe genius or abilities is below the notice of mankind; for deprive them of their wealth and you rob them of the only merit they poſſeſs. Were they elſwhere, but by their own fire ſides — were they elſewhere, but in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, they would find to their eternal ſhame, that ſomething more than riches would be neceſſary, to render them reſpectable in the opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Had Mr. Carey, like Mr. Y—, when he acquired a fortune, plumed himſelf in a bob-tailed coat, with the collar hanging half way down his back, and bedaubed with powder; had he, like him, purchaſed a country houſe, and drive in his carriage every morning behind his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with a tippee cane in his hand; would he, like him, when a poor man comes into his ſhop, to purchaſe a pamphlet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>HAD a writer, who ſtiles himſelf Porcupine, taken the advice of Doctor Swift, when he publiſhed his two firſt pieces; he might have paſſed on the world as a humorous facetious writer.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a <hi>brain</hi> that will endure but one <hi>ſcumming;</hi> let the owner gather it with diſcretion, and manage his little ſtock with huſbandry.

                  </gap>ogs.</note> The citizens being unaccuſtomed to receive ſuch pieces, from the preſs of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican printer, their novelty procured them a general circulation; whilſt the ridicule they contained ſerved to indulge a ſpirit of party ſpleen: by exciting mirth at the expence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For moſt men may be laughed out of their money, but there are few who can be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned out of it. The rapid ſale of his two firſt pieces enſured him ſucceſs, with the party whoſe cauſe he had eſpouſed; and a foreign agent, finding to what advantage his turn for ridicule might be employed, to ſupport the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted cauſe of a Britiſh faction, has conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paid him ſeveral viſits; this has been ſome time ago made known to the public, and is now generally believed. What a cabal was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030155_0005_0FE4B042F628C2E8"/>
raiſed againſt citizen Genet, three years ago, becauſe a certain party had aſſerted, that he interfered in the internal government of our country. Admitting he did interfere, was he more culpable than the other, who does it by means of an hireling. Surely his being a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of this city, and a tory; nay were he the royal aſs himſelf, it would never juſtify him in the opinion of thoſe, who regard the internal peace and happineſs of their country. Had Porcupine confined himſelf to tranſlations from the French, and giving inſtructions in that language, to thoſe who thought proper to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him; he would not have drawn upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the juſt indignation of a whole people; for thoſe inſults and groſs epithets, with which he has vilified them. Nor would we have ſeen him under the contemptible alternative of forg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a letter;<note n="†" place="bottom">See his Scare-Crow.</note> wherein he cenſures himſelf for his groſs calumny; that he might, by that mean, afford himſelf an opportunity of vindicating his conduct, and apologiſing for thoſe inſults he has given to the American citizens. He has now opened a book-ſtore, through the bounty of this <hi>pious</hi> agent, and his intereſt tells him, he ought, to conciliate the affection and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of all parties. For it is aſſerted, by ſome, that his employer having now gained his point; and having diſcovered by his laſt pieces, that the fountain has nearly ran dry, and an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal drought muſt ſucceed; he has conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrawn his golden auſpices, and thrown
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030155_0006_0FE4B046EA172580"/>
Porcupine on the mercy of an offended people. But a momentary contrition will not palliate for mob, banditti, &amp;c. with which he has ſo often vilified the peaceable citizens of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; cut-throats and murderers, with which he has abuſed their friends the French; thieves and robbers, with which he has calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated the Iriſh; who contributed ſo largely, in the late revolution, to humble the bluſtering pride of Britain. How far the different parties, whom he accuſes, are deſerving of his calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſlander, we need have recurrence but to a few facts, and arguments, to diſcover. There has not been, in my remembrance, a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the inhabitants, in this city, ſince after the eſtabliſhment of peace in eighty-three; who ſhewed the leaſt diſpoſition to riot, or act in open defiance of the laws of the ſtate, or of humanity and decorum; except one<note n="*" place="bottom">It was this mob, or a party of it, that dragged from their lodgings, to the Aſſembly-room, the members in the minority of the ſtate legiſlature, who had withdrawn on taking the queſtion, "Shall the federal conſtitution be now adopted," and compelled them to make a quorum, that the houſe might proceed to take the vote.</note> on the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of the federal conſtitution, when ſome of Porcupine's preſent friends—the old tories of '76—the very ſcum of ſociety, aſſembled together, and were headed by a certain gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; who led them (it was after night) to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable clergyman's houſe in this city; who was a known friend to the revolution, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted him and his family, with every mark of indignity. The next day it was affirmed, by an eye-witneſs, that this ſame gentleman, who
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030155_0007_0FE4B04B8ED50328"/>
headed the mob, went upon his hands and feet, at the clergyman's door; and <hi>bow-wowed</hi> in imitation of one of his domeſtic animals, in hopes of gaining admiſſion The odium of a bankruptcy, and a derangement of his pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary circumſtances, ſtill preſſing heavily upon his ſhoulders; he cunningly took this method to recommend himſelf to a certain party, who have always had the banks, the principal ſource of wealth, under their direction.

            <p>The next mob that appeared was during the time of the embargo; when a party of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſailors aſſembled, and paraded through the ſtreets, in a haughty manner. They marched up behind congreſs-hall where the members were ſitting; and became noiſy and clamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in ſuch a degree, that one of Porcupine's party, not knowing it was his friends who had aſſembled there, got greatly alarmed, ſtarted from his ſeat, and made a motion for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of Congreſs, to ſome other place.</p>
            <p>The laſt collection of people, who had the leaſt appearance of a mob, ſhewed themſelves at the cloſe of the town meeting, in the State-Houſe yard, laſt ſummer; when ſome boys, to the number, perhaps, of two hundred; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were ſeveral ſailors, who wiſely foreſaw, that the treaty would afford them no protection, againſt the inhumanity and ſavage cruelty of the Britiſh; paraded through ſome of the ſtreets, burnt the treaty in effigy, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030155_0008_0FE4B04D15A32F40"/>
proceeded to the houſe of a certain ſenator, and broke a ſingle pane of glaſs, in one of his windows; without ſhewing any other mark of a riotous diſpoſition. And it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that even that ſolitary pane would not have been broken, had not a well known Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who was riding forward in company with the proprietor of the houſe, the folly and preſumption, to get upon one of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's coach-horſes, and attempted to ride down the boys; in order to ingratiate himſelf, no doubt, into the eſteem of the ſenator and his family. Such a wild, and extravagant attempt of a ſorry individual like him, who was, and is himſelf deteſted by the people, was ſufficient to excite them, to that ſingle act, of outrage—and it did ſo. As ſoon as they diſcovered, that it was the noble Viſcount, who was on horſeback; ſome one of the mob, who accidentally had a ſtump of an old fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rod, or a ſmall pole, in his hand, ran up to our modern Don Quixote, and gave him a blow acroſs his ſhoulders; which ſo cooled his courage, that he ſcampered off <hi>Sans ceremonie.</hi> If I have in the above narrative of facts miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any circumſtance, I am willing to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected; but, I believe, there are too many living witneſſes in this city, to day, that will bear teſtimony of the truth of what I have here related, with reſpect to mobs. And I am convinced, that upon a candid examination and enquiry, mobs will be as rarely met with, in other parts of the union, as in Philadelphia;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030155_0009_0FE4B04F9BB1A920"/>
ſo that Porcupine, inſtead of caſting an odium on the friends of Republicaniſm, has called forth an examination of facts, which recoil with diſhonour upon the very heads of his ſupporters.</p>
            <p>With regard to the murders and outrages committed by the French nation; there are none who will believe a ſingle fact ſtated by Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, except credulous children, or prejudiced old women ſinking into their dotage. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a nation ſo enlightened as the French, "and always, ſays Mr. Bruce, foremoſt in the acts of benevolence and humanity," would tie men and women in pairs, and drown them by tens, and by fifties; nay even ſink boat loads of them, and thus wantonly ſport with the lives of their fellow creatures, as Porcupine aſſerts, is what no man in his ſenſes can ever believe. For calumny herſelf bluſhes at the exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—humanity treats it as an inſult—rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and truth ſpurn the daring impoſition —whilſt poor credulity is upon the rack. The implacable hatred, which Engliſhmen are known to entertain towards the French nation, ought to put every prudent man upon his guard; before he gives his aſſent, to all thoſe Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine accounts of "horrid maſſacres;" a man who is a declared enemy to the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the liberties of mankind in general. What confidence can we place in the veracity of a man, who would ſit down and deliberate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell the world, as Porcupine did, that there were two hundred gaming-tables kept in this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030155_0010_0FE4B05644F86A48"/>
city by Frenchmen?<note n="*" place="bottom">If I am rightly informed, Porcupine will find, that one of his own countrymen kept the principal gambling table in town.</note> John Fenno himſelf, who is not very remarkable for his modeſty, when an opportunity offers of abuſing the French nation, allows there were but about twenty; before they were expelled by the magiſtracy. By this falſe aſſertion, he endeavoured to caſt a diſhonourable reflection on the republican par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but gamblers were never known to be the friends of a republican government. Thoſe French are well known to be men of ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic principles, the aſſociates of Porcupine; who were expelled France, and the Weſt-India Iſlands for attempting to ſubvert the liberties of the people; and having no means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting themſelves they had recourſe to gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. They are now baniſhed, and it is to be lamented, the corporation had not taken earlier ſteps to have them puniſhed; before their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy produced thoſe evils it did. Exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own proweſs, and calumniating their enemies, are tricks, which the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been always known to practiſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their poor deluded ſubjects. He muſt be very little acquainted with the Britiſh accounts of the American revolution, who does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the truth of what is here advanced. For every battle they gained was magnified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a victory; and the American character was degraded, by them, to a level with the uncivil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized Indian of the woods. With the Heſſians, in particular, they were ſolicitous in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030155_0011_0FE4B057CE00FDD0"/>
the Americans, as a cruel, vindictive, and ſavage people; in order to rouſe them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit acts of wanton barbarity. And I have the authority of an Engliſh gentleman in ſaying, that theſe impreſſions are not yet entirely worn off his countrymen. Many people in England, who live remote from the ſeaports and have but little means of information, believing to this day, that the citizens of the United States, are ſcarcely a degree removed above unciviliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and he aſſigned this as a reaſon, why ſo few of the farmers, and labouring poor, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate to this country.</p>
            <p>That the French have gullotined, every man who was brought before their tribunals of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, is no evidence of their cruelty and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but is the fulleſt proof of their lenity and forbearance; becauſe it was not until after their crimes became ſo notorious, that even the ſlighteſt doubt could not be entertained of their criminality, that they were brought before their tribunals; when the united voice of the people, and the preſervation of the republic, required their execution. Their condemnation was the reſult of irreſiſtible neceſſity, and not of choice, or wanton barbarity. The Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans were forced into thoſe ſanguinary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by the ſtupid obſtinacy of the royaliſts —an obſtinacy which nothing could conquer but death.</p>
            <p>That the accounts of maſſacres, in France, publiſhed by Porcupine, Fenno, and Webſter; are often falſe and exaggerated, I can teſtify
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030155_0012_0FE4B05956943A48"/>
upon the authority of ſome French citizens; men of education and principle, reſiding here. Theſe gentlemen have frequently read, in the public papers, of perſons being gullotined, who were actually living when they received their laſt accounts from France; and which was many months ſubſequent to the time, wherein it was ſaid, that thoſe perſons were executed. No doubt there have been many gullotined, in the courſe of the revolution; but when the clouds of prejudice are diſſipated, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial inveſtigation of all the facts, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, take place, relating to thoſe who ſuffered under theſe ſanguinary meaſures; I am perſuaded, there will be but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber found amongſt them, of the innocent and unoffending.</p>
            <p>Although there be no principle of candour, truth and honour, which Porcupine has not violated, in his abuſe of the French nation; yet he is not alone cenſurable, for Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has trodden the path before him. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in his writings, has endeavoured to prove, that it was not from diſintereſted motives, France took an active part in the American revolution; but to pull down the enormous and overbearing pride, of England. Admitting this was the motive, which made France de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare war againſt that power, this all men muſt acknowledge, that if their motives in ſerving us were not ſo pure, as Mr. Hamilton wiſhes, they certainly loved us more than Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain did; and if they loved us more, ought not
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030155_0013_0FE4B05BDFEC1A98"/>
our gratitude to be in proportion to that love, in preference to Britain, as theirs was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to us. Why then reject their overtures for entering into a treaty, both friendly and advantageous; and meanly crouching ſolicit England to grant us one, which is equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to our intereſt, as degrading to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dignity and honour? Although I believe univerſal benevolence and diſintereſted friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, are found amongſt mankind, in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate individual capacity; yet I could never learn from hiſtory, that they were ever found amongſt monarchies. I am perſuaded Mr Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton cannot produce, from hiſtory, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of monarchies, whether ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, being actuated towards each other; with that cordial attachment, as has been known to exiſt between Republics. What have we then to expect from our union with England? Has not experience already convinced us, that when her intereſt is concerned, every principle of juſtice, of humanity, and the law of nations, are violated by her in their turn; to gratify her rapacious, haughty, and overbearing ſpirit. To illuſtrate what has here been ſaid, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the diſintereſtedneſs of monarchies, let us take a general view of the kingdoms in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, for a few years back. England, in the laſt Turkiſh and Ruſſian wars, aſſiſted the Turks privately, againſt the Ruſſians; ſhe has ſince the commencement of the preſent revolution, entered into a triple alliance, with the Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Ruſſians, againſt the Turks. In the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030155_0014_0FE4B063866ACAB0"/>
American revolution, Spain aſſiſted France a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt England, and in the preſent revolution ſhe aſſiſted England againſt France; and it is univerſally believed, if a general peace does not ſoon take place, ſhe will join the French againſt the Engliſh. England has ſought ſeveral times for, and againſt, the Hollanders. Behold the haughty contemptible Victor Amadeus, king of Sardinia; who, not many months ago, ſwore eternal enmity to the French republicans, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his knees before the Executive Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, the very ſame republicans, like a diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſnivling ſchool-boy, aſking pardon for his former tranſgreſſions; and declaring, with the ſame lying tongue, with which he curſed them, that if they will pardon him his folly and preſumption, he will, in future, be to them a faithful ally. It is more than probable the next account we receive from Europe, of this bigotted old monarch, is that he is marching the ſhattered remains of his army againſt the Engliſh and Auſtrians. Was it not, three years ago, equally as improbable, in the opinion of all Europe, that the king of Sardinia would aſk pardon of the National Directory, for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and folly; as that the idiot George the third, would three years hence, be upon his bended knees, begging of the National Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, in the ſame humiliating voice, forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his tranſgreſſions? National pride, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, folly, and intereſt, are the governing, and only motives, which actuate kings towards each other; and which give riſe to all this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatility
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030155_0015_0FE4B06511754CA0"/>
of conduct: For no man of common ſenſe ſurely will ſay, it was the effect of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted friendſhip.</p>
            <p>But France, more enlightened and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous than all the reſt, gave America early proofs of her friendſhip; by entering into a treaty of amity and commerce, in the moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous times, involving herſelf in a general war, at the hazard of looſing ſome of her moſt valuable poſſeſſions. And to convince Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and the world, more fully; that her form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſervices were not the effect of a temporary, ſordid, ſelfiſh intereſt; ſhe has ſince made over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for entering into a treaty anew; on prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the moſt honourable, and flattering, to the national dignity of America, and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous to her intereſts. But Mr. Hamilton, "ſtiff in opinion always in the wrong," by his influence in the cabinet council of America, defeated her friendly deſigns; and rendered all her overtures abortive. Let us now admit, that France took an active part in the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution from intereſted motives; for we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it only, becauſe Meſſrs. Hamilton and Smith,<note n="*" place="bottom">S. Carolina.</note> with all their contemptible quibbles, will never be able to prove it; until they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the underſtandings of men, that France would have gone to war with England, at that period, independent of the ſolicitations of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. It is a fact, known to the whole world, that America ſolicited the friendſhip and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of France, and that ſhe granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030155_0016_0FE4B0669D023560"/>
which was beyond all controverſy an act of friendſhip, if there be any ſuch thing as friendſhip in this world. Hence it follows, from what we have admitted, that France was actuated by two motives, that is, a friendſhip for America, and a perſonal intereſt ſhe had in checking the domineering pride, and arrogance of England. This perſonal intereſt, and the independence of America, which was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence of ſuch a check, were the only objects the two countries had in view. In accompliſhing theſe, France being governed by two motives, it is certain, ſhe would act with a vigor proportioned to the force of thoſe motives—ſhe did ſo; and American independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was ſecured. Let me now aſk the ex-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and his coadjutor, was there no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in her ſending her armies, and her fleets, to fight our battles, both by ſea and land?—was there no friendſhip in her furniſhing our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and our privateers, with ammunition, and arms; the only neceſſary means of defence? —was there no friendſhip in her opening her ports, for the ſale of the prizes captured by our privateers?—was there no friendſhip in her ſupplying our naked and defenceleſs citizens, with her manufactures, the abſolute neceſſaries of life—and was there no friend in her opening her treaſury, and lending us five million of dollars: were all theſe nothing? Speak thou demons of ingratitude and anſwer me.</p>
            <p>Much has been ſaid, by Mr. Hamilton in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, in his writings, againſt the French,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030155_0017_0FE4B0691E44DEF0"/>
about motives. The doctrine of motives is perhaps one of the moſt obſcure, and ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in nature. For an individual to attempt to pry into the feelings of mens heart's, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover the ſecret ſprings of actions which may there operate, is at once abſurd, and preſumptuous; it belongs to omniſcience only to view the motives, and ſecret ſprings of action with men; and conſider them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. If I ſolicit a favour of my neighbour, and he grants my requeſt; I want no more to complete my happineſs, ſo far as the ſupply of a ſingle want will render me happy. I am not to enquire, whether his motive in ſerving me, was diſintereſted, or not; admitting it was, in this caſe, it is an imaginary good only; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can pretend to diſcover what men's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are, the action muſt either be reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or performed. It is not by motives we live, but by actions; and conſidering or judging of men's motives ſubſequent to their actions, will never feed the hungry, nor clothe the naked. If my neighbour renders me a ſervice, it is the moſt certain proof which I could receive from him, that he entertains no hatred toward me; and if he entertains no hatred towards me, but renders me an eſſential ſervice, what is he? is he not my friend? if he be not, I know not who is; I am apprehenſive I will not find one in Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton. Actions are to motives, what light is to the ſun, were it not for them we could have no idea of men's motives, no more than we could have an idea of the ſun, were it not for his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030155_0018_0FE4B06E294CCCB8"/>
light. Now to ſuppoſe the ſun an impure and opaque body, becauſe he diffuſes light, is not a greater abſurdity, than to ſuppoſe a man who is capable of friendſhip and of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friendly action; is governed by baſe and ſelfiſh motives. If by ſerving my friend, I ſerve myſelf at the ſame time, am I to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as a ſelfiſh intereſted man, Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton ſays yes,<note n="*" place="bottom">If Mr. Hamilton does not expreſsly ſay ſo, his writings admit no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deduction.</note> but I anſwer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for if he, in conſequence of that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, rejects my friendſhip, I will then conſider him as the ſurly dog—would neither ſuffer me to do myſelf a kindneſs, nor would he receive one of my hands, becauſe I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly ſerving myſelf. Is he not the ſelfiſh man, who would allow himſelf only to receive the good I would do? nay, is he not ſomething worſe than a ſelfiſh man, who would deprive himſelf of that good, that he might alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive his benefactor, from rendering himſelf alike ſervice. A virtuous man will always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, when he finds a two fold good reſulting from an action; but according to Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's reaſoning, becauſe a two fold good aroſe from the ſervice of the French, during the late revolution; that is, they procured the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of America; whilſt they added to their own conſequence, in the balance of the European powers, we ought to treat them as a ſelfiſh intereſted nation. I repeat again, that a virtuous man will always rejoice, when
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030155_0019_0FE4B070F5F0E620"/>
he finds a two fold good reſulting from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but Mr. Hamilton and his coadjutor, ſnarl at it, and call the French a ſelfiſh, wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and intereſted people. That a man of Mr. Hamilton's abilities, would advance ſuch prepoſterous arguments, as he ſo frequently does, in his writings, is to me the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment in life. For this ſingularity in him, I can find no better ſolution, than the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Mr. Duncan; ſpeaking, in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to his logic, of the happy talent ſome men poſſeſs of unravelling, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light upon, the moſt intricate ſubjects; "others, ſays he, confound the eaſieſt ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, their underſtandings ſeem to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed awry, &amp;c." From what has been here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced upon the doctrine of motives, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced every candid thinking man will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the conduct of the French nation towards America, during her ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for liberty, was highly honorable and friendly, and worthy of a magnanimous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or admitting ſhe was intereſted, a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold good reſulted to the world from her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, during that period; and therefore ought not to leſſen, but doubly encreaſe, our grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and eſteem. How unanimous were the citizens, ſix years ago, in declaring their ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and unfeigned attachment to that nation; they would have continued in theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had not Mr. Hamilton, like a muſhroom of yeſterday, ſtarted up and poiſoned their minds, by endeavouring to impreſs them with
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030155_0020_0FE3F820EC2D3440"/>
the belief, that gratitude to the French nation was repugnant to their intereſt; this was the mean by which he collected all the men of ſordid principles in the union, and ſeveral la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, around him; they became his ſteady friends, and the open avowed enemies of France. For there is no tie of gratitude, no principle of honour and virtue, which avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men will not ſacrifice, to accompliſh their ſordid views. It is aſſerted, upon good authority, that Mrs. Maginnis was among the number of thoſe ladies, which Mr. Hamilton let into the ſecrets of the funding ſyſtem; whether this particular kindneſs to her, was owing to her ſteady attention to him, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him always with a clean room, and a freſh pullet; when he went to ſup with her, is of no conſequence to the public. It is howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well known, to all the gentlemen of the quill, at the different banks, that ſhe ſpeculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed largely; and has been enabled by her ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and the bounty of her viſitors, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire on the fruits of her labour. Having ſince purchaſed a ſnug houſe, a coach, a footman in genteel livery; ſhe now drives about the city in great ſplendor, the warmeſt advocate of Mr. Hamilton's meaſures.<note n="*" place="bottom">What a glorious proof, it is, of the purity of Mr. Hamilton's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, when all the whores and ruſſians, from New-Hampſhire to Georgia, are become his advocates. From Mrs. Maginnis, even down to Porcupine, F—o, and W—r.</note> It is ſaid alſo, that ſhe has already begun to canvaſs votes for Mr. Latimer, at the next election, as ſhe ſtill has great influence amongſt a certain deſcription
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030155_0021_0FE4B0750832D4C8"/>
of gentlemen. What Doctor Charles Davenant ſaid of a party that exiſted in England in his time, may be alſo ſaid, with great truth, of thoſe friends of Mr. Hamilton, whom avarice collected around him; "an ignorant, ſays he, mercenary, and ſervile crew; unanimous in evil; diligent in miſchief, variable in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, conſtant to flattery, talkers for liberty; but ſlaves to power," ſtiling themſelves fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſts, and the Preſident's only friends. From the influence Mr. Hamilton's writings has had, in giving a tinge to the American character, I am convinced it will render them the contempt, and ſcorn, of Europe. Have we not daily ſtriking proofs of my aſſertion? have not the American citizens been treated with coldneſs by the French?—have they not been vexed, harraſſed, and buffetted by the Engliſh? —and have not the Algerines, one of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt contemptible powers in that part of the globe, compelled us to purchaſe a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the enormous ſum of twelve hundred thouſand dollars?</p>
            <p>When we turn aſide from viewing his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards the French—the manner in which it has influenced the public ſentiment, to that nation; the only one from whom America could expect to receive real acts of friendſhip; and view his conduct with regard to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States internally, I am apprehenſive, we will find as little cauſe of approbation and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nygeric. Let us therefore take a general view of his conduct, from the meeting of the feder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030155_0022_0FE4B07C8E172998"/>
convention. In that enlightened body of patriots, for patriots they were, in compariſon to Mr Hamilton, we find him making a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the eſtabliſhment of a monarchial go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and when he failed, in his attempts, to get ſuch a form introduced into the United States, he got offended, like a capricious ſilly girl; and left the convention in a pout;<note n="*" place="bottom">It is generally underſtood, that when attached to the Preſident's houſehold, in the late revolution, he left it alſo in a pout; and that he is very much addicted to thoſe little girliſh poutings; for ſhame colonel Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, once the great Financier General of America!</note> for all his fine oratory was loſt in a breath of air. How mortifying, muſt it have been, to a man of his ambitious views and nice feelings to be thus early diſcomfited, in his political career; and in an object too wherein he ſeemed ſo warmly intereſted. However, he meditated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and he ſought for it. On finding the conſtitution admitted great latitude of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive power, he returned to the convention and ſigned the conſtitution; but with ſtrong marks of diſapprobation, declaring that he ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it only in conſequence of its ambiguity, in defining the powers of the different branches of government. The conſtitution being now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and ſoon becoming popular; from the confidence the citizens placed in General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Doctor Franklin, and ſome others; Mr. Hamilton had no alternative, to preſerve his popularity with the leading party, but to join, in conjunction with Mr. Madiſon,<note n="†" place="bottom">It was not, until ſome time after, that the public were let into the ſecret, that Mr. Madiſon was concerned in writing the Federaliſt: But Mr. Hamilton is not the only one who founded a reputation upon the merits of a modeſt man.</note> and write
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030155_0023_0FE4B07E3929B678"/>
in ſupport of it. Having thus eſtabliſhed his reputation, as a man of abilities, and a warm federaliſt, amongſt the real friends of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; and poſſeſſing an inſinuating manner of addreſs, it procured him many friends; who were active in promoting his advancement, to the head of the treaſury department, on the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization of the conſtitution. It was now, that he had the fulleſt opportunity of indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that revenge, which he meditated on ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtitution; by inſulting the good ſenſe of the citizens. No ſooner was he fixed in his office, than he endeavoured to introduce all the etiquette, buſtle, noiſe and impertinence of royalty; by introducing levees, a courtly gazette, &amp;c. the latter under the direction of John Fenno, of pious memory; who ſtuffed it occaſionally with all the nonſenſe, and empty ſound of royalty, &amp;c. Juſt arrived in town, ſays Mr. Fenno, in his paper, the honourable Mr. ſuch a one, &amp;c. Many thinking, ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded citizens, became doubtful of Mr. Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no's outward piety, conſidering all this traſh and nonſenſe, as an inſult offered to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings. His paper, in conſequence, loſt its circulation; and to ſave his reputation, he was under the neceſſity of changing it into a daily gazette; and depend on the ſpeculators, and a few governmental men, for its ſupport. He interſperſed it occaſionally, with ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaying of ſome good old woman to the eaſtward, who, perhaps, ſuffered under the martyrdom of witchcraft; probably his old

When they have ſuppreſſed theſe, or to ſpeak with more truth, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; when by reaſon of their old age, theſe have left them; they begin to think that they are pious, and are on the ſtrait path to obtain an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of bliſs. But they either forget, or do not wiſh to underſtand, that malevolence, falſehood, ſpiritual pride and ill nature; when indulged, or practiſed in any degree; reduce us to the character of devils; theſe are properly the evils of the mind. The truly pious will be careful, in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the evils of the one, as well as thoſe of the other.</note> for he ſeldom ſhews a conſcientious ſcrupulouſneſs, in ſaying the moſt uncharitable things, of thoſe who are oppoſed to him in principle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gild it over with ſome pious ſaying; but the devil, as well as Mr. Fenno, has been often known to aſſume the character of a religious man, in order to accompliſh his diabolical ſchemes. Whilſt the traſh, and nonſenſe of his paper, was juſt cauſe of regret to many genuine republicans; it afforded others, of more levity, much cauſe of laughter and ridicule. To hear him announce in his paper, the arrival of the honorable Mr. —, from Richmond, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, or Charleſton, on his way home to the eaſtward; after having ſwindled numbers of the old continental officers, and ſoldiers out of their certificates, at two ſhillings and ſix-pence in the pound; who were not let into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the funding ſyſtem; may have been cauſe of laughter, to thoſe who knew this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and others of the ſpeculating order, when they had not a ſhirt to their back; but

muſt ertainly ſhock the feelings of every man of reflection; who regards juſtice and moral honeſty, as the baſis of all civil ſociety. Yet theſe were the men, Mr. Fenno decorated with the epithet "honorable;" whilſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots of ſeventy-ſix, were often inſulted and ridiculed, in his paper, for petitioning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, for a remuneration of their loſſes. But a bare inſult, was not ſufficient to gratify Mr. Hamilton's vindicative ſpirit; nothing ſhort, would do, of ſubverting the liberties, peace and happineſs of the citizens. The conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſeſſed great latitude of conſtructive power, and he was determined to exerciſe it. Hence we find him introducing laws partial and oppreſſive in their operation. The fund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtem, aſſumption, and exciſe laws, and the bank of the United States; are all the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of his brain<note n="*" place="bottom">In contradiction to the foregoing; it is aſſerted by ſome, that Duer, who is now in the goal of New-York for his ſwindling; the friend, the aſſiſtant and aſſociate of Mr. Hamilton; was the perſon who firſt propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the eſtabliſhment of the bank, funding ſyſtem, &amp;c.—See Thirteen Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by A Citizen.</note> The author of "thirteen letters by a citizen," in ſpeaking of the latter, with great juſtneſs of thought, humourouſly obſerves, that "Mr. Hamilton, by committing a rape on the conſtitution, begot the bank of the United States." Surely it was a violence offered to the conſtitution; for there is no clauſe in it, that will juſtify ſuch an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was founded upon that clauſe, which ſays, "Congreſs ſhall provide for the general welfare;" although it has been five years in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030155_0026_0FE4B089E3241800"/>
who of its friends will now ſtep forward, and prove in what particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it has been productive of general welfare; to the community at large? Experience, on the contrary, has convinced us; that there is no bank in the United States, more partial, limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſelfiſh in its diſcounts. The fact is, it has been conducted in ſuch a manner as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and enrich a few governmental men; who neither care, in principle, for bank, or government; longer than either mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the enlargement of their pecuniary circumſtances. The conduct of Porcupine, their champion, the other week to the tax-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, exhibits a ſtrong proof of the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his party to government, when their purſe is in queſtion. Although the bank has contributed to enrich a few, at the entire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of others, yet the evil is partial, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to thoſe ariſing from the funding ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, aſſumption and exciſe laws. By the two former, Mr. Hamilton has reverſed the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal contract; and in ſo doing, the United States have become reſponſible, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome millions of dollars, more than they were by the original contract. This he has done, to enrich a few ſycophants, as rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as vultures, ever ready to prey upon the vitals of their country. To diſcharge this enormous maſs of national debt, it became neceſſary to lay heavy taxes upon the people; among theſe, we find "a law laying duties upon ſpirits diſtilled within the United States,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030155_0027_0FE4B08B6C7E0B90"/>
and upon ſtills:" a law which is every way repugnant to the principles of a republic; it has grown, and flouriſhed, under the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of monarchial governments only; where it required a military force to put it into ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But oppreſſive taxes, and facility in encreaſing the national debt, were not the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly objects Mr. Hamilton had in view; a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary eſtabliſhment was wanting, as a key ſtone to the arch. Michavel himſelf never invented ſchemes, fraught with more cunning, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; or more ſubverſive of the liberties of a free people. By introducing an exciſe, he foreſaw, as there was no law within the reach of government, more diſcordant to the feelings of the citizens, and repugnant to the ſpirit of a republic, that it would naturally meet with oppoſition; hence would ariſe the neceſſity of a ſtanding army, to ſupport the dignity of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But Mr. Hamilton's inordinate paſſion for a military eſtabliſhment, to perfect his ſyſtem, heated his imagination too much; he foreſaw more than really happened. The oppoſition to the exciſe law, at firſt, was but trifling, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and without ſyſtem, or coincidence of ſentiment, among thoſe who were oppoſed to it. At the commencement of its operation, when a few diſcontented perſons ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in oppoſition, had he ordered ſuits in law to be commenced againſt the refractory, it is univerſally believed, by thoſe who know, better than Mr. Hamilton, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the people in the weſtern counties
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030155_0028_0FE4B08CF41B1C80"/>
of Pennſylvania, and the reſpect which they have always manifeſted for the judiciary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that ſubmiſſion, by aid of the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, might have been obtained. But it was not ſubmiſſion Mr. Hamilton deſired, it was oppoſition.<note n="*" place="bottom">If Mr. Hamilton did not deſire oppoſition, why ſport with the rights of the citizens, and the authority of the Judiciary Department; by ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtillers of Fayette County with writs, that were illegal, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at Philadelphia, nearly three hundred miles from their homes. I ſay illegal, for when the diſtillers had come to give in bail, they were found to be ſo. Was this not mockery, and ſporting with the liberties of the people? but Mr. Hamilton will reaſon by analogy, and give us a long ſtory about a cock and a bull.</note> Hence we find him giving en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the oppoſition, by an ill-ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forbearance of urging the judiciary au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which gave the people time and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to diſcover the force of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a general expreſſion of the public ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent. Whilſt the negligence, or connivance of government, impreſſed them with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that it was feeble—wanting energy and firmneſs, to enforce obedience to its laws. Two powerful motives to induce a people, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſſatisfied, with other heightened mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Mr. Hamilton's adminiſtration, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come violent in their oppoſition; to a law which was more particularly oppreſſive on them, than on any other part of the union. In the mean time we find him, in the cabinet council, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocating, more probably giving birth to the treaty with England; and afterwards ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Preſident, to appoint him to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy; which was rejected by the influence of Mr. Randolph; this, at once, gives a ſolution to that bitterneſs, which Mr. Hamilton's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030155_0029_0FE4B08F72BD6528"/>
have ſhewn towards Mr. Randolph ſince his reſignation. For it is certain, that if Mr. Randolph had reſigned from motives different from what he did, we would have never heard of Mr. Hamilton's ſolicitations for the embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, His pride and vanity were, no doubt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably mortified; on finding that his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were rejected by the Preſident. This evidently ſhews, how faſt, the Preſident's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him was diminiſhing; for it cannot be urged, that it was a greater impropriety to appoint a Secretary, than a Chief Juſtice; it muſt therefore be owing to a diminution of the Preſident's confidence in him. Happy would it have been for America, if no ſuch confidence had ever exiſted! How highly pleaſing would it have been for Mr. Hamilton, to become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally acquainted with Pitt, Grenville, and the <hi>immaculate</hi> George Roſe; men, whoſe corrupt, and corrupting influence, he has been ſo anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to imitate. What a delicious gratification would it have afforded him, to have dined with thoſe renowned liberticides; he would then have been in his proper element, breathing his native air. This group of liberticides, would be like an aſſemblage of devils; leagued againſt the peace, welfare, and happineſs of mankind.</p>
            <p>Scarcely had the agitation ſubſided, which the public mind had been thrown into, by the unconſtitutional appointment of Mr. Jay, as Miniſter Plenipotentiary to the court of St. James; when the weſtern inſurrection burſt forth, like a mighty torrent, ready to ſweep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030155_0030_0FE4B0961CD61480"/>
thing before it. Now it is, that Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton unmaſks himſelf; and the little man appears to the world in his native plumage. It is now that he gives vent to his meditated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, in a helliſh ejaculation, "Oh! that the inſurgents would burn Pittſburgh!" What a forcible argument for a military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? It is here we behold him loſing ſight of the dignity of his office; and like the wily ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, aſſuming all that variety of character, which malice, meanneſs, and treachery could invent; to ruin the reputation of Meſſrs. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Smilie, and Gallatin, in the public eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: who were the moſt active in ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the inſurrection; but who, on other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were oppoſed to the arbitrary meaſures of his adminiſtration. One moment we find him in the character of an hoſpitable friend, inviting an innocent, unſuſpecting man,<note n="*" place="bottom">Major Powers.—See Findley's Hiſtory of the Weſtern Inſurrection.</note> from his wife, his houſe, and family; and putting him under a military guard for ſeveral days; becauſe he would not perjure himſelf, in prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the criminality of thoſe gentlemen. Next inſtant, we find the little ſecretary aſſume a different ſhape; and with all the ſubtilty of a fiend, endeavour to extort evidence from thoſe who were examined by him; firſt by telling them, that he had already ſufficient teſtimony, in his pocket, of the guilt of thoſe gentlemen.<note n="†" place="bottom">A cobweb ſubtilty it was indeed; it ſhews the man's embicility of mind, for the greateſt fool upon earth would be capable of ſeeing through it, and thus reaſon with himſelf; "If Mr. Hamilton has ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the guilt of thoſe gentlemen, why does he attempt to extort evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from me."

And when he could not ſucceed, in this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh proceeding, we next find him, like the frog in the fable, bloated with an imaginary conſequence; aſſuming all the terrors of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitorial monk; with knitted brow, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry look, threatening the evidence's own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſafety, if they would not confeſs to the guilt of theſe gentlemen:—of whom I will aſſert, upon a ſtrict examination of facts, are more genuine federaliſts than Mr. Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; for it is now well known that he ſigned the conſtitution, with ſtrong expreſſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt;—that it was wholly from its admitting ſuch a latitude of conſtructive power;—and that he has often ſpoken of it ſince, not as a ſacred compact, entered into for the general welfare and happineſs of the citizens, but as a piece of paper and parchment.</p>
            <p>After thus taking a general view of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in what terms ought we to addreſs ſo black, ſo cowardly, and treacherous a tyrant? who, under the impoſing name of public good, attempted to ſtab, aſſaſſin-like, the liberties, peace, and happineſs of the citizens; whilſt he, with his diabolical principles, were corrupting their morals, by combining vice with the lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope of gain. Thou worſe than Arnold, Noy, and all the Dumouriers!</p>
            <p>After what has here been ſaid, I will not heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate to predict, that when the clouds of prejudice
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030155_0032_0FE4B099321FAE28"/>
are diſſipated, and the preſent generation paſs away; and when future hiſtorians will ariſe, to give an account of the preſent day; if they find a ſingle tranſaction in the life of General Waſhington, that will caſt a diſhonourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his memory; it will be the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Mr. Hamilton, to the head of the treaſury department.</p>
            <p>In diſcuſſing the meaſures of our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and the revolutionary principle of the French government; I cannot conceive why occaſion is taken, by Porcupine, to traduce the Iriſh nation; as a banditti of thieves and robbers. It argues in the man a degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and folly, which is rarely met with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt individuals; but certainly never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men of ſentiment and education, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſenſible well-informed writers; who will never run into digreſſion, from the point in controverſy, to indulge their malice and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, in abuſing any people. But to calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all nations, except his own, ſeems to be the general deſign of this hireling; and this mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ill-nature ſhews itſelf, in a greater or leſs degree, in the writings of almoſt every En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman; when he has had occaſion to ſpeak of the national character of others.</p>
            <p>From a pamphlet publiſhed this preſent year, by Moreau de St. Mery, on the priſons of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, which is now lying before me; I will be able to prove, to the honour of Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that Porcupine's ſtrictures upon the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Iriſh, who emigrate to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030155_0033_0FE4B09AC138CE20"/>
are falſe; and can only ariſe from his invincible ignorance of facts, and national pride and ſurlineſs of diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fact then to be proved, is, that there are few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rogues, conſequently more honeſt men, emigrate to this country from Ireland, than England, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the whole number of emigrants.</hi> Moreau de St. Mery, in this pamphlet ſtates, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſpace of four years, ending June 1791, there were three hundred and twenty-one fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, under conviction in the priſons of Philadelphia; "among theſe, ſays he, two hundred and thirty-one were Iriſh, and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four Engliſh or Scotch;" and during the next four years, ending March 1795, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the above writer, "among the hundred and thirty-five ſtrangers, ninety-two are Iriſh, and nineteen Engliſh or Scotch." To prevent trouble, in the calculations, and deductions let us combine the two periods, which make a term of eight years; ſo that the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Iriſh convicted during this term, is three hundred and twenty-three. There are twenty-ſeven hundred Iriſh arrive in this port every year. The data, upon which I found this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, are, that generally one year with another, five veſſels ſail from the port of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry, with paſſengers, and four from Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt; beſides others from Newry, Killebegs, Donnegal, and ſome from Dublin, Limerick, Cork, and Sligo; but ſeldom from the latter. The nine veſſels, ſailing from Derry and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, contain from two to four hundred paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030155_0034_0FE4B0A3A98691C8"/>
each; ſo that each veſſel may be averaged at three hundred paſſengers; this makes the whole number of emigrants, amount yearly to twenty-ſeven hundred; as I have ſtated above. But if we go back in our calculations, to the four years ſubſequent to the peace in eighty-three, we will find that upwards of three thouſand emigrated each year, to this port, from Londonderry alone; and if we did juſtice to our calculations and deduction, we would: becauſe a man, however roguiſh he may be inclined, will rarely commence thief, or robber on his firſt arrival in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he muſt remain an honeſt man for ſome time, until he becomes acquainted with the manners, and cuſtoms of the people; the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the country; and above all, until he gets acquainted with others of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But I need not go ſo far back, for proof, to convince the world, that the number of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt men, who emigrate from Ireland to this country, is much leſs, in proportion to the whole number of emigrants, than either from England, or Scotland. I have already ſhewn upon what data, I ſuppoſe twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred emigrate to this port yearly; which, in the ſpace of eight years, amount to twenty-one thouſand ſix hundred; the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, who were convicted during that period, according to Moreau's ſtatement, was three hundred and twenty-one, which are nearly as one is to ſixty-two.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:030155_0035_0FE4B0A5396DC070"/>Let us now ſee how the honeſty of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, will bear to be analized, in like manner. It is ſo generally known, I need ſcarcely repeat, that, for four years ſubſequent to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of peace in eighty-three, there were few or no Engliſhmen emigrated to this country; except ſome clerk, who were ſent, by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, into the ſeaports, on ſchemes of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Many of thoſe gentlemen, have ſince fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened upon the ſpoils of the war-worn ſoldier; as well as upon the labour, and induſtry of the unſuſpecting farmer. They now aſſume a big-bellied conſequence, in our ſtreets, little inferior to a London alderman; who has been fed upon turtle-ſoup, and calves heads. They may be known by an affected ſneer, at every thing which is American; and a frothy inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in their looks; when they ſee a man, whom they ſuſpect to poſſeſs leſs wealth than themſelves. In the eight years, de St. Mery has given us, of thoſe under condemnation in the priſons of Philadelphia; that is, from June 1787, to March 1795, there were not more Engliſh and Scotch, I am convinced, arrived in this port, to ſettle in the country, than one hundred each year, upon an average; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, in eight years, to eight hundred. The number of Engliſh convicted during that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, I have already ſtated, amounted to one hundred and three; the proportion, therefore, of the whole number of convicts, to the whole number of emigrants, is ſomewhat more, than, as one is to eight. Hence it unqueſtionably
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030155_0036_0FE4B0A6CACEFBA8"/>
appears, that out of every ſixty-two, who emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated, from Ireland to the United States, one in the courſe of eight years is convicted, for committing ſome offence againſt the laws of the ſtate; whereas, out of every eight Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who emigrated, one is convicted in the ſame ſpace of time. To which I may add, without hazarding my reputation, as a candid writer, that there are generally five, or ſix ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators or ſwindlers, arrive in our city every year from the different ports of England. Theſe are generally ſtiled d—d ſmart fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but of whom the laws can take no cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance; and who are perhaps, as pernicious to ſociety, and contribute as largely in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the morals of our citizens, as the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profane. Theſe gentry appear to be fully acquainted with the maxim of a certain Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, who is well known, among the ſpeculating order; for a peculiar addreſs, and dexterity, he has in negociating all his tranſactions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to an account one day, by a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for want of candour, in his dealings, Obediah replied with more warmth, than cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; "friend, thee art miſtaken, thee needs not complain; I did not cheat thee, I only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted thee." From the foregoing deductions, which I have drawn from the moſt unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable data, it appears that if the ſame number of Engliſh, as of Iriſh, emigrated to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the ſame ſpace of time; there would be two thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty-four convicted; whereas there are only 321 of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030155_0037_0FE4B0A95159D948"/>
Iriſh; what a bleſſing it is to the United States, that national pride, ignorance and prejudice keep them at home? Although fully ſatisfied of having convinced the moſt obſtinate and prejudiced, as far, as well eſtabliſhed facts will do ſo; that there are fewer rogues emigrate, to this country, from Ireland than from En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, nearly in a proportion as one is to eight. Yet if the whole number of Engliſhmen who were convicted, for committing offences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the laws of the ſtate, had been found innocent on their trials; ſtill there are a few of their countrymen, who have eſcaped pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, by a ſtrange perverſion of the laws, —have done more injury to ſociety, and have robbed the citizens of the United States of more property, than all the articles would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to, that were ſtolen by Iriſhmen ſince the firſt ſettlement of America. Among theſe I will mention two only, becauſe more would be unneceſſary. Duer of New-York, it is well known, failed in one million five hundred thouſand dollars; it is alſo known that a great part of this he borrowed in five, ten, fifteen, twenty, &amp;c. dollars, as he could get them; from every fruit-woman, drayman, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But if an Iriſhman, from want of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or from neceſſity, robs a man of a cow or a horſe; the whole nation muſt be calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated by a contemptible wretch, as thieves and robbers. The other I will mention is Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, who failed in New-York, ran off to this city; and ſoon after opened a large ſtore, and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030155_0038_0FE4B0AF19D0BFD8"/>
as ſoon after failed in forty thouſand dollars; and fled to Amſterdam.</p>
            <p>And now let it be affirmed to the honor of Iriſhmen, that three-fourths of all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who turn bankrupts throughout the United States, are Engliſh and Scotchmen; although there are as many of the former merchants, as there are of the latter.</p>
            <p>There is another circumſtance, which ought not to be concealed on the preſent occaſion; as it affects the honor and honeſty of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in a very delicate point; its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are extenſive in their operation, and bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſociety; it ought therefore to receive publicity: I mean the counterfeiting the notes of the bank of the United States, and North A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. It is a truth, which the heads of the judiciary department of the ſtate can teſtify, as well as the ſheriff and goaler of Lancaſter county; that there were an Engliſh man and woman tried, and convicted at Lancaſter; for forging the notes of theſe two banks. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, with a combination of others, has thrown ſuch light upon that affair; as will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify us in aſſerting, that there was a banditti of Engliſhmen and women diſperſed over the United States; from New-Hampſhire to Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, employed in counterfeiting, and paſſing theſe notes. It is a fact, known to all Europe, that the <hi>immaculate</hi> Pitt employed ſeveral men in counterfeiting French aſſignats; but owing to the watchfulneſs of the national convention, few of them ever went into circulation: on
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030155_0039_0FE4B0B19E5C3B68"/>
finding that he failed in his attempt to raiſe money, by his counterfeit aſſignats, to carry on "a juſt and neceſſary war;" have we not the moſt preſumptive proof, that he turned his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to counterfeiting the notes of theſe two banks? We all know, that the Britiſh counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the paper currency of the United States, in the late revolution; and why not now the paper currency of theſe two banks? their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities are greater now, than they were dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the American war; and what faith, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rectitude can we expect from a ſet of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt unprincipled men, goaded on by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity? Surely there is no barrier which national faith, honor, and juſtice can erect, that ſuch men will not break through and violate; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their nefarious deſigns. And when we conſider that theſe banks are ſituated in a more extenſive, and larger trading town, than any other in the United States; their notes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore a more general and extenſive circulation; is a circumſtance which renders them fit objects of Pitt's deſigns. To which if we add, that theſe counterfeits appeared ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after he had advertiſed French aſſignats for ſale, and was defeated in his attempts to get them into circulation; it gives additional force to the evidence. But there is one fact yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be told, which muſt remove the doubts of every man, and ſilence at once the clamours of the Britiſh faction. It is well known, to many citizens of Philadelphia, that at the time when Pitt publiſhed his counterfeit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignats,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030155_0040_0FE4B0B32646FB10"/>
there was an Engliſhman reſiding in this city of the name of Hancock; who had fled from London, ſome years before, for crimes alledged againſt him there; and for which he would, no doubt, have received a Tyburn elevation, had he been taken. About this time Hancock left this city for London; and ſoon after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the apparatus for coining dollars; and ſeveral copperplates, upon which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved the counterfeit notes. He had ſeveral hundred copies ſtruck off the plates, in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and brought over the bank-notes in ſheets. Now to ſuppoſe that Mr. Hancock, who is well known to be an accompliſhed villain, would be ſo ſtupid as to return to London, when conſcious of his guilt, and that certain death awaited him there, if he were detected, is improbable. It is a ſuppoſition that cannot be admitted, as there is not one circumſtance, except the man's ſtupidity, which is not a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic in him, that could juſtify us in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuppoſition; ſince it is well known that there are ſome of his countrymen reſiding within the United States, fully capable of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting bank-notes; why then endanger his life, in returning to London, when all things might be as well accompliſhed here? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he muſt have returned, under the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Pitt, who employed him in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the counterfeit notes; as Lord North did many of the old tories, who now aſſume amongſt us, no ſmall degree of conſequence.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hancock was detected and convicted in Lancaſter, and an Iriſhman with him, who lent him his houſe, and became the dupe of his villainy. What pity our laws did not make a juſt diſtinction, and inflict a twofold puniſhment on the man, who would act the villain himſelf, and corrupt the morals of another, who might have lived and died an honeſt man.</note>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:030155_0041_0FE4B0B5A56A04A8"/>To attempt purſuing Porcupine through all the digreſſions, turnings, and labyrinths of his writings; would be like himſelf hunting a flea, amongſt the plaits of his old grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's petticoat, under the little damſon tree.<note n="*" place="bottom">See his Life.</note> One moment we find him abuſing Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick of Philadelphia; the next inſtant we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him, all the way in Virginia, ſnarling like a ſurly dog, at Mr. Giles; thence in New-York, puffing his foetid breath in the face of Mr. Livingſton; and next inſtant we find him in the weſtern counties of Pennſylvania; like a beaſt of prey, prowling after Mr. Gallatin.</p>
            <p>The republican party being ſo numerous, that to vindicate the conduct of each individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, againſt Porcupine's illiberal and ill-natured abuſe; would conſume more time than I have to ſpare on the preſent occaſion, and occupy more pages than I have aſſigned to this pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet. Let us therefore purſue ſome method, and begin with Mr. Swanwick firſt; becauſe he lives nearer us than the others. It is urged by Porcupine that he is a vain man; but what relation has vanity to politics? a prejudiced mind, like Porcupine's, may think there is a connection; for my part I can diſcover none, more than there is between vanity and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor do I ſee how vanity can interweave it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with politics; I know ambition may—am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030155_0042_0FE4B0BD07EAB7D8"/>
will lead a man to ſtrain his faculties, in compoſing a harangue; which will take him three or four hours in delivery. Some are ambitious of being thought men of parts, great orators, or ingenuous men; and others are again ſo weak, as to grow ambitious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteemed rich men; as if riches were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent; and ſome through meanneſs, are ambitious of being conſidered poor men. But all this time we never ſay, we are vain to be thought great orators, men of parts, &amp;c. An ambitious man will leave no attempts uneſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to have his political ſentiments adopted with all their prejudices; at the hazard of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, that is connected with his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's welfare; and in this reſpect, I believe, Mr. Hamilton and Porcupine are two of the moſt ambitious men we have; conſequently the moſt dangerous. In their own way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them has left a path unexplored; in order to have his favorite principles adopted; one by ſophiſtry, frequently of the ſlighteſt texture, and an analogical method of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which oftener leads men into error than any other. It is indeed the method chiefly practiſed by ſophiſts, as they frequently take for granted, that there is a likeneſs between things; when there is none in nature. Who ever diſcovered a likeneſs between the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States, and the army; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. Hamilton attempted to exculpate the Preſident, from thoſe charges brought againſt him, by the "calm obſerver?" Mr. Hamilton
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030155_0043_0FE4B0BE91E99DF8"/>
takes for granted there is a likeneſs between them, hence he concludes, as the army have often drawn more money out of the treaſury; than the ſpecific ſums appropriated by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and thoſe at an earlier period; that the Preſident was alſo juſtifiable in doing the ſame; which, in other words, is ſaying that the Preſident's neceſſities are equal to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's; for unleſs Mr. Hamilton proves this, which I think he will not attempt to prove, his deductions are all childiſh, and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and will never exculpate the Preſident in the public opinion. This vein of analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical reaſoning, is the baſis of all Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton's writings; and if one had time to analyze them, I am perſuaded, the greater part of them, as well as of thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he prides himſelf moſt, would tumble to the ground like a baſeleſs fabric; for reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by analogy is like building a houſe upon a ſandy foundation. But to illuſtrate more fully Mr. Hamilton's method of reaſoning, let us ſuppoſe him croſſing a field, at Albany, to ſeduce his neighbour's wife, or daughter; as it is ſaid, he has a wonderful itching after other men's wives; and when he has gotten into one of theſe catterwalling moods, no he-cat is more laſcivious; for rather than be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he would ruſh into the ebony arms of an African, provided ſhe had a huſband. I ſay let us ſuppoſe, that he is croſſing a field, and in his way meets a white pig; if he had never ſeen one before, what would be his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030155_0044_0FE4B0C01BDD9350"/>
of reaſoning on this occaſion? not like an enlightened philoſopher, who would exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine if it poſſeſſed thoſe properties, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, with the ſpecies to which it belongs; or whether it was a variety only; but the firſt idea, that would enter the mind of our analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical reaſoner, would be that of milk; if he were neceſſarily led to reaſon on the properties of the pig, he would proceed thus, "milk is white, and we all know it is nutritive; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be good to make men go a catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walling. The pig is white, it muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs the ſame properties; I will therefore make a funding ſyſtem of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">If the funding ſyſtem has not ſet men a catterwalling, it has certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet many a beggar upon horſeback.—The above reaſoning is not more abſurd, than the reaſoning of Mr. Hamilton, in ſupport, that "a public debt is a public bleſſing."</note> Among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bonds of union which direct men's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to aſſociate their ideas, reſemblance is one; and I believe there are few who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that aſſociating quality in a higher degree, than Mr. Hamilton; like an <hi>ignus fatuus,</hi> he bewilders us in the multiplicity of his ideas; hence he has been very juſtly ſtiled "the long winded Pacificus."</p>
            <p>But Porcupine is a writer of a different caſt from Mr. Hamilton; although their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the object they have in view, are preciſely the ſame, the diſcredit of republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; yet they purſue roads widely different. Porcupine more bold, and adventurous; but leſs artful, and deſigning; like a head ſtrong ſtubborn horſe, that runs off with his rider,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030155_0045_0FE4B0C2A3984E00"/>
he daſhes through mud and mire, making the dirt fly in all directions. If truth he in his way, he beſmears it with calumny and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; for he has on every occaſion fully ſhewn, that no truth, however ſacred, he will reſpect. There is no calumny too groſs, no falſehood too glaring and abſurd; for this hireling to practiſe, as weapons, in butchering the man's reputation, who is oppoſed to him in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And when he has calumniated him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, he will return to it to-morrow with the ſame eagerneſs, that a dog would to his vomit.</p>
            <p>But let us return to Mr. Swanwick, of whom I am juſtifiable in aſſerting, that if he acquits himſelf, in his political capacity, as an honeſt man; his conſtituents will never enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſent a piece of poetry to the editor of a London magazine, for publication, or not: or whether he has his houſe ornamented with paintings, buſts, and ſtatues;—that he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf to the entire ſatisfaction of his conſtituents, Porcupine will not attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. But if he has ſent a piece of poetry, acroſs the atlantic for publication, is that any proof of his vanity? common ſenſe ſpurns the idea. If ſuch a thing be a proof of a man's vanity, how many vain men will we find amongſt mankind? I could here, were it neceſſary, name ſeveral; who, if they did not ſend po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, ſent other works for publication; yet who ever thought, before Porcupine, that ſuch a circumſtance conſtituted a vain man? Porcupine criticiſes upon this poetry, but
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030155_0046_0FE4B0C91CA0C7F8"/>
Mr. Swanwick may reply to him with the ſame juſtneſs of thought, that Hanibal repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the philoſopher; who had the folly and preſumption, to diſcant before him upon the principles of war. "Of all the ſilly old men, ſays Hanibal, that I ever heard talk, thou art the ſillieſt." I need not aſk the reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hanibal or the philoſopher was the vaineſt man; neither need I aſk him, whether Mr. Swanwick or Porcupine is the vaineſt man. Porcupine criticiſes upon Mr. Swanwick's poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, like the vain philoſopher upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of war; without having had any experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or poſſeſſing one of the neceſſary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of a warrior. And Porcupine criticiſes upon Mr. Swanwick's poetry, without poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one of the neceſſary qualifications of a critique; except his ill-nature. Porcupine urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es alſo, becauſe Mr. Swanwick has his houſe ornamented with paintings, buſts and ſtatues; he muſt therefore be a vain man. If he had reflected, for fifty years, and as many centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, provided he out-lived that period, for a fact or an argument to prove a man to be vain, he could not have brought forward one more prepoſterous. Thoſe things are evidently a proof of Mr. Swanwick's love of the arts; and in this opinion, I believe, every ſenſible man will coincide with me; for if we judge of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by their effects, we can draw no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. By purchaſing thoſe things does he not reward the labour of the artiſt? he who rewards the labour of the artiſt, gives encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030155_0047_0FE4B0CAA79433C0"/>
to the art itſelf; and he who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the art muſt love it. How ſimple and eaſy it is for men to reaſon, when they have truth on their ſide, and candour to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it. If every man would act their part, in that reſpect, as well as Mr Swanwick; the arts would not languiſh in this country, ſo long in their infancy, as they do. But men's minds are too much abſorpt in ſpeculation, and pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aggrandizement, to admit a taſte ſufficiently refined to reliſh them. Why then cenſure a man for contributing his ſhare, to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of thoſe arts; which enlightened ages and nations have approved? nay more, it was owing to the encouragement that the arts met with in thoſe times; which make future writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers apply to them, the appellation of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened age, or enlightened people. Why do we call the Indians an uncivilized people? it is not becauſe they poſſeſs fewer of the ſocial, and domeſtic virtues than we do; for travellers all agree, that theſe they fulfill with more warmth, than even the pious folks of New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; if we except bundling, as we have not yet learned, whether that ſocial virtue has been introduced amongſt them. It is not becauſe they poſſeſs leſs moral honeſty, than is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Porcupine's friends; for travellers agree alſo, that amongſt them are found no brokers, no ſpeculators, no ſtock and land-jobbers; nor have they yet diſcovered, notwithſtanding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years reſidence amongſt them, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of mercantile fraud and meanneſs. But
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030155_0048_0FE4B0CC35889ED0"/>
it is alone from the circumſtance of their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no reliſh for the arts, and ſciences; that we apply to them the degraded appellation, of "an uncivilized people." Why then, in the name of heaven! ſhould we accuſe a man of vanity, for encouraging thoſe things; by which we acquired the honourable appellation of "a civilized people?" But what lengths, will not envy and malice go: when determined upon murdering a man's reputation The ſame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and envy, which perſecute Mr. Swanwick to-day; perſecuted Mr. Nicholſon for nine long years in this city; his political ſentiments did not harmonize with a certain party; and he was treading the path, to acquire a fortune, by which he was likely to obtain a pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over them; as far as riches will do ſo, in a free country. They were like the ſurly dog in the manger, who could not eat the hay himſelf; neither would they ſuffer Mr. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholſon, to obtain a fortune; as far as their malignant influence could go, in preventing it. But when he had acquired that fortune, which was the ſole object of his wiſhes; and which he purſued with the moſt unremitted exertion, and induſtry; he then changed his political ſentiments, turned his back on his old friends; and became the rallying-point of almoſt all the land-jobbers, and ſpeculators, throughout the United States, Since that time they have taken him into their boſoms, and ſome of them even now court his friendſhip. We do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <hi>faux-paus;</hi> nay he is to them, as immaculate, as the virgin roſe. I would aſk any man of ſenſe, and candour—for it is only to ſuch men I wiſh to ſpeak on the preſent occaſion, is Mr. Nicholſon an honeſter man to-day, than he was ſix years ago, or is he leſs vain? I ſuppoſe the next charge, brought againſt Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, by Porcupine; is, that he is a vain man, becauſe he eats—he drinks, and ſleeps; for theſe he may repeat to-morrow. "The ſhort man from Philadelphia," what ingenuity of thought! who would have believed their own eyes, on ſeeing Mr. Swanwick, that he was a man of moderate ſize; if the humourous, the witty, and ingenuous Porcupine had not told us? What a happy diſcovery!</p>
            <p>Had antient biographers and hiſtorians, been as particular in tranſmitting to us; the ſize, figure, and tone of voice, of their reſpective heroes, as Porcupine is in handing Mr. Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick's down to futurity; what a glare of light would it have diffuſed upon their hiſtories? For he ſeems to inſinuate that the capacity of men's minds, ought to be meaſured by the bulk of their bodies. The obſervation exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contains as much profoundneſs of thought, and good ſenſe; as one made by the learned Doctor Belknap, in his hiſtory of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. Speaking of the climate of that ſtate, and the coldneſs of the winter ſeaſon; the Doctor profoundly tells us, that this is the time, "when nature teaches the hens to ſet on
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030155_0050_0FE4B0D66A4073B8"/>
the cow's back, to keep their feet warm."<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. III. page 19.</note> Heavens! who would have thought? if the learned Doctor had not told us, that the hens of New-Hampſhire poſſeſs ſo much ſagacity. I ſuppoſe a Virginia, or an Iriſh hen, would be ſuch a ſtupid, ſilly devil; as to run in a cold day, and ſet herſelf down upon a ſheet of ice, or a heap of ſnow. But if the hens of New-Hampſhire poſſeſs ſo much ſagacity, how much more muſt the learned Doctor poſſeſs? he would never have thought, I preſume, of ſetting himſelf down upon a cow's back, in a cold day, to keep his feet warm, had not the hens put him in mind of it; nay, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, he would prefer to ſit by a good fire; for certainly it is no uncommon thing, to find a learned Doctor ſitting by a pleaſant fire, in a cold day, in preference to a cow's back; which unqueſtionably proves, that a Doctor in divinity as well as Porcupine, may poſſeſs more ſagacity than a hen.</p>
            <p>While I am thus ſpeaking of the ſagacity of hens, and doctors in divinity; it brings to my recollection, the author of "the American U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Geography;" who has lately been crowned with the ariſtotelian cap. This geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphic divine ſpeaking of the political diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions which prevailed in New-Hampſhire, reſpecting the adoption of the federal conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brings in the following argument to prove, that the delegates to the ſtate conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who had received inſtructions from their
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030155_0051_0FE4B0D7F28A3F68"/>
conſtituents, were not in duty bound to obey them. "Although, ſays this learned ſon of Ariſtotle, the inſtructions of conſtituents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, on the true principles of repreſentation, be binding upon a deputy in any legiſlative aſſembly, becauſe his conſtituents are but a part of the ſtate, and have not heard the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and objections of the whole, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his act is to affect the whole ſtate." I would aſk Mr. Morſe, what are the majority in any legiſlative aſſembly? are they not a part? but ſays Mr. Morſe, "a part ought not to govern;" a majority being a part, (for it is evident that a majority of the towns might have given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions) therefore they ought not govern, according to his mode of reaſoning. A doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſubverſive of every principle of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm. Some men ſhew ſo much ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be thought ingenuous writers, that they would even ſacrifice truth for the ſake of a ſophiſm; nay even violate the ſanctity of their clerical profeſſion, for the ſake of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical falſehood. Strange that men ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened as the people to the eaſtward, are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be by thoſe two writers, and not know their political rights, and the rank which they ought to hold in ſociety! to be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and not know ones's political rights, is a manifeſt abſurdity; to know one's political rights and not be capable of giving inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to a deputy, is an abſurdity no leſs gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

It is a well known fact that the clergy of Maſſachuſetts, once held the reins of that government; and ſince they have been ouſted by the good ſenſe of the citizens, they have not ceaſed to graſp at every opportunity; whereby they might regain their antient unlimitted power, over the rights and conſciences of the citizens. Does not this exactly correſpond with the part,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030155_0053_0FE4B0DC09C2A840"/>
which many of the New-England clergy have acted, upon a late important queſtion? In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my aſſertion generally, I have only to appeal to the writings of Mr. Morſe, wherein he ſays, that the very democratical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Connecticut, is counterbalanced by the ariſtocracy of the clergy. We know then, that the intereſts of ariſtocracy and democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are diametrically oppoſite; and when ſuch intereſts exiſt in a ſtate, they muſt naturally create diſſention among its citizens; but we hear of no ſuch diſſention among the citizens of Connecticut; for the ariſtocracy of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, like a ſlow poiſon in the human body, has paralized the democratical part and rendered it merely nominal. The clergy of the eaſtern ſtates are like thoſe women, who are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for ſubtilty, than candour; and who through principles of cunning and artifice, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their ſilly huſbands, without letting them know that they are governed. When a certain divine perſonage, at whoſe name every knee ought to bend, and the tongue of clamour ceaſe, was aſked by one of thoſe brothers; who thought himſelf unjuſtly dealt with, in regard to his patrimonial eſtate, what he ſhould do? "Man, replied the Son of God, who made me a judge?" giving him to underſtand that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or worldly affairs; were foreign to the true ſpirit, and intention of his miſſion. And when others, to try the political ſentiments of the ſame divine perſonage, preſented him with a piece of ſilver; and after being informed that
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030155_0054_0FE4B0E496F5DA78"/>
the image and ſuperſcription it bore, were Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's; he declined all interference in political matters, by giving them the following evaſive anſwer; "render, ſays he, unto Caeſar, the things that are Caeſar's." Are not thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which directly and unequivocally prove, that the Chriſtian religion, in its purity, does not admit clergymen interfering in political concerns. Hence we are no longer ſurpriſed, to find clergymen of ambitious views and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary principles, attempting to prove that the ſervant ought not to obey his maſter. Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch clergymen would relinquiſh, at once, their clerical functions; than longer pervert the precepts of Chriſtianity, by making them ſubſervient to their mercenary purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Porcupine's criticiſms, on Mr. Swanwick's poetry, are not the only inſtance we have of his vanity and ill nature. The illiberal and vulgarly manner which he has treated Tele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus, a work of the celebrated Fenelon, in a French grammar he publiſhed ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go in this city, is diſguſting to the feelings of every man, who regards virtuous and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened men, as the greateſt bleſſing and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſociety. Of this work, which Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine treats with contempt and ridicule, a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er highly eſteemed for his candour and good ſenſe, ſpeaks in the following manner; "no work, ſays he, ever had a greater reputation; the ſtile of it is lively, natural and beautiful; the fictions well contrived; the moral ſublime; and the political maxims all tending to the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030155_0055_0FE4B0E61F300240"/>
happineſs of mankind." But Porcupine, in contempt of the univerſal opinion of mankind, ridicules this work; and calls Telemachus a ſimple fellow. Why? becauſe he would not go to bed to Calypſo, who was in love with him. Gracious God! that a man would be ſo loſt to all ſenſe of decency, and moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to call another "a ſimple fellow;" becauſe he would not proſtitute himſelf, and indulge his brutal appetites; at the expence of innocence and virtue. This is uniformly the method, which men of vicious habits endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to propagate their nefarious principles; by ridiculing virtue, and innocence; for if they could get men to be once aſhamed of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, and virtue; they were then ſure of ſucceeding. When we view Porcupine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the character of a ſeducer, we are no longer ſurpriſed to find him ridiculing Telema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, as "a ſimple fellow." When we behold him inveigling an innocent girl, not more than ſixteen or ſeventeen years, from her aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents—their only remaining bloſſom—and laſt beſt hope; when we conſider him breaking the ties of parental affection, and filial duty; exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting animoſity between parent and child; our wonder ceaſes when we find him endeavouring to excite animoſity, between the citizens of the eaſtern and the ſouthern ſtates. When we view him giving an aged parent occaſion to exclaim, in the bitterneſs of his heart, "If I am bereft of my only daughter, I am bereft!" What pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of ſenſibility, who has a daughter; or what
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030155_0056_0FE4B0E7A8D2AF00"/>
brother of ſenſibility, who has a ſiſter; that would not be rouſed with indignation, at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on ſuch circumſtances? Are the tears and ſighs of an aching heart—a bereft parent, unworthy of our notice! is female happineſs of no conſideration amongſt men, that we ſhould paſs it over in ſilence!<note n="*" place="bottom">In anſwer to the foregoing we have only to obſerve, that it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed, by thoſe who were intimate at the houſe where Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine lodged, on his arrival, that he had ſeduced the girl who lived with him as his wife: they believed, and ſaid ſo, but upon what authority I never enquired.</note> When we moreover conſider him abuſing the archbiſhop of Cambray, and Doctor Franklin; two of the moſt enlightened men of their age; it confirms us in our belief, that his writings tend to the ſubverſion of all thoſe principles; upon which reſt the peace, happineſs, and well-being of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>The archbiſhop of Cambray believed and ſupported the being of a Deity, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion; Porcupine ſays, that Doctor Franklin a deity only, and moral rectitude. The latter he reproaches in the moſt groveling manner, and the former he calls a "ſilly bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler." Taking a general view of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mankind, ſo far as they relate to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we are naturally led to divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three claſſes; thoſe who believe in a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being and a Redeemer, are ſtiled Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; thoſe who believe in a Supreme Being alone, and the fitneſs of moral actions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure eternal happineſs, are ſtiled Deiſts; and thoſe who believe as neither of the former,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030155_0057_0FE4B0E93081B980"/>
are ſtiled Atheiſts. Porcupine ridicules Doctor Franklin's principles in the ſillieſt manner, without refuting them; now if he ridicules the principles of a Deiſt, and laughs at the principles of a Chriſtian? what inference can we draw? but that he is himſelf an Atheiſt; and if to this concluſion, which I think every man of candour will acknowledge to be juſt, we add the contempt he has ſhewn for the Chriſtian religion, by not attending any of its public inſtitutions; for who ever ſaw Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine at a religious aſſembly in this city? it muſt confirm every man's belief, that Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupine is an Atheiſt in the fulleſt latitude of the word. I have taken for granted, all this time, on the authority of Porcupine, that Doctor Franklin was a Deiſt; a man of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and an enlightened underſtanding, will never make an aſſertion, which he cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by ſome fact, or fair deduction; but what proof has Porcupine brought forward, that will lead us to believe, that Doctor Franklin's principles were deiſtical; ſurely not one, that would induce a credulous child to believe ſo. He has brought forward the hereſay of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed old man; who is univerſally known to entertain an irreconcileable hatred, to the memory of Doctor Franklin; becauſe he took ſuch an active part in the late revolution; well may we apply to him, on this occaſion, the ſaying of a celebrated writer; "as bad as men are, they dare not appear to be the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of virtue, and when they reſolve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030155_0058_0FE4B0EFC16B9DF0"/>
it, they pretend to believe it falſe, or lay ſome crime to its charge." I repeat again, that Porcupine has not adduced one ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Doctor's of a deiſtical tendency; only the malignant aſperſions of a turbulent old man, who is more remarkable for his bankruptſies, and clamorous diſpoſition; than for candour, fair dealing, and a deſire of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after truth. But I have produced both ſentiments and actions of Porcupine; from which I have, by the faireſt deduction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be an Atheiſt. For if we believe in a deity, the immortality of the ſoul, and in future rewards and puniſhments; in which no Atheiſt ever believed; To obtain thoſe future rewards, there can be only the following prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of general conduct; that is we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe in the merits of a Redeemer and moral actions, which are always the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſuch a belief; or in the fitneſs of moral rectitude alone, to procure us thoſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rewards; now he who ridicules and laughs at men for believing and practiſing one or other of theſe general principles; cannot be ſaid to believe, or practiſe either himſelf; and if he neither believes, nor practiſes either, it is then ſelf evident, he muſt be an Atheiſt. For it would be prepoſterous, in the extreme, to ſuppoſe a man would treat with contempt and ridicule thoſe ſacred principles of action in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which mark the general tenor of his own conduct. Before we attempt to ridicule a thing, we muſt remove from it all thoſe ideas of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030155_0059_0FE4B0F2451D0D30"/>
which we formerly conſidered attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it.</p>
            <p>In his "Scare Crow," he quotes the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage out of Doctor Franklin's will, to prove him an ariſtocrat; notwithſtanding the ſervices he rendered his country, and the cauſe of liberty, and ſcience in general. "I bequeath, ſays the Doctor, to my worthy friend George Waſhington, my gold-headed cane, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted with a liberty cap: if it were a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre he is worthy of it." Porcupine then makes the following remark; "after all the Doctor's clamour againſt kings, he thought a ſceptre ſomething more than a liberty cap." But, I anſwer, it was directly the reverſe; it was not owing to any eſtimation the Doctor held a ſceptre in; but being well convinced, that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington always entertained a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh longing after a ſceptre; which made him uſe that ſoothing expreſſion. It ſhews the Doctor's goodneſs of heart, that he wiſhed to part in peace with all mankind; and give cauſe of chagrin to none. Inſtead of proving, that the Doctor held a ſceptre in higher eſtimation than a liberty cap, it proves only, that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington always held it in higher eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for is it not ſelf-evident, that if the Preſident entertained an antipathy towards a ſceptre, or viewed it as a contemptible bauble; and the Doctor, under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, offered him his cane, by ſaying, "Sir, if it were a ſceptre, you are worthy of it;" would not ſuch conduct be ſomething
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030155_0060_0FE4B0F3CCFAE810"/>
like irony? would it not be degrading the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Preſident's opinion, and directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting his feelings? Porcupine further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that "poor Richard (Doctor Franklin) certainly deſerves to be tumbled from his niche, for his dying confeſſion;" becauſe he diſcovered to the world the Preſident's fondneſs for a ſceptre; "and I truſt, continues Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, when the day of retribution comes he will not be forgotten;" the above paſſage of this <hi>humane</hi> hireling needs but little comment; it fully ſhews of itſelf to what ſavage lengths, his party would extend their perſecutions if they dared—that they would even wreak their feeble vengeance, upon a ſenſeleſs block of marble. This is the generous—the immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late hero, who firſt accuſes, and then condemns the French nation; for a crime which he threatens to put into execution, when a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity will offer. Would it not be well for the corporation, to take notice of him; before his helliſh malice may tempt him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, that beautiful ſtatue? Surely threats are as cognizable in law, as real crimes: No doubt his good old friend, Mr. Olden, would ſpare time from his private diſcounting, to go before a magiſtrate and pledge ſome of his dirty acres, as a ſecurity for his good behaviour. But ſtill the magiſtracy ought to aſſert their dignity; and be a ſafeguard to the works of genius, as well as to that property which is too often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by fraud, and ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:030155_0061_0FE4B0F55606B7B8"/>I have already adduced arguments and facts, ſufficient to convince the moſt prejudiced, that Porcupine is neither a Chriſtian, nor a moral man. But the following fact, eſtabliſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controverſy, the impiety of this wretched ſcribbler. In his Cenſor of May, page 189, ſpeaking of Mr. Swanwick, he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, with the moſt unbluſhing effrontery, the ladies of Philadelphi to go, and "even ſ— him:" monſtrous obſcenity! aſſuring them at the ſame time, by a ſolemn oath, that "they need not apprehend any miſchief." Heavens! what an incitement does he offer to vice! What ſhall we in future think of this hireling's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, morality and diſcretion? How long will he be ſuffered to paſs with impunity? I have not the leaſt doubt, were he in London, but he could eaſily get ſome cockneigh wench, to act that vile abominable part: But ſure I am that the American women, though the Yankees may bundle, have not yet become ſo loſt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſenſe of modeſty and virtue; as that he could even find one among Mrs. Maginnis's girls ſo abandoned. When William Penn was tracing out his beloved city of Philadelphia,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </gap> Crow.</note> if any one had told him, that the time would come, when one of his own countrymen would have the canine impudence; for to adviſe the ladies of Philadelphia, in many of whoſe veins his own blood was trickling, to proſtitute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; I much queſtion if the good old man, though a Quaker, would not have ſaid "that
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030155_0062_0FE4B0FC845FDF80"/>
it was a d—d lie;" and if it would be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther told him, that it was a grey-haired old Quaker who himſelf had daughters, that was vending all this obſcenity and proſtituted traſh; would not the good old man have exclaimed with warmth? "Fellow, thee art a d —d confounded liar." Poor old man! he little dreamed what was to happen, about the cloſe of the eighteenth century; but William was no dreamer—he knew how to employ his time to more advantage. He would rather be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrings of beads, and old horſe ſhoes to the Indians for their lands; than ſitting up in his great armed chair dreaming about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which Porcupine and his aſſociate Ben Davis, would endeavour to excite, among the peaceable citizens, by their lies and calumnies. What a golden age! when men with a little religious artifice, on the tip of their tongues; and a few ſtrings of beads and old horſe ſhoes, could purchaſe land in any quantity. What pity ſome of our preſent monopolizers, had not lived in thoſe days of beads, and old hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſhoes; inſtead of giving hard dollars for their lands, or mortgaging their property to ſave their credit; they would have nothing more to do, but to order their ſervant to pull off an old ſhoe off one of their horſes feet, or take a ſtring of beads from little Miſs Polly; pay for their lands, and lift their notes. The ſtreets of our city would not then be ſo croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the pious horſe-ſtealers from Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut; gathering up every bit of old iron they
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030155_0063_0FE4B0FF0850B920"/>
could find. But inſtead of them we would ſee Meſſrs. M—s, N—n, old Doctor R—n, N—ls, the expatriated viſcount, and the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Mr. G—f all the way from New-York; diſperſed through the different ſtreets of our city, ſcraping the dirt, and gathering up every bit of old iron they could find. Why not? when it would pay for their lands, and prevent them from mortgaging one part to ſave the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The beautiful and all-accompliſhed Mr. G—f, with his roſy cheeks, would not then be under the dire neceſſity of purchaſing India muſlins, on ſecurity and long credit, from a certain mercantile houſe in this city; and ſend them the next day to vendue, to ſell for what they could bring. His matrimonial attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prevents him from returning to Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to renew his ſpeculations there; for it is ſaid, when there, that he loved with all the <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> of a Ruſſian. Nevertheleſs, I will venture to affirm, that his Amſterdam ſpeculation was the beſt he ever made; be this as it may, it is pretty generally underſtood, that a certain bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nette has often exclaimed with a heavy heart, in the language of one of Dryden's females, "our thoughtleſs giddy ſex, is caught by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form, and empty noiſe, and loſes itſelf in man." There is, notwithſtanding, one thing yet remaining, to be ſaid, of this <hi>virtuous</hi> friend of Porcupine's—this <hi>honorable</hi> member of the ſpeculating order; but until things are more fully explained, and the friends of — have ſpirit to vindicate their perſonal honour; it

would be cruel to confound the innocent with the guilty.

Aye, Maſter B—, ten or twelve thouſand pounds! who would not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate, turn plagiariſt, make verſes, get drunk at a beer-houſe, ſue for a divorce, put their heart in a glove, and ſwear

            <p>In his Cenſor of April, page 133, Porcupine obſerves, that in the Philadelphia Gazette of laſt year, he found the following words made uſe of by Mr. Giles, in the debate on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances to members of Congreſs. "Mr. Giles ſaid there was a country, from which America copied a great deal too much. The members of the Britiſh houſe of commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no wages, while the officers of ſtate had immenſe ſalaries. It was, however, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Britiſh houſe of commons were very well paid; he did not wiſh to ſee ſcenes of that kind introduced into this country. It was, I think, very uncivil in you Mr. Giles, to mention the word "ſcenes," as all men ſuppoſe you meant ſcenes of bribery and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and what honeſt man ever doubted, that ſuch ſcenes were practiſed by the Britiſh. It was, notwithſtanding, unpolite to preſs ſo hard upon Mr. Porcupine's ſores; that he has ſuch ſores, the following ſentence fully evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; it needs no comment; "now, ſays he, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to aſk this talkative gentleman, what he means by "ſcenes." He then goes on with his intero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories; If, ſays he, this were permitted, I would go on, and aſk him what he meant by copying too much from Great-Britain." In the next ſentence he means to quibble, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear witty, or ſay ſomething to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030155_0066_0FE4B10959BD6AA0"/>
of Mr. Giles; but his idea was certainly too complex, his feeble faculties muſt have been ſtrained, he could not therefore develope it; and he ſinks into ſuch unintelligible jargon, that Des Carte, if he were living, could not explain. It is as follows, "If he himſelf, ſpeaking of Mr. Giles, be a copy of ſome original from that country, (Britain) which I believe to be the caſe, in this inſtance I ſhall not contend, that we have copied too much." To ſay that we have copied Mr. Giles from ſome original in England; is as mere nonſenſe, in the common acceptation of the word, as ever was uttered; we might ſay with ſome propriety of thought, that Mr. Giles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf imitated, or copied ſome original perſon, or great orator in that country, had he ever been there; but to ſay that we have copied him, is altogether nonſenſe. For a man of Mr. Giles's ſuperior abilities to think of imitating the Engliſhmen, who come into this country, its entirely out of the queſtion; its what no man in his ſenſes would ever think of doing; except ſome ſilly Scotchman, who was too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy to work and wiſhed to become either a knave, or a drunkard. "Again, ſays Porcupine, I would aſk him,"—notwithſtanding all this bombaſt of Peter's, I will venture to affirm, that if he met Mr. Giles fifty times in the ſtreets, he would not dare aſk him a ſyllable; but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan like, conſcious of ſuperior worth, he would ſtand abaſhed and hang his guilty head. "A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſays Porcupine, I would aſk him, how
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030155_0067_0FE4B10AE9615E58"/>
he came to underſtand that the members of the Britiſh houſe of Commons were very well paid, or in other words corrupted by the king? he knows how ſeverely I could retort upon him here. I could dare him to a compariſon." Lord have mercy on us! how Peter brandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſword! he puts me in mind of certain gentlemen, upon a late expedition, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "ſhew us the fellows, and we will ſkewer them! we want neither Judge nor Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!"<note n="*" place="bottom">See Findley's Hiſtory of the Weſtern Inſurrection.</note> Peter brandiſheth his ſword, turns ſhort upon his heel, and whiſpers ſoftly in Ben's ear; never mind me, you know it is the act of a Briton, to bluſter and threaten; but it often Ben ſerves our purpoſe. As Mr. Giles's time and attention are occupied, on ſubjects of too much importance to the community at large; to anſwer ſuch impertinent, ſilly queſtions; I will undertake to inform Mr. Porcupine, where he may <hi>underſtand</hi> that the Britiſh houſe of Commons are very well paid. Let him read the Patriot, or the Political, Moral and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Repoſitory publiſhed in London by G. G. and J. Robinſon; alſo M'Pherſon's and Torcy's memoirs, which he will find in the houſe of every honeſt citizen; but that may be a reaſon, why he will not read them. He may likewiſe read, "a ſtatement of facts pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, in 1795, by Mr. Morgan F. R. S." in which he will find, among other items, that 150.000<abbr>l.</abbr> ſterling have been appropriated by the Britiſh government to ſecret ſervice money.

Now Porcupine be for once an honeſt candid fellow, and declare upon your conſcience, for your friends will not like you the worſe, I do not mean that conſcience of yours which is like a piece of gum-elaſtic, that ſtretches or contracts itſelf, as circumſtances may require; that is when you abuſe Meſſrs.

600 dollars to your friend Mr. Olden, as rent of a houſe to open a book-ſtore. This will afford you a better opportunity of ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, in ſupport of the Britiſh faction; and ſpreading your nefarious principles; paving the way to a monarchial government.

For all men are not capable of diſtinguiſhing between men and principles; neither are you yourſelf, capable of making that neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; for we often find you when you ſpeak of a certain party, looſe ſight of your own avowed principles; and fall into the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd inconſiſtencies.

Such epithets may ſerve to irritate the citizens, but will never convince them; for they are repugnant to every principle of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and common decency; and are proofs only of a cankered heart, inflated with pride. A people who, from principles of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and ſimilarity of principles in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are attached to the French nation. And if they be attached to the French nation, it is certainly none of Porcupine's buſineſs; he is not a native, neither is he a citizen, according to his own expoſition of things; why then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the air of a dictator, and tell the citizens who they are to love, and who they are to hate? Such conduct exhibits, a degree of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and preſumption, which we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect only from an Engliſhman. For Porcupine has taught us, that it is an Engliſhman only, who would be capable of preaching the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of ingratitude. When other foreigners arrive in this country they act with ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty; they take no decided part in politics, until they have become citizens: But no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er has an Engliſhman arrived upon our ſhores, than he commences paragraphiſt in our newſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, if he be capable of aranging his thoughts, abuſing the French nation, and the citizens ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally throughout the United States; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

attached to them: Or if he be not capable of expreſſing his thoughts in correct language, he is ſure to make noiſe enough at a town-meeting. Mr. S. Claypoole can teſtify to the truth of what is here advanced, that at the laſt town-meeting which was held in the City-hall, for nominating candidates to the federal Houſe of Repreſentatives; a certain young Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who aſſumes by his air and ſtrut, no ſmall degree of conſequence amongſt us, was ſtanding upon a bench along ſide of him, when a certain gentleman's name was propoſed as a candidate; the young Engliſhman inſtantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan hiſſing, with great violence; and turning round to Mr. Claypoole, inſiſted on him to join in the hiſs. Mr. Claypoole, with true republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can dignity, declined degrading himſelf by imitating an animal, which nobody would imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, except an Engliſhman. If theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at the next town-meeting, when they propoſe to offer Mr. Latimer as a candidate in oppoſition to Mr. Swanwick, would imitate the brayings of an aſs; it would perhaps be more congenial to their intellectual faculties. But this deſpicable, as well as many other vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar practices, is the bleſſed effects of our inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connection with England. For there are ſome amongſt us, who ſhew ſuch a paſſion for every thing that is Engliſh; that I believe in my ſoul, they would even * * * * * * * * aye, and old men too! turn macaronies, and walk the ſtreets in bob-tailed coats. I repeat again, that it is no Engliſhman's bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

who the American citizens eſteem, or who they diſeſteem. For to attempt to alien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or reſtrain the affections of the heart, in the fulfilment of its duty; is a degree of tyranny too brutal and abſurd, even to enter the mind of a Dyoniſius. I have already ſaid, that the attachment of the American citizens, to the French nation, aroſe from principles of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſimilarity of principles in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and not as Porcupine wiſhes to inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, becauſe they have guillotined their king, and a ſet of avaricious, unprincipled and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ariſtocrats; who attempted to ſubvert the liberties of the people. The Americans have never ſhewn a diſpoſition to interfere, in the internal government of any country. I am convinced, and I believe, I know as many of the peoples ſentiments as Porcupine; that it was, and is, a matter of indifference to the great body of the American citizens; whether the French guillotined their king and nobles, or ſent them to the glacial promontery in Aſia, to brouze with the goats amongſt the rocks; or to the plains of Dalmatia Nebuchadnezzar-like, to feed with the beaſts of the field; or did with them as your countrymen Porcupine, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do with themſelves, put a halter about their neck. "In the gloomy month of November, ſays Voltaire, when Engliſhmen hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;" and I will add, the redoubtable Duke of York ran away from Flanders; Frenchmen walk out and take the air, well may we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, wonderful people! whilſt Engliſhmen

If the Engliſh had ſuch a man, at the head of their lottery, as Mr. Blodget who would ſport with their property, and their patience; as much and as long, as Blodget has done with the citizens of the United States; Query, to what lengths would the ſuicide have extended? There is no calculating, if ſome honeſt ſturdy drayman, for humanity ſake, would not put a halter about his neck. What honor does this man reflect upon the Preſident, and the federal city?</note>

            <p>In his Cenſor of May, Porcupine obſerves, in a dirty inſinuating manner, that a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man carried about the petition againſt the treaty. The ſervices which that gentleman rendered to the citizens of Philadelphia, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the calamity of 1793, can never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; except by a Porcupine, or an old hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Quaker, whoſe principles may eaſily be reſolved into ſomething worſe, than mere ſelfiſhneſs. But will any man of ſenſe, who is not blinded by party and prejudice, ſay that it was more criminal in a Frenchman, who is bona ſide a citizen of the United States, and carries on an extenſive trade, by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes twenty times more to the ſupport of government, than Porcupine and old Ben to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I ſay was it more criminal in him to carry about a petition againſt the treaty, than for an old tory to carry one about in ſupport of it, who has been through the late revolution no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030155_0074_0FE4B121E87FBCA0"/>
attached to the Britiſh; and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his circumſtances may be, from his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in life, does not contribute half the ſum that the other does to the ſupport of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Of this old tory, who ſometimes aſſumes the garb and language of a Quaker, the following anecdote is in circulation; which ſhews in a ſtriking point of view, the manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres and artifices practiſed by his party; when they wiſh to carry a favorite meaſure. Being on his tour through the northern parts of the city, ſoliciting ſubſcribers in ſupport of the treaty, he ſtept into a Mr. B—'s, and aſked was he at home; there was none preſent but a young girl about ſixteen or ſeventeen, who told him her papa had ſtepped out; old trim pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little, then aſked her could ſhe write, ſhe anſwered in the affirmative; "Well friend, what is thy name," Nancy replied the girl; "Nancy, continues old hypocriſy, N. will alſo ſtand for Nathan, which is a reſpectable ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture name." The old ſerpent then pulled out his ſubſcription-paper, "friend, ſays he, will thee ſign thy name to this paper;" the innocent girl told him, it was what ſhe never did to any paper of the kind, for ſhe was ſure her papa would be diſpleaſed with her, "Friend, continues the old ſerpent, thee does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me, thee may ſet down N. for thy firſt name, and annex to it the other; and people will generally read it Nathan. It is cuſtomary for our wives, and daughters to do ſo; on certain preſſing occaſions, and it will be no
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030155_0075_0FE4B124D1BFE648"/>
harm for thee to do the ſame; thee knows I would not ſuffer any of female friends to ſo, if I thought it were criminal." The girl look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him all this time, with a ſtedfaſtneſs mixed with ſurprize, until he had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when ſhe replied, "Sir, I think, you are the man my papa has often pointed out to me, as the aſſociate of Roberts and Carliſle; who were executed here during the late revolution for toryiſm; and ſome months after my papa had returned from the battle of Monmouth, it was generally believed that you would ſhare their fate alſo." The ſimple unaffected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which ſhe expreſſed theſe ſentiments, ſtruck old broadbrim quite ſilent: he ſaid not a word in reply, but pulled down his hat over his face; and it is confidently affirmed, that this was the firſt time he was ever known to bluſh; or his rigid nerves were agitated. He put his brief in his pocket, and walked off repining, no doubt, at his unlucky ſtars; for ſuffering him to act ſo incautiouſly. Ariſtocratic arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is like the pitcher that goes too often to the pump, it will be broken ſometime. The above tranſaction brings to my recollection, the following lines of Milton's Paradiſe Loſt.</p>

               <pb n="77" facs="unknown:030155_0076_0FE4B1265928DF48"/>Although Porcupine may curſe, and ſwear; tell lies, and wage eternal war againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans; yet in all this he is not alone cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſureable; for it is univerſally acknowledged that the receiver is as bad as the thief; and he who exerts himſelf in propagating lies and calumnies, is as criminal as the inventor. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe book-ſellers who have lent their aid, in ſpreading Porcupine's ſcurrilities abroad we find B—n D—s ſtanding foremoſt with brazen front.<note n="*" place="bottom">There are two or three others we ought to notice; but it would ſwell this pamphlet to too great a ſize, we are therefore obliged to connive at them; until another occaſion.</note> Yet I will venture to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, there is no book-ſeller in Philadelphia, whoſe life has been chequered with ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes, or conduct, except in political mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, more doubtful: Pride, and humility; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and love; ambition, folly, avarice, and diſappointment, excite in this man's heart, ten thouſand complex emotions in the courſe of one day. His whole life has been a ſeries of ſtrange inconſiſtencies, and abſurdities; ſtrange, I ſay, or why ſhould he condemn a whole people for a fault which he is daily guilty of himſelf—the non-payments of his debts?<note n="†" place="bottom">It is remarkable that thoſe men, who are moſt outrageous, in abuſing the Virginians, for an old law exiſting in their ſtate, which prohibits men's real property from being ſold, to pay their debts; are the very men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, who are moſt unwilling to pay their own debts.</note> Why does he not take the mote out of his own eye, before he attempts to cenſure his brother, for the beam in his? Has he yet to learn in his old age, that the firſt act of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, is the payment of his debts? Why
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030155_0077_0FE4B128DCDC1B78"/>
will he wantonly provoke the cenſure of a whole people, who never did him any injury? —does he think they will tamely ſubmit to his calumny, and ſlander; when his own life is not irreproachable?—for he has neither dwelled in a corner, nor have his actions been performed under a buſhel; that he ſhould pride himſelf in his ſecurity, and wantonly ſport with the reputations of men. Of all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting ſights in nature, there is none which is ſo really ſhocking to a man of moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as to behold an old man, with grey heirs, ſtanding upon the brink of eternity, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in his youthful follies; crippled—bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down—and tottering under the load of his tranſgreſſions; it is not alone ſufficient that he ſhould vilify his neighbour; but like the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry leopard that tears the earth for prey, he and Porcupine rake up the aſhes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed patriot, and philoſopher,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Doctor Franklin.</note> to find matter of accuſation againſt the living, and the dead. It is not alone ſufficient to gratify his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hatred and revenge, that he ſhould calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the patriots in Congreſs; but the ſhort-lived prejudices of a whole people,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Bloody Buoy.</note> muſt be blackened into crimes. Yet all theſe are not ſufficient to ſatiate his vindicative, and ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpirit; but like the ravenous wolf, that is prowling after food, he roams abroad to find matter of reproach againſt the innocent, and unſuſpecting of oppoſite principles; by enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the private characters of men, that
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030155_0078_0FE4B130D6577F68"/>
he may, jackal-like, furniſh Porcupine, that poiſonous, bloody-minded monſter, with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for ridicule, and vulgar abuſe.</p>
            <p>But to ſum up all, on the preſent occaſion, with regard to Porcupine and his friends—the former, through the whole of his writings, ridicules the republican party, for the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their purſes; and calls them a ſet of "poor devils." When we conſider, that his principles, on his arrival in this country, and for ſome time after, were republican.<note n="†" place="bottom">This is a fact which Porcupine cannot deny, for he is ſtill well known to ſeveral gentlemen who lodged, and were intimate in the houſe where be lodged, in Pine-ſtreet, immediately after his arrival in this city; "and he was then, ſay they, ſo warm a republican, and an admirer of Paine's writings; that his Rights of Man were ſeldom out of his hands."</note> We may juſtly infer, that he firſt offered his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to that party; ſo that his principles and intereſt, might go hand in hand; or how could he pretend to know the depth of their purſes. Riches do not conſiſt in a well trimmed coat—a powdered head—a pair of large whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers—a gilded chariot—a well choſen ſpencer —or a pompous building: he muſt have lived a ſhort time in Philadelphia, who does not ſee the truth of this remark. Theſe are childiſh trifles, and rarely occupy the attention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans. How then could he aſcertain the wealth of the republican party? the anſwer is obvious, becauſe they would not purchaſe him; hence he infers <hi>they are poor.</hi> But undue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, or ſecret ſervice money being contrary to the principles of republicans, they would not therefore take him into pay; Peter's ſelf-pride
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030155_0079_0FE4B1325DEEA8A0"/>
was wounded, and what will not a proud man do, to ſeek revenge, when his overtures are neglected, or a ſlight indignity offered to his imaginary conſequence: the ſtory of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is a ſtriking proof. From theſe obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we will eaſily find a ſolution for the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilities and unmanly abuſe; which he has poured upon Mr. Madiſon, Giles, Gallatin, Swanwick, and Livingſton: theſe gentlemen poſſeſſing leſs of that faſtidious pride, which diſtinguiſhes many of our well-born; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſier of acceſs, he expected they would have taken him into pay; but Peter was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his judgment of human nature, when he ſuppoſed that ſimplicity and ſociability of manners, were connected with corruptneſs of principles. Their cauſe was good—they ſought for no hireling ſcribe—no wha-wants-me; to blazon their motives, and ſound their trump of fame. But whether the republican party be poor, or rich; or whatever their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be, what property they poſſeſs, I may with confidence affirm, is their own—it is real—their wealth is not imaginary, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a precarious credit with the banks, ſubject to the whims and caprice of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. A hard boiled egg, or a tainted oyſter, in the ſtomach of one of theſe gentlemen, may blaſt ſuch a man's reputation for ever. For it is well known that theſe create indigeſtion; and indigeſtion, to a man of delicate nerves, perverts his underſtanding, renders him peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, fretful and captious; and excites in his
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030155_0080_0FE4B133E802A148"/>
mind, a thouſand abſurd prejudices; like a man poſſeſſed with the jaundice, he ſees every object through a falſe medium. When to theſe obſervations we add, the manner of tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſineſs at the banks; the truth of my remark muſt appear ſtill more unqueſtionable. The directors aſſemble together, and reſolve upon diſcounting a certain ſum; the aſſiſtant caſhier, or ſome other, collects the notes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented for diſcount, and reads in an audible voice, each note; after which he aſks in the ſame tone, "if this man be good;" here is a full opportunity, for a mind fretted by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, to vend its malice and ill nature; if ſuch a one ſays "no," it inevitably damns the note, as none of the other directors will offer to contradict him; for contradiction creates animoſity, and animoſity, among the direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, might lead to the diſcovery of ſomething ſerious, and important.</p>
            <p>How long will you then my fellow citizens, be gulled by men of ſuch factitious wealth; can truth, honor, and integrity, be no where found but amongſt riches! How long will you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer yourſelves to be deluded, by the ſportive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of an hireling ſcribbler? and ſuffer him to ridicule the principles of your conſtitution, which recognizes no diſtinction among the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; but what ariſes from a virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? A hireling wretch, who talks of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whilſt he can only obtain it by proſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his principles.
