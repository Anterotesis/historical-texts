            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE following ſheets were principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by an anonymous perſon, ſaid to be a lady, in IRELAND; from a ſenſe of the great want of ſomething of the kind in that country.</p>
            <p>AS the work is in general executed with much ſimplicity and good ſenſe, as well as piety, it may be no leſs uſeful on this ſide of the water: where, though we abound in ſmall tracts for young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we have none that come up to the idea here propoſed, of making the Bible eaſy and intelligible to children; and ſo as to guard them at the ſame time againſt the wrong conceptions and prejudices which they might otherwiſe imbibe from reading the hiſtories at length, of the Old Teſtament eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in a book of ſuch a ſingular caſt and ſtile, and treating of matters ſo much above their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent comprehenſion.</p>
            <q>
               <p>With regard to the method of teaching this book, ſays the author in a ſhort preface to the work, that which I have experienced to be moſt for the eaſe of the Maſter and Pupil, is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
               <p>While the children are employed at any work, let the maſter or miſtreſs read to them one of theſe ſtories by way of amuſement, beginning with the firſt; and it will naturally entertain and intereſt them. When each has repeated it again to the maſter, not in the words of the book, but in their own (retaining, however, all the ſenſe) then read them the next ſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:028888_0003_0FDE5754685C7560"/>
The queſtions and anſwers at the end of the chapters, are of too much importance to be paſſed over lightly; but they ſhould not be taught by rote. If the children do not ſpontaneouſly aſk thoſe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelves, let the maſter firſt ſuggeſt, and then anſwer them. Let him occaſionally repeat thoſe doubts to them, and he will judge by their anſwers, whether they have really imbibed their meaning or not; and if it appears they have not, he muſt again read to them the anſwers as in the book, till they are perfectly fixed in their minds.</p>
               <p>All this may be done in an eaſy good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured way, as an indulgence, and not as a taſk. A little every day will bring them on as faſt as can be deſired.</p>
            </q>
            <p>"I ſuppoſe it unneceſſary to caution ſuch maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as are diſpoſed to obſerve the foregoing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, that they muſt take care before they teach a new leſſon, to know whether the children remember the ſubſtance of all the preceding ones. This is very eaſily done in the way of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and by trying whether they retain the titles of each chapter in their regular ſucceſſion."</p>
            <p>Although this compilation from the ſcriptures is mentioned as being chiefly deſigned for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet whoever knows the ſtate of religious knowledge in this country, will eaſily ſee, that thoſe of a riper age may find it a good aſſiſtant to lead them into juſt and proper views of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed hiſtory of the dealings of Almighty God with mankind in the different ages of the world.</p>

               <p>WE find by the firſt chapter of the book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Holy Bible, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty made the world in ſix days. He made the day and the night, the heaven above, the dry land and the ſea, the trees, and plants that grow upon the earth, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, fiſh and fowl, and four footed beaſts, and he alſo made the firſt man. He formed him out of duſt, and called him <hi>Adam,</hi> and gave him power over every thing upon earth.</p>
               <p>He commanded the ſeventh day to be kept holy for ever, which is one of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we go to church every <hi>Sunday,</hi> and make it a holy day.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God. For he gave us life, and all we have. He keeps us from all harm, and loves us as long as we endeavour to be like him in goodneſs.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do we learn from the hiſtory of the creation?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> We ſhould learn to praiſe God for having made birds, and beaſts, and fiſh uſeful to us; and we ſhould not uſe any of them cruelly, or give them unneceſſary pain.</p>

               <head type="sub">GENESIS ii. iii. THE FALL OF ADAM.</head>
               <p>GOD Almighty put <hi>Adam</hi> into a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant garden, called <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> or the garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> and God ſaid, man ſhould not be alone, he would make a companion for him—he did ſo; and gave
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:028888_0006_0FDE57E349606FB8"/>
her to <hi>Adam</hi> to be his wife. <hi>Adam</hi> loved her exceedingly, and called her <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our kind Creator, who is all goodneſs, and deſirous to make us happy, gave <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> every thing, except one tree which ſtood in the middle of the garden. He forbade them to eat the fruit of that tree, and told them if they did eat of it, they ſhould die.</p>
               <p>They lived very happily in that garden for ſome time, and had nothing to trouble them while they were good and innocent. But evil thoughts and deſires crept into the mind of Eve, and tempted her to eat what was forbidden; when ſhe had eaten of that forbidden fruit, ſhe deſired her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to do the ſame, and he was perſuaded, though he knew that it was wrong, to eat ſome too. But when they had done eating they were aſhamed, and grew very uneaſy, and went to hide themſelves behind the trees in the garden.—All people who have done wrong are troubled in mind, it is only good people that are happy within their own breaſts, and pleaſed with the reſt of the world; becauſe they know they have done well, and that God loves them, and that every body ſhould ſpeak well of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028888_0007_0FDE575F565C49F8"/>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> thought in their fright to hide themſelves from God; but he knows every thing, and ſees every where, even into our thoughts. He called to them and aſked them, why they had eaten the fruit which he had commanded them not to eat? <hi>Eve</hi> anſwered, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, meaning her own evil inclination, had perſuaded her, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid his wife had perſuaded him.—God is not to be put off with excuſes, what he commands, muſt be minded. So he directly turned them out of that happy place, and ſent them to wander about in a wild country, overgrown with weeds and briars, where they could get nothing to eat but what they dug and ploughed, and laboured hard for. There they grew old, and ſickly, and died.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſhould we do when we have done wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Whenever we have done wrong, we ſhould never make excuſes, or endeavour to hide our faults, for that is a kind of falſehood; but we ſhould at once confeſs that we are to blame, be ſorry for our fault, and endeavour to do ſo no more, that we may be forgiven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How far can God ſee?</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> He can ſee every where, for he is not like us. He ſees and hears from one part of the world to the other, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon all wiſe people fear God more than man. It is impoſſible to hide any thing from him; and as he loves us, he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways puniſh us one way or other when we do ill, in order to make us grow better.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What elſe do we learn from this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we ought to be very careful not to do any thing that can be the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to God, however trifling it may appear to us, as we cannot tell what evil may befal us in conſequence.

to God and his parents.

He thought they were alone, and that nobody would ever know it, but God is always preſent with us.

                  <hi>A.</hi> We may learn from the hiſtory of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> how wrong it is not to love one another, and whenever we are going to do any thing that is ill-natured, or to quarrel with one another, we ſhould do well to remember, that by indulging theſe habits, <hi>Cain</hi> was tempted at laſt to murder his brother, and was driven away from his parents, into a ſtrange country.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>ADAM</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had another ſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> called <hi>Seth,</hi> and alſo ſeveral other children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cain</hi> too had a great many children, and thoſe children, when they grew up to be men and women had ſeveral children of their own, ſo that the world became full of people. After the death of their fathers, theſe children grew very wicked, they were ill-natured and quarrelſome, gave way to their paſſions, neglected to think of God, or to ſay their prayers; and God was ſo offended with them, that he reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the whole world.</p>
               <p>There was however among them one good man called <hi>Noah,</hi> and God took care he ſhould not ſuffer with the reſt. He therefore taught him how to make a kind of covered boat, of prodigious bigneſs, called an Ark, and bade him to go into it with all his family, and take with him all ſorts of beaſts and birds, and then to ſhut himſelf up in it.</p>
               <p>When he had done ſo, God ſent ſo much rain for forty days and nights, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028888_0012_0FDE57F5B93B0040"/>
roſe up to the tops of the houſes and of the trees on the higheſt mountains, ſo that the men, women, and children, were every one of them drowned. All this while <hi>Noah'</hi>s Ark floated ſafely upon the waters, and no miſchief befel him, for God was pleaſed with him. At laſt the Ark reſted upon a high mountain, which is called <hi>Mount Ararat;</hi> and at the end of ſeven months the rain being gone, God ſent a ſtrong wind to dry the ground. <hi>Noah</hi> then opened a window and let out a raven; this is a bird that feeds upon dead bodies, and he found ſo much to eat that he went back no more. After ſeven days <hi>Noah</hi> let out a dove, which is a bird like a pigeon, but it flew back to him very ſoon, becauſe it could find no dry place to perch upon. In ſeven days more <hi>Noah</hi> let out the dove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and it came back with an olive branch in its bill. <hi>Noah</hi> knew by this that the waters were almoſt dried from off the earth, and when he let out the bird again, it came back to him no more. He ſoon after ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to open the door and go out with all his family. The firſt thing they did was to kneel down and praiſe God, for having ſaved them; good people always praiſe God for every thing, becauſe they know that all comes from him. God was ſo pleaſed with ſeeing <hi>Noah</hi> thankful, that he bleſſed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028888_0013_0FDE5771EDCBE850"/>
him, and bade him look up and ſee a rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, which he told him was for a token, that the world never would be drowned again. <hi>Noah</hi> lived a great while after this with his wife, his three ſons, and their wives and children. When he grew very old and weak, he died in peace.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do we learn from the hiſtory of <hi>Noah</hi> and the flood?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We ſhould learn to be good and to truſt entirely in God.</p>
               <p>Whenever you ſee a rainbow, remember it was the ſign which God gave of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving mankind, and you ſhould never look at it without thanking him in your mind for his goodneſs and his mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is dying?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is for the body to become ſenſeleſs, ſo as not to ſtand, or to move, or ſee, or hear, or ſpeak, or feel—in ſhort, dying is like going to ſleep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there an end of men when they die?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; men are to live after death: they that have been good in this world, are to be raiſed again, and to be taken into Heaven, and to be with God, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body can hurt them: where they will feel no pain, nor ſorrow, nor ſickneſs, where they will be always good, and always glad and never die again. As for bad people
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028888_0014_0FDE57FD67916500"/>
when they have died, they cannot go to Heaven, but they muſt be ſhut out of that good and happy place. God will not have them near him, and they will be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miſerable for the idle and wicked lives they have led in this world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the greateſt misfortune that can befal us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is to offend or diſpleaſe God, who always puniſhes thoſe that are wicked.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the greateſt happineſs we can enjoy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is to be in favour with God, who always loves thoſe that are good, and bleſſes them.</p>

And <hi>Abraham</hi> did obey this command, and believed in the promiſe of God; and he took with him a nephew, his brother's ſon called <hi>Lot:</hi> and they had a great many cattle and ſervants, and there was not food enough in the country for them all to travel together, and their ſervants began to diſpute with each other.

               <p>
                  <hi>ABRAHAM,</hi> after his nephew <hi>Lot</hi> had left him, lived in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> with his wife <hi>Sarah.</hi> He was ſo very good a man, that God loved him exceedingly, and told him <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould have a ſon, and that that ſon ſhould have children, and thoſe children would have a great many other children. That in this manner he would have a very large family, which ſhould afterwards inherit the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> and in that family would be born, after a great many years, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> our Saviour, who would teach men how they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028888_0019_0FDE577FAD60AB30"/>
might be delivered from the ignorance and wickedneſs, and doubts and fears, into which the greater part of them would fall; and would tell them how to live well and die comfortably, and to get poſſeſſion of a better life, and a better happineſs than they can have in this world, neither of which will ever have an end: and that thus, in <hi>Abraham</hi> and his family, all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Abraham</hi> had been told this by God Almighty, he and his wife <hi>Sarah</hi> lived many years, till they were both grown old, and ſtill ſhe had no child: <hi>Abraham</hi> was very eaſy about this, for he knew that what God promiſes he always performs in his own good time; but <hi>Sarah</hi> being a ſilly woman, fretted and ſhewed great impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. At laſt three angels came to him, and told him God remembered his promiſe, and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould ſoon bring him a ſon. She was behind the door and heard them, but ſhe did not believe God's word, but laughed at what they ſaid, though ſhe might have remembered that God Almighty can do what he pleaſes. And he, from whom nothing is hid, cauſed her to be aſked why ſhe laughed? upon which ſhe began to be frightened, and ſaid ſhe did not laugh. So ſhe was guilty of two great faults, the one
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028888_0020_0FDE580CF6603638"/>
was telling a falſehood, the other was not believing God's power.</p>
               <p>Soon after ſhe had a ſon, and he was called <hi>Iſaac.</hi> When he was grown a great boy, and his father was very fond of him, and very thankful to God for his goodneſs in having beſtowed him, God Almighty had a mind to ſhew the world that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> truſted him as much as he ought, and believed in the promiſes of God (that his deſcendants ſhould poſſeſs the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and that of his family by <hi>Iſaac, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhould be born) God therefore bade him take his ſon up to a high mountain, and there ſacrifice him; that is, kill him in a certain manner, and burn his dead body. <hi>Abraham</hi> knew that what Almighty God has promiſed he always performs, and that he never requires any thing which it is not right and beſt for us to do: they who love God as much as his goodneſs to us deſerves, ſhould be willing to give up their life, or any thing elſe to him when he calls for it; and although <hi>Abraham</hi> loved his ſon much, he loved God better, and was always ready to do whatever would pleaſe him. So with out ſaying one word, tho' grieved to the heart, he directly took his ſon with him to the mountain, and was juſt going to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice him, when God called out to him not to do it, for that he only meant to try him
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028888_0021_0FDE5785A03DE418"/>
for an example to others. He then came down from the mountain again very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with his ſon, and God told <hi>Abraham,</hi> that ſince he had been ſo ready to obey him, he ſhould ſee his ſon married, and have children; and that he would bleſs him in many ways. As for <hi>Sarah,</hi> God Almighty did not think fit that ſhe ſhould live to ſee her ſon married; but after her death, <hi>Abraham</hi> began to think of a wife for <hi>Iſaac.</hi> He did not like any of the women of that country, becauſe they were not well behaved; ſo he ſent an old faithful ſervant into his own country among his couſins, to get a wife for his ſon. When the ſervant came near the city of <hi>Nachor</hi> in <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> he ſtopped at a well, and kneeled down to pray for God's bleſſing, for he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be done without that. And he prayed to God Almighty, to ſend to the well the woman he choſe for his maſter's ſon <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and that when he aſked her to draw water for him, ſhe might anſwer, I will give you water and to your camels too; by which he ſhould know, that was the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man God had ſent. God Almighty, though he does not always grant us the particular favours that we aſk, becauſe in our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we often aſk for what would hurt ourſelves or others, yet thought proper to hear this prayer of <hi>Abraham'</hi>s ſervant, for
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028888_0022_0FDE5812373335D8"/>
ſoon after <hi>Rebekah,</hi> the couſin of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> came. He aſked her for water, and ſhe ſaid, I will give you water, and to your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels too. Then he thanked God that he had found the woman he wanted, and he went with her home to her father's, and aſked his conſent to the marriage. The father conſented, and ſo did ſhe; after a few days he brought her to the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw her married to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and ſhe made him a very good wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> lived after that ſome time, and continued with all his houſehold to ſet an excellent example of worſhipping and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the only true God; for which he is honoured with being called the friend of God, and will be rewarded by him in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world.</p>

               <p>WHEN <hi>Eſau</hi> came home with the veniſon, and had prepared it for his father, he brought it to him; but his father was much ſurpriſed, and told him he had been with him already, and had got
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028888_0027_0FDE579B436AAA10"/>
his bleſſing, and aſked him why he came for it again. Then when <hi>Iſaac</hi> knew the truth, he trembled exceedingly, but he could not contradict what he had already done. But <hi>Eſau</hi> was very angry, and he ſaid that when his father was dead he would kill <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Rebekah</hi> heard that, ſhe adviſed <hi>Jacob</hi> to go away, for fear <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be tempted to do like <hi>Cain,</hi> that murdered his brother. <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave <hi>Jacob</hi> leave to go, and deſired he would take a wife among his own relations, as he himſelf had done. So <hi>Jacob</hi> went to his mother's brother <hi>Laban,</hi> who lived in the ſame place that <hi>Abraham'</hi>s ſervant had taken <hi>Rebekah</hi> from, when he brought her to <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> travelled on till it was dark, then he lay down in a field, and ſet his head upon a ſtone for a pillow, and fell aſleep. He dreamed that he ſaw a great ladder, the top of it reaching to the heavens, and the angels of God aſcending and deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, going up and down. He dreamed alſo that God Almighty called to him from the top of it, and told him he was the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and that he would bleſs him too, and he ſhould have ſo many children, that they and their children ſhould be like the ſtars in the heavens, or like grains of ſand for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028888_0028_0FDE58210AEA28B0"/>
and that the promiſes made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſhould be fulfilled in his family.</p>
               <p>The next morning after <hi>Jacob</hi> had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, as every body ought to do night and morning, he went on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney till he came to the well, where <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham'</hi>s ſervant met his mother <hi>Rebekah.</hi> Soon after he had ſtopped there, he ſaw a girl called <hi>Rachel, Rebekah'</hi>s brother <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban'</hi>s daughter, coming with a pitcher to draw water: <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was a very civil young man, ran and drew the water for her: then he told her he was her couſin, and went home with her to <hi>Laban</hi> his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. <hi>Laban</hi> was very glad to ſee his ſiſter <hi>Rebekah'</hi>s ſon, and deſired <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſtay and live with him. Soon after <hi>Jacob</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Laban</hi> to let him marry <hi>Rachel,</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> told him he ſhould have her if he would ſerve him ſeven years. <hi>Jacob</hi> agreed to it; but at the end of the ſeven years, <hi>Laban</hi> was ſo bad a man, that he broke his promiſe, and, inſtead of <hi>Rachel,</hi> he gave him his eldeſt daughter <hi>Leah</hi> for a wife. <hi>Jacob</hi> was very ſorry, becauſe he did not love <hi>Leah</hi> ſo well as <hi>Rachel,</hi> and he aſked <hi>Laban</hi> how he could ſerve him ſo. <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid, he only did it becauſe it was the cuſtom of that country to marry the eldeſt daughter firſt, but if he would ſerve him ſeven years more he ſhould have
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028888_0029_0FDE579FEA031C98"/>
                  <hi>Rachel</hi> too. As for <hi>Jacob,</hi> he was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to marry <hi>Rachel,</hi> that he conſented to any terms; and he got her for ſeven years' ſervice more. <hi>Jacob</hi> lived a long while with his father-in-law <hi>Laban,</hi> and was ſo careful, that God proſpered every thing he undertook. He alſo gave him ſeveral children, twelve ſons and one daughter, called <hi>Dinah,</hi> but there were only two of the ſons that belonged to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> and their names were <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin.</hi> At laſt <hi>Jacob</hi> finding his family ſo large, had a mind to leave <hi>Laban,</hi> and go home to his own country, and his father's houſe. But <hi>Laban</hi> was a ſelfiſh man, he thought of nothing but his own intereſt; ſo becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> was very uſeful to him, he did not care to part with him, and wanted that he ſhould remain his ſervant all his life. However, God is always the friend of the oppreſſed; that is, of thoſe people who are not ſo well uſed as they ought to be, and ſo he was on the ſide of <hi>Jacob.</hi> He would not ſuffer <hi>Laban</hi> to uſe him ill; but thought fit that he ſhould go away, and <hi>Jacob</hi> went. He took with him his wives and children, his ſervants, his cattle, and all his goods.</p>
               <p>When they had gone a part of the way, ſome of his ſervants who went on before, came running back to him, and told him
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028888_0030_0FDE5826E0313600"/>
they had ſeen his brother <hi>Eſau</hi> coming, and ſeveral people with him. Then <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſadly affrighted, and did not know what to do, for he dreaded ſome harm to his tender family; but wiſe people always pray to God when they are in trouble, and if it is good for them, he relieves them. <hi>Jacob</hi> therefore prayed fervently, and God put it in his head what to do. He picked out ſome of the fineſt of his cattle, and of all the beſt things he had, and ſent them on before him, deſiring his ſervants, when <hi>Eſau</hi> aſked whoſe they were, to ſay they belonged to their maſter <hi>Jacob,</hi> and that he ſent them as a preſent to his brother <hi>Eſau.</hi> A ſoft anſwer turneth away wrath. <hi>Eſau</hi> was ſo moved at <hi>Jacob'</hi>s mild and obliging behaviour, that it drove away all his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and when <hi>Jacob</hi> came near and kneeled down to him, <hi>Eſau</hi> took him up and kiſſed him, and they were very good friends. This made <hi>Jacob</hi> very happy, for he found that his brother had forgiven him, and a good-natured man loves peace and good humour, and hates to quarrel with any body. Then <hi>Eſau</hi> went and lived in <hi>Mount Seir,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> travelled on towards the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> had lived. In his way there, he ſtopped at a place called <hi>Sichem,</hi> to reſt his family. Then his daughter <hi>Dinah</hi> took it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028888_0031_0FDE57A58FD82ED0"/>
into her head to go and viſit the girls of that country; and when ſhe was abroad, one of the young men of the place, ſon to the king, took hold of her and ran away with her. When her brothers heard of it, they went after him and his companions: they fought, and there were ſeveral people killed; all which miſchief <hi>Dinah</hi> was the cauſe of, becauſe ſhe did not ſtay at home, as ſober modeſt girls all do, but went away from thoſe who would have befriended and protected her. And it grieved poor <hi>Jacob</hi> very much to ſee how many had loſt their lives by this accident. Afterwards he went on his journey, and came to the land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but <hi>Rachel</hi> died by the way, and he buried her About this time God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was pleaſed to ſignify to <hi>Jacob</hi> by an angel, that he ſhould take the ſurname of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>JACOB</hi> was much grieved for his wife <hi>Rachel,</hi> and he was fonder of <hi>Joſeph</hi> than of his other children, becauſe he was her eldeſt ſon, and was a very good boy. But his brothers hated him, and were very jealous of him, becauſe their father loved him ſo much: for bad people often hate good people out of jealouſy; and are ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to them, and try to hurt them, but God is their friend, and defends them from all miſchief, and never forſakes them, as you will ſee by this ſtory of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The young man dreamed one night that he was in the fields with his brothers binding ſheaves of corn, and that his ſheaf ſtood upright, and their ſheaves bowed down to it. <hi>Joſeph</hi> very innocently told his brothers this dream, and another dream that was like it; but they were quite angry when they heard them, and reſolved to get rid of him at any rate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:028888_0033_0FDE57AB275A3FD0"/>
One day they being out in the fields, a great way from home, taking care of the flock, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſent <hi>Joſeph</hi> to them to bring him word how they did. When they ſaw him coming, they cried out, here is the dreamer, let us kill him. But <hi>Reuben,</hi> the elder brother, ſaid, no, we will not ſtain our hands with a brother's blood; but we will ſtrip him and throw him into a pit. After they had done it, ſome merchants that were going into <hi>Egypt,</hi> paſſed by, and the brothers dragged him out of the pit, and ſold him to them. Then they killed a kid, and dipped <hi>Joſeph'</hi>s clothes in the blood, and brought them to poor old <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> and made him believe that a wild beaſt had devoured <hi>Joſeph;</hi> that is, had eaten him up. <hi>Jacob</hi> was in the greateſt grief that could be for the loſs of ſo good a child, and his wicked ſons were ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted as to ſee him ſuffer, and yet not make his mind eaſier, by telling him the truth. But God Almighty directs every thing for the beſt, and his bleſſing went with <hi>Joſeph</hi> into the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſo that though he was among ſtrangers, he was not friendleſs. The merchants ſold him to one <hi>Potiphar;</hi> and he ſerved him ſome time, and behaved ſo well, that <hi>Potiphar</hi> had a great regard for him. But <hi>Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phar'</hi>s wife was a very bad woman, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028888_0034_0FDE58311EC78440"/>
wanted to perſuade <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be bad too! however he was too wiſe and good to yield, that is, to give way to temptation; ſo then out of ſpite and malice, ſhe told a lie of him to her huſband; and <hi>Potiphar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved all ſhe ſaid, and was ſo angry with poor <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he ſent him to priſon. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was always mild and patient, and civil, which made every body love him wherever he went; and the jailor, that is, the keeper of the priſon, grew ſo fond of him, he did not put him in irons, or faſten him with chains like the other priſoners, nor keep him in one room, but let him go about the houſe. There were in the ſame priſon two other priſoners; the chief baker of king <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his chief butler, whom they called his cup-bearer. The chief baker dreamed he had three baſkets upon his head, full of baked meats for the king's table, and that the birds of the air came and devoured them. As for the butler, he dreamed that he held three branches of a vine-tree in his hand, that they were full of grapes, and that he ſqueezed them into a cup, for wine to ſerve up at the king's table. They were both very uneaſy to know what theſe dreams could mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaw by their countenances that they were troubled; he aſked them what ailed them, and they told him what ſtrange
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028888_0035_0FDE57AFE7F81DE0"/>
dreams they had dreamed, and that they wiſhed to know the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>Dreams very ſeldom have any meaning at all, and it is fooliſh to be concerned about them; for when people ſleep badly, their heads are diſturbed, and rambling thoughts paſs through their minds. But as for theſe two dreams, God Almighty directed them on purpoſe, for wiſe reaſons of his own, as we ſhall ſee by and by. He alſo put it into <hi>Joſeph'</hi>s head to explain thoſe dreams to them. So he told the baker, that his dream ſignified that in three days <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would order him to be hanged; but as to the cup-bearer, he told him, he would, in three days, fill out wine to the king; and then he begged he would ſpeak for him, that he might be let out of priſon. The cup-bearer promiſed him fair; but when he got out on the third day, his joy made him ſo ungrateful that he forgot poor <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who remained in priſon two years longer.</p>
               <p>At the end of that time God ſent a ſtrange dream to king <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have it interpreted or explained, and none of the wife people of that country could underſtand it, becauſe God had not revealed, that is, had not made it known to them; for we know nothing but what God diſcovers to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:028888_0036_0FDE583728BAFC98"/>
So then the chief butler thought of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and told the king of him; and the king ſent for him out of priſon, and ſaid to him, I hear that you can explain dreams. I have had a ſtrange one that I wiſh to know the meaning of. I thought I ſaw ſeven fat oxen come out of a river, and ſeven lean ones come after them, who eat up the fat ones. Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> told him, that it was only by the power of God that dreams could be explained, and that the ſeven fat oxen meant ſeven years of great plenty, and after them would come ſeven years of famine, that is, the weather would be ſo bad that the corn would be all ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there would be none to make bread of for ſeven years; and this was the meaning of the ſeven lean oxen that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the fat ones. Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> adviſed him, when the ſeven years of great plenty came, to build granaries or ſtore-houſes, and lay up a great deal of corn in them, ſo that, in the time of famine, the king might ſell the corn to the people for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and they would have bread enough. When the king found that God had made <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſo wiſe, he ſet him over every body, and commanded all the people to obey him. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was then become a great man, took care in the ſeven years of plenty, to build granaries, and provide corn
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028888_0037_0FDE57BD95556D00"/>
ſufficient to feed the people when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine came; and the king had ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on him, that when any perſons came to him, he ſent them all to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> The famine was all over <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where old <hi>Jacob</hi> lived. He was told there was bread in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but little thought his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the diſpoſing of it. However, he ſent all his other ſons, except <hi>Benjamin,</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> with money to buy corn for bread. When they were brought before <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they bowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down before him, with their faces to the earth; they did not know him, but he knew them, and he aſked them if their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was alive, and if they had any more brothers. They told him they never had but two more; one called <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had been devoured by wild beaſts, and the other, called <hi>Benjamin,</hi> was at home with their father. Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> ordered their ſacks to be filled with corn, and bade his ſervants put in the money too, which they had brought to pay for it. When they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended going away, he put them into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement for three days; and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed them, he told them, that when they wanted more they muſt bring <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them, or they ſhould have none; and he kept <hi>Simeon,</hi> one of their brothers, to make ſure of their coming back. They were all
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028888_0038_0FDE583C29F1FDC8"/>
much affrighted at this, and they ſaid one to another, We are verily guilty concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear; therefore behold alſo his blood is required. Thus we ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when bad men meet with any misfortune, their conſciences always accuſe them, and their ſufferings are much harder to bear, when they conſider that they have deſerved them by their wickedneſs. When they went home, and found the money with the corn in their ſacks, they were both ſurprized and afraid. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, that might be a miſtake of the ſervants, but bade them remember to carry it back, when they went again; for an honeſt man would not cheat another, though he was ſure of being never found out; becauſe God ſees all we do, and never fails to puniſh us one time or other. At laſt, when all the corn was eaten up, <hi>Jacob</hi> deſired his ſons to go and buy more. This made them very uneaſy, for they durſt not go without <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and they knew it would grieve <hi>Jacob</hi> to part with him. At laſt they ventured to put him in mind, that the great man who ſold them the corn, ſaid they ſhould have no more unleſs <hi>Benjamin</hi> came with them. When poor <hi>Jacob</hi> heard this, he cried, and ſaid, he was already deprived of two of his ſons, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028888_0039_0FDE57C25E82C2B0"/>
                  <hi>Simeon,</hi> and if he loſt <hi>Benjamin</hi> too, it would break his heart. Then <hi>Judah,</hi> the eldeſt ſon, begged he would not be uneaſy, and promiſed to take all the care he could of the boy, and all the other ſaid the ſame. So <hi>Jacob</hi> gave them money to buy more wheat, and did not forget to ſend back the other money that was the price of the corn they had bought before. He then ſuffered <hi>Benjamin</hi> to go with them, and prayed earneſtly to God to bleſs them all.</p>
               <p>When they came to <hi>Egypt,</hi> they were brought directly to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who, when he ſaw his brother <hi>Benjamin,</hi> his mother <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel'</hi>s child, he was ſo moved he could not help crying with joy, and turned away, that they ſhould not ſee him. He then invited them to dinner, and put five times more meat upon <hi>Benjamin'</hi>s plate than upon the others, which they all wondered at. When they took leave, he privately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his ſervants, after they had filled their ſacks with corn, to put his ſilver cup into the mouth of <hi>Benjamin'</hi>s ſack. He alſo deſired them to follow his brothers, and aſk them how they could be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to their maſter, who had been ſo civil to them, and why they ſtole his ſilver cup, and were carrying it away. They all ſaid, indeed they had not ſtolen any thing; that all their ſacks might be opened, and if
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:028888_0040_0FDE5841D039BF60"/>
it was found among them, they were willing to go to priſon. So all the ſacks were opened, and it was found in <hi>Benjamin'</hi>s ſack. Poor <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who knew nothing of the matter, was very much aſhamed, and grieved when he ſaw it; and the ſervants ſaid, he muſt go directly to priſon. Then all his brothers went back with him to beg him off; for they were not wicked now, as they had been when they ſold <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but were grown very good, and had rather have gone to priſon themſelves, than leave <hi>Benjamin</hi> behind; becauſe it would grieve their father to loſe him. So they went back lamenting, and when they came to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> they kneeled down before him; and <hi>Judah</hi> begged he would put him in priſon inſtead of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and let the boy go back to his old father; but <hi>Joſeph</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be very angry, and ſaid he would not let him go. This gave all the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the greateſt concern. Then <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſo moved at finding they were peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that is, ſorry for their paſt fault, that he could hold out no longer, but threw his arms about their necks, and ſaid, I am your brother <hi>Joſeph:</hi> Doth my father yet live? Be ye not grieved, or angry with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ye ſold me hither; for God, who orders every thing for the beſt, ſent me here before you to preſerve life. Then
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:028888_0041_0FDE57C7F5552ED8"/>
he deſired them to go back to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and tell their father that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was alive, and in favor with God and man; and that he muſt come down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with his whole family, where they ſhould all be taken care of.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jacob</hi> heard the joyful news, he made haſte to go and ſee his ſon; and as ſoon as king <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heard that <hi>Joſeph'</hi>s father was come, he ſent for him, and ſpoke very civilly to him, and gave him a place to live in, called the land of <hi>Goſhen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And after ſome time, when <hi>Jacob</hi> was a very old man, he died in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but his ſons carried him to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be buried. Before he died, he called all his ſons together, and bleſſed them, and foretold many things that afterwards befel them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob,</hi> we ſee, in his life had many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. He was in fear of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and had reaſon ſo to be. He was deceived by <hi>Laban,</hi> and was afterwards oppreſſed by him; his daughter behaved very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and his ſons were very revengeful; and then he loſt his beloved wife <hi>Rachel.</hi> Afterwards the evil diſpoſitions of ſome of his ſons, and the loſs (as for many years he apprehended) of his good ſon <hi>Joſeph,</hi> were indeed very heavy afflictions. But on the other hand he had many bleſſings.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were theſe ſorrows any of them oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by his having deceived his father?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; ſome of them were, but he was afterwards very obedient to the commands of God, and Almighty God knew that he would be ſo, and was therefore ſo very good as never to forſake him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does God puniſh wicked people the minute they commit a fault?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He is ſure to puniſh them one time or other. Sometimes it is that moment, like <hi>Lot'</hi>s wife, but, very often not till a good while after, and ſometimes he does not puniſh us in this world, but in another. And this is the worſt of all puniſhments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does Almighty God ever pardon people that have done ill?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Never, if they do not repent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is repenting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is acknowledging; that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing our faults, and being very ſorry for them, praying earneſtly to God to forgive us, and if we have done harm to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, making it up to them every way in our power; and taking care never to offend again. This is true repentance, or peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; but if we are penitent to day, and ſin again to-morrow, our penitence is of no uſe. Nothing but growing very good, can make up for our paſt ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is it to ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:028888_0043_0FDE57CD25C5D0A8"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is doing any thing that we believe to be wrong, and that God does not like, and he does not like any thing that can hurt ourſelves or other people, or that ſhews diſreſpect to him. He has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us never to tell as lie, or do any ſort of miſchief, to be very modeſt and civil, and to do every thing we are bid by thoſe who are ſet over us, if it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the commands of God. Then they will love us, and God will love us too, and we ſhall be happy in this world and in the next.</p>
               <p>You ſee that the brothers of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who had been ſo cruel and wicked towards him, were afterwards very ſorry for it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented heartily; and when God found they were become very penitent, he forgave them, and bleſſed them, and they were very happy. <hi>Joſeph</hi> forgave them too; for good people are always ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give offences, as God is ready to forgive us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What were the names of <hi>Jacob'</hi>s twelve ſons?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Dan, Naphthali, Gad, Aſher, Iſſachar, Zebulon, Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> We may learn that Almighty God often ſerves himſelf of the evil bad paſſions of men to bring about his own good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do we ſometimes ſee that what we have thought our greateſt ſorrows, are in the end very great bleſſings?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes. <hi>Jacob</hi> thought the loſs of his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> the greateſt misfortune, yet <hi>Jacob</hi> lived to ſee that his beloved ſon was by this means made an inſtrument of great good to many nations, and that the perſons of <hi>Jacob'</hi>s own family in particular were preſerved alive, when they would otherwiſe have died for want of food; and if <hi>Joſeph</hi> had not been ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he would not have enjoyed the happineſs of ſaving his father, and forgiving his brothers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſhould we learn from this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To acquieſce patiently in, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly to, all the events of God's providence, and to believe, that if we bear them properly, they will in the end make us happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Does Almighty God ſee things as we ſee them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No. For we ſee but a very little way; but Almighty God knows every thing that will happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Would <hi>Jacob</hi> have wept ſo, and have been ſo very ſorry to have parted with <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:028888_0045_0FDE57D26F1279E0"/>
if he had known that <hi>Benjamin</hi> ſhould go to the land of <hi>Egypt</hi> in ſafety, that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> was alive and a great man there, and that he ſhould ſee all his children again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, he would not: his ſorrow was cauſed in part by his ignorance of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.

was dead, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the king was dead, there came another king <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his place, who never knew <hi>Joſeph.</hi> He was a very bad man, followed his own proud cruel thoughts, inſtead of hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the commands of God, and uſed the <hi>Hebrews</hi> very ill. He made them labor very hard, in hopes it would kill them, but when he found that would not do, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his ſervants, whenever a <hi>Hebrew</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was brought to bed of a ſon, to take the child and deſtroy it. There was a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> woman called <hi>Jochabed,</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a ſon, The poor woman being very deſirous to ſave him, but afraid of the king's anger, put him in a baſket, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to the river <hi>Nile,</hi> and ſet it among the ruſhes; then went a little way off, and left her daughter <hi>Miriam</hi> to ſee what would become of it.</p>
               <p>Soon after the king's daughter came with her maids to bathe in the river, and when ſhe heard the child cry, ſhe pitied him, and ſaid ſhe would take care of him.

                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:028888_0047_0FDE57DC8B7E7D58"/>
After he was grown up to be a man, he one day ſaw an <hi>Egyptian;</hi> that is, a man of the kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> uſing a <hi>Hebrew</hi> very ill; <hi>Moſes</hi> was provoked to ſee his countryman oppreſſed, and in his defence ſtruck the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> ſo that he fell down and died. Then <hi>Moſes</hi> was afraid the king would put him to death, ſo he ran away to the land of <hi>Midian.</hi> The prince or prieſt of that country was called <hi>Jethro;</hi> he married his daughter to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and let him live with him, and take care of his ſheep. One day as <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the fields feeding his father-in law's flocks, he ſaw a buſh flaming with fire, and yet the buſh was not burnt; that is, was not conſumed by the fire. He thought this very ſtrange, and drew near to ſee how it could be, when a voice called out of it and ſaid, I am the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> take off thy ſhoes, for the place thou ſtandeſt upon is holy ground. I have ſeen the oppreſſion of my people, and I will ſend thee to the king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to command him to let my people go back to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> from whence they came, and which was promiſed to be given to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to <hi>Jacob. Moſes</hi> was the meekeſt man in the world. He was ſtruck with rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and awe. He fell upon the ground,

and ſaid, he feared <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would not mind what ſuch a man as he ſhould ſay; but God anſwered, that he would make <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to mind him, and that <hi>Moſes'</hi>s brother <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould meet him on the way, and go with him.</p>
               <p>After this, God bade <hi>Moſes</hi> throw his ſtick or wand upon the ground, and when he had done ſo, it became a ſerpent. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> was ſo ſtartled at this that he ran away, but God called him back, and deſired him not to be afraid, but to take hold of the ſerpent by the tail; he did ſo, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately it became a wand again.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>MOSES</hi> then, in obedience to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, went into <hi>Egypt</hi> with <hi>Aaron</hi> his brother, and when they ſaw <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> they told him, that God had ſent them to deſire he would let the <hi>Hebrews</hi> go. But the king was ſo wicked, as not to mind what they ſaid; for he did not know that there is but one God, who is the Maker of heaven and earth, and who is all-powerful: and therefore God, to puniſh him, as alſo to teach him this great truth, turned all their waters into blood, and all the fiſh died. This ſoon humbled <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and he begged of <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray to God to cure the waters. <hi>Moſes</hi> did pray, and they were cured, and yet he would not let the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. Then God ſent a great quantity of frogs to torment him. They over-ran all the country, and hopped about in the very rooms where the king lived. Then he begged of <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray to God to deliver him from them, and he promiſed to let
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:028888_0050_0FDE586289E25D70"/>
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> go. Immediately <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed, and God was pleaſed to ſend them away; but when they were gone, the king ſtill refuſed to keep his promiſe. As God Almighty can never be at a loſs how to puniſh perverſe and obſtinate people, he ſent ſuch a number of lice, that the very duſt ſeemed to be all turned into lice, which crawled about them, and gave them no reſt. Then the king applied again to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they were ſent away, but ſtill his heart was hardened. Afterwards God ſent ſuch ſwarms of flies, they looked at a diſtance like black clouds, and buzzed about them ſo intolerably, they were not able to bear it. Upon which the king again deſired <hi>Moſes</hi> to pray for him; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did, and immediately the flies were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But ſtill <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s heart was hardened, and he would not let the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. So then God ſent a ſickneſs among the cattle, that they almoſt all died: and when that would not do, he ſent ſuch ſickneſs among the people, that they were all covered with ſores and biles, and ulcers. After that he ſent ſtorms of hail which killed all thoſe it fell upon, beat down the roofs of the houſes, and deſtroyed all the buildings; yet ſtill <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s heart was hardened, and he would not let the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:028888_0051_0FDE5914635CE310"/>
So then God ſent a ſtrong wind, that brought with it a number of locuſts, which eat up all the fruits of the earth, and every thing that grows for the uſe of man and beaſt. But ſtill <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was only frighted for the time. God then ſent darkneſs all over that part of the land where the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had light at the ſame time; yet as ſoon as the plague was gone, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> forgot the goodneſs of God in giving him relief; and alſo forgot the power of God to ſend a worſe plague, if he provoked him. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people are always fooliſh. If he had had any ſenſe at all, he would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that what God had done once he could do again, or a great deal worſe, if he pleaſed, and that there is no eſcaping him. At laſt, however, God Almighty obliged <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſubmit to him. He ſent an angel through the land, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to kill the firſt-born, that is, the eldeſt child in every family; except among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> where none of the firſt-born died. And God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to inſtitute (that is, to appoint) a faſt, which was to be obſerved by the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> every year, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this event, and which was to be called the paſſover; becauſe when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſlew the firſt-born of the children of
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:028888_0052_0FDE5862CA858310"/>
the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were paſſed over, <hi>i. e.</hi> were preſerved alive When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had loſt his own firſt-born, he found God was not to be reſiſted, and ſo at laſt he let the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. And the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ſo glad of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the plagues God had ſent upon their account, that they let them have a great deal of gold and ſilver, and ſeveral ear-rings and bracelets to carry away. So they went away very rich; and as they travelled along, God went before them by day in a cloud, and by night in a pillar of fire. At laſt they came to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> but before they got there, <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy had got the better of his fears, and he repented that he had let them go. So he called together his army, and followed them. Then the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw nothing but the <hi>Red Sea</hi> before them, and the wicked king and his army behind them. They were ſo terrified, they were ready to die with fear, for they forgot that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was their friend. <hi>Moſes</hi> prayed to God, and he immediately bade him ſtrike the ſea with his wand. When he had done ſo, the waters divided on both ſides, and there was a path between for them to walk through. After they had paſſed over to the other ſide, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thought to follow them the ſame way with his army, but the

               <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſaw this they praiſed God, and <hi>Moſes</hi> made a pſalm of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, which they all ſung, and they danced and were very joyful.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here it will be proper to teach them that ſong, explaining all the words in it.</note>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do we learn from theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> From the firſt and ſecond command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we learn that there is but one God, that he only is to be worſhipped, and that idolatry, which is adoring any other being, or worſhipping any image, or the likeneſs of any thing; is a very great ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were there ever any people guilty of idolatry, or worſhipping images?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bowed down to idols, for which they were ſeverely puniſhed; and ſo did moſt of the nations near them; for which, and for other wicked things that they did, many of them were deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why are we to worſhip God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe he has all power, wiſdom, and goodneſs; and becauſe he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us all that we poſſeſs that makes us happy in our preſent life; he made the ſun, which gives us light and heat; he ſends rain upon the earth, that it may bring forth corn and plants to feed us, and graſs for cattle: he has likewiſe bleſſed us with an underſtanding, that we
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:028888_0057_0FDE592420293B08"/>
may learn the proper uſe of every thing which he has given us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If God be ſo good, how can he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The wicked certainly deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But he generally puniſhes them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they may repent and become good, or that their example may prevent others from being wicked. The Jews, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God had been ſo good to them, grew forgetful of him, and worſhipped idols, and committed ſins, for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they were carried away by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and are now ſcattered abroad in every part of the world, and generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and ill-treated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What further do we learn from the firſt and ſecond commandments?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We ſhould learn to love God above all things, and always to obey his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. For if we prefer our own inclinations, or any thing in the world, to our duty to God, we ſhall be ſerving and pleaſing ourſelves, inſtead of ſerving and pleaſing him; and this is a kind of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By what means ſhall we learn to ſerve God only?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We muſt never neglect ſaying our prayers, attending his worſhip, or any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duty, for the ſake of our friends,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:028888_0058_0FDE587C7B0A6140"/>
our buſineſs, or our pleaſure; and at all times give up every advantage, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer any wiſh, that is contrary to his will, and to what we believe to be right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the third commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of taking the name of the Lord in vain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To mention the name of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reverence (that is, great reſpect) or upon any other than a ſerious occaſion, is certainly taking his name in vain; but to call upon it to witneſs a falſehood, or in profane curſing or ſwearing, is ſtill more wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it then unlawful to ſwear?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Profane ſwearing is certainly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by this commandment; and beſides, we are told by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> not to ſwear at all, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carefully to ſpeak truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How ſhall we learn to avoid this ſin, which ſo many people are committing every day?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By never keeping company with thoſe who are in the wicked practice of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this commandment—We ſhould alſo avoid reading plays, or ballads, or ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:028888_0059_0FDE59289EAD93A0"/>
or any other books, where the name of God is frequently mentioned without proper reſpect; for it is not enough that we guard againſt ſpeaking lightly of God, we muſt learn too never to <hi>think</hi> of him, but with awe and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any other rule for us to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, in order that we may keep this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is abſolutely neceſſary that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways perform our religious duties with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs and attention; never thinking of our worldly buſineſs, or our amuſements, when we hear or read good books, or whilſt we are offering up our prayers: for if we read of God with indifference, or ſpeak to him in prayer, without earneſtly wiſhing that he ſhould hear, and attend to our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; then we ſhall prove diſobedient to him, by breaking this commandment; and let us remember, that God will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fourth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Remember the ſabbath-day to keep it holy. Six days ſhalt thou labor and do all thy work, but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou ſhalt not do any work, thou, nor thy ſon, nor thy daughter, thy man ſervant, nor thy maid ſervant, nor thy cattle, nor the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:028888_0060_0FDE58839C214370"/>
ſtranger that is within thy gates. For the Lord bleſſed the ſabbath day, and hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What muſt we do in order to keep the ſabbath-day holy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We muſt ſpend it in the moſt uſeful and ſerious manner; thinking upon good things, reading the holy ſcriptures and good books, and praying to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Ought we not to be good every other day in the week, as well as on a Sunday?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We ſhould always remember God, and keep his commandments. Every morning we ſhould pray to him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to be as good as we can during the day; and every night repent of any thing that we may have done that is wrong, and determine with the aſſiſtance of God to do ſo no more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How then are we to keep the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath more holy than other days?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> On other days the cares of life, and our proper buſineſs, take up much of our time, and therefore we have leſs time for reading and thinking. For this reaſon we ſhould not conſider the ſabbath as a day of amuſement and reſt, but as a day appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for going to worſhip, to read good books, to think of God, and of another world after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="unknown:028888_0061_0FDE592EA0ECF868"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But we ſee that many perſons do not regularly go to worſhip, but amuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on a Sunday. Do theſe all do wrong?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is certainly a great crime not to keep the ſabbath holy, and we may ſuppoſe that thoſe who do not remember their duty to God, to whom they owe their life, and every comfort, we may naturally ſuppoſe that ſuch in time ſhould be guilty of many ſins. Indeed we find that moſt of the unhappy men who are condemned to death for their wickedneſs, have generally begun by breaking the ſabbath, and keeping bad company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is worſhipping God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To worſhip God, is to reverence him as our Sovereign and Creator, to love him as our conſtant and kindeſt friend, and to thank him in the moſt grateful manner, for the favors which he is continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing, and earneſtly to deſire that he would teach us how to deſerve them, to lament our ſins, to reſolve with his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſin no more, and to be reſigned to his holy will. Theſe diſpoſitions ſincerely felt, and humbly offered up to heaven, is that worſhip which is acceptable to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But may we not ſerve God in this manner at home?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="unknown:028888_0062_0FDE588D235C75B0"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is very poſſible we may, and it is to be hoped that we frequently do; but we ſhould remember, that at home a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand things may break in upon us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the diſcharge of this duty; it is therefore very right, that a day ſhould be ſet apart for it, and by attending a place of public worſhip on that day, we are ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a good example to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But are we ſure that our example will be followed;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We know that men in general are much led by example, but if our example ſhould not be followed, at leaſt we are doing our duty; let us therefore always attend our different places of worſhip, ſince it will afford us the beſt opportunity of thanking God, and learning how to obey him, and in order that we may fulfil this commandment of keeping the ſabbath-day holy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the fifth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Honor thy father and mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How muſt we behave to our parents, in order to honor them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We muſt treat them upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion with the greateſt reſpect and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, attend to their advice, receive with patience their reproofs, and obey them in every thing, which is not wrong, becauſe God has placed them over us, that we may
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:028888_0063_0FDE59340D396428"/>
improve by their good advice, and good example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How muſt thoſe behave, whoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are cruel and unkind?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They muſt ſtill endeavour to ſerve, and to obey them, and return their ill uſage with gentleneſs and good humour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If our parents ſhould be wicked, and ſet us a bad example?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That indeed would be a great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; yet perhaps by ſeeing the vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and miſery, which they ſuffer from their idleneſs, drunkenneſs, or their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty; we may learn the neceſſity of becoming induſtrious, ſober, and juſt; we ſhould be ſtill more watchful over our own conduct, ſteadily refuſing to obey, even our parents, whenever they would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us to do wrong.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Will not this offend God, who has commanded us to honor our parents?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> When God commanded us to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor our parents, he likewiſe required that our parents ſhould teach us how to be good, and to obey him. To ſubmit then to the advice of a good parent, is to obey God; but to refuſe to follow the example of bad parents, or their advice, when they adviſe any thing wrong, that is to honor God, who is the father of us all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:028888_0064_0FDE5894B13DD5C0"/>
Beſides, by doing right in ſuch caſes, we ſet a good example to our parents, we reſpect their happineſs, which is honoring them in the beſt ſenſe of the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ſixth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not kill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Will God puniſh thoſe who deſtroy the life of another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Undoubtedly he will. It is one of the greateſt crimes we can commit, in the ſight both of God and of men. In this world it is puniſhed with death, for it is one of thoſe injuries we never can repair, and what God (as we ſee in the example of <hi>Cain</hi>) puniſhed even in this life, in a very exemplary manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May we not kill ourſelves when we become tired of living?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No. That is almoſt, perhaps quite as great a ſin. God, who gave us life, ought only to put an end to it. He gave it us for wiſe and good purpoſes, that we might conquer every wrong diſpoſition, and acquire every diſpoſition and principle that is good, ſo as to make ourſelves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to enjoy eternal happineſs in the life to come. Therefore by putting an end to our lives whilſt we are in an unprepared ſtate, we may deprive ourſelves for ever
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:028888_0065_0FDE59381DB48DA0"/>
of that happineſs which our future good conduct might have procured us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By killing another, may we not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger his future happineſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By taking away the life of another, we do not know what injury we may have done him in this reſpect. It is certain that we unjuſtly deprive his relations and friends of the comforts he might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them, and by ſuch a crime we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit our own lives, at a time when, inſtead of being prepared, we have deſerved the ſevereſt diſpleaſure of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ſeventh commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not commit adultery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is not neceſſary to ſay much upon this ſubject at preſent. It may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to obſerve, that it is a ſin in which perhaps the happineſs of an innocent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and the character of one who ought to be an example of virtue, is wantonly deſtroyed. It is a ſin, the conſequences of which are highly diſgraceful and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous among men, and it will be right to impreſs our minds with a perſuaſion, that it is ſo wicked in the ſight of God, that thoſe who are in the practice of it, cannot be admitted into the kingdom of heaven, as we are aſſured in the holy ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:028888_0066_0FDE5899336FFBE8"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the eighth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</p>
               <p>As this is a crime to which too many are liable, you will do well to be very much upon your guard againſt it. A thief, you know, is always deſpiſed; he brings diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor on his family, and infamy upon himſelf: he is liable to be confined in a jail, and to periſh in a ſhameful manner at the gallows. This is the puniſhment to which he is expoſed in this world; and as it is a crime ſo ſtrictly forbidden by God, we may be ſure it will not go unpuniſhed in the world to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What are the beſt methods we can obſerve in order to be kept from this vice?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Men are often led to ſteal from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or want; and as idleneſs and ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering are the common cauſes of want, we ſhould endeavour, whilſt we are young, to get habits both of induſtry and of ſaving. For it is not always thoſe who can get the moſt, unleſs they are careful to ſave, and prudent in making a proper uſe of what they get, that are the moſt comfortable. When parents who can get money ſpend it in alehouſes, and are drunken, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in conſequence idle, we ſee their children, and themſelves dirty and ragged, and frequently guilty of thieving.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:028888_0067_0FDE593D5AE54100"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is there any thing elſe that we can obſerve the better to keep us from this ſin?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If you are ſober, induſtrious, and ſaving, you will have no temptation to ſteal: if you are ſerious and mindful of your duty to God, and conſider that your happineſs in a future life depends very much on your keeping his commandments here, you will be ſhocked at the idea of every thing that is diſhoneſt; and you will not take any thing, however trifling, leſt you get a habit of ſtealing. For the worſt and wickedeſt of thieves moſt likely began with ſtealing things of little value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the ninth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs againſt thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>All kind of falſehood whatever is highly diſpleaſing to God, who is the God of truth:—and a liar is a character which all mankind abhor. Indeed it is eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that if the practice of lying was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt men, they could put no truſt in one another, and conſequently could not live together. The good would not know what poor to relieve, if they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How do we know that lying is ſo diſpleaſing to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God has ſtrictly forbidden it, and as ſoon as you can read the new Teſtament,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:028888_0068_0FDE589F39E47AF8"/>
you may find there a very remarkable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a man and his wife, called <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> who were both ſtruck dead for telling a falſehood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray what is the meaning of bearing falſe witneſs againſt our neighbour?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is the worſt kind of lying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not only is a ſin againſt God and truth, but it is a ſin againſt our neighbour, whom we ought to love. If we bear falſe witneſs againſt our neighbour in any courts of law, this is called perjury, and is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by cutting off the ears, and expoſing the guilty perſon in a pillory. But if we raiſe a falſe or ſcandalous report, or tell ſtories of a neighbour, this is called a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and is a very mean and wicked action, and will make us hated and deſpiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the tenth commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbour's houſe, thou ſhalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his man ſervant, nor his maid ſervant, nor his ox, nor his aſs, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of coveting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To covet is to wiſh for that which we have not, and which we have no right to; to covet our neighbour's houſe is diſhoneſt, and this covetous diſpoſition, if given way to, will lead us in time to cheat, and to tell lies, and to ſteal. To covet our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:028888_0069_0FDE5941E9132AD0"/>
wife is a kind of adultery; and to indulge a covetous temper is to lay the foundation of almoſt every ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How ſhall we prevent ourſelves from breaking this commandment?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By never giving way to bad thoughts, but to check them in the very beginning, becauſe bad thoughts give riſe to bad wiſhes and inclinations and to covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and bad inclinations, and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, give riſe to bad conduct, and to ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, adultery, telling lies, and to bearing falſe witneſs. So if we would be good, we muſt ſhun the very firſt appearance of evil. For God, as we may read in the New Teſtament, is diſpleaſed both with bad thoughts, as well as with bad actions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If we never give way to bad thoughts, ſhall we never be guilty of bad actions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is the ſureſt way of guarding againſt them, and the eaſieſt way to be good; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe bad thoughts always go before bad wiſhes and bad actions; and bad thoughts are more eaſily avoided, than bad habits are conquered.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the ten commandments, which are frequently read in places of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and which we muſt all learn, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, becauſe they were given by God himſelf, and they teach us our duty to him and to mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:028888_0070_0FDE58A51B4BEA40"/>
By the firſt, ſecond, third, and fourth, we learn, that there is no God but one, and that we ſhould fear to offend, and love him above all things, and worſhip him, becauſe he made us, and can deſtroy us in a moment. We learn by the fifth to be dutiful to our parents, and thoſe that are ſet over us in their ſtead: and by the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth, we are taught neither to murder, ſteal, or do any manner of wrong; nor to ſpeak ill of any body, or ever to covet; that is, to wiſh for any thing that belongs to another. Becauſe as God knows our thoughts, he will puniſh wicked thoughts, as well as wicked doings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> was forty days and forty nights at the top of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> learning all theſe, and many more good things from God. But, in the mean time, the ungrateful <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> grew tired of waiting for him.</p>
               <p>In their impatience they ſuppoſed that he never would come back, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>Aaron,</hi> the brother of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make an idol for them, that they might worſhip, that is, that they might pray to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aaron</hi> was grieved to hear them talk ſo wickedly, and ſimply, but was ſo weak as to fear that they would kill him, if he refuſed them. Therefore he took the gold and ſilver which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> had given
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:028888_0071_0FDE59479FF98430"/>
them; he melted it over the fire, and made an image of it in the ſhape of a calf; and a great many of them worſhipped it, like their neighbours the heathens, and like the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> While they were ſo doing, <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and when he ſaw what they were about, he was ſo provoked, that the tables fell out of his hand, and were broken to pieces. And God was ſo offended at their wickedneſs, as to command that the moſt notorious of thoſe who were guilty of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, that is, of worſhipping the idol or image, ſhould be ſlain. There were twelve thouſand killed that day, and he made thoſe who were left wander about forty years in that place, which was called the Deſert or Wilderneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">Here it will not be amiſs to teach them the 95<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pſalm.</note> before they were permitted to go into the promiſed land, as a puniſhment for their ſtubbornneſs. Almighty God alſo thought fit to puniſh ſeveral other bad things, that ſome of them were guilty of.</p>
               <p>Before this time, he had been pleaſed to command a ſort of table to be built with ſtones ſet over one another. This table was called an altar, and upon that altar he bid them lay a lamb, or a dove,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:028888_0072_0FDE58AAEB25C2D8"/>
or ſome other thing; and whatever was laid upon the altar with wood under it, was called the Sacrifice, becauſe it was ſacrificed; that is, offered to God, as an acknowledgment that all we have comes from him, and that our beſt ſervices are due to him. And when God was pleaſed with thoſe who offered it, he ſent down fire from heaven to burn or conſume the ſacrifice, as a token that he accepted of it, and he forbade that any common fire ſhould ever be put to it. But one day two very bold young men, <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> had the aſſurance to diſobey, and to put common fire upon the altar to burn the ſacrifice; but God ſoon puniſhed their preſumption by ſending fire from heaven, which burnt them up, and nobody could ſave them.</p>
               <p>Another time there was a man who was ſo wicked and preſumptuous as to ſpeak againſt God, his Maker; and this great ſin is called blaſphemy. And God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty commanded, that every one ſhould throw ſtones upon the blaſphemer till he was cruſhed to death, and it was done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Even <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was ſo good a man, forgot himſelf one day: he was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the people's obſtinacy, as to be in a violent paſſion, and offended his
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:028888_0073_0FDE594CDC3E7030"/>
Maker, who to puniſh him, ſaid, he ſhould not live till they went to the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> but bid him go to the top of a high mountain, and look at it. When he came down again, he was very ſorry for his fault; and God pardoned him, and took care of him when he died.<note n="*" place="bottom">Here I would adviſe teaching the 105th and 106th pſalms.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You ſaid that <hi>Moſes</hi> learned many other good things from God beſides the ten commandments. Pray what were they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Amongſt other laws and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which <hi>Moſes</hi> received from God, are the following:</p>
               <p>He that curſeth his father or mother, ſhall ſurely be put to death.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt neither vex a ſtranger, nor oppreſs him, for ye were ſtrangers in the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ye ſhall not afflict any widow or father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs child: if thou afflict them any wiſe, and they cry at all unto me, I will ſurely hear their cry.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe report.</p>
               <p>Put not thy hand with the wicked, to be an unrighteous witneſs.</p>
               <p>Keep thee far from a falſe matter, for I will not juſtify the wicked.</p>

                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:028888_0074_0FDE58B79C59EF40"/>
Thou ſhalt take no gift, for the gift blindeth the wiſe, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p>
               <p>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor, nor honor the perſon of the mighty, but in righteouſneſs ſhalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not countenance a poor man in his cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not wreſt the judgment of thy poor in his cauſe (meaning that you muſt always judge juſtly, not favoring the poor, or the rich, but that you ſhould do what is right, without partiality.)</p>
               <p>Ye ſhall do no unrighteouſneſs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in mete yard, in weight, or in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>Ye ſhall not ſteal, neither deal falſely, neither lie one to another.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him.</p>
               <p>The wages of him that is hired ſhall not abide with thee.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not curſe the deaf, nor put a ſtumbling-block before the blind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:028888_0075_0FDE5951D9375A50"/>
Thou ſhalt riſe up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear thy God.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer.</p>
               <p>He that killeth any man, ſhall ſurely be put to death.</p>
               <p>And he that killeth a beaſt, ſhall make it good, beaſt for beaſt.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart.</p>
               <p>Thou ſhalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge againſt the children of my people, but thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>If thou meet thine enemy's ox, or his aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again.</p>
               <p>If thou ſee the aſs of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldeſt forbear to help him, thou ſhalt ſurely help with him.</p>
               <p>(From this we learn, that we ſhould do good to all, even to our enemies—and that we ſhould be merciful and kind to poor animals.)</p>
               <p>When ye reap the harveſt of your land, thou ſhalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither ſhalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harveſt, thou ſhalt leave them for the poor and ſtrangers.</p>

Ye ſhall keep my ſabbath, and rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence my ſanctuary.</p>

               <p>And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen into decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him, though he be a ſtranger or ſojourner.</p>
               <p>Take no uſury of him; thou ſhalt not rule over him with rigor, but ſhalt fear thy God.</p>
               <p>God gave ſeveral other laws to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and promiſed them his favor if they were obedient, and threatened them with very ſevere puniſhment, if they were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>God ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi> by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ye walk in my ſtatutes, and keep my commandments, to do them, then I will give you rain in due ſeaſon, and the land ſhall yield her increaſe, and the trees of the field ſhall yield their fruit, and your threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage ſhall reach unto the ſowing time, and ye ſhall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land ſafely. And I will give peace in the land, and ye ſhall lie down, and none ſhall make you afraid, and I will walk among you and be your God, and ye ſhall be my people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:028888_0077_0FDE59565FE02800"/>
But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all theſe commandments, I will appoint over you terror, and conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the burning ague. And ye ſhall ſow your ſeed in vain, for your enemies ſhall eat it. And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, then I will puniſh you ſeven times more for your ſins. And your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vain; for the land ſhall not yield her increaſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the trees of the land yield their fruits.</p>
               <p>I will bring a ſword upon you, I will ſend the peſtilence among you, and ye ſhall be delivered into the hand of your enemies, and ye ſhall eat the fleſh of your ſons, and the fleſh of your daughters ſhall you eat; and I will make your cities waſte, and I will bring the land into deſolation, and your enemies which dwell therein ſhall be aſtoniſhed at it. And I will ſcatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a ſword after you; and your land ſhall be deſolate, and your cities waſte. And ye ſhall periſh among the heathen, and the land of your enemies ſhall eat you up. And they that are left of you ſhall pine away in their iniquity in your enemy's land.</p>
               <p>Now all theſe threatenings which were denounced more than three thouſand years
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:028888_0078_0FDE58CB6A356798"/>
ago, have been wonderfully fulfilled. The <hi>Jews,</hi> though they were ſo highly favored of God, proved diſobedient and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and they have been driven out of the promiſed land by their enemies. Their diſtreſs, when they have been beſieged, has been ſo great, that parents have eaten their children. Their temple was utterly deſtroyed. Their land is now poſſeſſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and they are ſcattered and deſpiſed over the face of the earth. There never was any example of this kind of any other nation whatever.</p>
               <p>Afterwards we read in the book of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus,</hi> that when they be in the land of their enemies, that God will not caſt them away, neither will he deſtroy them utterly, but if they ſhall confeſs their iniquity, and their hearts ſhall be humbled, he will ſtill remember his covenants with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the greateſt affront that can be offered to God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is to worſhip or pray to any but himſelf; to any creature; to the ſun, moon, or ſtars; or to any thing that is made with hands, as God expreſsly ſays in the ſecond commandment; and praying to any thing but God is called idolatry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were the <hi>Egyptians</hi> idolaters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> were great idolaters, and therefore the miracles and wonders
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:028888_0079_0FDE595D5D11AE50"/>
which God enabled <hi>Moſes</hi> to perform, might be in mercy deſigned not only to deliver the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo to cure the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their idolatry. The pride and obſtinacy of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for theſe miracles, and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he was judged a proper perſon to be their king by Almighty God, who ſays, "for this purpoſe have I raiſed him up."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is meant, when it is ſaid, that God hardened the heart of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Did God make him wicked?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: for Almighty God has no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of a ſinner, but would rather that he ſhould repent and live. It was therefore <hi>Pharaoh'</hi>s own pride and obſtinacy that was the cauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. In other places, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſaid to have hardened his own heart: it was not therefore by any extraordinary influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God upon his mind that his heart was hardened, nor could Almighty God be ſaid to have done it, in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than as he may be ſaid to be the doer of every thing which he does not prevent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the greateſt happineſs any one can attain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The greateſt happineſs any one can attain, is to know the one living and true God; that is, to have true apprehenſions of his infinite holineſs, mercy, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:028888_0080_0FDE58D2D1D5A4B0"/>
from which we may learn what we muſt do, and what ſort of perſons we muſt become in order to obtain his favor. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> in common with other hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, were great idolaters; they were miſerably ignorant of the great God, and worſhipped various different animals: to bring them therefore to the knowledge of himſelf, by whatever means, was really the greateſt favor that could be beſtowed upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray how do we know all theſe things?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> God Almighty in his great goodneſs was pleaſed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould write them all down, and leave it for us who came after, that we might know his will and his greatneſs.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the hiſtory of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> the flood, the confuſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the hiſtory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> All theſe he wrote in one book, called the book of <hi>Geneſis. Moſes</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wrote the account of his own birth, of the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſing the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the wilderneſs forty years, of all that befel them there, and all that God directed them to do. Theſe matters are
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:028888_0081_0FDE59629AF40E10"/>
in four other books, called <hi>Exodus, Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus, Numbers,</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which with <hi>Geneſis,</hi> are ſometimes called the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch, i. e.</hi> five books.</p>
               <p>God directed thoſe that came in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s place, after his death, to write what had happened in their time. So we have all the hiſtory of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> almoſt till the coming of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. We have alſo an account of Chriſt's life and death. All this is together in one great book, called the Holy Bible, becauſe it contains the word of God. And the word of God is called revelation, becauſe God has revealed, that is, told it to us. Some part of the Bible is always read in public worſhip. It is the wiſeſt and the beſt book in the whole world. Other books are written out of men's own heads, or out of what they pick up from others, but the Bible was written by good men, to whom God revealed his will; and it teaches all that is neceſſary for us to know, and be, and do, in order to our paſſing comfortably through this world, and being happy for ever in the next.</p>
               <p>When you can read it, and are old enough to underſtand it, you will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to read it all yourſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is virtue? or what is it to be virtuous?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:028888_0082_0FDE58DBB031AD50"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is when we are either tempted or perſuaded to do what we know to be wrong, to reſolve againſt it, and not to yield to any body or any thing, though we like it ever ſo much, if we know it will offend God. When we are tempted, we muſt ſtrive hard with ourſelves, and pray to God to help us, like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and all other good men, and then it will not be in the power of bad or fooliſh people to ſpoil us; that is, to make us do ill.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE HISTORY OF JOSHUA.</head>
               <p>AFTER the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it pleaſed God that <hi>Joſhua,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nun,</hi> ſhould ſucceed him; that is, ſtand in his place, to ſhew the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the way into the promiſed land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt their enemies, and teach them their duty to their Maker. He was to inſtruct them in every thing that was fit for them to do, and tell them what they ought not to do. He that governed the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in thoſe days was called their judge.</p>

                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:028888_0083_0FDE596A289BD7F0"/>
When therefore <hi>Joſhua</hi> became judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he drew near the firſt city in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> called <hi>Jericho,</hi> and ſent privately into the city to get an account of the place and of the people in it. They who are employed in this manner are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpies; and when a ſpy belonging to the enemy is found in any place, he is always put to death. Theſe ſpies were very near being caught in <hi>Jericho;</hi> but a woman called <hi>Rahab,</hi> who lived near the gate of the city, took compaſſion on them. She hid them in her houſe till it was night, and then let them out of a window by faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tening cords to it. Before they went away, ſhe made them promiſe, that in return, for having ſaved their lives, ſhe and her family ſhould be ſpared when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> got poſſeſſion of the city.</p>
               <p>After this God commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to march with all the people to the river of <hi>Jordan,</hi> which ran between them and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo.</hi> He then ordered, that the ſons of <hi>Levi,</hi> called <hi>Levites,</hi> ſhould carry the ark, and walk before the reſt into the river, and ſtand in the middle of it, with the ark. When they drew near, behold! to the great amazement of all the people, the waters divided as at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and they paſſed over without ſo much as wetting their feet. Afterwards the people paſſed over alſo,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:028888_0084_0FDE58E1DDE15E48"/>
and then the waters immediately returned to their old place.</p>
               <p>The next wonder that God performed for the ſake of his people, was at the town of <hi>Jericho.</hi> He commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to lead them round the town ſeven days together, blowing a trumpet every time, and on the ſeventh day the walls of the city tumbled down. By this means the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in without any difficulty, and were maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the place. The people to whom it belonged having oppoſed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and being ſuch wicked idolaters, God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to kill them all, except <hi>Rahab</hi> and her family, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the promiſe the ſpies had made her. So they took great care of her, and all that belonged to her, for what good man ever forgets thoſe that have been good to him? All the kings of that neighbourhood, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their ſucceſs, came out at different times and fought againſt them. Whenever the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> acted wickedly, God ſuffered their enemies to beat them; and from the ſtory of one of them called <hi>Acham,</hi> which is mentioned in the ſcriptures, one may learn that nothing is hid from the all-ſeeing eye of God. But whenever they repented and behaved well, his anger was appeaſed, and then they again became ſtronger than their enemies, and the victory was on their ſide.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:028888_0085_0FDE5971F686D4F0"/>
                  <hi>Joſhua</hi> having thus conquered almoſt all the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> divided it into twelve parts, according to the twelve tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He made eleven of the tribes draw lots for their ſhares, that there might be no diſputes among them. As for the tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> they did not draw, becauſe God had provided for them in another way; for he thought proper they ſhould be his miniſters, and always attend on his immediate ſervice; that is, employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely in explaining the ſcriptures, praying and doing ſacrifice at the altar. And as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the beloved ſon of <hi>Jacob,</hi> had two ſons, <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> of theſe were formed two tribes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were the inhabitants of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be blamed for oppoſing the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who came to take their country from them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They were certainly not to be blamed for endeavouring to repel invaders, if they did not know that what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did in this reſpect was by the expreſs command of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Although they did oppoſe them, and were ſuch wicked idolaters, why did God order the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to deſtroy them?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:028888_0086_0FDE58E8913E4A98"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> We do not always know the reaſons of God's diſpenſations, but we may be ſure that they are ever founded in mercy as well as juſtice. You remember that the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> had been promiſed to <hi>Abraham</hi> above four hundred years before, and that this promiſe was very often afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; but it was not to be fulfilled till <q>the iniquity of the old inhabitants was full;</q> that is, till they were become ſo wicked that they were not fit to live; and Almighty God had ſurely a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in whatever way he ſaw beſt; by the hand of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as well as by an earthquake or famine. Moreover, this ſignal deſtruction of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> of which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> themſelves were made the inſtruments, would be an awful warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, to avoid thoſe ſins which had brought the divine judgments on that people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What was the ark which the <hi>Levites</hi> carried before the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> over the river <hi>Jordan?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It was ſomething like a cheſt, in which God commanded the two tables of the law to be carefully kept; and this ark he committed to the care of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and did not ſuffer it to be produced, but upon extraordinary occaſions.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE BOOK OF JUDGES.</head>
               <p>AFTER all theſe things, <hi>Joſhua</hi> died in a good old age; and he had been ſo worthy a man, that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned for him many days. They remained ſome time without any judge, and being like a flock of ſheep without a ſhepherd, very often went aſtray. Inſtead of obeying the laws of God, which they had been ſo often taught, and which were ſufficient to guide them, they choſe to follow the inclinations of their own hearts, which were diſpoſed to evil. Bad people cannot live long in peace and quiet with one another, for they always want more than they have a right to, and do not ſcruple injuring others. Unjuſt actions muſt always produce quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, for nobody will let another oppreſs him, if he can help it.</p>
               <p>The people of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> did a moſt barbarous wicked thing by one of the <hi>Levites,</hi> for which all the other tribes reſolved to puniſh them. The reſt of the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> inſtead of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their wicked relations, took their part. This brought on a civil war, in
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:028888_0088_0FDE58F0F7BA8A60"/>
which the tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> was almoſt all deſtroyed.—A civil war is, when people of the ſame nation go to war with each other.—This was a very bloody one, and when it was over, the other tribes repented hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dealt ſo hardly with their brethren the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> and they all became good friends again.</p>
               <p>They were, however, much oppreſſed by their neighbours the Syrians. They called to God for help, and he appointed <hi>Othniel</hi> to be their judge, who led them on to fight their battles, and ſaved them from their enemies. After his death they fell into idolatry, and then God delivered them into the hands of the <hi>Moabites;</hi> but when they repented, <hi>Ehud</hi> was made judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and overcame their adverſaries; that is, their enemies. The next judge was <hi>Shamgar;</hi> he conquered the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> who had fallen upon them; but when he died, they returned again. Then a wiſe woman, named <hi>Deborah</hi> the Propheteſs, and <hi>Barak,</hi> a valiant, that is, a brave man, both governed <hi>Iſrael</hi> together, and gained a victory over the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> found themſelves delivered from their enemies, they were very joyful; and <hi>Deborah</hi> the Propheteſs made a fine ſong, called a hymn or pſalm of thankſgiving,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:028888_0089_0FDE59822BD19B08"/>
ſuch as are ſung in places of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to praiſe God for his goodneſs to us.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>Deborah,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> fell again into idolatry, and God permitted the <hi>Midianites</hi> to rule and oppreſs them for ſeven years; but when they repented, and called to him for help, he ſent his angel to call <hi>Gideon,</hi> who was threſhing wheat in a barn, and <hi>Gideon,</hi> with God's help, ſoon freed them from their enemies.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Gideon</hi> died, one of his ſons, called <hi>Abimelech,</hi> murdered almoſt all his brothers, intending to be king of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This occaſioned great diſturbances among them, but they were quieted by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely death; for God permitted his life to be taken away by a woman throwing a ſtone at him</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tola</hi> was judge after him, and then <hi>Jair;</hi> in both their times the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> provoked God by their ſins, and he delivered them up to the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> After this the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple became penitent, that is, they repented, and then he gave them <hi>Jephtha</hi> as their judge. He was a great warrior, but one raſh action that he committed, made the remainder of his life unhappy. When he was going out to fight the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> he vowed, if God gave him the victory, he would ſacrifice the firſt thing he met when he returned home. He did conquer the
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:028888_0090_0FDE58F6F5228230"/>
                  <hi>Ammonites,</hi> but his only daughter not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of his vow, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o impatient to ſee her father again, that ſhe met him firſt of all; ſo to his great grief he was obliged to fulfil his vow, in conſecrating her to the Lord to remain unmarried all her days, that being the only way in which he could make good his vow in reſpect of her. When <hi>Jephtha</hi> died, <hi>Ibzan</hi> was judge in his place; after <hi>Ibzan</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Elon,</hi> and after <hi>Elon, Abdon</hi> was judge. When <hi>Abdon</hi> died, the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> oppreſſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> very much, till <hi>Sampſon</hi> was ſent by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to deliver them. It pleaſed God to make <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the ſtrongeſt man in the world. He killed a lion without any help, and deſtroyed many of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> At length he fell into their hands, but not till he had killed a thouſand of them with only the jaw bone of an aſs; and then he carried away upon his back the gates of the city where he was confined, and made his eſcape. But it was not long before they took him again, by the treachery of a wicked woman called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah.</hi> The <hi>Philiſtines</hi> offered her money, if ſhe would find ſome means to deliver him up to them, which ſhe did.</p>
               <p>One day the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> made a great feaſt to their idol god <hi>Dagon,</hi> in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and when they were in the midſt of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:028888_0091_0FDE598CCD28F908"/>
their mirth and jollity, they ſent for <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> to laugh at him and teaſe him. But the time was come, when it pleaſed God to deliver his people from ſuch cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for <hi>Sampſon</hi> finding himſelf in their temple with thoſe bad people, called upon God to help him; then taking hold of the pillars that ſupported the building, and looſening them, the roof fell down and cruſhed them all to death. After this the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were quiet for ſeveral years, and <hi>Eli,</hi> the high-prieſt, became judge of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> There was a young man named <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had been bred up under <hi>Eli</hi> from a child; and <hi>Samuel</hi> was ſo pious and virtuous a youth, that God was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently pleaſed to ſpeak with him, and to reveal to him his will, ſo that he became a great prophet; <hi>Eli</hi> the high-prieſt was good himſelf, but he ſuffered his children to be wicked, and that is a great ſin. His two ſons, <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> behaved very ill; and though he knew it was his duty to puniſh them while they were young, in order to make them better, he gave himſelf no trouble about it; and as they were not contradicted, they grew worſe and worſe. They at laſt brought on their own ruin, as well as their father's, for they were killed in battle by the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> who over-ran all the country; the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:028888_0092_0FDE58FE0C896578"/>
ark alſo was taken; and when old <hi>Eli</hi> heard the news, he fell down with grief, and broke his neck and died. Then was <hi>Samuel</hi> made a judge in his place, who kept the people in very good order, and followed the will of God in all things. However, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> at laſt grew tired of having only judges over them, and had a mind to be governed by a king, as other nations were. God Almighty, who knows all things, knew they would never be ſo happy under a king as under a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, like <hi>Samuel,</hi> who conſulted his will in every thing; but he told them, ſince they had ſo great a deſire for a king, they ſhould have one. Accordingly he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint a young man, called <hi>Saul,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Benjamin.</hi> It is an ancient cuſtom to anoint a king with oil before he is crowned; therefore God commanded it, as a token that <hi>Saul</hi> was the king he had choſen for them. <hi>Samuel,</hi> however, ſtill governed <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a great while longer, becauſe the people knew he was a good man and a great prophet.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is a prophet?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A prophet is one to whom God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the knowledge of ſuch things,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:028888_0093_0FDE5996E8A5F9B0"/>
whether preſent, paſt, or to come, as cannot be learned without his particular aſſiſtance; and to ſpeak or to write ſuch things is called propheſying. <hi>Moſes</hi> was a prophet, for he wrote the hiſtory of the creation; and he forewarned the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> before his death, what would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their diſobeying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God; he alſo foretold to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the xviiith chapter of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> that in future times the Lord God would raiſe up a prophet from among their brethren like unto him, who ſhould ſpeak unto them all that God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him.</p>
               <p>Some ſilly people fancy, that witches and conjurers have the ſame power of foretelling things; or, as they call it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-telling; but witches and conjurers are all cheats and impoſtors, who pretend to know what they do not know, with a deſign to get one's money, and to cheat one; and it is a great ſin, as well as folly, to aſk them queſtions, or liſten to them.</p>
               <p>A true prophet is very unlike theſe cheats; he does not attempt to get our money, but endeavours to make us good; and may be known by the wonderful works which God enables him to do, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and many others. Theſe wonderful works are called miracles, of
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:028888_0094_0FDE59031740CA10"/>
which our Saviour and his Apoſtles work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great many, as you will read in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is a vow?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> A vow is a ſolemn and religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to God; and as all promiſes muſt be faithfully obſerved, that is, kept, ſo muſt thoſe which we make to God in a particular manner. All that God does for us is of his own free goodneſs, for we can give him nothing, becauſe every thing is his own, and he can take it when he pleaſes; and he deſires nothing of us but that we worſhip him devoutly, and obey his laws, as he has told us in many parts of the ſcripture. It is better, therefore, to avoid theſe vows, which are frequently made in diſtreſs, and to be reſigned to God without doing any thing like making a bargain with him.</p>
               <p>We ſhould be very cautious, even about making a promiſe, or taking an oath to one another; for when once the words are gone out of our lips, if they are not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that is, contrary to God's law, we muſt perform them. For nothing is ſo baſe as not keeping one's promiſe; and nobody will be regarded after having broken it. But it is ſtill worſe than that, to take a falſe oath; that is, to ſwear a thing to be true which we know to be
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:028888_0095_0FDE59A0EF8E8B98"/>
otherwiſe; or to ſwear a thing to be falſe, which we know to be true. Either of theſe kinds of falſe oaths is called perjury, which is a moſt horrible ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is a high-prieſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The high-prieſt of the <hi>Jews</hi> was the chief of the prieſts, whoſe office or place it was, like them, to offer ſacrifices and to burn incenſe, and to do other ſervices in the temple. It was his peculiar duty to go into the innermoſt part of the temple once every year, on the day of atonement, as it was called, to perform there the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, that is, the particular ſervices of that day. He was appointed alſo to over-look all the temple worſhip, and to judge among the prieſts and the people in many matters, both civil and religious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Where do we find the hiſtory of the Judges of <hi>Iſrael?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You will find it all in that part of the ſcripture called the Book of <hi>Judges.</hi> There were fifteen of them after the death of <hi>Joſhua; Othniel, Ehud, Shamgar, Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Barak, Gideon, Abimelech, Tola, Jair, Jephtha, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, Sampſon, Eli,</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>DAVID</hi> was great grandſon to <hi>Ruth,</hi> of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> who was a very good woman, and had been remarkable for her dutiful behaviour to her mother-in-law. Her ſtory is in the Holy Bible, and is called, <hi>The Book of</hi> RUTH. Her ſon <hi>Obed</hi> was the father of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and <hi>Jeſſe</hi> was the father of <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After <hi>David</hi> had been anointed king by the command of God, he continued with his family, waiting till God thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that he ſhould reign over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the place of <hi>Saul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after, <hi>Saul</hi> being diſturbed in mind, and very miſerable, becauſe he knew he had offended God, deſired his ſervants to ſend ſomebody who could play well upon the harp, to amuſe his grief. <hi>David</hi> could play very well, ſo he was ſent for. His muſic was ſo fine, that the king was much pleaſed: he liſtened to him with delight, and yet the moment <hi>David</hi> ceaſed (that is, left off) playing, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper of <hi>Saul</hi>'s mind returned.—There
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:028888_0098_0FDE590EE04F8BA0"/>
is no cure for a guilty conſcience, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling one's ſelf to God by hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of life.—So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> went back to his father.</p>
               <p>Soon after the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> made war upon the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and ſent <hi>Goliath,</hi> a giant, to challenge any one of them. A giant is a man much taller and ſtronger than other men: and <hi>Goliath</hi> was ſo great a giant, that not one of <hi>Saul</hi>'s ſoldiers durſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, that is, fight with him, though <hi>Saul</hi> promiſed his daughter in marriage to the man that ſhould kill him. He came out for ſeveral days together, during them to battle; but they were all terrified at the ſight of him. At laſt young <hi>David</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be ſent to the camp, to bring ſome proviſions to his brothers, who were ſoldiers. When he ſaw the giant, and heard his inſolent language, God inſpired him with courage, and he reſolved to go out and meet him. All the army of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wondered and trembled for him: and when <hi>Goliath</hi> ſaw what a ſtripling he was, he ſuppoſed he had been ſent to mock him, and was very angry. The giant then came forward to deſtroy <hi>David,</hi> but the young man took a ſtone, which he threw from a ſling at him.

               <p>He tried ſo often to put <hi>David</hi> to death, that <hi>David</hi> was obliged to go away and hide himſelf, ſometimes with the prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> and ſometimes with the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> But the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> grew ſuſpicious, and took him for a ſpy, ſo he durſt not ſtay long with them. He wandered about in the deſerts, and lodged in caves, while <hi>Saul</hi> was almoſt mad with fury that he could not find him. In the mean <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

There was, however, one man called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> who was brutal and churliſh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with roughneſs and ill-nature to him. But his wife <hi>Abigail,</hi> a prudent, ſenſible woman, was much concerned when ſhe heard of it; and to ſave her huſband from

the reſentment, that is, the anger he had reaſon to expect, ſhe went to <hi>David</hi> to make all the excuſes ſhe could, and to aſk his pardon.</p>
               <p>Still <hi>Saul</hi> purſued <hi>David</hi> wherever he went. One day <hi>Saul</hi> happened to go into a cave where <hi>David</hi> was hid with two or three of his friends in a corner, out of ſight. Then <hi>Saul</hi> was in <hi>David</hi>'s power, and he could have ended all his diſtreſſes, by putting his unjuſt enemy to death. But a good man would ſuffer any thing rather than take revenge, or do a baſe act, and would always return good for evil. So <hi>David</hi> let <hi>Saul</hi> eſcape, and yet that ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born king continued ſtill to be <hi>David</hi>'s enemy.</p>
               <p>Another time <hi>Saul</hi>'s life was again in <hi>David</hi>'s power, but no provocation could tempt him to do him any hurt, ſo they parted again: and then <hi>David,</hi> to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of his way, went and lived in the country of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after, a freſh war broke out between that nation and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in which <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> his ſon were killed in battle. When <hi>David</hi> heard the news, he was much concerned for <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe he was his father-in-law and his king; and he grieved moſt exceedingly for <hi>Jonathan,</hi> who had always behaved to him as a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:028888_0101_0FDE797DFA004058"/>
and a friend. He made a funeral ſong for <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He ruled for a great while with juſtice and mercy, and was a wiſe and a great king. He never forgot the friendſhip of <hi>Jonathan</hi> towards him, but treated a poor lame ſon that he left behind, called <hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth;</hi> with great affection. His ſubjects were happy under his government. He was very devout, and made a number of holy ſongs or pſalms. We have in the Bible an hundred and fifty, moſtly written by him, which are called the Pſalms of <hi>David.</hi> Some of theſe are penitential, that is, written when he was ſorry for his ſins, and imploring or aſking earneſtly. God's forgiveneſs; and ſome are thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings for mercies received. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the goodneſs and greatneſs, and all the wonders of Almighty God; and others are prophetical, that is, filled with prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of what ſhould afterwards happen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> alſo collected all the riches he could get, either in gold or ſilver, ivory, precious ſtones, or fine timber, and laid them by, as materials for erecting, that is, making a great temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> a temple is a magnificent building in honour

of God, ſet apart for his ſervice; where the prieſts ſhould be continually attending on his worſhip, and whither the people ſhould reſort to pray and offer ſacrifices. This was what he had chiefly at heart; but it was not the divine will that the temple ſhould be begun during <hi>David</hi>'s life-time. God was, however, graciouſly pleaſed to acquaint him, by one of his prophets, that he approved of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it ſhould be executed, that is, done in the reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſon. In ſhort, <hi>David</hi> reigned ſo well, that his neighbours loved him, and God called him the man after his own heart. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> was his chief city, and where all the men were every year to aſſemble three times, to obſerve the paſſover, and two other feſtivals.</p>
               <p>Who would have thought that ſuch a wiſe prince could ever do wrong? But the fooliſh pleaſures of the world, the riches he poſſeſſed, and the reſpect every body paid him, tempted him to forget his duty to God his maker, and to think too much about pleaſing himſelf: and whoever does that will ſoon be led aſtray. It was juſt ſo with <hi>David;</hi> whenever he neglected ſtudying to pleaſe God, and began to think of pleaſing himſelf only, he fell into the greateſt ſins; but God Almighty was ſo
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:028888_0103_0FDE7988A5C674B8"/>
good as to ſend him great afflictions, which made him think of his ſins and repent. After a great deal of ſorrow and reſolving to amend his life, the Almighty forgave him and bleſſed him again. The ſins of <hi>David</hi> were very great indeed, but his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them was great too, and his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment very ſevere, which at ſome time, and in ſome manner, is what all ſinners muſt expect. <hi>David</hi> ſuffered great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his crimes, and met with terrible afflictions in his family. They quarrelled among themſelves, and <hi>Abſalom,</hi> one of his ſons, rebelled againſt him. He alſo loſt the love of part of his people, who ceaſed to reſpect him, when he became diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to God. The greateſt part of them joined with <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and made him king, and drove <hi>David</hi> out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city; but when God had ſufficiently humbled him, he ſuffered <hi>Abſalom'</hi>s army to be deſtroyed, and the young man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf loſt his life. The people then returned to <hi>David</hi> their old king. He grieved a long while for his ſon <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and took care never to offend God any more. He lived to a great age, and governed the people well, and God to reward him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his ſon <hi>Solomon,</hi> though but a youth, to ſucceed him to the crown of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; and many parts of them are very proper for public or private chriſtian worſhip: but we are to remember, that it is of no uſe to repeat the words of a prayer or pſalm, unleſs we think, at the ſame time, of what we are ſaying. It is highly diſpleaſing to God to let our thoughts ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, either at public or private prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it a ſin to divert ourſelves, and to be cheerful?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Very far from it: God Almighty, who is goodneſs itſelf, and loves us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us to be as cheerful, and to divert our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as we can, provided our diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or mirth is not ſinful; that is, that it does not hurt ourſelves or others. When it can do no harm, it is called innocent mirth; and good people always feel mirth and pleaſure, becauſe they know that God Almighty loves them, and protects them. It is, however, certainly a ſin to employ our whole time in diverſion only, becauſe that prevents neceſſary and uſeful buſineſs from being done. But as king <hi>David</hi>'s ſon ſays, in the book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes:</hi>

A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck away that which is planted.</p>
               <p>A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.</p>

               <p>SOLOMON had been taught by his parents, that religion and virtue are true wiſdom: and that true wiſdom is more valuable than riches, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us the eſteem of good men here, and purchaſes us eternal happineſs hereafter.

By means of this he was the greateſt king ever heard of; and to this day, when we would praiſe any body's
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:028888_0106_0FDE799DB63B6470"/>
wiſdom, we ſay, he is as wiſe as <hi>Solomon.</hi> He did many good things, which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſcriptures; and wrote ſome of the books that are in it. One of them is called the Proverbs of <hi>Solomon.</hi> It is full of wiſe ſayings and beautiful thoughts, very improving and entertaining. He built the temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was a moſt beautiful building. We find the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it in the Holy Scriptures. <hi>Solomon</hi> alſo made a great palace for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſeveral other fine buildings. And his wiſdom was ſo much talked of abroad, that the queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant country to ſee him, and to admire the wonders of his country.</p>
               <p>Yet, even this great and wiſe man went aſtray; with all his wiſdom, <hi>Solomon</hi> fell.

A good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man behaves well to her huſband, and takes care of his family and his children: but <hi>Solomon,</hi> wiſe as he was, did not conſider that. He took wives from among bad people, that were idolaters and idle, and did nothing but eat and drink, and make merry. Theſe bad women perſuaded <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> They were ſent by Almighty God, to forewarn the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> of the ſad conſequence of their diſobeying the laws of God, and to exhort them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and ſometimes they were ſent with meſſages from God to other nations.

<pb n="112" facs="unknown:028888_0115_0FDE7A4798C9BFB8"/>
brought before the king, upon his aſking them why they did not ſerve his gods, nor worſhip the golden image which he had ſet up? replied to him, O <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> we are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter. If it be ſo, our God, whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king. But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip the golden image which thou haſt ſet up.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> commanded a furnace to be heated ſeven times more than uſual, and <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> to be caſt into it. But they were miraculouſly preſerved by an angel of God, ſo that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was an hair of their heads ſinged, nor any thing about them burnt.</p>
               <p>When king <hi>Darius,</hi> who reigned after <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> had placed <hi>Daniel</hi> at the head of all his affairs, the great men of the kingdom, envying his power, and ſeeking his ruin, craftily obtained an order from the king, which could not be changed, to forbid any prayers to be made for the ſpace of thirty days, to any God or man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, except to the king, thinking thereby to enſnare <hi>Daniel.</hi> But he fearing nothing, continued to pray in his uſual manner,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:028888_0116_0FDE7A4DCE04F570"/>
with his windows open, three times a day. This being eaſily known, theſe wicked men took advantage of it, and accuſed him to the king, who was very ſorry to find his faithful ſervant in danger from his order, and laboured all he could to ſave him, but in vain, and was forced to command him to be caſt into the den of lions.</p>
               <p>The king paſſed the night in ſadneſs and ſolitude, neither were any inſtruments of muſic brought before him, and his ſleep went from him. And he aroſe very early in the morning, and went in haſte unto the den of lions. And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the king ſpoke and ſaid unto him; O <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſervant of the living God, is thy God whom thou ſerveſt continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? Then ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> unto the king; O king live for ever (this was an uſual manner of ſpeaking to kings in thoſe days.) My God hath ſent his angel, and hath ſhut the lions' mouths: foraſmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and alſo before thee, O king, I have done no hurt. Then the king was exceeding glad, and commanded <hi>Daniel</hi> to be taken out of the den, and the men that accuſed him to be brought and caſt into it; over whom the lions had the maſtery, and broke all
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:028888_0117_0FDE7A546EF0C8E0"/>
their bones in pieces, before they came to the bottom of the den.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why would not <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> worſhip <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s image?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe it was forbidden them by the firſt and ſecond commandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Ought not we to be ready to ſuffer any thing, rather than go againſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and worſhip any other than God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes: becauſe God can deliver us out of the greateſt dangers, as he did theſe men. If not, he can make us happy in another world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But might not <hi>Daniel</hi> have forborne to worſhip God for thirty days in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic manner he was known to do, and have contented himſelf with praying to him in ſecret, rather than diſobey the laws, and expoſe himſelf to be devoured by wild beaſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means: for that would have been to act deceitfully, and would have appeared to be a forbearing to worſhip God at the command of a king.

All this has accordingly come to paſs, and theſe four monarchies, or powers, have governed the world in their turn. Firſt, the <hi>

Several other kings of <hi>Perſia</hi>

The <hi>Jews</hi> were frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed by them till they ſubmitted to the <hi>Romans,</hi> who, fourthly, came out of a city called <hi>Rome,</hi> and, by degrees, conquered almoſt every nation in the world. When every country had yielded to them, and all nations were at peace, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> was emperor of <hi>Rome;</hi> at which happy time our bleſſed Saviour came to deliver us all from ſin and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſubjection to the emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was born?</p>

               <p>

               <head type="sub">OF THE BOOK OF JOB.</head>
               <p>I HAVE now given an account of moſt of that part of the Bible which is called the Old Teſtament, except the Book of <hi>Job.</hi> It contains the life of that good man, and is one of the fineſt hiſtories in the Holy Scripture. It is not known what time he lived; but he is mentioned as a pattern of goodneſs, patience, and ſubmiſſion to the will of God. No man ever underwent harder trials; for he was deprived of all his fortune, his friends,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:028888_0121_0FDE7A6F3B029CF8"/>
and his children, and endured the moſt painful ſickneſs; but all this ſerved to ſhew his great dependence upon God, and his humility, and that no extremity of ſufferings could tempt him to do evil. When <hi>Job</hi>'s piety had been ſufficiently manifeſted, God Almighty reſtored to him all he had loſt, fortune, friends, children, and health; and added a great deal more, ſo that the latter end of his life was ſtill more proſperous than the beginning had been.</p>

               <p>OUR Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was born in the country of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whilſt <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar</hi> was emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the time of a general peace. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:028888_0122_0FDE7A7411A43088"/>
circumſtances that attended his birth are related in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Soon after he was born, ſome wiſe men from the eaſtern country, where the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the Meſſiah was general, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been informed by the appearance of an extraordinary ſtar, of that happy event, came into <hi>Judea,</hi> to pay homage to him. <hi>Herod,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> had ſet over the land of <hi>Judah,</hi> was much alarmed at the news; for miſtaking in common with the reſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people, the true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Meſſiah, he feared that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would be raiſed to the throne in his place.</p>
               <p>This bad man, therefore, tried to find out the child, with an intention to deſtroy him; but <hi>Mary,</hi> the mother of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> her huſband, were ſo poor and ſo little known, that he could not diſcover him. Then cruel <hi>Herod,</hi> in order to make ſure of him, commanded all the infants to be put to death, who were in or about <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> where it was foretold that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be born. But God diſcovered his wicked intention to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a dream, deſiring him to make haſte, and take the child and his mother into <hi>Egypt.</hi> They went and ſtaid there, till God again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him by another dream, that <hi>Herod</hi> was dead, and commanded him to return
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:028888_0123_0FDE7A7A3306BE80"/>
home, but to go to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and not to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> for fear of <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſon, who then reigned, and who was as cruel as his father.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Jeſus</hi> was but twelve years old, he aſtoniſhed all who ſaw or heard him, by the extraordinary wiſdom he diſplayed. But before he made any appearance as a prophet, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was ſent out by God Almighty, to prepare people's minds for the coming of the Meſſiah, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and endeavoured to perſuade every body to repent, and alſo to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; a ceremony by which they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly expreſſed their deſire of becoming the diſciples of the Meſſiah, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that repentance was neceſſary in order to their becoming ſuch, and their belief that <hi>John</hi> was divinely commiſſioned to prepare men for his reception.</p>
               <p>When our Lord was about thirty years old, he began to act himſelf ſuitably to the intentions of his coming. Firſt of all, he was baptized by <hi>John,</hi> at which time the Holy Spirit of God, in a particular manner, came down upon him. <hi>Jeſus</hi> was after this put under a very ſingular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to exerciſe him before-hand, and to fit him for his great office of Teacher and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of a ſinful world; and he faſted forty days, all which time was ſpent in
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:028888_0124_0FDE7A80814C5A08"/>
holy meditation and prayer, and receiving divine inſtruction and direction. When this was ended, he began to call upon the people to repent and amend their lives. He went up into a mountain, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome of the moſt excellent diſcourſes, or ſermons, that ever were heard. In theſe diſcourſes he taught that which we call the Lord's Prayer, as a pattern for all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes or prayers to Almighty God. He teaches us alſo that we muſt be humble, ſubmiſſive, patient, and good-natured; in ſhort, that we muſt neither do nor ſay, nor even think any thing that is wrong, and that we muſt ſtudy to do kindneſs, even to our greateſt enemies. For by ſo doing we imitate God himſelf, who is kind to the diſobedient, as well as the pious and obedient; who ſends no afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but to make us better, or to keep us good; and who permits the enlivening ſunſhine, and refreſhing ſhowers, to viſit the good and bad alike.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour came down from the mount, he practiſed all he had been preaching; for he went about doing good, and uſing the great power which he had received from God for the benefit of men. He cured diſtempers of all kinds by a word, or a ſingle touch. He made the deaf to hear, the lame to walk, the blind
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:028888_0125_0FDE7A8686CA0980"/>
to ſee, the dumb to ſpeak, and raiſed the dead to life. In one inſtance there was ſuch virtue accompanying him, that a diſtempered perſon who touched his clothes, in hopes of being cured, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately well; and though he had no lands or money, he twice ſatisfied the hunger of ſeveral thouſands with a few loaves and fiſhes. The hiſtory of his raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, and the whole account of that family, gives us a moſt pleaſing picture of tenderneſs, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and friendſhip. Our bleſſed Lord, not content with doing what good he could perſonally, or by himſelf, choſe twelve from among his diſciples to be conſtantly with him; he particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them, and after they had been enabled by Almighty God to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, he commanded them to diſperſe themſelves about to inſtruct, that is, to teach the ignorant, as he did, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every kind of diſtreſs. He told them they would frequently meet with very bad uſage, but that they ought to ſubmit pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently for his ſake; that what they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was in the ſervice of God, for the good of mankind, and for their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to teach truth and righteouſneſs: and that if we live in this world in ever

ſo inoffenſive, or even uſeful a manner, we may ſtill have ſome enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Were not all men delighted with ſo great, and good, and amiable a character, and did they not do every thing in their power to ſhew their love and reſpect for him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, indeed they did not, a very few perſons excepted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How could this happen; one would think that every body would be almoſt ready to lay down his life for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> One would think ſo; and this would have been the caſe, had not the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> been at that time very wicked, having their minds poiſoned by many bad paſſions; in particular they were proud, conceited, and ambitious; that is, wiſhed to make themſelves great and powerful, at the expenſe of the happineſs of other people; when, therefore, they found that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would not gratify them by taking to himſelf any worldly grandeur, they were ſo diſappointed and offended, that they were eaſily prevailed upon by their rulers, and particularly by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> to ſeek his deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus,</hi> however, ſtill went on teaching his diſciples and the people every thing that was uſeful for them to know. He
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:028888_0127_0FDE7A93101F5990"/>
told them alſo a great deal beſides, that would come to paſs afterwards; ſuch as the nature of his death and ſufferings, of the time and manner of his ſecond coming, of the life of men after death, and of their reward or puniſhment, according as they had been good or bad. Some things in his teaching he delivered in ſhort hints and ſtriking ſtories, called parables, which, if they were not quite ſo eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, were leſs diſpleaſing to ſome who heard him, and likely to be remembered by them, till they became better diſpoſed to receive the inſtruction that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them. What he ſaid at ſome times darkly, at other times he delivered more clearly, and he explained all things to thoſe diſciples who were very much with him. And in one way or other, he has abundantly furniſhed us with all things neceſſary to lead us to the knowledge of our duty, and to excite us to the practice of our duty; to help us to avoid and to overcome temptation, and to ſupport and comfort us in difficulties and afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did <hi>Jeſus</hi> know that he ſhould ſuffer a very painful and cruel death, and did his diſciples know it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A. Jeſus</hi> knew it from the firſt, but it did not at all abate, that is, leſſen his zeal in the great work in which he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged;
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:028888_0128_0FDE7A9A7B42CE90"/>
and he often foretold, even the circumſtances of his death to his diſciples; but although they were honeſt well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, they were led away by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miſtake, that the Meſſiah was to be a great temporal prince.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour's words and diſcourſes aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed every body. Numbers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple admired and followed him; but the prieſts, the ſcribes, the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> were againſt him from envy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. Theſe laſt were hypocrites, who pretended to be wiſer and better than other men, but were full of pride and deceit. Such men always hate thoſe who are truly good, eſpecially when they find they are better liked than themſelves.</p>
               <p>They therefore perſecuted our Lord, and tried to puzzle him with artful queſtions, and to draw him in to ſay or do ſomething contrary to law, in order to have a pretence for putting him to death. But he ſhewed himſelf as much above them in wiſdom as in virtue, and often ſent them away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at the wiſdom and prudence of his anſwers.</p>
               <p>Their malice grew to a great height, and they perſuaded many to unite with them; our Saviour knew they would ſoon obtain their wiſh; and he knew that he was ſent into the world, not only to do good
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:028888_0129_0FDE7A9F1E22A920"/>
by his miracles and diſcourſes, but alſo to do good by the violent and public death which he was to undergo. By this death the ſincerity of his profeſſions (that is, his truth in reſpect of what he had told them) his obedience to God's will, his confidence in his heavenly Father, and his own belief in a future life and recompenſe to the good were to be proved: by this death alſo, his diſciples were to be encouraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to endure all things in the miniſtry to which they were appointed: by this death alſo, a clear proof was to be given of his love to all perſons; and laſtly, his death was to be followed by his reſurrection from the grave. That reſurrection would be a proof that his followers will not periſh when they die. For this violent and public death, therefore, a very awful, though very uſeful event, <hi>Jeſus</hi> carefully prepared both himſelf and his diſciples.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Who were the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who were ſuppoſed to be learned in expounding or explaining the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> were two ſects of men amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> who held very different opinions indeed; yet as they had all of them private ambitious ends of their own to anſwer, and were worldly-minded
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:028888_0130_0FDE7AA54B185CD0"/>
and covetous, they agreed in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting and condemning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent doctrine and holy life, were equally a reproach to them both. The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were men of learning, and pretended to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common holineſs; but their religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted chiefly in the obſervance of rites or certain forms, and ceremonies, for which they ſought to be admired of men, whilſt they neglected the weightier matters of the law, which are judgment, mercy, and faith. The <hi>Sadducees</hi> diſbelieved a future life after death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What were the diſpoſitions of mind that made the <hi>Phariſees</hi> pretend to be what they were not, or be ſuch hypocrites?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Vanity (that is, the love of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) covetouſneſs (by which is meant the love of money) and ambition (by which is meant the love of power) and when any of theſe vices get root in the mind, they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to every thing really excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, they miſlead the judgment, make the heart bad, and are very hateful in the ſight of God. To perſons of ſuch diſpoſitions, the deep humility, the perfect kindneſs, and the univerſal goodneſs of our Lord, could not but be very diſpleaſing.</p>
               <p>On the night that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was to fall into the hands of his enemies, he ſat down to ſupper with his diſciples, and acquainted
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:028888_0131_0FDE7AAB1DDC41B0"/>
them that one of that company would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him; and hinted that <hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> was the man. After ſupper he brake bread and bleſſed God for it, and gave ſome to each of them, ſaying, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body, which is broken for many. Eat this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</hi> He alſo took the cup of wine, and gave it to them, ſaying, <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for many. Drink this in remembrance of me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after ſupper, thoſe to whom <hi>Judas</hi> had betrayed his Maſter, came and ſeized upon him and carried him away.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of his examination before <hi>Pilate,</hi> his crucifixion, his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his appearance to his diſciples after his burial, and his aſcenſion into heaven: it is ſo finely related by the ſacred writers of that part of the Holy Bible, called the New Teſtament, that we cannot do better in this reſpect than to read it over frequently, and with attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You ſaid that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> delivered ſome very excellent diſcourſes, pray what were they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You will read them in the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. Amongſt others is an excellent ſermon from the mount; on which <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounced the following bleſſings, and taught the following doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:028888_0132_0FDE7AAFE43E4260"/>
                  <q>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit, for their's is the kingdom of Heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of being poor in ſpirit?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be poor in ſpirit ſignifies to be humble-minded, to be of a quiet teachable diſpoſition, not to think highly of ourſelves, or to indulge a violent or ſtubborn temper, but to be contented with our ſituation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be. Theſe are the poor in ſpirit, and to theſe the kingdom of heaven is promiſed.</p>
               <p>The next bleſſing is to them that mourn, promiſing that they ſhall be comforted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What does this mean?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It means, perhaps, that thoſe ſhall be comforted who mourn, or are diſtreſſed, from a ſenſe that they have done wrong, and who are ſincerely deſirous of doing right in future, or who are ſorry for the weakneſſes and faults of others: this is a very proper and affectionate temper, and will always be attended with great comfort, and ſatisfaction in the mind.</p>
               <p>The third bleſſing is to the meek, with this promiſe, that they ſhall inherit the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What does this mean?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The meek are thoſe of a quiet and gentle diſpoſition, who are not diſpoſed to be quarrelſome and angry, but to forgive.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:028888_0133_0FDE7AB54D9A50A8"/>
Theſe are the people who paſs through life moſt comfortably, by not reſenting little offences, they avoid making any enemies; by a gentle and kind behaviour, they make many friends; and ſo they may be ſaid to inherit the earth.—Whilſt thoſe who are of a quarrelſome temper, make every body about them unhappy, and are unhappy themſelves: if they are rich they have no comfort in their riches, becauſe they are miſerable in their own minds: and if they are poor, nobody ſcarcely will help them, becauſe they have made themſelves diſliked.</p>
               <p>The fourth bleſſing is to thoſe who hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, and it is promiſed to them that they ſhall be filled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Pray what are we to underſtand by this?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To hunger and thirſt after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, means an earneſt and conſtant deſire to be righteous, that is, to be good: and God has graciouſly promiſed that thoſe who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, they ſhall be filled (that is, they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good) let us therefore always, and with all our might, ſtrive to leave undone thoſe things which we ought not to do, and to do thoſe things that we ought to do; firmly believing that God will help us when we endeavour; and that in time, we
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:028888_0134_0FDE7ABA7A5F0DE0"/>
ſhall become as perfect as we have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to become.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, <q>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this bleſſing we are encouraged to ſhew a kind, affectionate, and forgiving temper. It is the ſureſt method of gaining us the love and good will of men; he who is cruel and unkind, who ſpeaks ill, and behaves harſhly to others, ſeldom meets with compaſſion when he falls into diſtreſs: and the recollection of his own cruelty, muſt make him very unhappy.—But every body pities, and many endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the diſtreſſes of a kind and merciful man, ſo that he often obtains mercy even in this world, and he is ſure (which is much better) to obtain it in the world to come.</p>
               <p>The ſixth promiſes to the pure in heart, that they ſhall ſee God.</p>
               <p>From this bleſſing, we ſee it not only neceſſary to avoid doing wrong, or ſaying any thing wrong, but that we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to keep the heart pure from every bad wiſh, for all evil begins either in our thoughts, or our deſires; and we-find that in order to ſee God, and to be happy in the next world, we muſt keep our hearts pure in this.—Let us then ſhun every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:028888_0135_0FDE7AC0F5DC4CB0"/>
of evil, and conquer every bad wiſh or thought in the beginning.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh bleſſing declares, that the peace-makers ſhall be called the children of God.</p>
               <p>From this we ſhould learn not only to avoid a quarrelſome temper ourſelves, but endeavour as much as poſſible to hinder, and to reconcile any quarrels amongſt our friends and neighbours. Thoſe then who go about telling tales, and making miſchief amongſt their neighbours, we may be ſure are diſpleaſing to God, ſince it is the peace-makers who ſhall be called the children of God.</p>
               <p>In the eighth, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſays, <q>bleſſed are they who are perſecuted for right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs ſake, for their's is the kingdom of heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In former times many people were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, that is, they were puniſhed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put to death, for ſpeaking and doing what they believed to be right, to them <hi>Chriſt</hi> has promiſed the bleſſing of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</p>
               <p>And in the next bleſſing, which is very much like it, he ſays, <q>bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil againſt you <hi>falſely,</hi> for my ſake; rejoice, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:028888_0136_0FDE7AC522C01670"/>
glad, for great will be your reward in heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, though in this country, no people are put to death for their religion, yet there are many thoughtleſs and wicked people, who are apt to make a jeſt of every thing ſerious, who not being good themſelves, laugh at others for ſaying their prayers, going regularly to worſhip, and being ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and mild, and peaceable, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. But do not let ſuch treatment diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you, but, on the contrary, let it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you—for remember—that great will be your reward in heaven.</p>
               <p>In another part of his ſermon, <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends them, to be patterns of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and piety, that others ſeeing their good works, may glorify their father who is in heaven.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have opportunities of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this excellent ſermon, and of learning their duty to God, and to mankind, ſhould attend to this, and endeavour to be ſuch patterns of goodneſs, that others may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> farther tells them, that by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> law, murder and adultery are forbidden; and that thoſe who are guilty of theſe crimes, are liable to judgment, and to be puniſhed: and at the ſame time, propoſes a much higher virtue or goodneſs,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:028888_0137_0FDE7ACADFCA9878"/>
for he tells us, that we muſt guard againſt every thought, or wiſh, or temper, that would lead us to do wrong; and that, <q>whoſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe,</q> does wrong in the ſight of God, and is in danger of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <q>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the altar, and there remembereſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee; leave there thy gift before the altar, firſt go and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</q>
               <p>From hence we may learn, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us before we attempt to worſhip him, to be reconciled to all men (for we ſhould in this ſenſe conſider all men as our brothers.) If, therefore, we would wiſh that God ſhould liſten to us, forgive us our faults, and love us, we muſt be kind and forgiving to others, and make them amends for any harm we have done them, before God will hear us. And if we ſhould find that any pleaſure, or any temper, or habit, that is ever ſo natural and agreeable, and ſeemingly almoſt neceſſary to us, ſhould prove hurtful in making us leſs good; however dear it may be, we muſt get rid of it, if we would be happy in heaven, though it ſhould be as dear to us as a right hand, or a right eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="unknown:028888_0138_0FDE7AD0ABA9D370"/>
Again <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <q>ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, thou ſhalt not forſwear thyſelf, but ſhall perform unto the Lord thine oaths. But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all, &amp;c. but let your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be yea yea, and nay nay, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is more than that cometh of evil.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this we are to underſtand, that upon every occaſion we ſhould moſt carefully tell the truth, and not take the name of God in vain, or ſpeak lightly of ſerious things: for when we are ſtrictly good, and ſtrictly juſt, we ſhall upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be as much ſhocked at telling a falſehood, as a bad man can be at ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſely, for which the laws have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a puniſhment here, and God will puniſh hereafter. Let us therefore never ſwear, but be ſimple and ſincere in our diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Again, in this ſermon, <hi>Chriſt</hi> adds, <q>I ſay unto you, reſiſt not evil; but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall ſmite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other alſo. And if any man will ſue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak alſo; and whoſoever ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel thee to go a mile, go with him twain (that is, two.)</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here <hi>Chriſt</hi> recommends that we ſhould not reſent, or be angry at injuries or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:028888_0139_0FDE7AD5F4433620"/>
but that we ſhould forgive them: this meekneſs is ſo far from being a proof of a mean and low diſpoſition, that it is a ſtrong proof of a great, a good, and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian temper. Beſides this, it is really the moſt wiſe, for it is the way to make our enemies our friends; it will make us happy in our own minds, and procure us the favor of God; and it is better to put up with many little injuries, rather than to go to law, which not only makes men unhappy in themſelves, but often brings them to poverty and diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <q>Give to him that aſketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If you have it not in your power to give money, you may give advice, and lend your aſſiſtance. You are taught by this to do every good and kind action in your power.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Chriſt</hi> adds, I ſay unto you, love your enemies, bleſs them that curſe you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who deſpitefully uſe you, and perſecute you: that ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven, for he makes the ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth rain on the juſt and on the unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="137" facs="unknown:028888_0140_0FDE7ADA5C60F038"/>
For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? Do not even the publicans the ſame? And if ye ſalute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans ſo? Be ye therefore perfect.—For let us remember, our Father which is in heaven, is perfect.</p>
                  <p>Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be ſeen of them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. But when thou doeſt thine alms, let thine alms be in ſecret, and thine heavenly Father who ſeeth in ſecret, himſelf ſhall reward thee openly.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The meaning of this is, that when we do charitable actions, we ſhould do them from a kind and merciful diſpoſition, and becauſe all mankind are our brethren; (and to relieve and aſſiſt our brethren, is pleaſing to God) now if we do good for theſe reaſons, we ſhall not want the praiſe of men, and God, who ſees in ſecret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will reward us openly in the other world.</p>
               <p>But thoſe who do actions that ſeem to be good, only in order that men may ſee and praiſe them, they are vain, and proud, and ſilly; and ſuch diſpoſitions as theſe cannot recommend them to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="unknown:028888_0141_0FDE7AE0DE78B478"/>
And ſo with prayers, we ſhould pray in ſecret at home, when we are by ourſelves, as well as at places of public worſhip, and God will reward us.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>After this manner, therefore, pray ye; Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven: Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive them who treſpaſs againſt us: lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil; for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For if ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; but if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give your treſpaſſes.</p>
               </q>
               <p>And as we are directed to pray that we may not be led into temptation, it will be wiſe in us not to expoſe ourſelves to it, but to avoid every thing that is likely to lead us to do wrong, eſpecially thoſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to which we are moſt likely to give way.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Lay not up for yourſelves treaſures upon earth, where moth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and ſteal; but lay up for yourſelves trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in heaven, where neither moth nor
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:028888_0142_0FDE7AE4D49126E8"/>
ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through and ſteal.</p>
                  <p>Take no (over anxious) thought for your life, what ye ſhall eat, or what ye ſhall drink, nor yet for your bodies, what ye ſhall put on: Conſider the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the field, they toil not, neither do they ſpin, but ſeek ye firſt the kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and (as your heavenly Father knows that food and raiment are neceſſary) all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Thoſe who are of a ſober, ſerious, and religious conduct, and conſider their duty to God, and the duties of religion, of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, private prayer, and good will to their neighbours; we ſee that they are likewiſe the moſt diligent in their buſineſs, and they have the beſt enjoyment, and the greateſt ſhare of the comforts of this life: at leaſt to the fear of God, and to his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, all other things that are needful are added.</p>
               <q>Judge not, that ye be not judged; for with what judgment ye judge others, ye ſhall be judged; and with what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</q>
               <p>From this we ſhould learn to be very charitable and kind, in judging others; and very cautious how we condemn them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:028888_0143_0FDE7AEA86561DB8"/>
We ſhould think favourably (at leaſt as favourably as poſſible) of their conduct; for with what judgment we judge, let us remember God will judge us, and this is a very ſerious conſideration.</p>
               <q>Aſk and it ſhall be given, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you.</q>
               <p>From this we ſhould learn never to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect our prayers to God, but we ſhould be earneſt and conſtant in our deſires to become good, and gain the bleſſing of Providence, and every virtuous and good diſpoſition. If we aſk, it ſhall be given; if we ſeek, we ſhall find; if we knock, it ſhall be opened.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</p>
                  <p>After this excellent doctrine, or advice, and more of the ſame kind; <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> concludes his ſermon by ſaying, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, who built his houſe upon a rock: and the rains deſcended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that houſe, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">OF THE APOSTLES.</head>
               <p>AFTER the books of the four evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> we find a book called, <hi>The Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> in which there is ſome account of what became of them after their Lord had left them. As for poor wicked <hi>Judas,</hi> his guilty conſcience drove him to ſuch deſpair, that he hanged himſelf.—It is thus that one ſin generally leads to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. But ſelf-murder could only add to the crime he had before committed. We have no right to take away the life that God has given, whether other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's, or our own. We may repent of other ſins, after having been guilty of them. There are, however, very few people, if any, who are not out of their minds, that attempt to commit ſuch a crime. The other apoſtles, or diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did in obedience to God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, go about preaching the goſpel, and doing good works. We read, that they very ſoon, according to the promiſe of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> were enabled by the power of God to ſpeak many languages which they
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:028888_0146_0FDE7AFADE03CEB0"/>
had never learnt, to work miracles like thoſe of their Maſter, and to conduct them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on very difficult occaſions, with extraodinary fortitude and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>They almoſt all died martyrs to the faith; that is, were put to cruel deaths, by barbarous men, becauſe they would perſiſt in ſpeaking the truth, which they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and witneſſing what they had ſeen and known relating to him.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the author of many epiſtles, or letters, which compoſe a part of the New Teſtament, had not been originally a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but had been a <hi>Jew,</hi> and perſecuted the church at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that is, the aſſembly of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> there. God however, was pleaſed to convert him at laſt from his errors, and he became a good Chriſtian, and a zealous Apoſtle. St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the other apoſtles, ſeemed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves chiefly to the converſion of the <hi>Jews:</hi> but St. <hi>Paul</hi> worked upon a larger plan, for he adreſſed himſelf to the heathens alſo, and converted an infinite number of them. He went twice to <hi>Rome,</hi> and preached the goſpel there. St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were great friends and fellow-labourers in the work to which they were appointed. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote a long letter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by the knowledge of the goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:028888_0147_0FDE7B00503765D0"/>
to him, he tells them what they were to believe and to do.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote two epiſtles, which are directed to all the ſtrangers, new Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſcattered about <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia;</hi> who by reaſon of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and perſecuted ſtate, might be called ſtrangers upon earth.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> alſo wrote three epiſtles, one to the univerſal Church; that is, the general ſociety of Chriſtians all over the world, and the other two to particular ſocieties.</p>
               <p>We have, beſides theſe, ſome other Epiſtles, written by different Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>The laſt book in the New Teſtament, is the Revelation of St. <hi>John,</hi> which is written in ſo ſublime and figurative a ſtyle, and altogether prophetic, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come, that the learned only are capable of ſearching into its meaning; and common readers need not perplex themſelves at all about it. Let us therefore content ourſelves like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified; and let us aim at nothing elſe ſo much, as imitating his virtuous and amiable life.</p>
               <p>The deſign of theſe Epiſtles is to fix upon the mind a ſerious belief in the truths of chriſtianity, and to perſuade men to the practice of every virtue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:028888_0148_0FDD22CD72D8EFF0"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the meaning of the word Teſtament?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Teſtament means the ſame as cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or agreement, which always ſuppoſes two parties. Thus Almighty God was pleaſed in ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſeperate <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> from his own family and kindred, and to promiſe him, that as a reward of his faith and obedience, his deſcendants ſhould obtain the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> who were to continue to poſſeſs it in proſperity and peace ſo long as they obeyed the law that ſhould be given to them by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This, therefore, on the part of God, was conditional, and only to be performed in conſequence of obedience to his laws on the part of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his poſterity: hence the former part of the ſacred hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, although it contains a great variety of other matters, is called by the name of the Old Teſtament, or Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do we know any thing of what might be the further deſign of God in thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing one particular family?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This diſpenſation reſpecting <hi>Abraham</hi> was a principal means of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> preſerving the knowledge of the one living and true God in the world, and of preparing the way, and providing evidence for the goſpel; and thus <hi>Abraham</hi> became the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:028888_0149_0FDE7B0BDE220CE0"/>
of the greateſt benefit and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to many others.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the ſacred hiſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the promiſes of God made by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> of a future happy and never-ending life after death, if we on our part are careful to obſerve and to do whatever he has commanded us, and this is called the New Teſtament, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Will our being called Chriſtians, and having been baptized, or the holding any particular opinions, entitle us to be heirs of his promiſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No indeed, not any of theſe things if we do not lead holy and exemplary lives. <q>Ye are my friends, when you do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you.—If any man have not the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he is none of his.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What were the principal things which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> came into the world to teach men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He was ſent to teach us, that if we do indeed purify ourſelves from all ſin and iniquity, and faithfully and ſteadily endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as our firſt purſuit to obtain the favour of God by obeying his laws, that then our heavenly Father, of his own free mercy and goodneſs, will forgive our paſt offences, receive us into his favour, and admit us to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:028888_0150_0FDE7B118A945408"/>
the glorious privilege of being called his children: and that although we muſt, in this world of trial, expect ſome diſſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet if we perſevere to the end, in the exerciſe of all chriſtian diſpoſitions, and the practice of all chriſtian duties, we may be certain that God will never forſake us; and that after death, he will raiſe us up again to a life of glory and happineſs, which will never end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is the true character of a chriſtian? Is every body a chriſtian who reads the hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and who believes all that is written in the New Teſtament concerning him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> To be a chriſtian, it is neceſſary not only to read, and believe the hiſtory of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> we muſt endeavour alſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like him in diſpoſition and conduct; always avoiding pride, and being careful never deſpiſe another, for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was of a meek and humble ſpirit; and as he was the friend and teacher of mankind, his true follower will endeavour like him, always to aſſiſt and be kind to others; the chriſtian who is not bleſt with riches, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, will yet pity their ſufferings—help them in their labours—reform the wicked, and ſet forth by his converſation and example, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and advantages of a devout and holy
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:028888_0151_0FDE7B165D3E30D8"/>
life; thankful for all worldly bleſſings, that providence hath ſet within the reach of virtuous induſtry, he takes them that he may uſe them for others, as well as for himſelf; remembering that of all his powers, and of all his talents, he is to render an account. His heart, however, is not ſet on external bleſſings; he ſeeks a better portion both for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for all who are within his influence. True Goodneſs always meets with whatever ſupport and encouragement he can give it, and while he abhors the vices of the wicked, he pities them, that would reclaim them. The love of goodneſs diſpoſes him to aſſociate with thoſe who are good.</p>
               <p>The word of God is his delight, and his counſellor; his day is always welcome to him, and he loves the habitation of his houſe.</p>
               <p>The true chriſtian although he weep with thoſe who weep, will yet be enabled to ſupport his own ſorrows without murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; always ſaying in his heart, "thy will oh Lord! not mine be done;" and ever bearing in mind the calmneſs and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> towards his enemies, he alſo will endeavour to ſuffer even inſults, reviling, and ill uſage with patience, and a compoſed mind; and as the true chriſtian will make choice of every means to advance
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:028888_0152_0FDE7B1E8216B6B8"/>
nearer and nearer towards the perfection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he will diligently ſtudy thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which <hi>Chriſt</hi> delivered on earth, in order to teach men how to reſemble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by becoming virtuous and wiſe, which alone can make us happy. The true chriſtian will frequently examine his own character, and endeavour to correct every thought, and word, and action, that may appear contrary to theſe doctrines; and inſtead of encouraging anger, hatred, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, diſhoneſty, intemperance, deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſwearing, or falſehood, he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, on the contrary, to pleaſe God, by following the inſtructions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which teach us to live peaceably with all men, to forgive our enemies, and to aviod every evil diſpoſition, or wicked practice, which might lead us to forget God, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure another, or to love this world better than that which is to come. The true chriſtian, therefore, loving God with all his heart, and always doing to others that which he would wiſh that others ſhould do to him, according to the example and goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will lead a life of peace, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remembering in poverty, and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every diſtreſs, that theſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can laſt but for a ſeaſon, and that every day he approaches nearer towards that time, when God ſhall admit him into
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:028888_0153_0FDE7B2335983700"/>
heaven, and make him happy with himſelf for ever. With theſe joyful expectations; the true chriſtian will find comfort under all his ſufferings, and when at length through temptation, trials, and tribulation, he ſhall be ſufficiently prepared for another, and a better life, he will then be enabled to meet death with a compoſed mind, and to ſay with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his laſt hour, <q>I have glorified thee on earth, and now, Oh Father! glorify thou me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This it is to be a true chriſtian.</p>
