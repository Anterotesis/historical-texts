            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>What I ſay to you is a ſerious Thing: You profeſs to Worſhip GOD and JESUS CHRIST, and while you get Drunk, you mock Him, and wrong your ſelves for this World and that to come.

                  <p>I have more things to mention.</p>
                  <p>I have been to St. <hi>George</hi>'s, according to my Duty to King <hi>GEORGE,</hi> to view the King's Fort and the Land there, to conſider what may be the moſt advantageous to the KING and to His People, to be done in that River.</p>
                  <p>I have been to <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> to ſee the King's Forts there; and at <hi>Cuſhnock</hi> and other Places on <hi>Kennebeck</hi> River, to ſee the King's Lands there, and I would have gone further, even to <hi>Norridgewock</hi> and <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> if any of the Tribes had been there to accompany me. And as I went into your Country, I ſhould be glad to ſee you at <hi>Boſton.</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Friends ſhould viſit one another at their ſeveral Houſes. It was in confidence of your ſincere Diſpoſition to Peace, that I travel'd into thoſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>I hope you find the Trading Houſes commodious for you, and that you are ſupplyed cheaper there, than by the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</hi>

                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:003554_0007_0FF85F826F1DE7A8"/>
                  <p>The Government takes Care that you be ſupplied cheaper than their own People: And I hope the more you are acquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and other Towns in theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>And as <hi>Loron</hi> ſaid, If there ſhould be any Cloud hanging over the Peace, you will take Care that we be informed timely of it.</p>
                  <p>Your coming hither to meet the Governour will not be ſuch a Proof of your Friendſhip as your giving Notice of theſe things, and practicing Friendſhip with us.</p>
                  <p>I have no doubt but the more you are acquainted with the Engliſh, the more you will love them.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall be ſo much my Care to ſeek your Intereſt and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as I doubt not will oblige you to ſincere Friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Government here have ſettled a Miniſter at St. <hi>George's,</hi> and there will be another at <hi>Richmond.</hi> They will be always ready to inſtruct you in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and teach your Children to Read and Write, which ſhall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Coſt to you.</p>
                  <p>If you are willing to ſend your Children to <hi>Boſton,</hi> they ſhall be brought up to Learning at the <hi>College,</hi> that ſo they may officiate as Fathers among you, and teach you the true Religion, and their Education ſhall coſt you nothing.</p>
                  <p>Tho' you have learnt Religion of the <hi>French,</hi> which you may apprehend to be a good one, yet you ſhould not be averſe to look into another. Before you knew the <hi>French</hi> Religion, you tho't the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion to be a good one, but when you were taught the <hi>French</hi> Religion, you tho't that better. And ſo when you are inſtructed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religion, you may think that ſtill better than the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have a mind to underſtand the true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religion, it ſhall coſt you nothing; and when you underſtand it you will certainly know, that you are cheated, when your Sins are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be pardon'd for Skins: This is all a Cheat and Deceit: None can pardon Sins but JESUS CHRIST; and He does it freely, without Money and without Price. All that the Prieſts make you pay, they put in their own Pockets.</p>

Your Excellency will go on in the Way that former Governours have gone in; which are the Articles of Peace made between us; which are to be obſerved.</p>

As to Prayers, It was mention'd in the Treaty, that there ſhould be no Diſpute about Religion. It would be a light Proceeding in us, to anſwer what you have ſaid on that Affair; We are too few to enter into this Diſpute, which is a weighty Matter: There are other Tribes to be diſcourſed with; and when we know their Mind we ſhall be better able to Anſwer: We had the Advice of the other Tribes about the Peace; and therefore we think it proper, to have their Advice in this Affair.</p>
                  <p>As to what was ſaid of our Children, we are not qualified to anſwer as to the Propoſal for their Education, we being but few here, and the other Tribes being concerned in it.</p>

I meet you further to ſtrengthen the Articles of Peace, and ſhould be glad from Time to Time to hear from you what will further promote it.</p>
                  <p>As to the Settlement of the Lands and the making of Towns in King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Lands, it ſhall always be according to the Treaties. I did not mention the Matter of Religion to make any Jar between us, but offer'd it as an Inſtance of my brotherly Love; and becauſe I am perfectly ſatisfied, it is the beſt way to your Intereſt in this World, and in the World to come. GOD has given you Reaſon to examine into the Matters of Religion. It will do you no Hurt to examine into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Religion, for then you can chuſe that which you ſhall judge is the beſt. The Government is willing to inſtruct you on free Coſt. I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with the foreign Nations; You have ſaid, you are free Men and you are my Brethren.

I ſhall be glad, if you have any thing to offer, you would mention it this Afternoon: For I purpoſe you ſhall dine with me To-Morrow, in order to diſmiſs you the Day after.</p>
                  <p>In all things we ſhould be frank and open, and no Body ſhould be here that are afraid to be known. This I ſay, becauſe I hear there are two <hi>French</hi> Men preſent; and I ſhou'd not Care if their Maſter was here too. I will always do Juſtice to you; but I will ſupport King <hi>GEORGE's</hi> Honour, who is Lord and Sovereign here; and the <hi>French</hi> ſhall know it.</p>
                  <p>How many <hi>French</hi> Men are here?</p>

                  <p>This Morning we happened to ſee ſome Strangers; but they came in a Veſſel on their own Affairs.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that we are to ſpeak freely to one another; for by the Articles of Peace we are to uſe this Freedom; and we ſhall be very open with your Excellency as to what concerns us.</p>

                  <p>My Heart is much engaged to prevent the Miſchief of the private Trade; the Government receives no Damage by it; but there is Danger that it will make a Miſunderſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us: For by this Means you have had ſuch Injuſtice done you, as the Government can't ſet to rights: but theſe Abuſes will not be offer'd you at the publick Truck-Houſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Loron.</speaker>
                  <p>We are to ſpeak every thing that is true, and hide nothing: As to the Trade, it was agreed, that we ſhould have the Goods as cheap as at <hi>Boſton</hi>; and the Governour told us that Goods would be govern'd by the foreign Markets, ſometimes cheaper and ſometimes dearer; but the Goods have always riſen in their Price.</p>

                  <p>As you are pleaſed to mention a Trading Houſe, at <hi>Cuſhnock</hi> it is too weighty for me to lift, but we will conſider of it, and return an Anſwer to it. There are many Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in it, if it were all my own Land, I would ſay you ſhould be welcome to it Brother; but if I ſhould ſay ſo, without the Conſent of the other Owners, I ſhould make my ſelf a Jeſt among them.</p>

                  <p>I ſpeak for the <hi>Amereſcoggin</hi> Indians. We ſhould be glad to have a Trading Houſe near us: As your Excellency ſaid we ſhould ſpeak of any Grievance as to the Trade; <hi>Adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wando</hi> and his People are diſſatisfied that a <hi>Negro</hi> has the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Trade at <hi>Saco-River.</hi> We did not know that King <hi>GEORGE</hi> was ſerved by <hi>Negroes.</hi>

                  <p>That <hi>Negro</hi> is a Servant to the Truck-Maſter, and he muſt have ſome Body to manage the Trade in his Abſence; he is a very honeſt Man. GOD made us of different Colours, the <hi>Negros</hi> black, the <hi>Indians</hi> not ſo black, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> white; and I don't deſpiſe the <hi>Indians</hi> becauſe they are not ſo white as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for they are as GOD made them.</p>
                  <p>As to the Propoſal of a Trading Houſe for the <hi>Amereſcoggin</hi> Indians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will conſider of it, and give you an Anſwer in the Afternoon.</p>

                  <p>I have ſomething to offer further: Your Excellency was pleaſed to ſay we ſhould ſpeak plainly. As to the diſtant Tribes, we think there is ſomething yet wanting. As there is Friendſhip, we wonder that Powder ſhould be wanting for us to fire a little with. It was mention'd at the Treaty, that Powder ſhould be given to each Tribe. If the Preſent ſhould be given, thoſe that are at a Diſtance would think that there is Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; and we are of Opinion that when other Tribes ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they would think there is hearty Love between us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Govern.</speaker>
                  <p>What do you mean by what you ſay of Powder?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Loron.</speaker>
                  <p>We mean a Preſent of Powder and Shot, which was mention'd in the Treaty. As to the Sloop that comes a Trading to <hi>Penobſcot,</hi> we don't deſire they ſhould be forbid, becauſe it is profitable to us, but only we are willing they ſhould be forbid bringing Rhum.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Govern.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad it lies much upon your Mind to have the Trade of Rhum prevented. There is no ſuch effectual Way to prevent your being drown'd with Rhum, as your not having to do with private Traders. If there be Convenience for a Sloops coming Spring and Fall to <hi>Penobſcot</hi> River, I will endeavour that the Government ſhall ſend a Sloop at thoſe Seaſons, to bring them every thing but Rhum; and I hope you will not be diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, if I order my People not to Trade with you in that Article.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the firſt Time I have heard of it. I will give Order to my Captains to ſee that you be treated with Juſtice and Kindneſs.

                  <p>When I was in <hi>Kennebeck</hi> River, I had Complaints from the Inhabitants that they could keep no Sheep for the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Dogs: By the Treaty you are obliged to muzzle them. It may ſeem a light Matter to you, to keep your Dogs looſe, but it is a great Diſcouragement to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> As I ſhall ſtrictly obſerve every Article of the Peace, ſo I expect you ſhould, and therefore you muſt take Care to keep your Dogs from doing this Miſchief to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>I have a Complaint againſt one of the young Men of the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridgewock</hi> Tribe from one <hi>Samuel Harden,</hi> that they kill'd five of his Horſes at <hi>Hunnawell's</hi> Point, to the Value of <hi>Forty

Pounds,</hi> for which he has had no Satisfaction. Taking away Men's Eſtates is like taking away their Lives; and their denying it will not Excuſe them. All the Articles of the Peace are made in the Preſence of GOD, who obſerves theſe things; and I expect Satisfaction for this Injury. I obſerve your Young Men ſmile at this; but it is a ſerious Matter; if you are in want, you muſt tell us of it. Theſe things will endanger a War.

We muſt be very careful to be Honeſt and Juſt to one another. I could upon theſe Occaſions do Juſtice to King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Men, by puniſhing thoſe that make ſuch Breaches on the Peace; but I chuſe this Method to ſhew my

Bever</hi> is grown ſo ſcarce, that what one Man can get till Winter, will hardly procure a Pair of Stockings. There were formerly ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things taken from the Jeſuits at <hi>Norridgewock</hi>; which if they were brought again to <hi>Richmond,</hi> we ſhould be glad to pay for them, eſpecially a Writing we ſaw at <hi>North-Yarmouth.</hi>

                  <p>One <hi>Drinkwater</hi>'s. Capt. <hi>Woodſide</hi> of <hi>Maquoit</hi> has taken good Care of us when we are cold and wanted any Thing; and we deſire that what has been ſaid about him, may go no further.</p>

                  <p>It is with Pleaſure that I hear what you have to ſay to me; and I hope what paſſes between us will make the Peace ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>It is beſt in Time to remove every Difficulty, or elſe by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it may grow greater. There is a great Difference as you know well between Spring and Fall <hi>Bever</hi>: The Market in <hi>England</hi> will always govern the Price here; and as great Quantities of <hi>Bever</hi> are carried there from other Places beſides this, that will have an Influence upon the Price here, whether you get much or little: I ſhall be glad when the Market will allow of a greater Price, which I ſhall let you know of; and you may depend on it in all Caſes to have ſtrict Juſtice done you: We take Care that the Trade be govern'd as much to your Advantage as may be. You are ſupplied cheaper from us than from the <hi>French,</hi> which is plain, becauſe they buy of us to ſell to you.</p>

It is a great while ſince the Affair happen'd at <hi>Norridgewock,</hi> and I ſhould be glad you had mentioned that Matter before, and then it would have been eaſier to have recover'd thoſe Things than now: Maj <hi>Moulton</hi> is here, who can tell you that the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken at <hi>Norridgewock,</hi> was divided among the Soldiers, Capt. <hi>Parker</hi> has got the Paper you mention, and will be ready to deliver it upon your paying the Price of it: I ſhould be glad you could have any other Things return'd; but our People made but little Account of them, and I believe the moſt of them are loſt.</p>
                  <p>I am well pleaſed that Capt. <hi>Woodſide</hi> of <hi>Maquoit</hi> is kind to you, and I ſhall be glad every Body elſe would be ſo too. When Capt. <hi>Woodſide</hi> does what is good, it is praiſe-worthy in him; but if he breaks the Laws of the Province, he muſt be puniſhed for it.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are now at Peace with all Nations, with the <hi>Dutch, French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and there is no likelihood of War. When any thing looks like a War, I ſhall give you No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and expect the ſame from you as good Friends and Brothers.</p>
                  <p>And if any ſuch thing as a War ſhould happen among the Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> that need not affect us; but we may ſtill be good Friends and Neighbours; and I hope in ſuch Caſe you won't be decoy'd to your Hurt.</p>
                  <p>When you have any Grievance, I invite you to come to <hi>Boſton</hi> ſeaſonably, that ſo you may be redreſs'd before the Thing is grown too old to make it clear, and to find out thoſe that have done you any Wrong.</p>

Capt. <hi>Loron</hi> has deſired of me ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Carpenters, to Build him a Houſe; and I have ordered Capt. <hi>Gyles</hi> to ſend him Men for that Work, who will take Care that he ſhan't be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon in the Price: And if any other Perſons deſire Houſes to be Built, they ſhall alſo be aſſiſted in it.</p>
                  <p>The Sun grows low: To Morrow will be the Lord's Day; If you have any thing further to ſay, I ſhall willingly hear you. If not, I ſhall deliver you the Bounty of the Government, as a Token of Our ſincere Deſire to maintain the Peace: And when that is done, we will Drink King <hi>GEORGE</hi>'s Health; and then I ſhall wiſh you a good Journey to your ſeveral Homes.</p>
