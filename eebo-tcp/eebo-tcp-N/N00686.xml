            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE words are part of a <hi>Sermon</hi> which was Preached by <hi>Paul</hi> an <hi>Antioch,</hi> wherein he demonſtrates the Reſurrection of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by what is written in the 16<hi>th.</hi> Pſalm, where it is ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine Holy One to ſee Corruption.</hi> That muſt needs be meant either of <hi>David</hi> himſelf or of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>: But it cannot be ſo affirmed of <hi>David</hi> himſelf, for ha ſaw Corruption. <hi>Davids</hi> Body had been turned to Duſt in the Grave for ſome Ages before that Time; therefore that paſſage in the Pſalm muſt be meant of Chriſt, whoſe Holy Body did not lie long enough i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dious Hiſtory of the Life and Death of <hi>David.</hi> 1. We have his Life. It was a Life of Service to his own Generation, and that by the Will of God. The Greek word <hi>HUPERETESAS,</hi> here Tranſlated <hi>he had Served,</hi> is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> taken from <hi>Rowers,</hi> who ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot in the ſafe paſſage of the Veſſel. This World is a Sea, the Church is like a Ship toſſed on the Sea, God is the Pilot, by whoſe Skill and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Ship is Steered: He is pleaſed to make uſe of men as <hi>Under-Rowers</hi> to Serve his Providence. Whereas <hi>David</hi> is here ſaid to Serve <hi>his own Generation</hi>; That Expreſſion may imply two things. (1.) That he Served the People who Lived in the ſame Age in which he Lived; for in that ſenſe is the word frequently uſed in the Scripture. No man can do Service for a Generation of men who were gone out of the World before he came into it. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man do Service for thoſe that ſhall come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, after he is gone out of it, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he did whilſt himſelf was here. (2.) A Generation is ſometimes taken for <hi>the Age of one man,</hi> as well as for the men of one Age. Thus when 'tis ſaid, <hi>David</hi> Served his own Generation, this is intended, <hi>ſc.</hi> that as long as he Lived in the World, he continued to Serve thoſe that were his Contemporaries. He Lived to be Seventy years old, and ſo long did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000831_0004_0FAB4064681BFD78"/>
a Servant of his Generation. Moreover, when it is affirmed, that He Served them <hi>by the Will of God,</hi> that may import: (1.) That he fulfilled the Decree of God in that his Service. He did all ths Service which God from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had willed that <hi>David</hi> ſhould do. As no Servant of the Lord can Dy before the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time, ſo neither ſhall he Dy until he has finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that work which God has aſore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that that man ſhall do. Every Servant of God is Immortal, until his work is done. (2.) The Expreſſion imports, that the Precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Will of God was that according to which <hi>David</hi> acted in his Serving his own Generation. As he uſed to Pray that he might know, and that he might do the Will of God. We hear him praying, <hi>Give me Underſtanding,</hi> ſhew me the way wherein I ſhould go, Lord, <hi>Teach me to do thy Will,</hi> ſo he did Practiſe according to his own Prayers. Thus did <hi>David</hi> Live.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have a deſcription of the Death of this Faithful Servant of God, and of his People. (1.) <hi>He fell Aſleep.</hi> That Expreſſion and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Death when applied to Holy men, intimates an happy Death: In this World (as 'tis ſaid of <hi>Judah</hi>) they <hi>find no reſt</hi>; but Death puts an end to all their hard Service and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. (2.) <hi>He was Laid unto his Fathers.</hi> This is true both in reſpect of his Body which was Laid in the Grave, as his Fore fathers who
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000831_0005_0FAB4065F7638CD8"/>
were Dead had been. And in reſpect of his Soul, which which was carried to that Heaven, where his good Father <hi>Jeſſe</hi> (whom the Jews are wont to call <hi>Jeſſai the Righteous</hi>) and his Fore-fathers, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were gone before. Often in the Scripture when men dy, they are ſaid to be <hi>Gathered unto their People</hi>; which Expreſſion implies the Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Soul. At the Hour of Death men paſs out of this World into the World of Souls. (3.) <hi>David ſaw Corruption</hi>; which is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not of his Spirit, but of his Body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That Corruption is in order to a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto a Glorious Incorruption. As Grain, it may chance or Wheat or ſome other Grain, is ſown under the Earth, and then it corrupts, but after that riſeth again with a great addition of beauty; ſo it is as to the Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Saints, they are ſown in Corruption, but raiſed in Incorruption. This may ſerve for the opening of the words.</p>
            <p>The Doctrine from them is,</p>
            <p>That the Grave will be a Bleſſed Bed of Reſt to that man who ſhall Serve his own Generation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God.</p>

Whenas the moſt ſplendid Services not proceeding from theſe principles are of no account. King <hi>Amaziah</hi> did notable things in his Generation, which the Church of God in that age was benefited by. He deſtroyed no leſs than twenty thouſand of their Enemies: but God did not approve of him, becauſe his heart was not rightly principled in what he did. It is noted of him that <hi>he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart.</hi> 2 Chron. 25.2. He wanted faith in Chriſt, &amp; a ſincere love to God in what he did.

That Truth which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in one Age, is Perſecuted in another. There are <hi>Labouring Truths,</hi> which meet with the greateſt oppoſition from Satan and from the World. There is that which is called the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Truth.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.12 In the Apoſtles Dayes, the preſent Truth was, <hi>That Jeſus of Nazareth is the promiſed Meſſiah, the Son of God, and the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World.</hi> The Holy Apoſtles of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by Preaching and Propagating that Glorious Truth throughout the World, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their own Generation according to the Will of God. After that Chriſtianity had prevailed and triumphed over <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> the great Truth moſt oppoſed in the World, was that which concerns the Eternal <hi>Deity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> did ſingular Service for his Generation, in ſtanding up as a Champion for the Truth, when (as that Ancient ſpeaks) the whole World ſighed to ſee it ſelf become an <hi>Arian.</hi> After this, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristianiſm</hi> (that is <hi>Popery</hi>) ſprung up, and got head, and then the Truths which concern the Offices of Chriſt were invaded and violated by the Man of Sin.

and Martyrs, whom the Lord Jeſus has raiſed up in the laſt Ages of the World, who by their Preaching, Writing, and Sufferings, have born witneſs to the Truth relating to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Office of Chriſt, in aſſerting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and fulneſs of the Scripture, againſt all Traditions and Canons deviſed by men; and to the Prieſtly Office of Chriſt, in maintaining Juſtifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Truths of this Age wherein it has been the Will of God that our Lot ſhould be caſt, are thoſe which concern the Kingly Office and Power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. That He is the only Head of his Church: That no Officers, no Ordinances, no Sacraments, or Religious Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies ought to be there, beſides what Chriſt himſelf has appointed. And as ſuch as theſe are the Truths of the Age, ſo in a very ſpecial manner of the place wherein the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has caſt our Lot to be. What was it that our Fathers came into this Wilderneſs for? It was pure Conſcience to the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that brought them hither. It was that ſo they might build Sanctuaries for the Name of the Lord. It was, that ſo they might meaſure the Temple according to the Golden Rule of the Scripture. It was with reſpect unto Purity

as to all Church Adminiſtrations, that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lord into a Land which was not Sown. Wherefore notwithſtanding too many of <hi>this Generation,</hi> who are lamentably Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Principles and Spirit or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Grandfathers, will rage at it, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily do a better Service, than to withſtand Innovations which would prove fatal to the Churches, and to the Intereſt of Chriſt's Holy Kingdom among them.

It is ſaid, (Cant. 8.8.) <hi>We have a little Siſter that has no Breaſt, what ſhall we do for her!</hi> So there are little places (and ſome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ones too) in <hi>New-England,</hi> that have no Breaſts, no Miniſters from whom they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſincere milk of the Word. What ſhall be done for them? There are ſome eſpecially in this Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> who have Contributed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally unto ſo good a Work, by which they
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000831_0031_0FAB410AE9B805F0"/>
have done a real Service for Chriſt, and for the Souls of men, and ſo it will be acknowledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day. In taking yet further care, as for the Goſpellizing of <hi>Heathen Indians,</hi> ſo of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Engliſh,</hi> we ſhall do an acceptable Service in our Generation. Let me alſo ſay, That the Welfare both of this preſent, and of ſucceeding Generations, is very much concerned in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the <hi>Colledge,</hi> which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence muſt flow thoſe Streams which will make glad the City of God. By taking care that the Government thereof be confirmed in faithful hands, that will tranſmit it unto ſuch Succeſſors; we may be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to make Generations happy. Whoever ſhall be inſtrumental in obtaining ſo great a Good, will do a ſingular Service both for the preſent, and After Generations. What a doleful Caſe had <hi>New-England</hi> been in before this day, had it not been for that Bleſſed Nurſery, almoſt all the Churches being ſupplied from thence. Nor do I know wherein I or any man can do a greater Service for this Generation, than by taking effectual care that the <hi>Tutors</hi> there be ſuch as ſhall make Conſcience to Eſtabliſh the Young Scholars in thoſe Holy Principles of Truth, for a Teſtimony whereunto their Bleſſed Fathers came into this Wilderneſs, and for the Defence and Propagation whereof they Erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Colledge</hi> here.</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:000831_0032_0FAB410BAA6637B0"/>But thus for Anſwer to the Caſe propoſed.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall ſay by way of <hi>Application</hi> is only this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We ſee that no Eminency of Uſefulneſs can keep men out of the Grave.</hi> A <hi>David</hi> that Serveth his Generation with the greateſt induſtry and fidelity, muſt fall aſleep, and ſee Corruption. When his work is done, he muſt go to Reſt in the Bed of the Grave; and a ſweet Reſt and Repoſe will it be. It is ſaid of Merciful men, &amp; Righteous men; yea, of Serviceable <hi>Joſias</hi>'s, that they <hi>Enter into Peace.</hi> So they do at the Hour of Death in reſpect of their Souls, and <hi>they ſhall reſt in their Beds,</hi> namely in reſpect o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And truly, every year does ſadly confirm the Truth of what you hear. Have we not ſeen very Afflicting Inſtances of it in the year that is paſt. Look over into <hi>London,</hi> and we ſhall ſee that eminently Faithful and Uſeful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, are lately removed from thence. I forbear to ſpeak of a Brother of mine, who had his Education in this <hi>Colledge,</hi> and after that Served his Generation in the Work of the Goſpel for the ſpace of Forty Seven Years in <hi>England, Holland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and now he is Fallen aſleep. But there is Bleſſed <hi>Anſtey, Cole, James, Vincent,</hi> all within this twelve-month Gone to <hi>the Spirits of Juſt men made perfect</hi>; and a little before them, <hi>Buris, Fincher, Laurence, Mayo,</hi> theſe were all Eminent Miniſters of Chriſt. And I have the rather mentioned them becauſe I had not long ſince a dear Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with them all. One ſuch ſtroke ſeldom goes alone. An ingenious Writer on occaſion of many Miniſters Dying in the ſame year, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>That when a Generation of Contemporary perſons begins to Crack, it quickly falls. The Leaſes of their Earthly Cottage Commencing at the ſame date, oft at the ſame Term Expire.</hi> And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that Twenty years ago, an Eminent Perſon in <hi>London,</hi> ſent me a Catalogue of no leſs then Forty Two Miniſters belonging to that City,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000831_0034_0FAB410D2A4E4E98"/>
who Dyed in the ſpace of about ten years. But we need not look ſo far off as <hi>London</hi> for a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Verification of the Truth before us, ſince amongſt our ſelves in leſs then half a year, beſides ſeveral young Miniſters, three others of principal Note, and Uſe, are Laid in the Grave. In the Neighbouring Colony, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſince than the laſt month, that Serviceable <hi>Hooker,</hi> (who was the worthy Son of a moſt worthy Father) is gone to his Reſt. He was eminently Uſeful on more accounts than one. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt had made him a Pillar in the Temple of his God: (And without Envy be it ſpoken) there is not a greater Pillar remaining in all the Houſe of God throughout that Juriſdiction. The Churches there are all weakned by his Fall, The manner of his Death was very much like unto that of our Precious and forever famous <hi>Juel,</hi> whom Death found in the Pulpit Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Congregation at <hi>Lacock</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> I obſerve that many Super eminent Miniſters of the Goſpel have dyed ſuddenly: So Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> the never to be forgotten Teacher of <hi>this Boston:</hi> And in <hi>England</hi> of late years; Mr <hi>Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000831_0035_0FAB410DEB764438"/>
dyed ſuddenly. It was an honour and a favour from God to them, that they were <hi>found ſo doing.</hi> Mr <hi>Capel,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> (that Eminent Servant of his Generation, who was the Son of famous Doctor <hi>Gouge,</hi> and in Exemplary Piety not inferiour to his Father (all theſe (honourable men of God) dyed in their ſleep, on a Lords day night: Thus did they fall aſleep after they had Served their Generation according to the will of God: What hapned to them was more like a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> than a <hi>Death.</hi> Such a Death as theirs was, and as our <hi>Hookers</hi> was, is ſometimes a ſign of Gods ſpecial Love to his Servants, but of his Anger kindled againſt that People, out of whoſe hands he has ſnatched his Jewels. But we ſee then that the deareſt Servants of Chriſt are Subject to the arreſts of Death. Yea, if we look into this very Congregation, we ſee it, one that often ſpoke in the Name of the Lord from this Pulpit, and (as I take it) the words which I am now upon, were the laſt which he Preached on in this Place; ſix months ago he Reſted from all his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. God made him very Serviceable, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that part of the Country where for the greateſt part of his Time, he had Served his Generation. <hi>Portſmouth</hi> oweth more than a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his Memory. No longer ſince then the laſt Week, another Faithful Ambaſſador of Chriſt is called Home, who if he had been Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000831_0036_0FAB410EA99AF0A0"/>
and in Health, ſhould have ſpoken in the Name of the Lord here this day. It is ſaid in Prov. 10.7. <hi>the memory of the Juſt is bleſſed,</hi> which words the Jews conſtantly apply to their Dead Deceaſed Friends that have been of eminent Uſe among them. The Seventy Greek Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters expreſs it by ſaying. The Memory of the Juſt is <hi>[met enkomione] with Praiſes.</hi> It is not my work this day ſo much to Praiſe the Dead, as to Inſtruct the Living: Nor ſhall I enlarge on his Character of whom you heard many things the laſt Lecture. Only I muſt ſay of him, as is here ſaid of David, <hi>He Served his Generation according to the will of God.</hi> He was truly a very faithful Servant of God. Conſidered as a Chriſtian. He kept a ſtrick Watch over the frame of his own heart every day. If he had hapned to ſpeak but ſo much as one unprofitable word, ſo tender was his Conſcience as that he would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely reflect upon it, and mourn before the Lord in Secret, afore he ſlept that night. He was of a Peaceable temper; and would do any thing which he thought was not repugnant to the will of God, rather than make a Schiſm in a Church of Chriſt. Conſidered as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he was Eminently Faithful and Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. God honoured him, in making him one of the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> of theſe laſt dayes. The Spirit of a <hi>Martyr</hi> was in him. He endured a ſore
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000831_0037_0FAB410F9DBF2878"/>
Impriſonment in <hi>Limrick</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for his bearing witneſs unto <hi>the preſent Truth,</hi> which the Lord would have his Servants in this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to ſtand up for. And on that account (as our Fathers, &amp; we our ſelves, ſome of us did) he became Subject unto a Voluntary Exile into theſe goings down of the Sun. I have been informed, that the unhappy man, who was the chief Inſtrument and Inſtigator of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Limrick,</hi> was afterwards himſelf by the Papiſts made a Priſoner there, and that then he Cryed out in horror; <hi>This miſery is come upon me, for my cauſing</hi> Mr. Baily <hi>to be caſt into Priſon.</hi> When his Miniſtry found great acceptance in the World, his Soul would tremble leſt haply his <hi>Reward</hi> ſhould be (like that of the Phariſees) only a <hi>Reputation</hi> amongſt men in this World. His very heart was ingaged in deſires and endeavours to promote the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Souls: And God made him Eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Succeſsful therein. There are many who will bleſs God to Eternity, that ever they knew him: And at the day of Judgment (which the Lord haſten) we ſhall no doubt ſee verified in him that Scripture in <hi>Daniel,</hi> where it is laid, <hi>They that turn many to Righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>
