            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT having been my lot to fall in among the <hi>Quakers</hi> whom I always obſerved in their Preachings to Extoll themſelves, telling what God had done for them, and that he had bleſſed them above all other People and Profeſſions, whom they called <hi>The People of the world,</hi> but themſelves. <hi>The People of God, The peculiar People of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. which made me think my ſelf happy in being among them, and did not much enquire after the Principles and Doctrines of Chriſtianity profeſſed and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Church of England</hi> and other Chriſtian Profeſſions, thinking my ſelf well enough; but about the year <hi>1691.</hi> when <hi>G. Keith</hi> began to Preach Zealouſly the Faith of <hi>Chriſt Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and finding them to oppoſe him therein, I ſet my ſelf to Examine the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books, and compare them with the holy Scriptures, and finding them Inconſiſtent therewith, and many of them Contradictory one to the other, I thought it my Duty to let others know the ſame, that were ignorant, wherefore I collected many of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſound and Erroneous Doctrines and Principles contained in their printed Books and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them in a Book, Entituled, <hi>News of a Trumpet Sounded in the Wilderneſs,</hi> which had good acceptance in <hi>America,</hi> and alſo in <hi>England,</hi> where it was Reprinted, and in <hi>Holland</hi> it was Tranſlated and printed in <hi>Dutch.</hi> About a year and half after it was publiſhed there comes out a pretended anſwer, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Satans Harbinger,</hi> ſigned by one <hi>Caleb Puſey,</hi> a Miller in <hi>Pennſilvania.</hi> No ſooner had I began to read his anſwer but I found ſeveral Lyes, Perverſions, &amp;c. therein, and particularly I found that he charged me Several times with belying and abuſing <hi>W. Penn,</hi> for quoting his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> where he calls
<pb facs="unknown:001113_0003_0FB042746091DC30"/>
               <hi>Chriſt the finite Impotent Creature,</hi> Whereupon I writ a Challenge to this <hi>C. P.</hi> to meet him at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> or <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington,</hi> and to chuſe <hi>four</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> perſons (not <hi>Quakers</hi>) to judge Whether or no <hi>W. P.</hi> called <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>finite Impotent Creature?</hi> propoſing that if I had belyed or abuſed <hi>W. P.</hi> therein, I would print and publiſh a Paper of Condemnation, as <hi>C. Puſey</hi> ſhould order me but if I had truly quoted <hi>W. P.</hi> then <hi>C. Puſey</hi> ſhould print and publiſh ſuch a paper of Condemnation, as I ſhould order him, for abuſing me. Now this paper lay a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time in the Printers hands before it was printed, and when it came to <hi>Philadelphia</hi> I was removed from my Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Burlington</hi> to <hi>Egg-harbour,</hi> which is near Eighty Miles, and <hi>C. P.</hi> get the ſaid paper before me, and took he advantage to pul a Trick upon me, by ſending me a Letter dated the 6 of October, to meet him within ten days after the date of that Letter, and ſeven of the ſaid ten days being expired before I received his Letter, it was almoſt impoſſible for me to prepare my ſelf and come near 80 miles and end the buſineſs, and all in three days time; or elſe he had ſome baſe Deſign upon me. Therefore in my <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack</hi> for the Year <hi>1701.</hi> I Renewed my Challenge to him, and appointed the <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>May</hi> to meet him at <hi>Burlington</hi> to refer the matter to ſome judicious meen (not <hi>Quakers</hi>) <hi>Whether or no</hi> W. P.<hi>calls the Manhood of Chriſt the finite Impotent Creature?</hi> Accordingly I came to <hi>Burlington</hi> the ſaid <hi>12th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> to meet this Champion <hi>C. P.</hi> but inſtead of coming himſelf he ſends a Printed Pamphlet, wherein he pretends to quote <hi>W. P's</hi> words, but deceitfully leaves out that Paragraph where the words <hi>Son of God, Chriſt as man, &amp;c.</hi> was, and tells that W. P. means it of as ſinners, and not of Chriſt. And therefore I have quoted <hi>W. P's</hi> words as they ſtand in his book, called, Sandy Foundation, <hi>p. 20 21.</hi> that people may judge whether I have wronged <hi>W. P.</hi> or not. Which is as follows.</p>

               <hi>W. P.</hi>'s Sandy Foundation, p. 16. begins thus; <hi>The vulgar Doctrine of Satisfaction being dependent on the ſecond Perſon of the imagin'd Trinity, Refuted, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <q>THat Man having tranſgreſs'd the Righteous Law of God and ſo expos'd to the penalty of eternal Wrath, it's altogether impoſſible for God to remit or forgive without a Plenary Satisfaction; and that there was no other way by which God could obtain Satisfaction, or ſave men, than by inflicting the penalty of infinite wrath and vengeance on Jeſus Chriſt the Second Perſon of the Trinity, who for ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, hath wholly born and paid it, <hi>(whether for all or but ſome)</hi> to the offended infinite juſtice of his Father.</q>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. THat God is gracious to forgive, and yet impoſſible for him, unleſs the Debt be fully ſatisfied.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Finite and Impotent Creature,</hi> is more capable of extending Mercy and Forgiveneſs, than the Infinite and Omnipotent Creator.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That God ſo loved the World, he gave his only Son to ſave it;</hi> and yet that God ſtood off in high diſpleaſure, and Chriſt gave
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001113_0005_0FB04275F2DD2DE0"/>himſelf to God as a compleat ſatisfaction to his offended Juſtice; with many more ſuch like groſs Conſequences that might be drawn.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Refuted from right Reaſon.</head>
               <p>But if we ſhould grant a Scripture ſilence as to the neceſſity of Chriſt's ſatisfying his Fathers Juſtice, yet ſo manifeſt would be the Contradictions, and foul the Repugnances to right Reaſon, that who had not vail'd his underſtanding with the dark ſuggeſtions of unwarrantable Tradition, or contracted his Judgment to the implicit apprehenſions of ſome over-valued acquaintance, might with great facility diſcriminate to a full reſolve in this point; for admitting God to be a Creditor, or he to whom the Debt ſhould be paid, and Chriſt he that ſatisfies or payes it on the behalf of man, the Debtor, this queſtion will ariſe, Whether he paid that Debt, as God, Man, or both (to uſe their own terms.)</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Not as God.</head>
               <p n="1">1. In that it divides the Unity of the God-head by two diſtinct Acts, of being Offended, and not Offended; of condemning Juſtice, and redeeming Mercy of requiring a ſatisfaction, and then paying of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if Chriſt payes the Debt as God, then the Father and the Spirit being God, they alſo pay the Debt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Since God is to be ſatisfied, and that Chriſt is God, he conſequently is to be ſatisfied; and who ſhall ſatisfie his infinite Juſtice?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But if Chriſt has ſatisfied God the Father, Chriſt being alſo God, 'twill follow then that he has ſatisfied himſelf, (which can't be.)</p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſince God the Father was once to be ſatisfied, and that it's impoſſible he ſhould do it himſelf, nor yet the Son or Spirit, becauſe the ſame God; it naturally follows that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001113_0006_0FB04276C215B100"/>the Debt remains unpaid, and theſe Satisfactioniſts thus far are ſtill at a loſs.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Not as Man.</head>
               <p n="6">6. The Juſtice offended, being Infinite his Satisfaction ought to bear a proportion therewith, which Jeſus Chriſt, as Man, could never pay, he being FINITE, and from a Finite cauſe could not proceed an infinite effect; for ſo man may be ſaid to bring forth God, ſince nothing below the Divinity it ſelf can rightly be ſtiled Infinite.</p>

For where two mediums, or middle Propoſitions, are ſingly inconſiſtent with the nature of the end for which they were at firſt propounded, their conjunction rather does augment than leſſen the difficulty of its accompliſhment; and this I am perſwaded muſt be obvious to every unbyaſ'd underſtanding. Thus far W. P.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>Now here you ſee in his <hi>6th</hi> Paragraph he (in expreſs words) ſays, <hi>Chriſt, as Man, was FINITE;</hi> and if <hi>Finite,</hi> conſequently Weak and Impotent in making ſatisfaction for mens ſin, which is the only thing W. P. here is Refuting. But <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> in his Pamphlet did not quote this, This did not ſuit his turn, No, This would have diſcovered his Knavery under his Cloak, and laid him too open; he thought it his ſafeſt way to leave the explaining part out, and quote only that paſſage where <hi>Finite Impotent Creature</hi> is named, and not the words, <hi>Son of God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt as Man,</hi> that he might make weak People believe, by his puzeling Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, that W. P. meant ſome other things: He alſo tells a deceitfull ſtory of three diſtinct Heads, p. 19. as if <hi>W. P.</hi> wanted this Millers help to draw his matter into Heads and Tails. A thing never done nor intended by W. P. for all
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001113_0007_0FB04277DB751938"/>
who have Eyes may ſee, 'tis only three Abſurdities that <hi>W. P.</hi> draws up againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſatisfying the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Juſtice of God.</p>
               <p>Now I doubt not but by this time all underſtanding men, except Quakers, plainly ſee that <hi>W. P's</hi> only ſubject there is to refute the doctrine of ſatisfaction made by the ſecon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity. Nay, <hi>Quakers</hi> too ſee it as plain as the Noſe of a mans face, who do but lay aſide their Religion, and take up Right Reaſon for one minuites time.</p>
               <p>And though I could never believe <hi>C. Puſey</hi> would accept my Challenge, yet I preſented my ſelf at <hi>Burlington</hi> the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> laſt, where he ſent his Pamphlet inſtead of appearing in perſon, ſo that 'tis apparent that his Letter to me at <hi>Egg-harbour,</hi> to accept my Challenge, was only a cowardly ſham, at beſt; for elſe, why could he not as well have allowed me three Weeks time as three dayes? and why cannot he meet me now in ſix Months time, that I gave him, as well as in three dayes then, if his deſign had been honeſt? Nay, he makes it appear in his Pamphlet, that his intentions were deceitfull, and only to mock me, for in p 17. he lets me know, that his deſign was to chuſe <hi>Quakers,</hi> which is contrary to the Terms of my Challenge: This he kept hid from me in his blind Letter, where he tells me, he accepts my Challenge; yet now he lets me know he never intended to accept it.</p>
               <p>But this was only to kidnap me, for they had provided a better argument for me, if they could have got me thither while <hi>W. P.</hi> was amongſt them, even a Priſon, their beſt argument of all; for at a Caball of them at the houſe of <hi>S Carpenter,</hi> where <hi>W. P.</hi> dwelt, one of their Juſtices, (<hi>viz. S. Richardſon</hi> by name) was heard to ſay, <hi>He would lay this</hi> Leeds <hi>in Goal for his Scribbling if he could meet him there</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia</hi>) and doubtleſs <hi>W. P's</hi> influence
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001113_0008_0FB0427837932088"/>
would have extended this argument to <hi>Burlington</hi> too; and this, a Friend gave me notice of, not long before, who heard this <hi>S. R.</hi> ſpeak thoſe words: I'll not be ungratefull to name the perſon at preſent, to expoſe my evidence to the Rage and Fury of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> there is a time for all things.</p>
               <p>And thus far is the baſeneſs of <hi>C P's</hi> deſign diſcovered; and let him laugh it out for vexations, if he pleaſe. — Mean time, I think it as lawful for me to ſhun the Malice of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as that <hi>Paul</hi> fled from the Malice of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let me a litle examine his Pamphlet, as to the point in Controverſie; for I deſign to be brief, Therefore I think to paſs by the reſt of his ſtuff; yet I will ingage to prove, when need requires, that every page, (in anſwer to me, is ſtuft with Perverſions, Lyes, Abuſes or Slanders. And in the caſe about the Eſtate of <hi>T. Croſs</hi> he is deceitful, and baſe in writing that I expoſed him in print before I demanded it of him, whom as I demanded it by <hi>R. Toung,</hi> my Wifes Father, who brought me his anſwer, and is ready to teſtify it to the face of him. But he writes like a <hi>Quaker,</hi> therefore it doth not much move me.</p>
               <p>But as to the point in hand, I perceive he is in pain about it; for he labours hard, and as the Maxim is, <hi>Who ſo labours to prove a thing to another, himſelf diſtruſts it?</hi> And at laſt I find it ſo, for he falls a few Coggs lower, even to a confeſſion of my Charge; for though he denyes that <hi>W. P.</hi> held <hi>Chriſt as Man to be a Finite Impotent Creature,</hi> yet in P. 25 he in effect confeſſes it, as if he were Mumbling of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And becauſe he had called it a blaſphemous Charge in me, ſo to affirm of <hi>W. P.</hi> therefore he blunders at it, and will needs thruſt in the Prieſts along with W P. as holding the ſame, <hi>Both the Prieſts and</hi> W. P. <hi>did own</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001113_0009_0FB0427906C53720"/>
Chriſt as man was Finite.</hi> Nay, in P. 26. he brings <hi>G. Keith</hi> in too, as holding Chriſt as Man to be a Creature, and then he adds, <hi>ſurely nothing created can be either Infinite or Omnipotent.</hi> Here now he grants, that if Chriſt, as Man be Created, he muſt needs be a <hi>Finite Impotent Creature;</hi> yea, he is very willing we ſhould know, that if it be falſe Doctrine, that <hi>G. K.</hi> and the Prieſts are of that faith, but loath he is that <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſhould be ſaid to hold ſo But alas! this is a ſhameful begging of the Queſtion; for I never denyed or diſputed this point; I know Perſons of ſeveral Societies of <hi>Chriſtans</hi> (as well as <hi>W. P.</hi>) hold Chriſt, as Man, to be <hi>Finite</hi> and <hi>Impotent,</hi> but as God, <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and I dare not call it Blaſphemy ſo to affirm, as he has ignorantly and raſhly done; 'tis a point beyond my capacity to determine, whether it be Orthodox or not. The point between <hi>Caleb Puſey</hi> and me, is not whether the Doctrine be True or falſe, but Whether W. P. holds ſo or not; nor did I ever bring it againſt W. P. as falſe Doctrine, but as Contradictory to other of his and his Brethrens Books.</p>
               <p>Hence now may be ſeen what ſort of ſtuff the reſt of his Book is; for I propoſed this as the Rule and Touchſtone of Tryal between us, to try the reſt of his Book by, This being by him reputed a Capital, or the Cheif Article or Crime againſt me, which now he dare not ſhow his head to vindicate, but on the contrary has at laſt (with a blundering unwillingneſs) confeſſed it, as by me charged; and now I expect he muſt again open his Muſter-Rool of Rattles and Nonſenſe and compoſe another Book in anſwer to this, that when his Neighbours tell him of this, he may ſtop their voyces, by ſaying, he has or will anſwer it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Whereas he inſinuates, p. 17. <hi>That I would take
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001113_0010_0FB04279AD2F3708"/>
men of my own party to judge of the caſe, but ty him from Chuſing of his Party.</hi> But this is a falſe inſinuation, I never deſigned to take men of my own Party, nor can any ſuch thing be gathered from any words in my Challenge; ſo that this is a Quibbling Evaſion, like the reſt.</p>
               <p>I obſerve he tells, p. 12. <hi>That</hi> W. P. ſays, <hi>'tis a horrid Abuſe put on him;</hi> but if W. P. ſays ſo, 'tis evident that he ſpeaks it not as a Man or a Gentleman, but as a <hi>Quaker,</hi> &amp; his Religion obliges him to ſay it. For Why? the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay the ſame in their anſwer to G. K's broad Sheet of about Fifty Quotations out of their Books, which though eight Miniſters have atteſted to the truth of them and my ſelf by comparing the Quotations have certain knowledge they are true, yet they boldly call them horrid Lyes: So that what Truth is it that in ſuch caſes they will not call horrid Lyes? Hence I appeal to all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> Whether ſuch men are fit judges in their own caſes? and whether by theſe ſore of Writings, Sayings and Unſayings, &amp;c. of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> they do not make the whole body of Chriſtians look <hi>Black and Odious</hi> (to uſe C. P's Terms) <hi>in the eyes of Runigadoes, Julian Apostates, Scavengers, Atheists, Infidels, Turks and Jews?</hi> Though indeed theſe are the terms that <hi>C. P.</hi> in his Pamphlet, from his modeſt <hi>Quaker Property</hi> beſtows on me, and on thoſe who have been ſo kind to him (it ſeems) as to anſwer his Call, in ſhewing him and his (pretended Perfect) Brethren their Sin and Imperfection. But enough of this, leaſt I move him to call for the Names of more of his Unclean Tribe, next time he Prints.</p>
