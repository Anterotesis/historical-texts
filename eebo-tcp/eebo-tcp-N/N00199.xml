            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THat these Churches once flourished, with much spiritual prosperity, under a glorious dispensation of the Spirit and grace of God, by the saving administrations of his word and worship, and that with full demonstration of his special grace and favour; we ought to commemorate, unto his praise and glory, and our own present shame and confusion. That now we are a people in extream danger of perishing, in our own sins and under Gods Judgements, (unless God shall please in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way, of Soveraign mercy to save us) is the most humbling consideration of our present sad condition. That all ordinary means (in that extraordinary way of improvement which God hath of late set us under) have been altogether ineffectual, unto a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and saving work of reformation; makes it (at least) a fearful que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether our degeneracy and apostacy may not prove Judicial, and so perpetual; a question which will not admit of a comfortable resolution, <hi>until God shall pour out his Spirit from on high upon us.</hi> That Soveraign promise of the donation, and effusion of the Spirit, and so of the dispensation of saving grace (as it hath been unto the Churches in all Ages, under their deepest defection,) So it is unto us the main stay of our faith, confidence, and comfort, and that which gives some present reviving, unto our languishing hope; of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion in these Churches. That God doth at present so far suspend the accomplishment of this promise, and so far with hold his Spirit and grace, it is, the just, yet most dreadful punishment of that most sinful abuse of it; and general unprofitableness under the means of grace, and of that resisting his Spirit; and rejecting his Son by unbelief and disobedience unto the Gospel which is found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, and is sadly signal of the gradual cessation of the work of Conversion, and of the further execution of Gods wrath, both by external and spiritual plagues and Judgements. How much that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

work doth already fail; the decaying and dying state of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of these Churches, doth evidence by woful instance and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, there being little more left, then <hi>a name to live, and those thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which remain so ready to dye;</hi> That so many sinners, do seem to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up Judicially, unto the still growing, and prevailing sins of the times, which both in their nature and working are so utterly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the progress of the work of Conversion, doth make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our present case much the more lamentable: especially-considering that such sinners do remain under a secret, soveraign in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Gods vindictive Justice; whence the word in the Ministry is become <hi>a savour of death unto death in them that perish.</hi> What remains then; but that we do most enixly endeavour; (in whatsoever we may, or can possibly) to approve our selves a people more hopeful; as to Conversion, Reformation, and Salvation; labouring practically, and savingly to understand, <hi>even we at least in this our day the</hi> great <hi>things</hi> of our temporal, spiritual, and eternal <hi>peace,</hi> and welfare, least they should be <hi>hidden from our eyes, because we know not this time of our visitation.</hi> How is it then the most important concernment of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted sinners, to take heed unto themselves, that they do not (as heretofore) hinder their own Conversion, by abusing and loosing their special day and seasons of grace, or by yielding up their Souls unto the power of sin and Satan, in those wayes of sinning, wherein their hearts will be hardned against the power and working of the word, and Spirit of God, unto positive unbelief and disobedience, unto the Gospel, against light, and so by giving up themselves unto deep secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in their unregeneracy, and unto spiritual Apostacy, from that common grace which they may have received and that past <hi>ordinary</hi> hope of recovery, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, to 8. But that sinners do redeem <hi>this present time</hi> unto a constant attendance upon the Ministry of the word; and a most diligent improvement of all means of grace, and operations of the Spirit, crying earnestly unto God, and waiting instantly upon him for the application of Christ, and salvation in a saving work of grace; and that under a sense of their extream necessity thereof, crying out as they <hi>when prickt in their heart,</hi> Act 2. 31. <hi>what shall we do?</hi> and as he. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30. <hi>what must I do to be saved?</hi> How severely also then are all such persons to be reproved and warned, as the most dangerous, destructive Enemyes, unto both the temporal and spiritual welfare, and prosperity of this people, and of these Churches, seeking the utter

ruine and destruction both of the present, and succeeding generations; who make it their business, to hinder, obstruct, yea, utterly to destroy the work of Conversion, by upholding the sins of the times, opposing the dutyes of the times, corrupting the Souls of others, with error, heresy, libertinisme, and licentiousness, weakning the hearts and hands of those who labour in the work of Christ, for the salvation of Souls, by all means crossing and counter working the whole work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: such do declare themselves to be <hi>full of all mischief, Children of the Devil, and Enemies of all righteousness, Act.</hi> 13. 10. &amp; incurre that woe pronounced by our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

Therefore all those who would approve themselves to be true friends to the work of Christ in the promotion of his Kingdome, the propagation of Religion, and the Salvation of Souls, ought to labour most intensly in their several places, by all means with all their might to promote converting work, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally amongst the Rising Generations: Godly parents &amp; Masters, heads of Families, by the constant exercise of the worship of God; in the life and power of it, by dayly instructions; admonitions, and all kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education, by the right, and full improvement of Family go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, training up Children and Servants <hi>in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord,</hi> and this with sincere desire, and fervent prayer, for their Conversion.

It is much for our encouragement that in this our perishing condition, God hath by his Spirit in the Ministry of many of his Servants, proposed this great promise; expressing his own gratious disposition to open and apply it, in the saving grace and blessing of it, and withal pressed us, from the consideration of inevitable destruction, without a full and perfect sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the application of it and furnished us with all Arguments of faith, to labour and prevail with him in prayer for the obtainment of it: which also is the more solemnly observable, in that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially ordered the labours of divers of his Servants, in this <hi>same great</hi> and most necessary subject to be published at this time, as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony unto this Generation, what their main work and duty is; whereby <hi>he hath shewed us what is good, and what it is that the Lord doth require at our hands.</hi> God grant that it may not be rejected, and so be left upon Record, as a Testimony against this Generation to condemn it, the more deeply, under the aggravated guilt of total &amp; final Apostacy.</p>
            <p>The Reverend and worthy Author of these Sermons, having been through the abundant grace of God sanctified, and seperated from his youth, unto the Ministry, he hath had a more early call into that work, wherein he hath been more happy then most of his fellow Servants; and being himself coae<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

first ripe fruits of this young Generation; his Soul hath laboured, and doth labour, with the more fervency, of holy and sincere love to, and zeal for, the salvation of their Souls: modesty and humility being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him as gifts, both of nature and grace, it would be too much an injury to him, to give his work deserved commendation: It shall therefore suffice to say, that the powerful and (we hope) saving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression which it had in the ministration of it, upon the hearts of the hearers, is a Testimony of divine approbation and commendation: the suitableness and seasonableness of the Subject unto <hi>this</hi> time, and the necessity of <hi>this</hi> people, the copiousness, and (yet withal) conciseness of the method (it being expressive of so much of the general message which God is sending unto his people, and of that which the Spirit is now speaking unto these Churches in so few Sermons) doth render it the more fit, and useful for the publick. The motion of the Spirit of God upon the hearts of those pious and judicious hearers, who have (we believe) been thereby moved with a godly zeal for the saving good of the Generation to desire, request, and undertake for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of it; doth promise it Patronage from Heaven. The special promised presence of our Lord Jesus with this his Servant, for his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in the Ministry of his word, as also in the whole course of his ministration, is a singular token, and pledge of his special grace and favour, unto that pretious Church in, and unto which he is called to minister. The Lord make them more and more thankful, profitable, and fruitful, and prosper his work with them, granting unto them more clear and full discoveries of his mind and will concerning their duty in order thereunto, <hi>that they may stand more perfect and compleat in all the will of God;</hi> and be more fully replenished with his spiritual and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious presence; <hi>inriched</hi> with all the gifts and graces of his Spirit, &amp; setled (together with all our Churches) under the saving dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of grace, strengthned unto sted fast perseverance, in the faith, obedience, and order of the Gospel; unto the end.

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter there is a Prophesy of the righteous and prosperous reign of a <hi>King,</hi> whose Subjects shall live in a comfortable and happy condition under his government, things and persons shall be called by their right names, a wicked man shall be called a wicked man, a good man owned for a good man, and every one treated rightly and all things managed righteously, every person and thing handled accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their true merits, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>to</hi> 9. And this <hi>King</hi> is by some ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> Engl. Annot. But by others <hi>Christ,</hi> under whose reign especially all these things are accomplished. <hi>Jun. in loc.</hi> Christ does indeed alwayes rule, but there is at some times a more eminent and powerful administration of his Kingdome, wherein there is a more visible and plenary fulfilling of the things here spoken of, and to some such time may this Prophesy have respect.</p>
            <p>In the latter part of the Chapter the Prophet discourseth of those troubles that were to come upon the Land of his People, before their establishment in and under the prosperity formerly described.</p>
            <p>And 1. He begins with a solemn warning and Exhortation to all secure careless ones to be awakened by their misery coming, and to break off their evil courses, and to betake themselves to humiliation,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000259_0009_0FA410A6E3F04588"/>
lamentation, and so to Reformation, if thereby they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or at least moderate the Judgement impending over them. Ver. 9, to 13. <hi>Rise up ye Women that are at ease, hear my voice ye careless daughters, give ear unto my Speech: Many dayes and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless Women,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tremble ye Women that are at ease,</hi> &amp;c. Would careless secure Men and Women be awakened by warnings given, much of their sorrow might be diverted. Had we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and foolish People in New-England been wise in season, and taken those solemn warnings have been given us much of that sorrow and misery which we have felt, and do feel in War, sickness, and other shakings might have been escaped. 2. He declares (seeing they had not by Repentance diverted Gods Anger, but were secure) their set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement under a dispensation of Judgement, and the continuance and process of their miseryes to a determined period, at which there should be a great turn and change of Gods dispensations towards them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>to</hi> 19. <hi>read.</hi> 3. In the two last Verses, whether read by themselves, or joyned with the foregoing, he describes the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness and security both of their persons, and enjoyments, upon and for whom this change is wrought, however it fare with others: when sorrows come down upon others they shall be secured. The expressions here used being probably metaphorical. <hi>Vide Sanctium in Pol. Synop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text we have 1. A declaration of the settlement of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under a dispensation of Judgement, and the process of Judgements and miseries upon them. How troubles &amp; sorrows should come, grow upon &amp; overspread them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Upon the Land of my People shall come up Thorns &amp; Briars] Thorns &amp; Bryars</hi> may be here taken <hi>literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp; so the expression denotes the great devastation &amp; depopulation should be made in the Land. They may also be taken <hi>metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> as Ezek. 28. 24. <hi>There shall be no more a pricking Brier to the house of Israel, nor any grieving Thorn of all that are round about them.</hi> So that by <hi>Thorns and Briars coming up upon the Land,</hi> we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand pricking, grieving, pinching, and disquieting troubles falling upon the Inhabitants of the Land. <hi>Upon all the houses of joy]</hi> They are called <hi>houses of joy,</hi> because they were at present full of mirth and merriment in them, as misdoubting no trouble near, <hi>Eng. Annot. in loc.</hi> And upon all these should sorrow come: Their troubles should spread among, and over them universally, and take away their mirth and turn it into mourning. <hi>In the Joyous City] City,</hi> in a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive

Sense, for <hi>Cityes,</hi> the several Cityes throughout the whole Land of Judah. <hi>Annot.</hi> And these were <hi>joyous or revelling Cityes,</hi> given to ease, delight and pleasure, abounding with much Luxury, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, joy and revelling should be followed with distress. <hi>Because the Palaces shall be forsaken, the multitude of the City shall be left,]</hi> There should be great desolations made in the places of their dwellings both for conveniency and delight: And great diminution of their numbers, mortality and misery lighting upon them. <hi>The Forts and Towers shall be for Dens.]</hi> Their places of strength, munition, defence and safeguard being deserted and lying waste, should become Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Dens for wild Beasts to lye down in. <hi>For ever,]</hi> or, for a long time, As the word (<hi>Gnolam</hi>) is often used. <hi>Designat conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuationem vel durationem non perpetuam semper, sed long am &amp; non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptam per aliquod tempus, &amp; continuatam ad insignem aliquam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odum.

A Joy of Wild Asses]</hi> These and other wild Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should range, run at large, play and disport themselves there, where sometimes dwellings and Castles were. <hi>A Pasture of Flocks]</hi> Cattle should graze in those places that were sometimes inhabited, they being left desolate. These and the like miseryes should be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and grow upon them, being set under Judgement.</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>until the Spirit be poured upon us]</hi> By <hi>Spirit</hi> here which is said to be poured out upon them, we may understand not so much the Person of the Holy Ghost (Not here to speak of the personal in-dwelling of the Spirit in all the Saints, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 14.) As the saving gifts and graces of the Spirit, by the donation of which, persons are enlightned, &amp; regenerated, sinners converted, &amp; Saints more &amp; more sanctified: And by <hi>pouring out of the Spirit,</hi> we may understand a plentiful effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or giving forth of the gifts and graces of the Spirit to the sound Conversion and through Sanctification of a People. The dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit in all the gracious and saving operations thereof is exprest by giving the Holy Ghost, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39, <hi>This spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given.</hi> And by pouring out the gift of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 45. <hi>On the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> By the Spirit being poured out upon them therefore is intended, a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful

and abundant measure of the communication of the gifts and graces of the Spirit unto them, and this was the determined period of their miseryes. See more of this in M. <hi>I. Mather</hi> his Sermon on <hi>Isai.</hi> 44. 3. Qu. 1, 2. where these things are directly and fully spoken too. <hi>From on High]</hi> from God above, Father and Son. <hi>And the Wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest.]</hi> I shall not trouble you with reciting the various Expositions given of this as in the parallel place, in <hi>Isai.</hi> 29. 17. but only lay down and improve that, which comparing them with the Text, and one with another, I take to be most probable. What is therefore exprest in the latter part of this Verse, we may take to intimate the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effects or fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit wrought upon, or in those upon whom it is poured. And they are two, 1. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the unregenerate. <hi>And the Wilderness be a fruitful Field,</hi> i. e. Those that have been as a Wilderness, barren and unfruitful, bringing forth no fruit to God, but wild fruits of sin, they shall be changed, tilled converted and made fruitful, to bring forth fruits of holiness unto God. 2. The admirable fruitfulness and encrease of grace in the godly; <hi>And the fruitful Field be counted for a Forrest,</hi> i. e. They that have a Principle of fruitfulness in them, and did bring forth fruit before, yet now upon the pouring out of the Spirit upon them shall receive such abundance of grace and be so eminent in the acting of it, that what they did before shall be accounted as the fruit of a barren Forrest, in comparison of what they do now. Such a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence shall there be in their fruitfulness before and after the pouring out of the Spirit on them. Or the meaning may be <hi>The fruitful field shall be counted for a Forrest, i. e.</hi> Those that were before fruitful fields shall upon the pouring out of the Spirit fructifie so incredibly, that they shall seem rather to be a Wood, a Forrest, a Thicket then fields of Tillage, (by an appropriation of such expressions as are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used concerning the incredible fertility of some Fields in grain and fruits, unto the exceeding great fruitfulness of persons in grace and spiritual, and holy actions) And so the Sense is the same as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. <hi>Vide Angl. Annot in Isai.</hi> 25. 17. and <hi>Calvin in Pol. Synops. Crit. Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The great turn and change following upon the pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17, 18. <hi>Then shall, &amp;c.</hi> The immediate Effects &amp; fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit were exprest in the former Verse:

The mediate or more remore effect and consequent of it, is here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest to be, the restoration and multiplication of sure mercies and blessings upon them in the Particulars mentioned in these verses. And they respect either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Sanctification, as a holy and heavenly Conversation. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Then Judgement shall dwell in the wilderness,</hi> i. e. in illis quiolim Desertum eran<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In treating of these words, I shall not endeavour to draw out all the single observations from them that might be, but only to take up the general scope of them in this one Doctrine, <abbr>

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000259_0014_0FA410AC25B18170"/>
well give it. This Doctrine may be further opened in these Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p>Prop. 1. <hi>God doth sometimes set a People under a dispensation of Judgement.</hi> As this People here. The Lord in the way of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence exposes them to Judgement, sets them in the way of misery, sorrow and calamity lighting upon them, follows them with evil: The general course of his dispensations toward them is afflictive: He does as it were set them as a mark to shoot the Arrows of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and displeasure at, Lam. 3. 12. <hi>He hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the Arrow.</hi> He marks them out for Judgement, they are a people of his anger, a generation of his wrath, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 29. he sets himself against them, he sets his face against them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 17. <hi>And I will set my face against you.</hi> He is sore displeased with them, and sets himself as it were with an angry countenance to punish their sin: He engages his Power and wrath against them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 25. <hi>And I will set my Jealousie against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee.</hi> He watches over them for evil, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 11, 27. <hi>Behold I will set my face against you for evil; Behold I will watch over them for evil.</hi> The Lord does as it were set himself to watch his opportunity to bring evil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, is against them on every side, and sets himself to afflict them.</p>
            <p>Thus God sometimes sets a People under a dispensation of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that; <hi>because they have set themselves in a way that is not good.</hi> They set themselves out of the way of holiness, and in the way of sin, and hence God sets himself in a way of Judgement, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26, 23, 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And 1. <hi>They have set themselves against his Command.</hi> They have rebelled against him, and broken his Laws, and cast his words behind their backs. Hence God in setting himself against a People sets their sins in the light of his Countenance, <hi>Psal.</hi>

            <p>Prop.

Until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, &amp;c. Text. ver.</hi> 15. If God hath once so far taken a people in hand as to set them under a dispensation of Judgement, there is no grounded hope of their deliverance and release in mercy, till God do in a gracious manner pour out his Spirit upon them, or wonderfully work a saving change in them and among them by the effectual operation of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit: Till abundance of grace be given forth for the procuring and effecting of their sound conversion.</p>
            <p>The Spirit is given or poured out for that end that there may be <hi>Conversion.</hi> And that either,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Conversion of sinners,</hi> which is exprest in the Text by, <hi>the Wilderness becoming a fruitful field,</hi> Psal. 51. 13. <hi>Sinners shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto thee.</hi> The Lord sends down his Spirit for this end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, awaken, convert, regenerate and sanctifie sinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 11. to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God: This is the work of the Ministry, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000259_0020_0FA410B278C64958"/>
the Spirit efficiently to deliver sinners out of the power of darkness, and translate them into the Kingdome of the dear Son of God: to make them of unholy, profane, proud and vain, serious, humble, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pious and conformed to the image and will of God: to love those things [of God] which they have not loved nor regarded; and to hate and abandon those things [of sin, world and vanity] which they have loved and set their hearts upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. <hi>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Conversion of Saints and Christians.</hi> Which is exprest in the Text according to the interpretation given, by; <hi>the fruitful field being counted for a forrest.</hi> Peter was converted before Satan sifted him and made him deny his Master, for saith Christ; <hi>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not:</hi> But he must be converted again and therefore Christ sayes to him; <hi>When thou art converted strengthen thy brethren,</hi> Luk. 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 32. though the relative change of state in believers is but once wrought, it is wrought at once and continues for ever, and the real change in their persons by sanctification is perfect in its parts, yet this latter admits of degrees: It is so wrought in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as that it needs constant carrying on in this life: and it may so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay as to need to be done over again, and so the Christian to pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the work of Conversion again, a second time. Hence David prayes when he had as it were lost the work or effect of former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, that God would <hi>create in him a clean heart, and renew a right Spirit within him,</hi> Psal. 51. 10. <q>Apprehending himself deprived in a manner of that holy disposition and power of godliness, which God had formerly wrought in him, as before he begged for pardon, so here for the sanctification of Gods Spirit. The word <hi>Renew</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hath reference to his former piety, which he found greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in him, wherewith he desires to be established again.</q> 
               <hi>Jackson in loc.</hi> Now this is the work of the Spirit to renew the work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and carry on the work of grace in believers. He is given for this end, for the furthering the work of grace and holiness in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in renewed and more strong acts of repentance, saith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to make them more free from sin and pollution, more and more conformable to the will of God in all things, more abundantly fruitful in every good work: to enlarge them in duty: and to make their faces and conversations to shine, that they shall in good earnest be engaged for God, his service and glory.</p>

Hence when the Spirit is poured out upon a people, All, or the generality of them, or at least very many among them will be either enquiring for, or walking in the way to Zion with their faces thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4,5. <hi>In those dayes, and in that time, saith the Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weeping; they shall go and seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thither ward.</hi> Which last expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may intimate their sincere intention and fixed resolution to go on in the way they enquired after. <q>
                  <hi>To set ones face,</hi> is <hi>to fix the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and actions without declining to any other way.</hi> 
                  <bibl>Wilson Christ. Diction.</bibl>
               </q> Such a people will be <hi>bound</hi> for God, having received the Spirit of God every one will <hi>go bound in the Spirit</hi> to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his duty and the glorifying and honouring of God. They shall be signally carryed out in seeking Gods face and doing of his will. There would appear a right and full bent of Spirit for God in persons, doing all sincerely in the name and in an evangellical manner exactly according to the will of the Lord Jesus, heartily giving thanks to God and the Father by him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3, 17. The Spirit of God and of holiness will breath and be manifest in them: There will be a godly sorrow and mourning for sin in All, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>But they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</hi> A hearty grief that they have displeased, dishonoured and provoked God by their sin: And a sincere and earnest care and endeavour to repair the honour and glory of Gods Name by future holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. These are the immediate effects and fruits of the pouring out of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And till the Spirit be thus poured out and these gracious effects of it in some good measure obtained to the Conversion and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a people under Judgement their misery and sorrow will be like to proceed and continue. And that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the profaneness, unbelief and impenitency of sinners, and the unholiness and unfruitfulness of Christians are the causes of these sorrows and miseryes. And as till the causes be removed there is no probability that the effect should cease, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>neither will I be with you any more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</hi> So in order to the removal of these from a people, the pouring out of the Spirit from on high upon them to their sound conversion and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000259_0022_0FA410B4E7C1EAE0"/>
sanctification is the grand expedient. And therefore till this be they will remain a generation of Gods wrath: His anger will not be like to be turned away from them till this work be wrought in and for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because till the Spirit be in some measure poured out upon them they will not be fit for mercy. They will not duely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not improve it, but profane and abuse it. Till by the gracious work of Gods Spirit in them they be brought to a complyance with his will, they will not be in a posture to receive mercy: They will not carry it aright under mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 8. 13, 21. <hi>Nevertheless he saved them for his Names sake, But, they soon forgat his works, they waited not for his Counsel. They forgat God their Saviour, which had done great things.</hi> And therefore there is little probability that God will bestow Salvation upon such a people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Till then they will be provoking God, Though the Lord be striking them they will certainly be adding new provocations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved: thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed them, but they have refused to receive correction, they have made their faces harder then a rock, they have refused to return,</hi> Isai. 57. 17. <hi>For the iniquity of his Covetousness was I wroth and smote hi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore notwithstanding all the evil God hath done unto them, it will be probable that his Anger will not be turned away, but his hand stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out still against them.</p>
            <p>Prop. IV. <hi>When the Spirit from on high is poured out upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their sound Conversion there will be a restoration and multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sure mercyes and blessings upon them.</hi> Though such a people were under affliction and expressions of divine displeasure before. The Seal of Gods providence would then turn towards them and there would be a remarkable, glorious and happy change among them, <hi>Text, ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18. Then there should be a new face and aspect of divine providence upon them, and the clouds of divine displeasure would blow over. What before was taken away or withheld from them should be then restored or given, and what mercy they want, bestowed upon them. They should have mercyes and blessings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

The righteous and holy God seems to be now weary of repenting concerning us, as he hath oftentimes done, and not to act towards us as formerly: When his hand hath been upon us heretofore he hath repented and not stirred up all his wrath, As, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 38. <hi>But he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not, yea, many a time turned he his anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and did not stir up all his wrath.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 106, 44, 45. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry.

places and persons almost more or less. In our late and present trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of sword, sickness and mortality there is scarce any but feels some thing whereof they are ready to complain, either in person, estates, relations: And fears of what may yet come by this or the other means are even ready to amaze the hearts of all that are so serious to consider any thing. So that there is an eminent accomplishment upon us at this day of that solemn word in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 15, 16, 17. <hi>I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint; and their ruines be multiplyed. Ah it is made bright, it is wrapt up for the slaughter. Go thee one way or other, either on the right hand or on the life, whithersoever thy face is set.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>God hears not our Prayers,</hi> i. e. Our publick prayers or prayers for the publick.

Hence see <hi>a reason of the continuance and growing of our sorrows.</hi> We are set under a dispensation of Judgment, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not yet poured out from on high upon us. And therefore no wonder if our troubles grow more extensive, numerous and general, and more intense, sharp and piercing. God hath in just anger set himself against us, and we are not yet turned and set for him by the effectual pouring out of the Spirit upon, and working of it in us. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How little kindly and sincere mourning for sin is there among us?</hi> That is one special effect of the pouring out of the Spirit on a people that have been rebellious; <hi>They shall look upon him, whom they have pierced and mourn, Zech.</hi> 12. 10. They shall mourn for their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and for their neglects of Christ. But how little of this mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing do we hear of amongst us in these dayes? Men and Women are heart whole, though there be much guilt upon them, and it may be their corruptions are yet whole and entire in them: They can do this and that evil and neglect this and that duty, and yet not mourn. There are many poor creatures can rejoyce in their sins: But, Alas; how few are in bitterness for them? where are the persons that sow in tears, that go forth and weep bearing precious feed, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 5, 6. Many are apt to make their moan for want of <hi>health,</hi> want of <hi>peace;</hi> want of <hi>money, &amp;c.</hi> But how few are there that lament and mourn truly for want of <hi>a broken heart,</hi> for want of <hi>pardon of sin,</hi> the <hi>favour</hi> of God and his grace? Were there more of this, there would be hope. As is the Proverb; <hi>Corn sowen in a flood comes up like a wood:</hi> Were there this sowing in floods of tears of true repentance, we might then hope for an abundance of the fruits and graces of the Spirit and the blessings accomyanying them to follow.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>How little of a praying frame, of a spirit of grace and supplication is among us?</hi> Where the Spirit of Christ is, there are these Abba's, those groanings that cannot be uttered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 8. 26. <hi>The Spirit it self maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</hi> Where there is any good measure of the Spirit there is liberty of access to God, there will be freedome of pouring out the the heart before God and strong wrestling with God, holy importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and taking the Kingdome of heaven by violence. But alas how little is there of these things? Our prayers are too cold, dead, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, lifeless, insipid and wordy only. How little of a melting frame in our prayers and humble brokenness therein, and how little vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment breathings of Soul after, and strong actings of faith upon the Lord Jesus therein? How little of patient and painful wrestlings with the Lord in them? How little of earnest looking after prayers, and believing expectation, and waiting for a gracious answer of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>How little studying and practising of Holiness is among us?</hi> Little of a Gospel becoming conversation. Were the Spirit of God put within us it would cause us to walk in his statutes and keep his <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and do them, Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. <hi>And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my Judgements and do them.</hi> We should then live holy and amiable lives, our light would shine before men and so give occasion of much glory to God. But how do we walk at all peradventures with God in our conversation? We are too uncertain and uneven, if not unholy therein. This is a thing confessed by most. Oh that it were lamented and reformed by All!</p>

5. <hi>How little breathings of love to God, his wayes, Ordinances and Saints are among us?</hi> Were the holy Ghost in the gifts and graces of it given to us in plentiful manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the love of God would be shed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in our hearts, it would be much there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost which is given to us.</hi> We should entirely love God and dearly love his word, Saints and wayes: The bent and stream of our affections would be turned this way. But alas! How low does our affection run to God, to his house, to his word, to his Ordinances, and one to another. How eager are we in our pursuits of other things? but after these not so earnest.</p>
            <p>It is too too evident that of these things mentioned there is too little among us, but of their contraryes too much: There is too much bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in, and impenitency for sinning; too much neglect of, formality and deadness in prayer; too much of weariness in and under, and list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness to the worship &amp; service of God; too much heedlessness, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness, unholiness &amp; profaneness in conversation; too much loathing, slighting, undervaluing &amp; disregarding of God his word, Ordinances &amp; Saints: Which plainly show our want of the pouring out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: And hence is our trouble continued and growing.</p>

               <hi>USE</hi> 4. Learn <hi>to observe the motions and breathings of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we may discern the signs of the times.</hi> We are from this Text informed that the pouring out, or with holding of the Spirit, hath a great influence to alter or dispose the frame or manner or state of times and dispensations: And therefore this dispensation of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Spirit is a special <hi>signe</hi> of the times, a signe for us to know the times by onto understand what the work of God is, or is like to be in the times we live in. It is the duty of Christians to labour to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the signs of the times, for want of which our Saviour blames and sharply reproves those, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 3. <hi>O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky, but can ye not discern the signes of the times?</hi> Luk. 12. 56. <hi>But how is it that ye do not discern this time?</hi> That was the time of the Messiah and his coming; of which there were special signs by which they might have apprehended and understood it, had they been wise and diligent to have marked the same. <q>The signes of any times they are those visible appearances of Gods providence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God leads us to discern that which is more inward as to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, intentions and expectations.</q> By these signes we may be led to observe or understand what God intends with, or to a people in such or such a time, which way the providence of God is at present work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000259_0034_0FA410C063E0CC98"/>
or like to work toward such a people, what God is doing with or among them. Now the Spirit of God in the pouring out or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of it, being a special eminent and remarkable signe of the times, by a wise and prudent observation of the motions and workings of that, we may be signally led to this discerning of the times. And therefore let all Christs disciples take due notice and observation of this matter. And consider particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What movings of the Spirit there are in the Souls of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in these times.</hi> What solemn awakenings and sound convictions wrought by the Spirit in the hearts of sinners: what wooings and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurings to draw their Souls unto God: What roise there is, rushing and shaking caused by the wind of the Spirit among the <hi>dry bones.</hi> Do we see them coming together bone to his bone, and standing up on their feet from the dead? Is the Spirit of God striving, mightily sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, powerfully and irresistibly working upon the hearts of secure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Does it force them to cry out of their sin and misery, wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and woful condition? Does it terrifie them from persisting in, or medling with iniquity? Does it humble and make them look about them with greatest care and sollicitude how they may do to escape the wrath of God and to obtain Salvation? Are these workings of the Spirit upon the hearts of sinners in these times? Speak you who still remain unregenerate! Is the Spirit of God still dealing with you by awakening, warning and not letting you alone to go on in sin, and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you by love to Jesus Christ? Or hath it done striving with you in that solemn manner and moving upon you in that winning way which formerly it hath done, whereby it made you sometimes to listen to its motions? Have you got the mastery of the Spirit by frequent resistance, that now you will not be jog'd or moved by it? Or hath the Spirit never thus moved upon you? Will you let us know how it is with you in this matter, that we may the better understand what God is doing or about to do? If there be these movings, awakenings &amp; allurings of the Spirit in the Souls of men and women in any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble measure among us, it is a good signe: But if not, it is surely bad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Consider, <hi>what presence of God is with his word in the dispensation of it, and what workings of the word there are upon and in the hearts of hearers.</hi> What impression the Word of the Gospel laboured in takes: Whether it tends to hardning or softning, whether it be a seed sown upon good ground, or as seed thrown by the way side, or hath only some lighter impressions. Particularly,</p>

               <q>The preaching of the Gospel, accompanyed with the mighty working of the Spirit of Christ, is the Rod of strength, or the strong Scepter whereby Christ doth mightily subdue and govern his people, <bibl>

               </q> And where there is a presence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit accompanying the dispensation of the Word, it will subdue hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What heart-breakings and Soul-meltings there are under the Word of God?</hi> How does the hammer of Gods word wielded by the Spirit break the rock in pieces? <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 29. <hi>Is not my word like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> Does the word divide betwixt the joynts &amp; the marrow, pierce to the discerning of the inward thoughts and intents of the heart? Do men and women sit <hi>trembling</hi> under the hearing of Gods word? Are their Souls plainly and wholly laid open to be <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>healed</hi> by the word of God? Does the word move and work kindly and sweetly upon the heart to perswade, to draw, to instruct, to correct, to awe, to unite the heart to God? Does it fully unravel our own woven webs, kindly humble us and make us fall all to pieces, as in our selves that we have no kind of thing to take to; and does it sweetly allure and work up our hearts to an earnest, hearty and thankful devolving the whole weight and concernment of our restless, helpless Souls upon the everlasting Arms of a tender and gracious Father in Christ Jesus? Does it bring us to clasp about a strong, gracious and faithful Redeemer and Saviour, as who will hold there and not let him go, because else we shall perish? Or is it so that the heat of Gods word dispensed will not thaw or melt our fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen hearts, how oft soever they are held to this fire? <hi>Is not my word like as a fire, saith the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What affection there is to the word of God.</hi> What love to, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for and desire after it. Is it the delight, joy and rejoycing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to be hearing, reading and practising according to the holy word of God? Is it as it was with David, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>Oh how love I thy Law! Psal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth my Soul after thee O God.

Soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 122. 1. <hi>I was glad when they said unto me; Let us go into the house of the Lord.</hi> Or are we little affected to, and our hearts little drawn out after the word of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Consider, <hi>What tenderness of heart and heart-smiting for sin there is among us?</hi> Where there is much of the grace of the Spirit the heart will be tender, and such a mans heart will smite him upon every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence against God, and upon every appearance of his anger. As Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah's heart was tender and he humbled himself before the Lord upon the hearing of what God spake against Judah, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 19. And Davids heart smote him upon his inconsiderate rash actions, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 5. and 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. Now what of this heart tenderness, and grief, and mourning for sin and Gods anger is there among us? Does the least transgression or miscarriage wound and grieve the Soul? Is a vain thought a trouble? Is an hypocritical frame or inclination a grief? Any appearance of evil disquieting, that the least corruption cannot be born without crying to God for deliverance? Or can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bear away with lighter and lesser evils, and it may be grosser mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages also? Let sin go without lamenting, or bewailing it, or being much concerned about it? be loose in their lives and ungirt in their Religion, and yet full peace?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Consider, <hi>what lively vehement outgoings of Soul to God in prayer there are among us:</hi> What of humble and holy access, freedome and familiarity with God in seeking him. Doe persons (even Christians) freely, easily and as it were naturally pour out their Souls to God? Can they by Faith take hold of God, and wrestle it out with him, and not let him go till he bless them? The spirit of <hi>grace</hi> is a spirit of <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications</hi> also, Zech, 12. 10. Or is it so, that many neglect calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God wholly, others do it in hypocrisie, many in meer formality, and even Christians themselves find it exceeding difficult to get up their hearts at any time to any earnestness, or suitableness in this duty?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Consider, <hi>what concernment of soul there is for the glory and work of God among us.</hi> Are we deeply engaged in, heartily taken up about, and diligently labouring in the promoting of Gods work, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his glory? Is it our chief care and principal endeavour that the work of Christ may be upheld, continued, and transmitted to posterity? Is every one in his place and capacity thoughtful and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful about this in good earnest, that it may be done? Or are we no
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000259_0037_0FA410C42FEF2610"/>
whit or little concerned about the glory and work of God among us? Are not our own concernments minded more? If we can look to our selves, let Christ look to himself and his work, as the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>All seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christs.</hi> Are there few upon whose hearts doth rest the care and sollicitude what will become of the Lords work? It is the property of such as inherit any good measure of a true Gospel spirit to seek the glory of God.</p>
            <p>These are some of the motions and operations of the Spirit which we are to observe in our selves and others, and by which we may be directed to discern the times, what God is doing or about to do, and what is like to become of us. When these things shall be, we may look for good times: If there be much of these things there is good hope: if little, little hope: if none, no hope: Only we may here, as alwayes elsewhere, reserve to God his <hi>absolute Soveraignty</hi> in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Be we never so bad, he may of his <hi>Soveraign grace</hi> save, or at least spare us: Or be we never so good, we may of his Soveraign <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>dominion,</hi> and in <hi>perfect Justice</hi> also, hold us under affliction in this life. But according to ordinary dispensation we may expect that he will be with us as we be with him. As the working of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in us, so the presence of his mercyes and blessings will be with us, his presence or absence will be much according as our spirits are working towards or from him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while ye be with him: and if ye seek him, he will be found of you: but if ye forsake him, he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> forsake you.</hi> So <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>If any shall say; Then (setting aside what God in his Soveraignty may do) We hope <hi>it will go well with us,</hi> It is probable it will so; For there are sure these workings of the Spirit among us. In Answer hereto I shall only add that it will be needful to consider these things further.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether these workings of the Spirit, supposed among us, may in any sense be said to be general.</hi> That there are some few, here and there one that keep themselves close to God and have a good measure of the Spirit breathing in them, for whose sakes we fare the better, is I suppose beyond question. But whether there be a sufficient number to obtain the sparing or saving such a place of <hi>light and means</hi> as <hi>New-England</hi> is, at least without the feeling of more sorrow first, may yet be a question. For I am ready to take this for granted, that the same
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000259_0038_0FA410C4EFF4B3F0"/>
number of righteous persons that might save a <hi>sinning Sodom,</hi> would yet not be enough to save a <hi>sinning Israel.</hi> And that because of what the Lord sayes, <hi>Am.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Familyes of the Earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether those workings of the Spirit that appear among us be for the most part effectual and saving.</hi> Whether they be not mostly or in great part <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ineffectual,</hi> and so issue only in <hi>formalities.</hi> It is the <hi>inward saving</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> operation of the Spirit that gives us grounded hope of the expectation of sure mercyes and blessings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Whether the breathings and workings of Gods Spirit are more or less among us then when we were first set under a dispensation of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If they be <hi>less,</hi> yea if they be not <hi>more,</hi> there is little likelihood that we should be delivered from under that Judgment. For it is not probable that that should remove anger, which was not sufficient to keep it off. If the want of such and such graces and fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath brought us under the Lords displeasure, the same defect will sure be like to continue us there. This therefore must not escape our consideration, what difference there is betwixt us then, and now. That there is more sin, and that iniquity bounds more, since Gods hand hath been out against us, I think is the general observation of all that take notice of any thing: According to that, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>I punished them: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether <hi>the workings of the Spirit are now growing or decaying among us.</hi> If there be more &amp; more of this gracious work of the Spirit break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth dayly, it is well: But if it grow more rare, and less and less, and the loss of good men and women, in whom the Spirit of God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently was, is not in some good measure made up by the resting of the same Spirit upon others rising up in their stead, our case looks threatning. But I shall say no more in this matter. <hi>Who is wise and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>USE 5. Of Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To all such among us as have any Interest at the throne of grace <hi>earnestly to pray that God would pour out of his Spirit upon us from on high.</hi> Let Gods favourites among us be earnest in crying unto God in this matter. If there be any strength for wrestling with God left, improve all the Interest you have with God and with his Son that you may prevail for this blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000259_0039_0FA410C5A3DF9FD0"/>
For Motive, Consider,</p>
            <p>Mot. 1. <hi>It is the manner of, and is becoming to Gods people to suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and wait upon him for all their mercyes.</hi> It is meet we should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all our special blessings from God upon our knees. Thus Gods Servants have done, <hi>Psal.</hi> 123. 1, 2. <hi>Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.—Our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that he have mercy upon us.</hi> We must not expect to receive any signal mercy unless God say the word, and that in answer to our ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayers. What ever mercy God bestows on his people he will be sought to by them for it: When he hath any mercy to bestow on his people he is wont to stay till his people ask it, though it is God that puts it into their hearts to ask it. Hence we are bidden in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving to let our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests be made known unto God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. We must ask the Father in Christs name for all. And therefore for this great blessing of the pouring out of the Spirit there is all reason that we should wait upon God by humble prayer. As the Apostles were commanded to wait at Jerusalem for <hi>the promise of the Father,</hi> the sending down of the Spirit, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 4. and most or much of that time they spent in praying, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication.</hi> And this no doubt was a special or main part of their prayer, that God would accomplish his promise in the actual pouring down of his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Nothing else is like to do us good, unless God will pour out his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on us.</hi> We have had experience of the <hi>inefficacy</hi> of means upon us to bring us into order and to a good frame.</p>
            <p>Much and frequent <hi>instruction</hi> and <hi>warning by the word</hi> hath not done it. We have been taught: what people this day in the world more; It may be said of us, as <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>The just Lord is in the midst thereof.—every morning doth he bring his Judgment to light, he faileth not,</hi> The word of the Lord hath been to us, precept upon precept, line upon line; We have been in that respect planted in the house of the Lord: But have we not been as the fig-tree, barren Or as the Lord speaks of his Vineyard, <hi>Isai.</hi>5. 4. <hi>Wherefore when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judgements</hi> have not done it. We have been under many: But yet may it not be said of us after all, as of them, <hi>Am.</hi>4. <hi>Yet have ye not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto me saith the Lord?</hi> How true is it of us; <hi>The people turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to him that smiteth them?</hi> We have not received correction but refused to return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:000259_0040_0FA410C679E7DE28"/>
               <hi>Deliverances</hi> do not do it. We have been respited. And when we have seen there hath been respite, have we not been secure still? As it was said of Pharaoh, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>But when pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardned his heart and hearkned not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Renewal of stroaks hath not done it.</hi> After respite and deliverance granted God hath taken us into his hand again. But alas! that it should be too truly said of us, <hi>We set not our hearts to this also.</hi> So that there is little or no hope till this be, till God by his Spirit work a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving through change in our hearts. Truly we are grown so irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as to spiritual concernments, that it is not Gods working upon us only in a rational way that will reclaim us, or bring us to his will. There must be in a more then ordinary manner the real energetical operation of his Spirit in us to make us other men and women then we are first.</p>
            <p n="3"> 3. <hi>An universal languishing in the inner man is and will be upon us for want of this pouring out of the Spirit.</hi> You your selves Christians by Your own confession are not so capacitated to the exercise of grace &amp; duty for want of this. Things go hard with your Souls. Those things which remain are even ready to dy. As <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. Faith, love and other graces they are as it were under a Consumption, very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and languid. Iniquities prevail, corruptions get loose and waste the strength and vigour of the Soul: And will not you stir up your selves to pray for the Remedy? This is lamentable, <hi>Isai.</hi> 64. 6, 7. <hi>We all do fade as a leaf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away: And there is none that calleth upon thy Name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</hi> And how do sinners pine away in their iniquities not regarding God nor their own state and condition whilest they are without the effectual strivings of the holy Spirit with them? Will you not pity them and earnestly pray for this <hi>kealing Remedy</hi> to be given to them? Can you see your own Souls pining, and others Souls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and not be importunate with God to put forth his hand to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and save respectively? what will become of faith, holiness, love to God, his word, Ordinances, wayes and one another, unless; God be pleased to pour out his Spirit on us?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The work of Christ is like quickly to ly by, unless this be.</hi> If God do not graciously appear to give forth his holy Spirit, the work of Christ will be like ere long and it may be not long first to fall to the ground for want of persons spirited to manage it and carry it on. And can

you he willing to see that day, or that it should come though you do not see it, and not improve the utmost of your interest with God to prevent it? Are you Christs, and not concerned that the work of Christ should, or should be in danger to, lye by? Indeed we are like to run all to confusion and misery, if God doe not wonderfully and graciously appear this way to work for us, to revive us by his Spirit, to set us into, and keep us in that order which is according to his will. There is therefore absolute necessity of the effusion of the Spirit for the continuance of Gods work and glory among us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>This will be our great security against the expressions of Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Ezek.</hi> 39. 29. <hi>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.</hi> And so it will be our security in the enjoyment of all blessings and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Indeed it is the only sure way we have to all, or any good. The nearer God <hi>the greatest good</hi> is to us, the farther sin <hi>the greatest evil</hi> will be from us; &amp; there will be peace, quietness and rejoycing in the favor of God, and in the gracious effects of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It will be for the great honour of Christ.</hi> By the pouring out of the Spirit is manifested the <hi>efficacy</hi> of his <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the end and fruit of it obtained, which redounds to his honour. It is a great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the power of Christs Redemption and demonstrates him to be a strong Redeemer, when there is of the travel of his soul to be seen, and his people are made willing in the day of his power, &amp; hence is he glorified. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 8, 10. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me: and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me—And I am glorified in them.</hi> And will not you pray that Christ may be honoured in his subduing the hearts of men to himself, that this <hi>crown of Glory</hi> may be set upon his head?</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>You have a promise to improve of Gods pouring out his Spirit:</hi> This is that which the Lord hath spoken that he will doe, especially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, <hi>Isai.</hi> 44. 3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit on thy Seed and my blessing upon thine offspring.</hi> So <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 28, 29. Whence you have a <hi>bottome</hi> for <hi>faith</hi> to rest upon, an argument to plead in prayer for your children of the rising generation. You are the Lords people, and to such God in these promises gives hold to be taken of himself in this matter. Beg therefore that God would fulfil his own word, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish his own promise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:000259_0042_0FA410C7E53B2890"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it may be some will say; These promises and so the Text also respect the latter times, and Gods pouring out his Spirit upon the Jews at their conversion, and bringing home; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what improvement can we make of them for our times?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> If it be granted that they do respect <hi>a signal dispensation</hi> of God to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>last</hi> times, yet that hinders not but that there is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a <hi>like dispensation</hi> of God in accomplishing these promises under the Gospel. Prophetical Scripture is often fulfilled. And though there be in special one grand accomplishment of Scripture Prophesies and promises: yet there are also many Specimens, beginnings of fulfilling them, partile accomplishments, like dispensations of Gods providence, wherein those prophesies and promises are fulfilled in their measure and degree. And so this Prophesy and promise of Gods pouring out his Spirit, however it may have its <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> accomplishment in some particular glorious time hereafter: yet there hath been a <hi>glorious</hi> accomplishment of it already in the Apostles times, as we are informed. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16, 17, 18. <hi>But this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel; And it shall come to pass in the last dayes (saith God) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and it is fulfilled in a degree wherever the Gospel comes with power. Yea, further it is observed by some; that, <q>There is no particular Church where the light hath shined but hath had its special times, some solemn day of the pouring out of the Spirit, before the Sun went down; Which may be observed either at the first breaking up of the Gospel, or at some remarkable time and change of her condition; Whence a great tack of Souls to Christ hath followed, besides the reaching of the Conscience, and stirring the affection of many others under a common work of the Spirit, which usually goeth along with solemn times.</q> 
               <hi>Fulfilling of the Scripture, pag.</hi> 142. <hi>Edit.</hi> 2. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray that New England may have such [or another such] a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day, before her Sun go down.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is necessary to <hi>evidence</hi> that you <hi>have</hi> the Spirit that you be ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly desirous to have <hi>more</hi> of the Spirit, and that both for your selves and others.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If Christians would <hi>in good earnest set to pray</hi> for this, there would be <hi>good hope</hi> that the <hi>Spirit</hi> would be <hi>poured</hi> out upon us. The Lord is not wont to say to his people, <hi>seek</hi> or to stir them up to <hi>seek</hi> him in <hi>vain, Isa.</hi> 45. 19. <hi>I said not unto the Seed of Jacob, seek ye me in vain. &amp;</hi> 30. 19.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000259_0043_0FA410C8EC4EAAA8"/>
               <hi>He will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</hi> More encouragement to instant prayer for the pouring out of the Spirit, see in Mr. <hi>I. Mathers</hi> Sermon on <hi>Isai.</hi> 44. 3. <hi>Pag.</hi> 14, to 19.</p>
            <p>By all let Christians be perswaded to <hi>lift up</hi> the hands which hang down, and set to prayer, with a deep <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>want</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> with a <hi>Soul humbling sense,</hi> that we have so <hi>grieved</hi> the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as thus to forsake and <hi>with hold</hi> its <hi>gracious</hi> operations from us: and also with <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>expectation</hi> that God will do this for us for the sake and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Christ:</hi> And then we might hope that it would <hi>go well</hi> with us, and that that should be accomplished in us which is prayed for by the Psalmist. <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>O satisfy us early with thy mercy, that we may rejoyce and be glad all our dayes. Make us glad according to the dayes wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil. Let thy work appear unto thy Servants and thy glory unto their Children. And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish thou the work of our hands upon us: yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Exhortation 2. To <hi>All,</hi> to labour that <hi>the Spirit may be poured out upon them,</hi> that they may both have the Spirit, and a plentiful measure of the graces of it. Let every one endeavour to get the Spirit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so there would be a general pouring out of the Spirit, Would we be free from misery, would we be happy, make this our business. Let all unregenerate persons rouze and stir up themselves, and take the Kingdome of heaven by holy violence. Sue and strive by all means that the saving graces of the Spirit may be given to you. If we would have the Spirit poured out upon us upon our persons, we must be in the way of waiting for it. And O that we could use utmost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and endeavours in this thing! It is a matter of most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and everlasting concernment. I might here urge those two things hinted in the Text. <hi>The misery of being without,</hi> and <hi>the blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of having the Spirit poured our upon us.</hi> which comprehend all can be said. But more particularly by way of motive, consider.</p>
            <p>Mot. 1. <hi>If you have not the Spirit you are none of Christs,</hi> you have no Christ, you are Christless persons, and have no more to doe with he Son of God in your present state, as to any propriety in him, then the Devils had, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 28. You may talk of Christ, and it may be profess him, but you have no right nor interest in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>Now
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000259_0044_0FA410C96EFC88B0"/>
if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</hi> The Spirit is the bond of union on Christs part, and it is the Spirit which works Faith in us which is the bond of union on our part: whence Christ dwels in his people by his Spirit. Where therefore the Spirit of Christ is not, there is no union of that Soul to Christ, no faith wrought in the heart, and so no Christ dwelling in that soul. And now seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what it is to be <hi>without Christ,</hi> to be <hi>none of his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is to have no pardon of sin.</hi> No Christ, no forgiveness. You are yet in your sins, under the guilt of them and can have no pardon so long as you are without Christ. All the sins that ever you have committed, they stand on file against you, and you must answer for them. You lye under the heavy load of the guilt of innumerable evils, the which if you had any sense, might-make your hearts to fail at the thoughts of it. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 12. <hi>For innumerable evils have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed me about, mine iniquityes have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up: they are more then the hairs of my head, therefore my heart faileth me.</hi> It is enough to make the heart of any person to <hi>fail</hi> indeed, to see the load of all his sins lying upon him unpardoned. What a dreadfull thing is it for us who have been Transgressors from the womb, endless in acting of sin, to have all our sins to answer for before God, <hi>Job.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</hi> We cannot give a satisfying Answer for one single sin of a thousand: But we must <hi>answer,</hi> that is, we must be called to an <hi>account</hi> for them all, if they be not pardoned, and pardoned they are not, if we have not <hi>Christ.</hi> In him <hi>pardon</hi> is to be had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.</hi> But pardon is no where to be had without him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to have no favour with God.</hi> No Christ, no favour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The heart of God will never he towards any that are not in Christ, and that continue out of him. The world is at enmity with God, and reconciliation is only to be had in Christ Jesus. God will enter into friendship with, or shew favour to no person but by the means and mediation of his Son. And therefore if thou art and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuest without Christ. God does and ever will look upon thee as an Enemy, thou shalt find no favour in his eyes. <hi>He that made thee will not have mercy on thee, he that formed thee will shew thee no favour:</hi> There will never be other then anger in the face and heart of God towards
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000259_0045_0FA410CC604EBC98"/>
We are all by nature children of wrath and Enemies, but they who are gotten into Christ they are thereby reconciled, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21, 22. <hi>You that were sometimes alienated and Enemyes in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath be reconciled, in the body of his flesh through death,</hi> &amp;c. But for others the wrath of God <hi>abides</hi> on them, and there it will abide to Eternity, for they can have no favour, if they continue out of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It is to have no Salvation.</hi> No Christ, no Salvation. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else men may have, if they have not Christ, they can never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, Joh.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>He that believeth not the Son shall not see life.</hi> Poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! what dost thou dream of Heaven, happiness, eternal life &amp; glory &amp; hast no Christ? All thy hopes will prove to be but vain dreams, and will in the end vanish, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>He that hath not the Son of God hath not life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It is to be reprobate,</hi> i. e. <hi>disapproved, disallowed and rejected of God, Jer.</hi> 6. 30. <hi>Reprobate [or refuse and rejected] silver shall men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Know you not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except ye be reprobates.</hi> They who are without Christ, though they may not be <hi>Reprobate,</hi> as the word is opposed to <hi>Elect;</hi> yet in their present state and as to what appears they are no better then those that are reprobate. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing under Gospel enjoyments without getting into Christ is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful symptome of everlasting Reprobation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is to be Satans.</hi> If thou art none of Christs, thou art the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. The possession of men in the world is divided betwixt <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Satan.</hi> What <hi>Christ</hi> possesses not are under <hi>Satans power</hi> and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Know therefore that if Christ hath no possession of thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou art possessed of the Devil. Most lamentable tydings I bring to all unconverted sinners, <hi>you are possessed by the Devil:</hi> you are in the hands of that cruel Enemy of Souls, in the paw of that roaring <hi>Lyon</hi> who goes about seeking whom he may devour. Is it not a dreadful thing to have the <hi>body</hi> possessed? See <hi>Mark.</hi> 5. 2,—5. <hi>There met him out of the Tombs a man with an unclean Spirit.—And alwayes night and day he was in the mountains and in the Tombs, crying and cutting himself with stones.</hi> But how much more dreadful is it to have the <hi>Soul</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils possession? Ah sinner! Hast thou any reason to laugh and be
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:000259_0046_0FA410CC6D2F4E78"/>
merry, to enjoy one good hour, whilest thou art under the hand of so cruel a master and murtherer of Souls as thou art? He hath his will upon thee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. <hi>Who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi> The evil Spirit worketh in the Children of disobedience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. He trades there; In some he keeps open shop, setting forth his wares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world in those abominations and villanyes by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: In others he deals more underhand, he does not appear so open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet he is at work in the heart of every child of disobedience. Every sinner is the Devils <hi>factor,</hi> and erelong unless thou withdraw from his service he will pay thee thy wages. Every Christless sinner is under Satans power: Hence when persons are converted, they are turned from the power of Satan, delivered from the power of darkness, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Col. 1. 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus remember and consider that if you have not the Spirit of Christ you are none of Christs, and if none of Christs, then what and whose you are.</p>
            <p>Mot. 2. <hi>If you have not the Spirit you are worth nothing.</hi> The true worth and value of men is according to what of the Spirit of God is in them. And therefore Pharaoh judged right of Joseph on this account that he was <hi>an eminent man, a man in whom the Spirit of God was,</hi> Gen, 41. 38. But if you are without this, whatever rate you may value your selves at, or others may value you, you are indeed good for nothing.</p>
            <p>For, 1. <hi>You know nothing of that which is only worth the knowing, and to which all other knowledge ought to be subservient.</hi> You know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the things of God and his Kingdome, of the mysteries of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with God in Christ. Speculative knowledge you may have, but practical saving knowledge you have none, for the true saving knowledge of these is only attained by the help of the Spirit, which you are without, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11,—14. <hi>We have received the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us God—But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</hi> You have little reason any one of you, he that knows most, to boast of, or be lifted up with your knowledge, for you know nothing as you ought to know. <hi>The God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, left the light of the glorious
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000259_0047_0FA410CD231AE870"/>
Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. And therefore whatever you may imagine, or speak, or reason concerning spiritual things, it is but even as the blind mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, discourse and reasoning concerning Colours: It is very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly: You do not really understand any thing about them. <hi>Si Christum nescis, nihil est si coetera discis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>You can do no good thing.</hi> You have no ability to perform any good action. We are all naturally so impotent that we can do nothing that is good unless we have Spirit to help our infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. <hi>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities:</hi> Which you have not. We cannot take any step in a right path without the manudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and leading of the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, Psal.</hi> 51. 12. <hi>Uphold me with thy free Spirit:</hi> But you have no such guide. All spiritual life and every action of life it comes from the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it nothing is to be done: And therefore let me tell you who have none of the Spirit of God, you never did any thing well in your lives, not any thing that God will accept.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>You have no good in you.</hi> All the good that is or ever was in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man, it is wrought by the Spirit of God. And therefore if you have none of the Spirit of God, you have no real good in you. You may have these and those good natural dispositions, and some shews of good, but as for any spiritual, saving good that will abide the tryal when God shall judge what is good and what is bad, you have none of it. And therefore it may be said truly of you (whatever you may think of your good heart, &amp;c.) your heart is little worth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>The heart of the wicked is little worth.</hi> It is little worth indeed, for it is worth nothing. Hence is it said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 119. <hi>God putteth away all the wicked of the Earth like dross:</hi> they being of no worth. Thus you see you are worth nothing, good for nothing, if you have not the Spirit of God in you: But they in whom the Spirit of God dwells, they are the <hi>excellent upon the Earth, Psal.</hi> 16. 3. They are <hi>Gods Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, Mal.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>In that day when I make up my Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mot. 3. <hi>If you do not get the Spirit of God to be in you, you will be like to be guilty of New-Englands ruine.</hi> I speak now to the Generation coming on upon the Stage; if you or a considerable number of you do not take care to be right spirited for God, that you may duely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage his work and carry it on, and serve the God of your Fathers with

a perfect heart and willing mind, you will be like to destroy and lay this pleasant land desolate, your irreligion will be an occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 34. <hi>He turneth a fruitful land into barrenness for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of them that dwell therein.</hi> Your sin, your degeneracy, your not owning and worshipping God in Spirit will provoke God to lay it desolate, and then it will be charged upon you, you will be reputed guilty of it, as being you who have done it, <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 11,—14: <hi>But they refused to hearken, &amp;c.—for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</hi> There is the fault and there will it be charged. And what a dreadful thing will it be to have the spoiling of such a blessed work as God hath here begun, to ly at our door?</p>
            <p>Mot. 4. <hi>While you are without the Spirit of God you are in extream danger.</hi> You go in jeopardy of your lives, the lives of your Souls eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour. If this night thy Soul should be called for, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee, who hast none of the Spirit of Christ? Assuredly Christ will say of you; <hi>I know you not, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi> And then how fearful would your condition be? <hi>There shall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gnashing of teeth.</hi> This is the danger you are in while the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not given to you. There is but a step betwixt your Souls and eternal death. Sentence of condemnation is past upon you already, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi> Hell does as it were gape for you, your condition is extreamly perilous. Did sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners know in what danger of the lives of their immortal Souls they walk in every hour they are without the Spirit of Christ, they would never sing care away with vain mirth and pastime, or please themselves with some shew and formality of Religion only. Oh the fearful ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing security of men and women that can sleep quietly and take their ease upon the brink of eternal misery!</p>
            <p>Mot. 5. <hi>Consider, you know not how little time you may have for the getting of the Spirit.</hi> And therefore labour to get it quickly. It is certain you have but a short time to work in, but how short is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. We have seen and see dayly how suddenly they are cut down, by the Sword, and now by this fore disease God hath sent among us; who in probability might have lived many dayes. These especially are times wherin none can promise himself continuance of life. Thou hast this day an opportunity of hearing the word of the Gospel, and it may be mayst be something moved by it: But who knows but that some of us here may never have another? Oh that the present time

could be improved by us all to strike the stroke for Eternity! The present time is only ours, and to know and improve that, is our wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 2. <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> If we now improve it, it shall be a day of salvation to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>While it is said, To day, if ye will hear his voice, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts.</hi> If we neglect making out after the Spirit to day, we know not <hi>what shall be on the morrow, Jam.</hi> 4. 14. None knows <hi>what a day may bring forth, Prov.</hi> 27. 1. Another day may bring the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner into eternal flames. God tells us that <hi>his Spirit shall not alwayes strive with men, Gen.</hi> 6. 3. And if the Spirit of God have once done striving with us, then the time and hope of our getting the Spirit is past and gone also. Now therefore while time and the day of grace lasts look about you lest the opportunity be lost and you be undone for ever.</p>
            <p>If any shall now ask; <hi>How shall we do to get the Spirit of God pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us and dwelling in us?</hi> There is a great deal of duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon us in this respect. We must not sit still and say, It is not in our power to get the Spirit: God expects that his word should stir us up to careful endeavours that we should up and be doing, if so the Lord will be with us. If we sit still we are sure to perish, but if we stir up and set our selves to seek him, who knows but the Lord may help us so to seek him as that he may be found of us? Something therefore of our duty in order hereto I shall endeavour to set before you in these following Directions. And the same course is to be taken for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an encrease of the graces of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Direct. 1. <hi>Labour for a serious considerate frame.</hi> Duely to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weigh things especially matters of Eternity. Seriously mind what your state, what your danger, what your work is. That is the woful bane of many a Soul they do not consider, <hi>Isai.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>My people doth not consider.</hi> They do not throughly think of things, some slight notions and workings they may have about them, but it is not to purpose.

and to purpose: They know every thing almost about Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but they feel nothing, and so indeed know nothing. Did men and women see things <hi>really,</hi> and consider things <hi>seriously</hi> and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, we should have other manner of endeavours for the Spirit, for <hi>Conversion</hi> and Salvation then there are. It would be a good step if sinners could get their hearts set upon, and their thoughts seriously busied about, those matters that lye betwixt God and their Souls; and take up <hi>right</hi> and <hi>through</hi> apprehensions of those things which are of spiritual and everlasting concernment. Hence is it wont to be said; <hi>Consideration is half Conversion.</hi> A giddy flighty generation that can scarce be serious or fixed in any thing, that cannot get their hearts fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed seriously to think of things, especially of a spiritual nature, are not like to be a converted generation, to be the subject of the pouring out of the Spirit. We must therefore labour to set our hearts to the words of God, to feel them in <hi>through meditation</hi> that they may be our life? <hi>"One Truth felt in Meditation is worth a world.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mitchels Let.</hi> Hence David <hi>Psal.</hi> 39. 3: <hi>My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned.</hi> A religious pondering frame would greatly make way for the presence of the spirit of grace in the Soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 59. <hi>I thought on my wayes and turned.</hi>

If you will not give entertainment to the Sprit of God, nor embrace its motions, how can you be like to receive it?

            <p>Direct. 3. <hi>Remove all prejudices against the Spirit out of your hearts.</hi> Our hearts naturally are full of prejudice against the Spirit and the wayes and workings of it, of which we must labour to get them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There are those things wont to be mentioned (<hi>as in the Author but now quoted, p.</hi> 639) wherein we are apt to take up prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Spirit. 1. Against the humbling work of the Spirit. 2. The mortifying work of the Spirit. 3. The sanctifying work of the Spirit. 4. The Derisions that befal men for the Spirits sake. That which I have especial reference to here is that we should get removed all <hi>prejudice</hi> against the <hi>mortifying</hi> and <hi>sanctifying work</hi> of the Spirit. Beware of being offended at the way of walking in the Spirit for the strictness of it, as if it were too streight to be restrained from these and those flesh-pleasing actions, and to be tyed to these and those religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dutyes and services. Be so far from looking upon these as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, as that on the contrary you may account them most equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and indeed most pleasant: As <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Her wayes are wayes of pleasantness.</hi> And account that it is your naughty heart only that makes you think them tedious and irksome. By all means get your hearts <hi>reconciled</hi> to those wayes, in which the Spirit of God leads those he dwels in, that you may from the heart account those happy who by the help and grace of the Spirit can and do walk in them, and that you should account it your own greatest happiness if you could obtain to have and walk in the Spirit, and in all the wayes thereof, and that every way and work of the Spirit of God may be very precious &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable to you They are the most excellent, glorious, profitable and desireable wayes and works, and it is the perverseness of mans heart and will that makes them at any time seem otherwise: which perverse esteem of them we must labour to get rid of.</p>
            <p>Dir. 4. <hi>Get your hearts pressed with the intollerable load and burthen of sin, of which you can no way be eased but by the presence and help of the Spirit of God.</hi> Never rest nor be quiet till you come to see the intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, infinite, endless evil that is in sin, to be sensible that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable burthen. That is the reason why many are so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:000259_0052_0FA410D2642EF850"/>
about obtaining the Spirit of God to help and relieve them; they are not duely sensible of the dreadful burthen and load of their sin that lyes upon them. They have some lighter convictions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations it may be for some grosser sins, but they are not deep, soak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor through enough: They are not sick unto death of their sin, and hence they do not look for, or not very earnestly for the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. It may be they have some physick of their own, something com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in their own Kitchin, some course or work of their own, that they account will do the deed, expiate for their sin, and preserve them from perishing; and so they look no further. Or if they do look out to this great Physitian of Souls, it is only to get some directions what they may do themselves for themselves, and they themselves will get it, work it and administer it, and so they rest still upon their own doing: They are not brought so low in themselves, as utterly and for ever to despair of their own strength and skill to recover themselves, and hence they do not yield themselves wholly and fully to be healed by the Spirit of Christ, they do not see such need of it. Labour therefore by all means to see clearly the deadly wound that sin hath given you, and to have your hearts broken all to pieces under the sense thereof. So long as you are whole in your self, or think you can make your self whole, you will see no need of the Physitian: But if you be thus sick, heart sick of sin, you will then feel an absolute need of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, you will then prize and look after him, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>They that be whole need not a Physitian, but they that are sick.</hi> Sit not down at quiet till sin become most exceeding bitter. <q>
                  <hi>Go on humbling to be humbled, and to see such intollerable evil in sin, and to be so burthened with the wrath of God lying upon you for it, as it may make sin everlasting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly odious to you, &amp; force you to fly for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and to have strong consolation there.</hi>
               </q> Mr. <hi>Mitchel Let.</hi> Do not shun sorrow and mourning for sin: Of necessity you must be troubled for sin in this life or in Hell, and it is far better to come mourning to God for sin here, then to go mourning from him for his Judgement hereafter. If we be indeed cast down for sin &amp; be in extream bitterness of Soul about it from the sinfulness of it, and its contrariety to God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to us, then we shall be fit objects for the Spirit who is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to manifest his gracious work upon, <hi>Isai.</hi> 57. 18. <hi>I will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</hi> Penitential mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for sin stand fair in the way to be comforted by God. Thus it is

said the Spirit of the Lord was upon Christ for this end, <hi>Isai.</hi> 61. 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tydings unto the meek, he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the Captives. and the opening of the prison to them that are bound: To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn: To appoint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oyl of joy for mourning.</hi> If we do not feel sin to purpose (as it is to be feared few in these dayes do, whatever common convictions many have) there is little hope that we should have this blessed Comforter sent to us, to take up his abode with us. Mourning for sin cannot be too much, if it raise the price of Christ in the Soul, and draw out a more earnest desire of the applying work of the Spirit to be wrought in the heart.</p>
            <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Cry mightily to God for his Spirit.</hi> Ask this boon of Heaven. When you feel an utter want of the Spirit of God in you, then run, flee to the throne of grace and let your Soul <hi>cry out</hi> to the living God for this mercy. Tell the Lord in humble manner what need you have of his Spirit, what your misery is without it, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly beg of him that he will give you his holy Spirit, to work faith, repentance and all other graces in you. And for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consider what Christ sayes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your Children: how much more shall your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3, 4. 5. But you will say; <hi>We cannot pray without the Spirit.</hi>

            <p>Answ. But yet go and present your selves before God, and spread your case before him as well as you can. Bemoan your wants, your inability to good, your insensibleness of your misery: Plead as well as you can for mercy, for the bestowing of his Spirit upon you: Who knows but when you are endeavouring, seeking and striving, God may give in his holy Spirit to you, and help you to pray to acceptation with him? It is our duty to wait &amp; let God take his time &amp; way to work. But be sure to pray &amp; that with great earnestness from a deep sense of your distress and danger, that God will speedily help you, <hi>Psal.</hi> 70. 1. <hi>Make haste, O God, to deliver me, make haste to help me, O Lord, Psal.</hi> 143. 7. <hi>Hear me speedily, O Lord, my Spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.</hi> It must be with humble and earnest prayer on our part, that the Spirit of God will come into our Souls, if ever it come there, Look therefore to the

Infinite mercy of God in Christ to help in this matter.</p>
            <p>Direct. 6. <hi>Be exceeding diligent in the use of all means, especially in attending upon the word of God for the obtaining of the Spirit.</hi> As we must pray, so we must use all due means with praying over them. Seek for the Spirit wherever there is hope it may be found in all those <hi>wayes</hi> which God hath instituted for the giving forth of grace, mercy and good to the Souls of men. Let <hi>Sabbaths</hi> be observed, <hi>Ordinances</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>meditation, self examination, prayer,</hi> secret, Family and publick prayer, <hi>reading the word</hi> of God; And especially the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the word: Oh wait there; By that, the <hi>word</hi> of God <hi>dispensed,</hi> the Spirit is pleased to convey himself. The <hi>Gospel</hi> is called the <hi>ministration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8. We read of those upon whom the holy Ghost fell while they were hearing the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. <hi>While Peter yet spake these words, the holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</hi> The <hi>Galatians Gal.</hi> 3 2. received the Spirit by the <hi>hearing of faith,</hi> i.e. the word of faith which the Apostles preached. Therefore attend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to the <hi>Ministry</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> pray before you come, pray when you go from hearing of the word, that it might be a blessed means to conveigh the Spirit to you: And when you come to the word attend with all your might, hear as for your lives, do not heedlesly let slip any one Sentence without your careful attention. Expect, wait, long, look when, by what sentence, by what word spoken God will let in his Spirit into your Souls. Oh if persons would set themselves in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to attend upon the word of the Gospel, as the word of God, as the Ministry of the Spirit, who knows what God might do for them? Let the word of God be precious, if ever you would have the Spirit of God with you and in you.</p>
            <p>Dir. 7. <hi>Enquire seriously and consult with those that have the Spirit of God.</hi> If you have any serious christian friend you can open your heart to, be plain with him, &amp; beseech him to be plain with you. Enquire the way of the Spirit from those who have had experience thereof, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 4, 5. <hi>In those dayes and in that time saith the Lord, the Children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together going and weeping: they shall go and seek the Lord their God: They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward.</hi> Where you meet with difficulty in the way seek for instruction: Listen what others, what Christians of approved god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and experience say concerning the way of the Spirit of God in their Souls, if so be that you thereby might go forth by the footsteps

of Christs flock, and find him whom your Soul seeks after. This is the direction the Lord gives to her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>If thou know not,—go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock.</hi> It is of exceeding use for persons whose desires are intensly set after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God to be opening their hearts, and conferring seriously one with another about the same. Oh the holy breathings of the Spirit that have many times been kindled in the Souls of persons when they have been seriously and sincerely confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring concerning the things and wayes of the Spirit of God!</p>
            <p>Direct. 8. <hi>Continue seeking, striving and waiting in the use of all means till you find, till the Spirit be poured out from on high upon you.</hi> If the Lord do not come and give his Spirit to you presently, yet take heed of giving over, or slacking your endeavours. Many being some way or other rouzed, for a fit are very earnest, but not finding the Spirit of God to come quickly, they give over, they are soon cooled, and content themselves with their former formalities in the exercises of Religion. Take heed we do not cast away our Souls here: How many, many perish here! Resolve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to give over seeking and waiting till God be gracious to you, and pour out his Spirit upon you. If God give you not the holy Spirit to be your Comforter, resolve never to take comfort, but ly down in sorrow. Let nothing divert you from this seeking, let nothing satisfy you till you have found the thing you seek for, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord.</hi> Importunity and constancy may at last prevail, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 5,—10.—<hi>Yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needeth, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Luk.</hi>

And for the prevalency and good effect of this we have the famous example of the woman of Canaan, <hi>Math.</hi> 15. 22,.-28.</p>
            <p>Direct. 9. <hi>Make this the business of your lives.</hi> Look upon it as the main thing you came into the world for. Lay out the strength of your Souls about it. Drive on this as if you had nothing else to mind or do: Make this your work to get the Spirit of God to be in you, and all other things subordinate and subservient to this. Do not think that for a sinner to obtain all the gracious operations of the Spirit in himself, to get a due sense of sin as most odious and loathsome, and to rest his Soul upon Christ as most pretious, and to shew forth all the blessed fruits of the Spirit in his conversation, is a work easily or quickly done: And yet you must not rest till you come to this, till there be the apparent, manifest, full breathings and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit in you. As Mercy is not like to come to us till the Spirit be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon us from on high: So let us wait and labour till the Spirit be poured out upon us, singly and generally, that the wilderness may become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a Forrest; and so those mercyes and blessings which are consequent to this may be derived down to, and setled upon us. For a close, let every sincere one, whose heart is upon the work and glory of Christ, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and earnestly joyn with the Psalmist in that prayer &amp; profession of his, <hi>Psal.</hi> 53. 6. 0 <hi>that the Salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoyce, and Israel shall be glad.</hi>
