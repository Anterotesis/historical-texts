            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004353_0004_100441B1997C5678"/>do very well agree with Acts of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and are a becoming Sabbath Exerciſe; ſuited to the Place and Time and Act of Worſhip when Occaſion offers.</p>
            <p>The ſuperſtitious <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; not that they had the leaſt Shadow of a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for their Affectation and Pretence of a more ſtrict and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the Sabbath; but they had fondly imbib'd it as a venerable <hi>Tradition,</hi> which was not to be ſpoken againſt on any Account, nor parted with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it gave 'em a <hi>Credit</hi> among the People, carrying a Face and <hi>Form</hi> of ſtrict Devotion.</p>
            <p>On the contrary our <hi>Lord</hi> declared both in his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Practice this <hi>neceſſary Truth;</hi> That to <hi>do good</hi> on the Sabbath-day, as well in Acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> as thoſe of Worſhip, was the proper and true Sanctification of it.</p>
            <p>For this he was particularly <hi>malign'd</hi> and hated by the hypocritical <hi>Prieſts,</hi> Elders and <hi>Formaliſts</hi> of that Day; and therefore we find 'em in our <hi>Context</hi> watching Him whether he would <hi>heal</hi> this poor Man on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, that they might <hi>accuſe</hi> him. V. 2.</p>
            <p>In to what Spite and <hi>Villany</hi> will not blind <hi>Superſtition,</hi> as well as Profaneſs, carry Men? the moſt Divine and God-like Works ſhall be traduc'd, revil'd and perſecuted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patient</hi>'s Caſe was very piteous: It ſhould have pleaded with 'em to have carry'd him to Chriſt, and beſought Him to have Compaſſion on him. But on the contrary they play the <hi>Spies</hi> upon our Lord, that they might accuſe him for a <hi>Breaker</hi> of the Sabbath. They doubtleſs <hi>hop'd</hi> in their Hearts, that Chriſt would not fail to <hi>heal</hi> him, but not from the leaſt <hi>Pity</hi> to the miſerable Object before them, nay from a diabolical Spirit of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> on Chriſt, when he had heal'd him. That which ſhould have <hi>charm'd</hi> 'em into the higheſt Reverence and Love, provok'd their Rage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004353_0005_100449BDA535BDD8"/>
To ſhame 'em out of their Ignorance and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to inform their Judgment and move their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, our Lord bid the Man <hi>ſtand forth;</hi> and then <hi>reaſon'd</hi> the Matter with them: "<hi>Is it lawful,</hi> ſaid He, <hi>to do good on the Sabbath-days, or to do evil? to ſave Life or to kill?—but they held their Peace.</hi> He put it to their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> but they obſtinately reſiſted the Light and <hi>Conviction</hi> they felt within themſelves; and having nothing to ſay <hi>againſt</hi> ſo clear a Truth, they would however ſay nothing <hi>for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Lord</hi> beheld this with great Grief and Anger; "<hi>He looked round about on 'em with Anger, being grieved for the Hardneſs of their Hearts.</hi> Juſtly was he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked at the Sin, yet kindly grieved for the Sinners. They <hi>hated</hi> him for his Goodneſs, and he <hi>pitied</hi> them for their horrid Impiety and Hypocrify.</p>
            <p>He <hi>look'd</hi>— his Anger appear'd in his <hi>Face.</hi> His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was very juſt and <hi>holy,</hi> for he was angry at their <hi>Sin.</hi> He was griev'd at their <hi>Hardneſs,</hi> to ſee 'em obſtinately ſet againſt Conviction. There is nothing ſhould give us ſo much <hi>Grief,</hi> as to feel the Hardneſs of our <hi>own</hi> Hearts, and to ſee that of <hi>others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, neither their <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and the Offence they took, nor the malicious <hi>Uſe</hi> they reſolved to make of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> curing the poor Man, could <hi>hinder</hi> our Lord from doing it. It was a moſt known Act of Goodneſs, and He reſolutely did it; as we read in my <hi>Text,—He ſaid to the Man, Stretch forth thy Hand! and he ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out, and his Hand was reſtored whole as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may ſeem a <hi>ſtrange</hi> kind of Command given to the <hi>Man,</hi> for his Hand was <hi>withered:</hi> How then could he be required to <hi>ſtretch it out?</hi> It was not in his <hi>Power,</hi> it was a thing <hi>impoſſible</hi> for him to do; and it might therefore ſeem <hi>vain</hi> to attempt it.</p>
            <p>But ſee the good <hi>Effect</hi> of our Lord's commanding him! <hi>Power</hi> accompanied the Precept; Power was
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004353_0006_1004499BE8DD4208"/>given him to obey it. He <hi>tried</hi> at the Word of Chriſt, and found <hi>Strength</hi> put into the Arm, and out it <hi>ſtretch'd;</hi> yea and was <hi>reſtored whole</hi> as the other. The Effect was ſudden and perfect, in an <hi>Inſtant,</hi> like the Work of GOD. He found the <hi>Cure</hi> wro't, upon his firſt <hi>Eſſay</hi> to obey. CHRIST <hi>ſpake and it was done!</hi> ſo the FATHER <hi>worketh ſtill, and He works.</hi> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Man <hi>tried</hi> to obey, and was <hi>enabled</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
            <p>It was his <hi>right Hand,</hi> Luke vi. 6. The Hand with which he had wrought, or was to work for his <hi>Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> at his Trade or Calling. It is ſaid, he was a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> or <hi>Bricklayer</hi>

            <p>It was a very <hi>teaching Miracle,</hi> and is fit to be ſpoken of and <hi>ſpiritualiz'd</hi> in all the Churches of the Saints. This <hi>Day</hi> might it be <hi>verified</hi> upon <hi>Us</hi> our ſelves. Many a Time it has been, ſince our Lord's <hi>Aſcention,</hi> in the <hi>Spirit,</hi> tho' not in the <hi>Letter.</hi>

            <p>It is not indeed now the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> yet are we aſſembled for the ſolemn <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God; and our LORD JESUS is <hi>preſent</hi> in his Ordinances, and here are <hi>Souls</hi> whoſe Powers to what is ſpiritual and holy are <hi>withered;</hi> and what ſhould they come hither for, but <hi>Healing</hi> and Recovery? and what is the <hi>Voice of Chriſt</hi> to them here, but this in my <hi>Text? "Stand forth,</hi> and <hi>lift up</hi> thy Heart to me, and be made <hi>whole.</hi>

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> truly is with his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Ordinances. He works with them, in them and by them. This is to <hi>Souls,</hi> what the Waters of <hi>Jordan</hi> were to <hi>Naaman,</hi> for his Healing: the Waters of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> ſanctified for the Uſe and Benefit of Souls. Chriſt <hi>worketh hitherto,</hi> and the Day of our <hi>Holy Reſt</hi> is the Day and Seaſon of his Working on our Souls for their everlaſting Good. His <hi>Reſt</hi> is glorious in the ſaving Operations of his <hi>Holy Spirit. He</hi> only, by the Power of his Grace, can heal our Souls. It is not within the Power of <hi>Means</hi> or Inſtruments to reach the Soul, or produce a <hi>ſaving</hi> Effect; but it is the <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> and peculiar Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone to put <hi>Life</hi> into dead Souls, or Strength into <hi>feeble</hi> Minds, and <hi>to work in us both to will and to do of his good Pleaſure.</hi>

            <p>Truly <hi>in vain</hi> do we go to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of God at any Time, in vain do we wait on our <hi>Miniſtring,</hi> or uſe the <hi>Inſtituted Means</hi> of Grace, if we do not believe, realize and rely on the Preſence of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Bleſſing of his <hi>Spirit</hi> neceſſary for the <hi>healing</hi> of our Souls. We read of a <hi>certain Day, as Chriſt was teaching, that the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004353_0012_1004499F37E6D250"/>Power of the Lord was preſent to heal,</hi> Luke v. 17. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is always thus, when ever the <hi>Word of Chriſt</hi> is duely preached, his <hi>Power is preſent</hi> as it ſeems good in his Eyes, to heal what Souls he will.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Call of the Word to impotent Souls is always in effect this, "ſtretch out thy Hand.</hi> The <hi>Lord</hi> now ſays ſo to every one here preſent before him. He ſaith</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Imploy thoſe Hands in holy Endeavours, to work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling, for I am ready to work in you to will and to do,</hi> Philip. ii. 13. As he who will <hi>not work</hi> with his Hands, neither ſhall he <hi>eat,</hi> by the Order of the Goſpel; ſo he who will not <hi>improve</hi> the Powers of his Soul in working out his own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhall never be <hi>ſaved.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls upon ſtrong and weak together, but eſpecially upon the <hi>Feeble</hi> of the Flock, to <hi>lift up the Hands that hang down, and make ſtrait Paths for their Feet,</hi> Heb. xii. 12. We have a <hi>Race</hi> ſet before us to <hi>run,</hi> and the good <hi>Warfare</hi> and <hi>Fight of Faith,</hi> which call us to put forth all our <hi>Agility</hi> and Might. Yea with <hi>all our Might</hi> we muſt ſet our ſelves to <hi>do,</hi> whatever our Hand <hi>findeth</hi> to be done, in the great Work of God and our Souls, becauſe there is <hi>no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wiſdom in the Grave, whither we are going,</hi> Eccleſ. ix. 10.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God calls us <hi>to lift up our Hands to Him in Prayer, for Life and Strength and Vigour; "that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in all our Needs,</hi> Heb iv. 16. When we <hi>pray</hi> and when we <hi>praiſe</hi> we are ſaid to <hi>lift up</hi> our Hands in God's Name, and alſo to <hi>ſtretch</hi> them forth to Him. It is a <hi>Sign</hi> of ſpiritual Life and Strength received, and a bleſſed <hi>Means</hi> of receiving more. Prayer and Labour ſhould go together, as in providing for the natural Life, ſo alſo for the Spiritual; firſt ſtretch out the <hi>Arm</hi> in Prayer, and then imploy it alſo in diligent Working: Receive Strength <hi>from God</hi> by the one, and then lay it out <hi>for God</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Call of God</hi> to us in his Word is, <hi>that by the Hand of Taith we lay hold of Chriſt and Eternal Life.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004353_0013_100449C51039BF60"/>We can neither pray nor work without <hi>Faith.</hi> It is Faith that gives a Soul <hi>Life,</hi> Strength, Activity. If Faith be <hi>weak,</hi> the Hands hang down and the <hi>Knees</hi> are feeble. Faith makes Prayer <hi>fervent and effectual,</hi> it <hi>wreſtles</hi> and holds the <hi>Angel</hi> and prevails. It lays <hi>hold</hi> on the Power and Mercy and Truth of God; on the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, on all the precious Promiſes in Him, and keeps its Hold. <hi>Moſes</hi> by Faith <hi>held up</hi> his Hand in the Mount, and kept it up till the Evening, and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Faith <hi>ſpread forth</hi> his Arms toward Heaven. We are alſo taught the Exerciſe of Faith, and the Property of it, in thoſe Precepts and Phraſes, truly Evangelical; "<hi>Lay hold on Eternal Life; lay hold on the Hope before you.
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 12. <hi>Hebr.</hi> vi. 18.</note>. Faith</hi> is to the <hi>Soul</hi> in doing this, as the <hi>Hand</hi> is to the Body.</p>
            <p>Thus as often as we come up to the Houſe of God to <hi>pray</hi> or <hi>hear,</hi> the Voice of God to us is in effect this, "<hi>Impotent Soul, ſtretch forth thy Hand.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Impotent as we are, the Lord expects that we try to exert our ſelves, as well as we can, and in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we can, under the Call of his Word.</hi> When God commands us to do that which is holy and ſpiritual, his Right from us by the Conſtitution of our Nature, we may not think to excuſe our ſelves from our Obligation thereto, by pleading the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> and <hi>Indiſpoſition</hi> which we have wickedly bro't upon our Selves. No, up and <hi>try</hi> and do as thou art <hi>bid.</hi> God looks for ſome Endeavour, and an inſtant <hi>Sign</hi> at leaſt of a <hi>Mind</hi> to obey, if you could; and a <hi>Will</hi> to do what you <hi>can.</hi> And ſurely there is ſomething to be <hi>done</hi> &amp; that you <hi>can</hi> do toward the thing required of you; tho' the thing it ſelf be beyond your Ability.</p>
            <p>The God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not like the <hi>Egyptian Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters,</hi> nor their <hi>Tyrant Pharaob,</hi> who exacted the whole Tale of <hi>Bricks</hi> when he refus'd them the <hi>Straw!</hi> No, He will find thee both <hi>Materials</hi> and Wiſdom and Strength, if you <hi>liſten</hi> to his Word and ſtrive to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004353_0014_100449A227131CE0"/>obey it. — You muſt ſay at leaſt, "<hi>Lord, what will thou have me to do?</hi> O work it in me, both to will and to do it! Would that I had a <hi>Heart</hi> and Power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form! Prepare this in me, and me for thy Self!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaw the impotent Man lying at the <hi>Pool,</hi> and long had he lain there for Healing, with a <hi>patient</hi> Hope and much Deſire; the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to him, "<hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> He anſwered, "<hi>Sir, I have no Man when the Water is troubled to put me into the Pool, but while I am coming another ſteppeth down before me,</hi> John v. 7. q. d "Ah Lord! <hi>willing</hi> to be made whole?

Good <hi>Sir,</hi> will <hi>You</hi> ſtay and do me this merciful Office?— Tho' he cou'd do <hi>no</hi> more for himſelf, tho' he could not <hi>ſtir</hi> a Hand or Foot, yet this his Wiſh and <hi>waiting</hi> in the Means of healing, was his Preparation thro' Grace for his finding Favour in the Sight of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Mercy from his Hand. — So <hi>You,</hi> impotent <hi>Soul,</hi> muſt expreſs your reverend Regards to the <hi>Lord</hi> that heals, to the expected and deſired <hi>Cure,</hi> and to the <hi>Means</hi> ordained of God, where he commands the <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> So You muſt confide in and look for his Preſence in and with his Word; receiving it not <hi>as the Word of Man, but as it is indeed the Word of God, which work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth effectually</hi> when and as he pleaſes. 1 Theſſ. ii. 13. And this leads me to add in the laſt Place,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>If we are not groſly wanting to God and our own Souls, in doing what we eaſily might, the gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt and his efficacious Bleſſing would be found in and with his Word upon our Souls, unto all ſaving Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Purpoſes.</hi> The Mercy and Grace of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and propoſed to us in the Goſpel, ſuppoſes this.

            <p>Believe it, that Chriſt ſays to <hi>You</hi> this Day, as to the <hi>impotent Man</hi> of old, "<hi>Stand forth now in the midſt!</hi> preſent thy ſelf <hi>before me,</hi> who ſees thy <hi>Spirit,</hi> now in the Preſence of theſe my People!— And might the bleſſed <hi>Spirit</hi> of God now <hi>ſingle</hi> out every <hi>One</hi> as by his <hi>Name!</hi> to <hi>Thee</hi> perſonally, to each <hi>Individual,</hi> it is ſaid! And do <hi>thou</hi> ſay unto thy Self, "<hi>I am the Man, Woman</hi> or <hi>Child!</hi> and come forth. The Word of thy <hi>Saviour</hi> to thee is, "<hi>Stretch out thy Hand!</hi> exert the remaining Powers of thy feeble Soul, and lift it unto God. — What! will you not <hi>try?</hi> no not to move a <hi>Hand,</hi> or ſtir a <hi>Finger</hi> at his Word! who <hi>made</hi> thy Hand, and Mouth and living Soul! can he not upon thy Wiſh and Prayer to <hi>move,</hi> give Strength to <hi>leap up,</hi> as the Feet and Ankle Bones of the <hi>Cripple</hi> found at the <hi>Temple Gate,</hi> Acts iii. 7.

Can he trifle with thee in things of an everlaſting Conſequence! He is ſerious, hearty and in good Earneſt with thee in the momentous Matter of <hi>Life and Death,</hi> whereon thy everlaſting Weal or Woe is depending. — Ah! that <hi>we</hi> were but as <hi>truly</hi> and as much concern'd for our own ſpiritual and eternal Welfare! but we dally and <hi>trifle</hi> with Heaven, and at laſt to excuſe our own <hi>Sloth</hi> and Folly in the great Concerns of our Souls, we are ready with the wicked and <hi>idle Servant</hi> to caſt the Blame on God, and ſay,— "<hi>Lord, I know that thou art an hard Man, reaping where thou haſt not ſtrowed; ſo I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, and went and hid my Talent in the Earth; lo, there thou haſt that was thine,</hi> Matth. xxv. 25.

            <p>Suffer me then to ſpeak a little in God's behalf!

            <p n="1">I. <hi>There is no Inability ever to be pleaded, where Chriſt commands.</hi> For wilt thou dare to object againſt a plain Order and Command of God, or queſtion the Equity or Righteouſneſs of what He requires? If He bid thee go on the <hi>Waters,</hi> they ſhall <hi>bear</hi> thee, as they did <hi>Peter,</hi> till his <hi>Faith ſank;</hi> or if he order thee thro' the <hi>Fires,</hi> thou ſhalt bear them; and as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks ſhalt not be <hi>burnt.</hi> If he bid thee <hi>fly</hi> up to Heaven, he will give thee Faith and <hi>Eagles Wings,</hi> or his <hi>Angels</hi> ſhall bear thee up in their Arms. No <hi>Heſitancy</hi> may be allow'd in us, where God poſitively declares his Will. "<hi>Lord</hi> ſaid <hi>Moſes, I am not Eloquent, but of a ſlow Tongue, a well ſince Thou haſt ſpoken to me, as before!</hi> And the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to him, "<hi>Who hath made Man's Mouth? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">II. <hi>Not to offer and attempt when God commands plain Diſobedience. Angels</hi> ſtand ready all Ways to <hi>fly</hi> God's Order: they <hi>excel in Strength</hi> by <hi>hearkning

So ſhines the <hi>Father of the Faithful</hi> in the Eyes of all his ſpiritual <hi>Seed,</hi> their bright <hi>Leader</hi> and Example to the End of the World! and ſo <hi>ſhone</hi> he in the Sight of God and of his <hi>Angels:</hi> Gen. xxii. 12, 16. "<hi>Now know I that thou feareſt God!</hi> And <hi>by my Self have I ſworn ſaith the Lord, becauſe thou haſt done this thing, that in bleſſing I will bleſs thee! becauſe thou haſt obeyed my Voice.</hi> It is thus always with the Soul, whom it pleaſes God to <hi>call by his Grace,</hi> and <hi>to reveal his Son in;</hi> immediately <hi>it confers not with Fleſh and Blood;</hi> raiſes no <hi>Scruples,</hi> makes no <hi>Objection,</hi> but is all <hi>Ear</hi> and Duty; "<hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

            <p n="3">III. <hi>It is no ways unjuſt or abſurd for God to command us to do thoſe things, which of our Selves we are unable to do, becauſe He is able to make all Grace to abound to us, and to give us an Alſufficiency in all things, unto our abounding to every good Word and Work,</hi> 2 Cor. ix. 8. We may not <hi>ſtagger</hi> at any Precept or Promiſe of God, no not tho' our <hi>Soul be dead</hi> to it as was <hi>Abraham's Body.</hi> When the <hi>Lord</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Apoſtle Paul, "My Grace is ſufficient for Thee; for my Strength is made perfect in Weakneſs;</hi> how nobly did the <hi>Saint</hi> anſwer? "<hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Chriſt may reſt upon me,</hi> 2 Cor. xii 9.

            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>There is a Promiſe of Grace given with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, which every one, ſet to obey, may humbly and confidently depend upon.</hi> Prov i. 23. <hi>Turn you at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto You, I will make known my Words to you.</hi> Iſai. xliv. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Yet now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

For I will pour Water upon Him that is thirſty, and Floods on the dry Ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thy Offspring! And they ſhall ſpring up as among the Graſs, as Willows by the Water-courſes: One ſhall ſay, I am the Lord's! and another ſhall call himſelf by the Name of Jacob; and another ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe with his Hand to the Lord, and ſurname himſelf by the Name of Iſrael. Thus ſaith the Lord the King of Iſrael, and his Redeemer the Lord of Hoſts; "I am the firſt and I am the laſt, and beſide Me there is no God: And who, as I, ſhall call, and ſhall declare it, and ſet it in Order for me, ſince I appointed the ancient People? and the things that are coming and ſhall come? let them ſhew them.

VI. <hi>They that are ſaved have nothing to boaſt of, but the whole Glory muſt be given to the free Grace of God alone, and his Almighty Power.</hi> What tho' the poor Man <hi>did</hi> at the Command of Chriſt <hi>ſtretch</hi> forth his Hand, and found it immediately <hi>reſtored!</hi> What tho' the <hi>Cripple look'd</hi> wiſhfully at the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and at the Name of JESUS leapt up on his Legs! What tho' the the <hi>Lepers</hi> went to waſh in Obedience to the Word of Chriſt, and as they were going found themſelves <hi>made clean!</hi> was there any thing in the <hi>Obedience</hi> of one or other of them that could <hi>claim</hi> any part of the <hi>Glory</hi> of the Cure?

            </p>
            <p>With all our Soul and Mind and Strength we muſt endeavour to comply with the Demands of the Goſpel, but at the ſame time (as <hi>Workers together with God,</hi> and altogether under Him) to <hi>rely</hi> on Him alone to <hi>work all in us and for us.</hi> The <hi>little</hi> Powers we have we muſt <hi>put forth,</hi> for Strength to do the <hi>whole</hi> Will of God; but our <hi>Dependance</hi> on God muſt be ſuch as the greateſt <hi>Inability</hi> to the <hi>leaſt</hi> of it can ſuppoſe.
