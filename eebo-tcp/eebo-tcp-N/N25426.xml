            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ENCOURAGED by the opinion of Friends, whoſe partiality for the Author has, perhaps, miſled their judgment, ſhe humbly ventures to preſent the following work to her fair Countrywomen. She truſts the heart of ſenſibility will not find it deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of merit. Imperfections it undoubtedly has—for what human performance is free of them? But, as it is her firſt public at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, not originally meant for the preſs, ſhe hopes the eye of criticiſm will be turned aſide, and ſuch allowances made, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour may authorize, and liberality ſuggeſt. Of one point ſhe is conſcious—that a good intention has guided her pen—and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be found in it, militating againſt the moſt rigid principles of virtue, ſhe hopes for indulgence at leaſt, if ſhe is not honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with approbation, or encouraged by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>

            <head>THE FORTUNATE DISCOVERY: OR, THE HISTORY OF HENRY VILLARS.</head>
            <p>IN a remote village in the northern parts of the State of New-York, on the ſide of a river beautifully ſhaded with ancient oaks, around whoſe branches the bellvine and honey-ſuckle wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly crept, ſtood a ſmall houſe, or cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, environed with hawthorn; beneath whoſe foilage, the meandering rivulet ſoftly ſtole: Nature had made up the deficiency of Art, to render this little habitation truly delightful. At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the conteſt with Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Mr. Villars, with his amiable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:033744_0004_0FF90881F8754AF8"/>
retired to this ſequeſtered ſpot, to ſhun the din of war; troubles in early life, had fixed a ſettled melancholly in his diſpoſition, that ſuited beſt with retirement, particularly at this time, when the feeling heart muſt be ever affected with the diſtreſſes of others. Mr. Villars was a Briton; but prepoſſeſſed in favour of America: and though he wiſhed to ſee her independent, he felt for his countrymen. Mrs. Villars was an amiable woman, and ſtill handſome; though trouble had greatly impaired her charms: her now darling employment, was forming the young mind of her daughter Louiſa, whom ſhe ſaw daily improving; ſhe was now entering her ſevententh year, and her beauty, though excelled by few, was her leaſt perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mr. Villars, equally employed his time with two fine boys, whoſe good qualities promiſed amply to repay his care; in this manner they had paſſed
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:033744_0005_0FF908875A2BB8E8"/>
the three firſt years of the war—and enjoyed a tranquillity, little known at thoſe times: when they were alarmed on hearing the enemy faſt: approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for many days, they heard frequent ſkirmiſhes at a little diſtance. One evening Louiſa, accompanied by her younger brother Charles, was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the banks of the river, the ſun juſt ſinking below the horizon, the chanting of the birds, and the beauty of the evening, lulled her into a pleaſing reverie, and ſhe wandered ſhe knew not whither; nor did ſhe think of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety, till reminded by her brother of the diſtance they were from home; at that inſtant a beautiful little ſpaniel came up to them, and fawned on Louiſa, then whining, ran into an adjacent thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; ſhe immediately followed him, and perceived a young man on the ground, to all appearance dead; who by his dreſs appeared to be a Britiſh officer. Louiſa
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033744_0006_0FF9088921961D30"/>
ſhrieked, and was running away; when the humane little Charles ſaid, "My dear ſiſter, perhaps the gentleman is not dead, and we may be of ſervice to him."</p>
            <p>LOUISA, ever alive to the calls of humanity, ſummoned all her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and advanced to the young man; holding ſalts to his noſe, ſhe perceived him breathe. At this inſtant an officer arrived with ſome water in his hat; ſeeing Louiſa (who was about to fly when ſhe perceived him.) He cried, "Ah, fair ſtranger, art thou human, or an angel, ſent to relieve the diſtreſſed?" She ſtopped, almoſt ready to faint with fright. Be not terrified, Madam, ſaid he, "but tell me where I may carry my dying friend." She deſired he would ſtay with him, while ſhe ran for her father; ſhe flew home with the utmoſt precipitation; and acquainted Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033744_0007_0FF908901F5F4BB8"/>
he was ever happy to be of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to his fellow-creatures, waited not a moment; but went with his ſervants, had the gentleman brought home, and put to bed; a ſurgeon was ſent for, who pronounced the wounds not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but he had ſuffered ſo much from loſs of blood, and want of timely aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the greateſt care was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. After his wounds had been dreſſed ſome time, he opened his eyes; and ſeeing his friend by his bed ſide, ſaid, "Where am I, my dear Henry?" "Under the roof of hoſpitality," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, "Compoſe yourſelf for the preſent, William, you ſhall know all hereafter." "But to whom beſides your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf am I obliged?" "Talk not to <hi>me</hi> of obligation" anſwered his friend, "Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has ſent an Angel in the form of a young lady, to our relief, and her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent father, has treated you as his child." During this converſation, Mr.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033744_0008_0FF9089343DAE0A0"/>
Villars, had retired to the other end of the room, perhaps he had his emotion. —He was extremely happy to have it in his power, to be of ſervice to the wounded gentleman; but there was ſomething in the voice, and manners of his friend, that ſtruck him ſo forcibly, he could not account for it; and his great reſemblance to a perſon we ſhall hereafter mention, entirely abſorbed him in thought; when the young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came to him, and begged he would accept the thanks of his friend, who was now able to ſpeak to him. Mr. Villars approached the bed, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bellmore (for that was his name) thanked him in the moſt grateful terms for his extreme kindneſs; the good man told him, "to make himſelf as eaſy as his ſituation would permit, as his ſpeedy recovery, depended greatly on his being quite tranquil. "Alas, ſir" returned he, "I am perfectly eaſy on
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033744_0009_0FF90897F655B2D0"/>
my own account, but very unhappy on my friends. Mr. Hargrave has left his camp, in ſearch of me; and I fear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports will be circulated, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his honour." Mr. Villars ſtarted at the thought, and turning to Mr. Hargrave, (who ſat in a deep reverie) ſaid, "Can I, ſir, be of ſervice to you?" this was pronounced with ſo much tenderneſs, that Mr. Hargrave, before greatly prepoſſeſſed in his favour, now felt an emotion, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; bowing very reſpectfully, he ſaid, "His ſituation indeed required a friend:" —Mr. Villars told him it was late, and it was neceſſary Captain Bellmore ſhould reſt, begged him to join his wife and daughter in this little parlour; promiſing Mr. Bellmore to do every thing in his power to ſerve his friend, he wiſhed him a good night.—Mrs. Villars and Louiſa choſe to receive Mr. Hargrave, and eagerly enquired after his friend. "He is much
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033744_0010_0FF90899B61F1270"/>
better, Ladies," ſaid he; and I hope, Madam (addreſſing himſelf to Louiſa) will in a ſhort time be able to thank you as his guardian angel. Louiſa bluſhed; and only curtſied. Mr. Villars then beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Mr. Hargrave to inform them the manner of his friend's being wounded, and his leaving the camp.—"He told them, the day before they had had a ſmart ſkirmiſh—that the party returned with an account of Captain Bellmore's being miſſing. A deſerter coming in ſoon after, informed them he was lying on the field, he believed not quite dead. —I immediately applied for a flag, to go in ſearch of him; but the orders was to march, and it could not be obtained. Our commanding officer was newly put in, or this would not have been the caſe. —Diſguſted with the brutality of our colonel, and a heart bleeding for my friend, I took the advantage of the night, and left the camp in ſearch of him—it
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033744_0011_0FF9089F13E49720"/>
was near morning ere I found him. Alas! how can I deſcribe my feelings, on ſeeing him in ſuch a ſituation. I took him in my arms to a river not far diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, waſhed the blood from his face, and bound up his wounds with my hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief. After drinking a little water, he ſeemed to recover: I ſaw a light at a diſtance, and endeavoured to carry him to it; but I was deceived—it was only a vapour.</p>
            <p>THE morn arrived, but with it no gleam of hope; I had wandered the whole day, ſupporting my friend, I may ſay, carrying him; for he frequently fainted. I had at length brought him to the bank of the river, where Miſs Villars found him. He had loſt ſo much blood, and was ſo exhauſted with endeavouring to travel, that I thought he would have expired. He begged me to leave him, and take care of myſelf.—
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033744_0012_0FF908A3CDBF6CA8"/>
"My dear Harry," ſaid he, "I feel I cannot live—why will you endanger yourſelf—comfort my parents—farewell my friend."</p>
            <p>I HAD not time to tell him, I would never leave him, when he again fainted. I ran for water to the river; when at my return, to my inexpreſſible joy, I beheld Miſs Villars. Heaven had heard my prayer, and ſent relief when I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of finding it."—Mr. Villars and the Ladies, highly commended Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave's humanity. The former ſaid, "When things were properly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, his leaving the camp would be deemed meritorious. He thought it would be dangerous to attempt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That as he was ever an enemy to diſſimulation, he would adviſe him to write to the general, and inform him of every circumſtance, and in the interim, to give himſelf up as a priſoner of war;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033744_0013_0FF908A61F2E5490"/>
he made no doubt of his being very ſoon exchanged."</p>
            <p>THE young gentleman very politely thanked him for his advice, and ſaid he would be entirely directed by him; then ſeparated for the night; but not to ſleep. Mr. and Mrs. Villars, though they ſaw ſomething in Mr. Hargrave that intereſted them very much in his favour, they wiſhed to be more particularly acquainted with him. Miſs Villars gentle heart was touched with compaſſion: the ſcene ſhe had been witneſs to, preyed ſo forcibly on her ſpirits, that ſhe could not ſleep. At one moment, ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bellmore on the ground, juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring: at another, Hargrave dragged to priſon as a ſpy. The next morning the ſurgeon arrived; he ſaid "Captain Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more was greatly recovered, and he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in no danger;" which gave univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſatisfaction to this benevolent family.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033744_0014_0FF908AACB3A6B90"/>
Mr. Hargrave was ſo rejoiced at his friend's recovery, that he forgot his own tuation, until reminded by Mr Villars; who propoſed going with him to his commanding officer, whoſe quarters was not above twenty miles diſtence. The buſineſs was ſoon ſettled; Mr. Villars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them leave of abſence, and they returned to the great ſatisfaction of Captain Bellmore, who was much more anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his friend than himſelf. After a few days, he was able to ſit up; he begged Mr. Hargrave would intreat the Ladies permiſſion for him to thank them in perſon, for the favours he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: he complied with his requeſt. Mrs. Villars told him, ſmiling, "She was happy his friend was well enough to ſee company; that they would do themſelves the pleaſure of taking a diſh of tea with him that afternoon. —Louiſa appeared more lovely than uſual; her dreſs, which was ſimplicity
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033744_0015_0FF908AD19AC5F58"/>
itſelf, added to charms, already height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, by the heart-felt ſatisfaction of having been ſerviceable to the diſtreſſed. —Mr. Villars attended the Ladies to the room, where Mr. Hargrave waited to receive them: he introduced Louiſa to his friend, "As the perſon they were ſo much indebted to." At that moment, the little ſpaniel jumped on her lap, and licked her hands: Louiſa careſſed him, and mentioned his coming to her on the bank of the river, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſs he ſeemed in. It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to relate the many obliging things that was ſaid:—the afternoon paſſed away in a moſt agreeable manner: they parted equally pleaſed with each other. Capt. Bellmore told the Ladies, that it would greatly add to his recovery, if they would favour him with their company often; which they promiſing to do, wiſhed him a good evening.— "You are a happy fellow, Harry (ſaid he,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033744_0016_0FF908AFF585FB08"/>
with a ſigh,) to wait on this divine girl in all her little excurſions."—He then launched out ſo largely in Louiſa's praiſe, that his friend rallied him; telling him, "He believed the laſt wound he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, would be the moſt obſtinate to cure:"—Upon my word, Will," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued he, "I believe your caſe is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate—Miſs Villars improves ſo much on acquaintance, that I have little hopes of you.—"And do you really believe I am in love with Miſs Villars?"—"Moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely I do; for though I have had the pleaſure of ſeeing her theſe ſix days paſt, and been indulged with her agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converſation, I have not thought half the fine things of her, that you have ſaid within this quarter of an hour."—"Can it be poſſible Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars has not charmed you? Is there any thing in her you can diſapprove?" Do not miſtake me, my dear Will; ſhe is a moſt deſerving girl. I have at
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033744_0017_0FF908B493C83580"/>
this moment, a ſincere affection for her, and would riſk my life to ſerve her; but love is quite out of the queſtion; ſo you ſee I ſhall be no rival—but upon my ſoul, you muſt not trifle with her." "Can you be ſerious—do you think, ſaid Captain Bellmore, "if it was, as you ſuppoſe, I could be guilty of trifling with ſuch a girl." "No, no, my friend," returned Hargrave, "I know your goodneſs of heart better: but I muſt now bid you good night, and join the agreeable group in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and ſtrive to find out in the languid blue eyes of the fair Louiſa, what effect your black ones have had." Saying this, he left him, and joined the family at ſupper. Mr. Villars propoſed, ſince company was ſo agreeable to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bellmore, Mrs. Villars would take her work into his room the next day; and Louiſa ſhould read for his amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. (Louiſa bluſhed, ſhe knew not
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033744_0018_0FF908BB4EBFB220"/>
why;) Mr. Hargrave politely thanked Mr. Villars for this mark of attention; they ſoon after retired. Louiſa, not much inclined to ſleep, ſat down and wrote the following letter, to Miſs Sommers:

                     <p>YOU have often, my dear Eliza, called me the recluſe of the foreſt; and rallied me upon having no adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to write. I have now, my dear, one to acquaint you with, which will exceed your moſt ſanguine expectation. I was laſt Wedneſday evening, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the banks of the river, near our houſe;—thinking of my Eliza, and the many happy days I have ſpent

                     <p>AS Captain Bellmore is now able to ſit up, we this afternoon paid him a viſit. When I firſt ſaw him, I was too much terrified, to take particular notice of him; I only obſerved, he was young and handſome; but to day I thought I never ſaw any one ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging. His perſon is ſymmetry itſelf; rather above the common ſize;—his hair is a bright cheſnut, and he has the fineſt: eyes and teeth, I ever ſaw. Mr. Hargrave, his friend, is a moſt agreeable man, and very handſome. Papa ſeems much pleaſed with his

            <p>IN a ſhort time, Captain Bellmore was able to leave his room; he would often read to the Ladies while they were at work. Mr. Hargrave's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures were not wrong; the young Captain's thoughts were continually fixed on the fair Louiſa; he was never happy but in her company—when ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he was meditating whether he ought, and how he ſhould, diſcover his ſentiments; he viewed the many
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033744_0021_0FF908CBD33D5E88"/>
bars to his happineſs—his family was noble, and of unbounded ambition; there was no probability of his father's conſenting to his union. He thought he ſaw ſomething in Mr. Villar's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, that pronounced them of a much higher rank than they at preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in; he wiſhed to be acquainted with their connections, but had not reſolution to break the ſubject: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were, or were not, what they appeared to be, he had never har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a diſhonourable thought. The anxiety of his mind, retarded his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; and his friends were ſorry to find he did not gain ſtrength as faſt as they firſt expected. "Adviſe me my Harry," ſaid he to his friend, "I love the divine Louiſa, but would I not be a villain, to endeavour to gain her affections, when I am certain my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (on whom you know I am entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dependant,) will never conſent to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033744_0022_0FF908CE24D52748"/>
my marrying her." "You are not ſo ſure of that," returned his friend, "you can but aſk it; ſhould it be refuſed. and you are happy enough to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Miſs Villars, you are both young and can wait; you have great reaſon to expect promotion—as your father's intereſt can at any time procure you a regiment, you may then pleaſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf." Mr. Hargrave, though he ſpoke in this manner, had not the moſt diſtant idea of Sir John Bellmore's conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſon's union, but he wiſhed to encourage his hopes, as he feared the conſequence of his preſent uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One day, after a converſation of this kind, Capt. Bellmore went to walk in a wood adjoining the garden. Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa was ſitting in an arbour of jeſamine, careſſing the favourite ſpaniel, when lifting up her eyes, ſhe ſaw Capt. Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more approaching. "Happy Juba!" ſaid he—at the ſame time, looking
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033744_0023_0FF908D1D9F32488"/>
with uncommon tenderneſs at Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who had aroſe to retire as he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the arbour; begged her pardon, ſaid he would begone in a moment, if ſhe wiſhed to be alone." No indeed, I do not," ſaid ſhe with an artleſs bluſh; at this he led her back to the ſeat, and taking one of her hands, which he preſſed with ardour to his breaſt, "Will then my moſt adored Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, permit me a few moments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation." Louiſa had ſpoke before ſhe thought, but it was now too late to rectify her miſtake, without appearing to underſtand him; ſo careleſsly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew her hand, ſhe picked a ſprig of jeſſamine, and aſked him, "If he did not think it would make a handſomer wreath, than laurel?" He ſaid he ſhould not eſteem either, unleſs he could have the honour of laying them at her feet.—Poor Louiſa had undeſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly led to the ſubject ſhe moſt wiſhed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033744_0024_0FF908D375C88E00"/>
to avoid; not that it was diſagreeable to her; but her father had taught her to believe, that marriages without the ſanction of Parents, would ever be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; and from the ſketches ſhe had heard from the gentlemens converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir John Bellmore's family, ſhe had no hope of his conſenting to his ſons marrying without the lady was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a large fortune, ſhe endeavoured to again wave the ſubject; but the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, was too favourable to his wiſhes to let it eſcape; he threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at her feet, and opening his heart, told her, "it was not in the power of riches, or preferment, to make him happy, without her; that he had no great reaſon to imagine his father would conſent to his marriage; but he hoped as he had pretty good intereſt in the army, to be ſoon independent."— Louiſa had heard him patiently till now, ſaid, "O, Sir, do not think you will ever be independent of the duty you
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033744_0025_0FF908D833D54980"/>
owe your parents;" I muſt not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, hear you any longer upon this ſubject." At theſe words ſhe roſe, and was leaving the arbour, but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her; and intreated, "She would not drive him to deſpair, to tell him at leaſt ſhe did not hate him."— "hate you, Captain Bellmore. Oh, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!—"If you do not hate me, my angel, ſaid he, do not make the life you ſaved miſerable, by refuſing me to hope for the only thing, that can make it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable." Their ſtay had been longer in the arbour than either imagined, and juſt as he had done ſpeaking, they heard Mr. Villars, and Mr. Hargrave, return from hunting; Louiſa then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon going, "as her Mamma would wonder at her long ſtay." Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter making her promiſe to hear him on the ſubject again, he permitted her to go, and took a walk to the woods, while Louiſa returned to the houſe.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033744_0026_0FF908DD1851A5A0"/>
Unuſed to artifice, ſhe could not eaſily get the better of the confuſion ſhe was thrown in, by the above converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which was not a little augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by her Mamma's aſking her, "where ſhe had been; ſhe however, anſwered pretty well, "in the jeſſamine bower, Mamma, making this wreath." Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave going up to her in a gay man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, aſked, whoſe "happy brows was to be crowned with <hi>that</hi> wreath:" but ſaid he, ſmiling, "what is become of the Capt. has he been making wreaths too." "I—I—I don't know," ſaid Louiſa, ſtammering; Hargrave thought by her confuſion, all was out: giving her a ſignificant look (which Louiſa perfectly underſtoood,) "I will go look for him, ſaid he, "he is grown of late ſo fond of roſeat bowers, and purling ſtreams, that I am poſitively afraid he'll turn poet." So ſaying he left her, and went in ſearch of the Captain, whom he found
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033744_0027_0FF908E2B5BCED70"/>
ſitting on the bank of the river, ſo loſt in thought that he approached nigh enough to ſlap him on the ſhoulder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he perceived him: "Come," ſaid he, "Mr. Villars is making a bowl of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant punch, but I ſuppoſe you have been ſipping the nectar of Miſs Villars's converſation, in the garden;" "Why do you think I have ſeen her there?" returned the Captain; becauſe the roſes were heightened in her cheeks, and the pretty confuſion ſhe was in, when I aſked her where you was, made me imagine you had been aſſiſting her, to make that beautiful wreath of jeſſamine ſhe had in her hand." "You're a ſad rattling fellow, Harry, but your heart is at eaſe." "And ſo may your's be," anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hargrave,
or I am much miſtaken. "I have ſeen Miſs Villars,"
ſaid the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, "and have told her all my doating heart feels for her; ſhe heard me, it is true—but would not give me the leaſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033744_0028_0FF908E6DED42A88"/>
hopes of ever being mine contrary to my parent's conſent:" "Ha! ha! ha! so you are quite in deſpair, becauſe ſhe did not immediately fly into your arms. Come, come, Will, come in and drink a little of the old gentleman's punch, I am ſure you want it to chear your ſpirits, for you have poſitively got the hip:" So ſaying, he took him by the arm, and led him to the little parlour, where Mr. and Mrs. Villars were waiting with baſkets of fruit and the currant punch, for their return; over which ſimple repaſt we will leave them, and return to Louiſa, who had retired (ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. Hargrave went in ſearch of his friend,) to read a letter, ſhe had juſt received from Miſs Sommers. As the reader will be better acquainted with this young Lady, it may not be deemed unneceſſary, to inform them, ſhe was the daughter of an eminent merchant in the city of New-York.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033744_0029_0FF908E8B2294F00"/>
She was very beautiful; and to a fund of good nature, was added a great deal of vivacity. She was miſtreſs of an excellent education, which rendered her a deſirable companion; and early intimacy had endeared theſe young Ladies to each other; and ſince Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Villar's retirement, they had conſtant correſponded: Lauiſa ever happy to hear from her friend, eagerly broke the ſeal, and read as follows:

have ſighed amongſt your ſhady bowers a month, to have been the heroine of ſuch a ſcene: but Louiſa, have a care of that little heart of thine; methinks you are very laviſh in the praiſes of this young Briton; I have a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſee theſe beaux of yours. But my dear, do you know the news of your adventure, has reached the town already: I laſt night ſpent the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Mrs. Muſhroom's; Miſs Vitrol, Miſs Drip, and Miſs Maria Worthy, with many others, was of the party; we were no ſooner ſeated at the <hi>card-table,</hi> than Miſs Vitrol began, bleſs me! Madam," (ſaid ſhe, addreſſing herſelf to Mrs. Muſhroom,) "Have you heard of the odd affair that has happened in Mr. Villars' family. "O dear! aye" exclaimed Miſs Drip, the oddeſt thing in nature."—"Nothing has happened to their diſadvantage, I hope," ſaid Mrs. Muſhroom, "they are a family I have
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033744_0031_0FF908F09D9D96B8"/>
the greateſt regard for," "O—no—," ſaid Miſs Vitrol," they only ſay, two Britiſh officers came nigh Mr. Villars': one of them pretended to be ſuddenly taken ill, and (as they expected,) was carried into the houſe: and would you believe, Mem, it was only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance to carry off Miſs — which they poſitively did <hi>that</hi> night, and Mr. Villars was obliged to ride, "till almoſt morning, before he overtook them;" "Aye," added Miſs Drip, "and they ſay Miſs was not ſo well pleaſed with being overtaken."—I could ſcarcely contain myſelf, when Colonel Rightly addreſſing himſelf to both Ladies, ſaid, "I beg your pardon, Ladies, but muſt take the liberty to tell you, you have been miſinformed: I have but a week ago received a letter from my friend Mr. Villars, who mentioned an officer's being found dangerouſly wounded nigh his houſe. The gallant manner his friend
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033744_0032_0FF8C310DF3F6F78"/>
left the camp in ſearch of him, and his having obtained their leave of abſence from the regiment, until Mr. Hargrave recovered." — I then joined Colonel Rightly, and ſaid, "I had a letter in my pocket, in which Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars had given me all the particulars of the affair which had been ſo groſsly repreſented."—"Indeed Miſs Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers," ſaid Miſs Drip (who is not ſo excellent at telling truth as her grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was at dipping candles,) I had this from a perſon, who had it from one of the people that went in ſearch of Miſs Villars, it happened but four or five days ago:"—"Pardon me, Miſs," ſaid the Colonel, "it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to come from that place in leſs than ſix days." This effectually ſilenced her, though ſhe ſeemed much nettled, her ſcandal did not take; Miſs Vitrol begged I would favour the company with a ſight of Miſs Villars's letter, "as it is very
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033744_0033_0FF908F25E395DA0"/>
ſtrange I ſhould be ſo miſinformed." I ſaid I ſhould have no objection, if the diſcretion of Mr. Villars's family, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any vouchers after what Colonel Rightly had ſaid. The two diſpirited Ladies, ſoon withdrew; and Maria Worthy (who had ſat the whole time biting her lips with vexation,) ſaid "ſhe really believed, Miſs Vitrol had drained her father's vials for every bitter ſhe could find, to compoſe ſo malicious a draught; for the account ſhe had heard, agreed exactly with what Colonel Rightly had ſaid." You may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, my dear Louiſa, that I enjoyed very little ſatisfaction that evening. I ſhall certainly take my Papa's advice, and go no more to Mrs. Muſhrooms, though ſhe is a very good woman, moſt of her acquaintance, are the growth of a night; and I find no people ſo fond of ſcandal as thoſe whom fortune alone, has entitled to appear in genteel life.

I was one day playing on my piano forte; my ſiſter Caroline accompanied me with her voice, when he offered to join us with the German flute. He played ſo ſhockingly, he put me out— Caroline burſt into a fit of laughter, and our concert was diſcord itſelf.—Laſt Monday morning, the old veteran was cloſeted with Papa above half an hour— When we met at dinner, I thought Papa looked as if he was very full of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: he laughed very much; and told me, "He did not think I looked very well—that it was a chance if I had not

But when I went up to my room, Puff came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, "Miſs—Miſs—Miſs Eliza, I have news for you—would you believe it—the old General has been aſking your Papa's permiſſion to pay his addreſſes to you.— This morning, when he was in the compting-houſe with Mr. Sommers, I went paſt the door, and I heard him ſay, the divine Miſs Sommers. This, Mem, was enough, you may be ſure, for me to put my ear to the key-hole; and I am ſorry to ſay, your Papa gave his full conſent.

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033744_0036_0FF908FBAF65AEA8"/>
very well ſay, "if he was agreeable to me, he had no objection."—But, Miſs, your Papa and Mamma was in their own room ſoon after; and I heard them laughing, as if they were very much pleaſed."—I begged the good girl to be under no apprehenſion, for I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to carry on the joke, and dreſs as ſmart as poſſible. At five a carriage ſtopped at the door, and a thundering rap announced the approach of this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.—He entered the room more alert than uſual; for borne on the wings of love, he had left at leaſt forty years of his age behind.—He was dreſſed in a new ſuit of regimentals, cut ſo much in faſhion, the taylor had like to have forgot leaving any ſkirts at all; and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Empreſſe had exhauſted his ſtock of perfumery, powder and pomatum; for never did I ſee the ravages of time ſo completely covered: Mamma ſoon left us. The old gentleman began

the attack, with, I—I—I—have had the honour, Miſs Sommers, (here an lucky cough, which laſted ſome time, impelled him to begin again) "I have the honour, divine Miſs Sommers, of your Papa's permiſſion to throw my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at your feet;" ſo ſaying, down he plumpt on one knee with ſo much force, I really believe his rheumatic joints will feel it for a month. O pray ſir," ſaid I, "Riſe, I can't bear to ſee a gentleman of your <hi>years,</hi> in ſuch a poſture." This ſtruck him forcibly, and he continued ſome time ſilent; fixing is little grey eyes on me with (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he thought) a moſt languiſhing ſoftneſs. "Angelic creature," ſaid he, you muſt not regard the difference of a few years, in a man that adores you; and can have no happineſs unleſs he is permitted to hope:" In ſhort, my dear Louiſa, he ran on in this ſtrain for near an hour; I coquetted it ſo well,

that he ſometimes thought he was ſure of me, and at others I daſhed his hopes, with my great reſpect for his age; after two hours killed in this manner, we parted, I hope never to meet again; he promiſed himſelf great pleaſure in waiting upon me again—but I ſhall take care never to be at home. Papa wiſhed me joy in the evening; he ſaid, "he had made an excuſe to go out, as he had not command enough of his muſcles, for ſuch a rencounter."— Mamma, who you know is much more ſerious, ſaid, "it was very wrong to trifle with the old gentleman, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance he gave me, at leaſt demanded a polite refuſal.

The family were now ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to dinner,—after the cloth was removed, Miſs Villars ſaid "ſhe had that morning received a letter from Miſs Sommers." At the mention of her

As Louiſa could not with propriety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the converſation at Mrs. Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room's; ſhe ſaid, "nothing extraordinary, except the new conqueſt ſhe has made of General <hi>Antique;</hi> who has with great formality, aſked her Papa's permiſſion to pay his addreſses to her.

"Did you never ſee her after," ſaid Louiſa. "Never," returned he, "I was immediately ſent on a diſtant expedition, and it has not been poſſibly in my power to viſit that city ſince. You did not tell Miſs Villars," ſaid Captain Bellmore, "what effect the bright eyes of her friend, had on you. Indeed you never ſaw a poor fellow more in love in your life."—"Bellmore, you dream," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Hargrave.—"It is more than you did at that time," returned the Captain, "I poſitively believe yon did not ſleep in a month."—" Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave was not very dangerouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

if he recovered in a month," ſaid Louiſa—"No, no," continued Bellmore, "he did not in twelve: and poſitively I have never heard him give another Lady as a toaſt ſince." —"Miſs Villars," anſwered Hargrave, "who has the pleaſure of being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Miſs Sommers, will, no doubt, acquit me, for thinking her a charming girl; and I will not ſay, if I had had the happineſs of ſeeing her often, I ſhould have brought off a whole heart."—"I'm of opinion,"— returned Mr. Villars, "You would have loſt it entirely, by what your friend ſays, it was pretty much ſhatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at firſt ſight; and I aſſure you, Miſs Sommers improves upon acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. She is a great fortune, and it would be no bad ſpeck, Mr Hargrave." —"It is not for a poor wandering fellow like me, to aſpire to Miſs Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers," anſwered Hargrave. "You
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033744_0043_0FF90912D05B0EB8"/>
ſhould not," ſaid the Captain, "call yourſelf a poor fellow, whilſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged favourite of Lord—." Here a letter was brought Captain Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, which prevented his proceeding. "He was deſired as ſoon as he was able to travel, to come to town, and an exchange would be immediately procured."—Captain Bellmore, though a good ſoldier, would have been content with remaining longer in the country, to have enjoyed the ſociety of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Louiſa; and could not think of parting, until he had obtained her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being one day his.—Louiſa's heart now revealed a ſecret; ſhe thought ſhe only eſteemed him as a friend; but when ſhe heard he was ſoon to depart, ſhe could ſcarcely hide her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and making an excuſe to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, retired to her own room, to bewail the caprice of fortune.—Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſaid, "he hoped they did not intend
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033744_0044_0FF8C3160569F0C8"/>
leaving them for ſome time; as Capt. Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's health was not ſufficiently re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ſuch a journey." After many obliging things ſaid on both ſides, it was concluded, they ſhould ſet out in a fortnight.—Captain Bellmore had no opportunity of ſpeaking to Louiſa for ſome days;—when one evening, the gentlemen requeſted her to walk—with her Mamma's permiſſion, ſhe conſented. Charles, and the young Edward, were of the party. Enticed by the beauty of the evening, they walked farther than they intended; when Charles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, "Bleſs me, ſiſter, this is the very place where we found Captain Bellmore."—They all ſoon recollected the ſpot: the blood forſook Louiſa's cheeks, and ſhe was near ſinking. On the edge of the thicket, ſtood a large willow, at whoſe root nature (to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite the wearied traveller,) had placed a beautiful bank covered with moſs;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033744_0045_0FF90916C6E06040"/>
to this ſeat they led her; ſhe ſoon recovered, and roſe to return, but Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, willing to oblige his friend, ſaid, "She had better reſt a little, and he would go and gather ſome wild flowers to add to her beaux pots; as he had ſeen ſome very handſome nigh that place." And continued he, "Charles and Edward will accompany me."— So ſaying, he took the boys by the hand, and was out of ſight in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.—The reader may be aſſured the Captain did not loſe the moments ſo ardently wiſhed for; but plead his cauſe ſo well, that had Louiſa acted from the dictates of her heart, he would have had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. But ſhe was ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of giving him hopes, when ſhe ſaw no probability of their being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed. He begged her to let him apply to her father; this ſhe poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed—and told him, ſhe knew his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033744_0046_0FF9091912CACA80"/>
ſo well, it would be needleſs.— She had not, however, diſguiſe enough to hide entirely her approbation; and the Captain had ſome conſolation in thinking he was not altogether indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to her. They had ſpent nigh an hour moſt agreeably; when Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave and the little boys returned, with large bunches of flowers. After this, they had frequent interviews. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave undertook to plead his friend's cauſe; but there was no occaſion; he had an advocate in Louiſa's breaſt, more powerful than any he could offer. —Captain Bellmore, at length, obtained the promiſe he wiſhed. The day before they were to depart, they walked to the favourite willow; where they, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Mr. Hargrave, vowed to live only for each other; and wait ſome happy turn of fortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:033744_0047_0FF9091E71E05368"/>THE day arrived, when they were to part. As no one ſuſpected an attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Captain and Louiſa, it was not difficult for them to ſteal a few moments in private. They met in the jeſſamine bower; he preſſed her to his breaſt when he bid her adieu,—poor Louiſa could refrain her tears no longer; but diſſolved with the tenderneſs of the moment, hid them in his boſom.</p>
            <p>THE ſcene was too affecting; they broke from each other.—When the little group aſſembled to breakfaſt, the concern was general; though the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had been twice retarded, it ſtill arrived too ſoon, and they parted with mutual regret.—Mr. Villars accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated them with <hi>horſes</hi> to a town, about twenty miles diſtant, from whence they were to take the packet. Louiſa gave Mr. Hargrave the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Miſs Sommers:

Write to me, my Eliza, and ſtrive to reconcile me to myſelf. I have much to communicate, but my ſpirits are too much hurried. I haſte to take (perhaps) a laſt farewell. Oh!

            <p>NOTHING material happened on the road. The packet was ready to ſail when they arrived; they diſmiſſed the ſervant with the horſes, and a few lines to Mr. Villars. The wind was fair, and in 6 days they arrived at New-York.—Mr. Villars had recommended them to his friend Colonel Rightly.— As ſoon as they were dreſſed, they waited on him; he immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them genteel lodgings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to dine with him the next
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:033744_0050_0FF909256D5CD2D0"/>
day.—Captain Bellmore begged, "he would recommend them to a merchant, as they had ſome bills they wiſhed to diſpoſe of.—Colonel Rightly told them "he made no doubt, but Mr. Sommers would purchaſe, to whatever amount they choſe."—And it was agreed, they ſhould wait on him the next day.—Accordingly, Colonel Rightly called at twelve, and attended them to Mr. Sommers's, who immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the bills, and politely invited them up ſtairs; as they had mentioned having a letter for Miſs Sommers.—She was ſitting with her Mamma and ſiſter, when they entered. Mr. Sommers intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, ſaying, "this gentleman has a letter for you, Eliza."—Mr. Hargrave approached; ſhe immediately recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected him, and bluſhing exceedingly, inquired after her friend's health.— Hargrave, though much confuſed, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033744_0051_0FF9092BB9338630"/>
her with a pretty good grace. The converſation then charged to the accident that brought them to Mr. Villars's houſe;—they both expreſſed the greateſt regard for the family, and their particular obligations.—After ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh an hour, they took their leave, Mr. Sommers politely requeſted they would not be ſtrangers to his houſe, while they remained in town.</p>
            <p>Captain BELLMORE ſoon made Miſs Sommers (as the friend of Louiſa) his confident; and perſuaded her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe his letters. The impreſſion Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za's fine eye had made on Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave at firſt ſight, was now deeply rooted; and he was never happy when abſent from her. Though extremely lively, ſhe had nothing of the coquette; ſhe preferred him to all her admirers, and did not ſtrive to conceal it. The Winter was now approaching, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:033744_0052_0FF9092E1F99BCA8"/>
there was no probability of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in actual ſervice till ſpring; nor did they ſeem to wiſh it. Hargrave, happy with being near his Eliza, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing ſo much as the thoughts of parting.—Captain Bellmore, though deprived of the ſight of Louiſa, had the pleaſure of hearing from her often. But we muſt now leave them, and return to Louiſa; who ſpent her time, as uſual, in improvement with her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mother; but her tranquillity of mind was loſt, her former amuſement had now no charms.—She ſeldom vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited in the village, and whilſt the weather was fine, ſhe, often attended by her little Juba, ſpent hours under the willow, which ſhe reverenced, as witneſs to her vows. Mr. and Mrs. Villars ſaw the change in Louiſa; and ſuſpected the cauſe, but did not think it ſo deeply rooted. They, however, avoided mentioning, what they ſaw
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033744_0053_0FF90931ED755828"/>
ſhe wiſhed to conceal —Nothing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during the firſt part of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, worth relating. Through her friend, Louiſa received many letters from Captain Bellmore, which ſhe anſwered by the ſame means. We will now leave her, and return to town.</p>
            <p>Mr. SOMMERS had one day invited Captain Bellmore and his friend to dine. Soon after they came in, Mr. Hargrave told Mr. Sommers, "He had letters from Lord Beauclair, which mentioned his drafts being paid, and hoped he had the ſame account." Mr. Sommers ſaid he had.—At the name of Lord Beauclair, Eliza ſtarted, and changed colour: In the evening, ſhe aſked Mr. Hargrave if he was any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to him. "A very diſtant one," replied he, "but he has been a father to me." "Pray," ſaid Eliza, "is Lady Beauclair living." "She is," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033744_0054_0FF90933C61EBA08"/>
Hargrave, "but why, my dear Eliza, does the name of Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair ſeem to affect you;" (for during this diſcourſe ſhe has often changed colour,) "I have heard," anſwered Eliza, "he had a daughter he uſed very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly, and I can't hear his name without emotion: do they know if ſhe is ſtill living." "They do not," replied he. "I have heard ſhe went ſeveral years ago to the Eaſt Indies, with her family; I have often heard Lady Beauclair la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her, but her name is never menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned before my Lord."—"Good God," ſaid Eliza, "and her only fault, was marrying a worthy man with a ſmall fortune."—"And is that a ſmall fault, my beloved Eliza," ſaid he, claſping her in his arms. "Tell me, I pray, if you know any thing of this Lady, or her family; for be aſſured, though I have been taught to look on myſelf as the heir of Lord Beauclair, if ever
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033744_0055_0FF9093887053208"/>
I am ſo happy as to find Lady Maria, I ſhall willingly reſign my pretenſions in her favour." "Your intention is truly meritorious," returned Miſs Sommers. "You may perhaps find Lady Maria, or ſome of her family:" "Ah! Miſs Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ſaid he, "riches or titles could only make me happy for being accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to you; and I am confident, you would not prize ſuch unjuſtly retained." —After a long and tender converſation, they parted equally pleaſed with each other.</p>
            <p>Miſs SOMMERS was torn between love and friendſhip; ſhe knew Lady Maria Beverly; but was not at liberty to diſcover her; and if ſhe did, ſhe would deprive the man ſhe moſt regarded of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence riches; but friendſhip and juſtice were predominant. She determined to write to her friend for permiſſion to diſcover her, which ſhe immediately
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:033744_0056_0FF9094147791600"/>
did.—Mr. Hargrave related to Captain Bellmore the above converſation—they both concluded, Miſs Sommers muſt know ſomething of Lady Maria; but thought it beſt not to preſs her far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent, as ſhe might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be at liberty to diſcover her. Not long after this, Mr. Hargrave attended Miſs Sommers and her ſiſter, to ſpend the evening at Mrs. Hardy's.—Doctor Squills by accident dropt in, he ſaid he had juſt come from the priſon, and his feelings had not for a long time, been ſo hurt. "A very decent woman was brought there ſome days before," continued he. "She is very ill, and I fear cannot live if ſhe is not removed to a more comfortable place:"—"pray what is ſhe charged with?" demanded Hargrave, "upon my word I cannot tell," returned the Doctor, "it ſeems ſhe was taken within our line, and does not give a very good account of herſelf. She ſays
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:033744_0057_0FF909460FB5DDA8"/>
She has travelled from the Southward, in ſearch of a young gentleman, ſhe was nurſe to, and whom ſhe heard was confined as a ſpy; I told her ſhe might be perfectly eaſy on that account, for no Britiſh officer was confined on ſuch ſuſpicion at preſent." Mr. Hargrave aſked him, "if he knew her name?" "I think it is Carely," anſwered the Doctor. "Good God!" exclaimed he, "my old nurſe." He begged the Ladies to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him, and ſaid, he would wait on Colonel Rightly, and prevail upon him to uſe his intereſt, with regard to freeing Mrs Carely." He was no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gone, than ſome of the company expreſſed great ſurpriſe, at what they had heard.—Captain Bellmore, who had dropped in accidentally, briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated his being wounded, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted behaviour of Mr. Hargrave; which he ſuppoſed had given riſe to the report that frightened poor Mrs.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033744_0058_0FF90947E6DAC318"/>
Carely. The whole company joined in his praiſe; and Eliza had the inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pleaſure of hearing the choſen of her heart, extolled to the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>Mr. HARGRAVE went immediately to Col. Rightly, who promiſed to do every thing in his power upon the occaſion.— They went that night to the priſon, though it was late. Hargrave entered the room, followed by the Colonel; they approached the bed—ſhe was ſleeping. They had ſtood a few moments, when ſhe awoke, praying for bleſſings on her Harry.—"Your Harry is with you," ſaid Hargrave, advancing.— The poor woman was nigh fainting.— "My ſon," returned ſhe, "I ſhall die eaſy, ſince I ſee you ſafe."—"Compoſe yourſelf, good mother, and tell me how you came here," replied Hargrave.— "O! ſir, I have not ſtrength;—I heard
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033744_0059_0FF909508C028238"/>
ſomebody ſay, you would be taken as a ſpy; ſo came off in the night, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, I knew not where. I have been ſeveral months a priſoner, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſo cloſely as at preſent."</p>
            <p>Col. RIGHTLY told her, "to make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eaſy—that he would procure her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and take her to his own houſe." —The good woman thanked him with her tears; her heart was too full tor ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance. Next morning, Col. Rightly applied to the General, and had her brought home, where ſhe very ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and took the place of a houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper he had juſt diſcharged.—About this time, a peace was negociating; and hoſtilities ceaſed with Britain.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had adjourned go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to town (as he did not wiſh to leave his family at ſuch a time) now paid a viſit to the metropolis. His firſt inquiries
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033744_0060_0FF90952DA423AA0"/>
were for Capt. Bellmore and Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, who received him with the higheſt ſatisfaction. They dined the next day at Mr. Sommers's, with Colonel Rightly and Major Beaucamp, who was alſo a Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh officer on leave of abſence. The company had aſſembled ſome time before the Major came in. Mr. Sommers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him. As he approached Mr. Villars, he ſtarted and ſtopped. "Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, ſir—your likeneſs is ſo great to a friend of mine, that was I not almoſt certain of his death, I ſhould think I now ſaw him before me.— "You are not miſtaken, my friend," ſaid Mr. Villars, his eyes ſwimming in tears; "and can I be ſo happy," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Major, preſſing him to his breaſt, "Again to meet my Beverly!— You ſee indeed the man who once was Beverly," returned Mr. Villars; "but, ah! the trials I have met ſince laſt we parted!"—The reader may eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033744_0061_0FF90955E6AA2D98"/>
the aſtoniſhment of Mr. Hargrave and Captain Bellemore, at the above converſation:—the former would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately have gone to Mr. Villars's, and diſcovered his intentions in his favour; but Miſs Sommers detained him. "Conſider," ſaid ſhe, "you are dependent on Lord Beauclair; and ſhould you diſoblige him, by interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this matter, you may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his favour, and not have it in your power to ſerve them. You will, no doubt, hear Mr. Villars's ſtory; you may then mention your connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Lord Beauclair, and your intentions, ſhould the eſtate come in your poſſeſſion:"—"You are extremely right, my dear Eliza," anſwered he: "I can at preſent do nothing; but I feel exceedingly intereſted in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half." In the mean time, Major Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp was aſking Mr. Villars many queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he had not ſeen him ſince his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033744_0062_0FF9095785460190"/>
marriage. Mr. Sommers ſaid, "He hoped the long friendſhip ſubſiſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Villars and himſelf, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his begging to hear his ſtory, <note place="bottom">Miſs Sommers was the only perſon preſent, acquainted with Mrs. Villars's ſtory, which Louiſa had related to her in confidence.</note> which he thought would be very intereſting." "My hiſtory is a melancholly one," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he, "and I believe will afford lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſatisfaction; though notwithſtanding I'll endeavour to recollect facts, that will tear open wounds, time can never heal. Accordingly, as ſoon as the cloth was removed, Mr. Villars began as follows:</p>
            <p>MY father was the youngeſt ſon of an ancient family in Cumberland, of the name of Villars. My grandfather, at an advanced age, married a widow of ſmall fortune; ſhe had one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who was very beautiful; and her mother poſſeſſed of a great deal of art,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033744_0063_0FF9095A15C26B58"/>
ſoon made a match between her and my father's elder brother. She had great aſcendancy over my grandfather, and found means to withdraw his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from his younger children.— My father, and a ſiſter of twelve years of age, were ſent to a boarding-ſchool, and never allowed to come home. At my grandfather's death, they found themſelves thrown on the world, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a very few hundreds.— Miſs Villars took her father's uſage ſo much to heart, that ſhe died not long after. —She was in her eighteenth year when this melancholly event took place. My father, who was of a lively turn, ſubmitted to the caprice of fortune, and ſtrove to be content: he had ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died the law, but did not pay ſuch ſtrict attention to it, as he ought.— When he had entered his two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year, a brother of my grandfather's mother died, and left my father an
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033744_0064_0FF8C31C86461C10"/>
eſtate nigh Bath, of ſix hundred pounds a year; with which he was to take the name of Beverly. He ſoon after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Miſs Louiſa Herbert, a very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed young Lady, with a fortune of ten thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>A YEAR after their marriage, I was born; and in two years more, they received a ſecond addition to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, by the birth of a daughter.— Nothing material happened during our minority, until I attained my nineteenth year. My father paid the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to our education, (but impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently lived to the extent of his income.) My mother often remonſtrated to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpoſe; he was not of a diſpoſition to brook reſtraint.</p>
            <p>AT that age, I left the univerſity; my father intended me for the army, but my mother would never conſent
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033744_0065_0FF9095ED976E3F0"/>
to it; and was with difficulty prevailed on, to conſent to my making the tour of France and Italy, the enſuing year; which I did, accompanied by my friend Beaucamp, and his worthy father; who acted as governor to us both.— Whilſt abroad, I became acquainted with Lord Sidly, ſon to the Earl of Beauclair. He was pleaſed to profeſs the greateſt friendſhip for me; indeed it was amply returned;—and I ſhall ever ſincerely regret his loſs."</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS ſtopped and wiped his eyes. We ſtayed," continued he, "two years abroad, and returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.—My father was choſen as a member for a neighbouring borough; and the winter after I returned, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to town; my firſt enquiries were for Lord Sidly. He received me with great cordiality, and introduced me to Lady Beauclair, the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033744_0066_0FF9096071F81958"/>
Hon. Charles Sidly, and Lady Maria, his ſiſter.—I was great part of my time with Lord Sidly; and had frequent opportunities of ſeeing Lady Maria.— I was admitted to all their parties;— the friendly and familiar footing, I was on in the family, (for even Lord Beauclair ſeemed particularly attentive to me) made me forget the difference of rank; and my heart aſpired to this lovely girl.—I ſometimes fancied myſelf not indifferent to her; but I ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to conceal my own ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in company with her brother.</p>
            <p>I ONE night attended her to the play; there happened to be a riot— Lady Maria was extremely frightened; and we were making our way through the croud, with an intention to get out, when a man rudely caught her arm. This way Ma'am," ſaid he. Throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf in my arms, "Oh! ſave me,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033744_0067_0FF909666806F2C0"/>
Beverly," exclaimed ſhe. I took her up, and bore her to the carriage, in which I placed her almoſt fainting. I ſeated myſelf by her, and ordered the carriage to drive home. Lady Maria aſked for her brother; I told her, "We had left him at the theatre; but if ſhe wiſhed, I would return, and ſeek him."—" O, no!" ſaid ſhe, " do not leave me."—I preſſing her hand to my heart, told her, I would wiſh never to leave her;—her head was ſtill reclined on my ſhoulder.—At theſe words ſhe ſighed, and ſtarting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew the hand I preſſed, ſaying, "Excuſe me, Mr. Beverly, I have been exceedingly frightened." The coach now ſtopped, and I attended her to the parlour. Lady Beauclair aſked, "why they came home ſo ſoon, and what had become of Lord Sidly." I related what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. "I have cauſed a great deal of trouble to Mr. Beverly," ſaid Lady
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033744_0068_0FF9096805A24E78"/>
Maria; "he was ſo good as to carry me a conſiderable diſtance in his arms." I could only anſwer her by a look, which I thought ſhe underſtood. The day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Hon. Charles Sidly ſet out on his travels. His departure afforded mutual concern, as he was to take the tour of Europe; and he was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to return in ſome years.</p>
            <p>SOON after this, I returned home, I correſponded with Lord Sidly, but dared not mention my beloved Maria, agreeable to the dictates of my heart. When the bathing ſeaſon came on, he wrote me, that he ſhould ſoon wait on Lady Maria to Bath, as ſhe was in ill health, and begged me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him lodgings; which I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately did, and waited with impatience, for their arrival. It was not long before I received a card with the welcome intelligence. I flew to their lodgings, Lord
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033744_0069_0FF9096DABC857F0"/>
Sidly met me on the ſtairs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the greateſt happineſs at ſeeing me. Lady Maria aroſe as I entered; ſhe looked very pale and languid: I begged her to be ſeated, and told her, "I was grieved to owe the happineſs of ſeeing her to ill health." Lord Sidly ſoon left the room;—I was thrown from my guard, and ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a more tender nature, than I had ever dared before: ſhe ſeemed much affected, but I thought not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed.—In the evening, I attended my ſiſter Caroline to her lodgings.— They were equally pleaſed with each other; and the next day we went to the rooms. The Ladies preferred walking home; as it was but a very ſhort diſtance, Lord Sidly gave his arm to Caroline, and I offered mine to Lady Maria. We had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far, when ſhe ſaid, " you know not how unhappy I have been, Mr.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033744_0070_0FF9097274D5FC58"/>
Beverly, ſince you left us." She then told me, "that her Papa had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the addreſſes of Lord Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; whom I knew was very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to her: that he had given her poſitive orders to prepare to marry him.—And had it not been for the interceſſion of her brother, who had prevailed on him to allow her a little time, ſhe ſhould e're this have been dragged to the altar." She ſaid, "ſhe would rather die, than marry that deſerted Lord, which ſhe ſuppoſed ſhe would be obliged to do when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned." This was like fire to my brain; though I had no right to hope. Yet to ſee her ſacrificed to a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated wretch, who had nothing to recommend him but immenſe riches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was more than I could bear, when preſſing the hand I held to my boſom, "My beloved Maria,"—cried I, "this cannot, this muſt not be."—She ſighed,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:033744_0071_0FF9097807FD16F8"/>
but made no reply. We had now reached the houſe: Lord Sidly inſiſted upon our ſpending the day with them. —My father waited on him the next day, and invited them to dine; they accepted the invitation. That and many more days, we ſpent together. I was no longer maſter of myſelf: I declared my ſentiments without reſerve, and pathetically lamented my hard fortune; I had the pleaſure to find ſhe was not diſpleaſed: But would ſay, "O! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verly, I am ſufficiently wretched, do not add to my diſtreſs, by making me think I am the cauſe of unhappineſs to you."</p>
            <p>THUS we had ſpent ſix weeks, when one evening at an aſſembly, we were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted by Lord Winter: he told Lady Maria, "He had juſt arrived from town; and as he did not know where ſhe lodged, he expected to have the plea-of meeting her there:" and very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033744_0072_0FF90979B1049968"/>
begged her to go down the next dance with him. She anſwered, "ſhe ſhould dance but little, and was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;" "who is the happy perſon that uſurps my right," ſaid he, indignantly. "Very well my Lady, perhaps I may not be allowed to wait of you home nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?"—"Very probable, my Lord," replied ſhe. At that moment, the dance was called.—as I advanced, ſhe aroſe and gave me her hand; ſhe trembled ſo exceedingly, ſhe could ſcarcely move. When the dance was over, ſeeing her very much flurried, I led her to a ſeat, and called her brother and Caroline to her. I told Lord Sidly, the ſight of Lord Winter had affected her ſo much, ſhe was near fainting."— "Lord Winter here!" ſaid he: "Damn him, he'll be the death of the girl yet."</p>
            <p>IN the courſe of the evening, Lord Winter had learnt, "I was the only
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033744_0073_0FF9097F175B81E8"/>
one that had attended Lady Maria ſince her arrival at Bath: that ſhe ſpent the greateſt part of her time at our houſe; in ſhort, it was ſuppoſed, I was her favoured admirer. He advanced, and addreſſing himſelf to her, aſked "if he ſhould order his chariot."— She thanked him; but ſaid, "ſhe ſhould return with her brother;—Lord Sidly gave him a card, and begged the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his company to dine the next day: he returned a ſlight bow, and retired to a little diſtance, where he could obſerve who went into the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.—I led Lady Maria to the door; when Lord Sidly ſaid, "Beverly, I muſt ſee you to-morrow morning."— I went accordingly, and learnt Lady Maria had been ſo ill all night, ſhe was not able to come down to breakfaſt. "I cannot conceive," ſaid Lord S. "why my father inſiſts on ſacrificing the girl for riches."—" Oh! my Lord," cried
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:033744_0074_0FF90980B5C18D08"/>
I, "Do you know no way to ſave her?"—He ſaw my emotion, but tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no notice of it, ſaid, "what can I do for her? can't you adviſe me?"— "I could, but"—"but what," ſaid he, ſmiling, "I ſuppoſe you would adviſe me to get ſome clever fellow to take her out of his way."—My Lord," ſaid I, ſtarting, "Be not ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, would not you like to aſſiſt me in preventing this match?"—" I would willingly loſe my life, to contribute to her felicity." "But if I'm not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, you muſt preſerve your life, to make her happy." "Henry," continued he, "I will trifle no longer. I have long ſeen the affection between you and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria; and with my parent's conſent, no man on earth I would as ſoon call bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—but as it is, I can't bear to ſee her wretched. I am ſenſible the blame will fall on me, but I am better able to bear it."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:033744_0075_0FF90983C91E9840"/>I know not what I ſaid to him; my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy may more eaſily be imagined than defined. I would have fell at his feet, and embraced his knees; but preventing me, he ſaid, "if I acted like ſuch a crazy fellow, he would not truſt his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with me."—He then left me, to go to her, with whom he ſoon returned; and leading her to the ſofa, ſaid, Beverly, Maria is quite ſhagrined at Lord Winter's not calling on her this morning; and I have recommended an hour's converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you, to recover her ſpirits. So ſaying, he ſmiled and left us. "Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!" exclaimed ſhe, with ſurpriſe: I flew to her, and folding her in my arms, told her what had paſſed between Lord Sidly and myſelf. We now gave a looſe to the moſt endearing ſenſations, and for a time forgot the many bars to our union.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:033744_0076_0FF90986CC0D6360"/>WE had been nigh two hours together, when Lord Sidly returned; he ſeemed thoughtful, and walked the room ſome time without ſpeaking; then turning to us, he ſaid Lord Winter had left Bath; that he had made particular enquries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, and was heard to ſay, "Lord Beauclair ſhould be acquainted with his children's behaviour." "What is to be done, Beverly ?" continued he.— I told him, "I thought no time was to be loſt; and begged him to let us ſet out immediately for Scotland."</p>
            <p>IT was accordingly determined, we ſhould be off at four that afternoon. To prevent ſuſpicion, we were to go the firſt ſtage in Lord Sidly's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; he had ſent a truſty ſervant on, to provide a poſt-chaiſe. Lord Sidly and my ſiſter were the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the ſecret; I took all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney I had by me, which amounted
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033744_0077_0FF90988650FABC0"/>
to two hundred guineas.—I left a letter for my father, which I told Caroline not to give him, until the next evening, as we ſhould by that time be out of reach.</p>
            <p>LORD Sidly, at parting, put a bank-note of fifteen hundred pounds in Maria's hand; ſhe was very much affected, and ſaid, "O, my brother! what will you not ſuffer on my account." "If you are happy, my dear girl, I ſhall be amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid." About nine miles from Bath, we took a poſt-chaiſe, and Lord Sidly's carriage returned: honeſt John had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided relays at every ſtage, ſo that we were not obliged to wait a moment. We had travelled all night, but the next day, poor Maria was ſo fatigued, we were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to reſt ſome hours. We arrived without any accident. Maria bore the journey much better than I had expected ſhe would. We were immediately mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033744_0078_0FF9098AB0A8AE28"/>
and took lodgings, as I thought it beſt not to return directly.</p>
            <p>THE report of our being eloped, did not ſpread in Bath, until the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon following our departure.— My father was extremely enraged; his proud ſpirit could not brook my being deſpiſed, as he was certain I ſhould be by Lord Beauclair's family; and he made no doubt, but his lordſhip would uſe all his intereſt to effect his ruin. (which was indeed the caſe.)</p>
            <p>LORD Winter had no ſooner arrived in town, than he waited on Lord Beauclair, and told him, it was currently reported, that lady Maria received the addreſſes of Mr. Beverly, and Lord Sidley encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it. It is impoſſible to expreſs the rage of his lordſhip, on this information: he diſpatched a ſervant to his ſon with orders to return immediately, without
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033744_0079_0FF9098D061F4A90"/>
mentioning the cauſe—before he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter, the news of our elopement and marriage, had reached town;—Lord Beauclair's rage was now beyond all bounds;—he wrote to my father in the moſt opprobrious manner; and alſo to Lord Sidley, in which he forbid him ever to appear in his preſence; that he forever renounced Maria; and was determined never to hear any interpoſition in favour of either of them.</p>
            <p>LORD Sidly was extremely diſtreſſed on reading his father's letter; he did not think he would have carried his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch lengths.—He immediately ſet out for London. Upon his arrival, he went directly to his father's: when a ſervant ſaid, he had orders to tell him he had no home there.—He took lodgings nigh, and wrote to his mother in the moſt affecting manner.—After writing a third letter, he received an anſwer, by
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033744_0080_0FF9098F53DBC168"/>
Suſan Artleſs, Lady Maria's maid.— This was much colder than he expected from her. She informed him, Lord Beauclair was determined not to ſee him: and begged he would never men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her diſobedient daughter to her; that Suſan ſhould be ordered to pack up her clothes and jewels, which ſhould be ſent to her; and deſired him to let her know, it was all ſhe had to expect. Poor Suſan wept bitterly, and begged ſhe might go to her miſtreſs, which ſhe ſoon after did.</p>
            <p>THO' Lord Sidly had only ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year, independent of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was determined never again to ſeek his favour; but immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a majority in a marching regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtined for the Eaſt Indies—from whence he never returned.</p>
            <p>HERE Mr. Villars ſtopped, from an
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033744_0081_0FF90991A41240C0"/>
incapability of proceeding. — He after ſome time thus continued: "Some weeks after our marriage, Suſan arrived with my wife's trunks, and a letter from Lord Sidly; he mentioned his going to India, but ſaid he would pay us a viſit before he ſailed.—Maria, and I, had both wrote to Lord Beauclair; and our letters had been returned unopened; ſhe could bear with greater fortitude, their cruelty to herſelf, than to her brother; it moſt ſenſibly affected us, that he ſhould ſuffer ſo much for us, he ſpent a fortnight with us before he ſailed, and ſeemed prefectly chearful.—He told my wife to be intirely eaſy, on his account, that leaving her happy, would be a great means of making him ſo. Soon after he left us, we received a letter from him, in which he impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to draw upon his banker for two hundred a year, until his return.</p>
            <p>MY wife diſpoſed of her jewels; the
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033744_0082_0FF909964D642960"/>
ſale of which amounted to fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds; this we added to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lord Sidly had ſo generouſly made his ſiſter, and purchaſed a ſmall eſtate in my father's neighbourhood. But, alas! a cloud was now hanging over our heads, which burſt with all its force.</p>
            <p>MY father had been obliged to mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his eſtate for ſeveral hundreds. Lord Beauclair bought the mortgage, and immediately cloſed it; this heightened my father's reſentment againſt me; he had never been perfectly reconciled; he ſaid, he was convinced I ſhould be his ruin.—My wife propoſed mortgaging our eſtate, to clear his, but he would not accept of it. His was accordingly ſold for much leſs than the value.—My ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was juſt married to Colonel Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, and went with him to Scotland. Had my father been prudent, he ſtill
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:033744_0083_0FF8C320C1205480"/>
had ſufficient to live comfortably; but his ſpirit was too great to retrench.</p>
            <p>AFTER his affairs were ſettled, there were ſeven thouſand pounds remaining, which he placed in the hands of an eminent broker: took a houſe in Bath; and lived as uſual.—A year after our marriage, my Maria preſented me with a ſon, whom we named Henry, after Lord Sidley.</p>
            <p>HERE Mr. Villars ceaſed—the tears flowed ſo faſt, he was obliged to leave the room; in a ſhort time he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thus continued: "When my ſon was about ſix months old, Lord and Lady Beauclair came to Bath. One day Lady Beauclair ſaw the nurſe and child walking before my father's door, (for though very much incenſed with me, ſhe was fond of my child, and would often ſend for him.)—She ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033744_0084_0FF8C32D849D6968"/>
and aſked whoſe child it was: when ſhe was told, ſhe ſtarted and walked on; then returning, told the nurſe to ſtep into a milliner's ſhop with her; ſhe careſſed the infant. "It is a ſweet boy," ſaid ſhe. She then took a gold medal, and tied it by a ribbon, round the child's neck: the nurſe aſked if ſhe ſhould tell Mrs. Beverly to whom ſhe was obliged." She anſwered, "it was not material."—When the nurſe came home, ſhe acquainted my wife with the rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—My poor Maria was near fainting; ſhe knew the medal, and found her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſtill determined not to ſee her. —She, however, reſolved again to write, but they left Bath the next day.</p>
            <p>MY father's affairs now became deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate—his creditors preſſed upon him, and we determined to mortgage our eſtate, and ſend him relief, as from an unknown hand. We raiſed eight hundred pounds,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:033744_0085_0FF90997E7D3EC40"/>
which we ſent, encloſed in a blank pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But, alas! we were only involving ourſelves, without doing him any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. His debts were to a much greater amount than we were worth, and I ſaw him dragged to the priſon without the power to aſſiſt him.</p>
            <p>I applied to ſeveral of his friends in town, but Lord Beauclair had prejudiced them againſt him. He ſuffered but a few months—he was ſeized with a fever, that carried him off within, a few weeks.</p>
            <p>HOW can I expreſs my feelings?—I looked upon myſelf as acceſſary to his misfortune. The creditors took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every thing: my poor mother ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in ſilence, and never reproached me; ſhe ſoon went to Scotland to my ſiſter, as Col. Montgomery had preſſed her to ſpend the remainder of her days with them. She was ſcarcely gone, when
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033744_0086_0FF9099BACC9BE78"/>
Mr. Granville, the gentleman from whom we borrowed the money, demanded im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate payment. Lord Beauclair would not appear in this; but I have been ſince informed, he perſuaded Mr. Granville to act in the manner he did.</p>
            <p>I WAS now obliged to apply to a broker, and to give an exorbitant inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. It is needleſs to mention the many misfortunes that attended me, in the courſe of two years; I was obliged to ſell my eſtate. I had now one thouſand pounds left; with which I ſtill continued in trade, with a merchant in Briſtol. Our whole ſtock was now embarked in one bottom, and the fate of that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; troubles ſeemed to thicken upon us; anxiety for my family (for I had now two children) entirely depreſſed my ſpirits: but fortune had ſtill greater evils in ſtore; we had been but three years married, when we received accounts of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033744_0087_0FF9099D86FE5FF0"/>
Lord Sidly's death: this ſtroke was almoſt too much for my poor Maria; but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſupported her through it. He had left a will with her, which we opened, and found he had made her his heir: I commiſſioned a gentleman to wait on Lord Beauclair with a copy of the will; his Lordſhip flew in a violent rage, ſaid that "Lord Henry had been very impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to allow us any thing while he was abroad; that the will was a vile forgery, and I ſhould ſuffer for it." He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as good as his word; for three days after, I received his anſwer; I was arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for forgery.</p>
            <p>I WILL not pretend to figure my aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, or my dear Maria's diſtreſs; we did not imagine, notwithſtanding Lord Beauclair's threats, that he would have gone ſuch lengths. The unfeeling bailiff pulled my wife, who was juſt ſinking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my arms, from me, and inhumanly
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:033744_0088_0FF909A01102FEE8"/>
dragged me away.—Great God! ſhall I ever forget this ſcene, or the cries of my little Henry, who was not three years old." Here Mr. Villars was obliged to ſtop for ſome time, and then went on as follows:</p>
            <p>"I begged the bailiff to be patient: that I was certain I could obtain bail." —He ſaid, "he had orders to admit of none."—We then proceeded to a cloſe uncomfortable goal, where I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I was to remain until I had my trial.—Mr. Traffic (the gentleman with whom I had commenced buſineſs,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with the greateſt friendſhip, and undertook to have the will proved; but unfortunately for us, Sir William Harly, one of the witneſſes, was in India; and the other, a Mr. Scrip, an attorney, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately abſconded; we made the ſtricteſt ſearch for him, but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and it was ſuppoſed he was well paid for his abſence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:033744_0089_0FF909A261CDCF00"/>MY wife wrote a moſt pathetic letter to her mother, and received for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, "That it was entirely out of her power to do any thing for her, unleſs ſhe would conſent to part from me; on thoſe conditions ſhe ſhould be reinſtated in their favour; that ſhe would take her ſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own particular care; and I ſhould be releaſed, on promiſing to quit the country immediately, and never return; and that ſhe ſhould have a month to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of it."</p>
            <p>THIS was ſent by a ſervant of Lord Beauclair's, who told Maria, he believed his miſtreſs was compelled to write as ſhe did; for ſhe wept very much when ſhe gave him the letter. Maria anſwered it immediately; ſhe ſaid it required no time to conſider; that though ſhe was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to live and die with me, and truſted to a juſt God, who knew my innocence, to ſee me righted;—to be reconciled to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:033744_0090_0FF909A4B27607A0"/>
her mother, was her moſt earneſt wiſh; but was grieved, it could not be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed but on terms ſhe never would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to.</p>
            <p>I had remained ſix months in goal, during which time, Mr. Traffic had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived accounts of our veſſel having made a loſing voyage. My wife took a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contiguous to the goal, and diſcharged the few ſervants we kept, except my ſon's nurſe, whoſe huſband and child were both dead; and her attachment to my ſon was ſo great, ſhe ſaid ſhe would never leave us.</p>
            <p>MY wife had one day, brought the children to ſee me; I was careſſing them whilſt ſhe leaned over me, the tears flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt down her cheeks, when the door opened, and the Hon. Charles Sidly, (now Lord Sidly, who we had not heard was returned) entered. Though he had
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:033744_0091_0FF909A7350F9670"/>
not ſo much tenderneſs in his diſpoſition, as his brother, he could not behold this ſcene unaffected. He tenderly embraced his ſiſter, ſaid "he was grieved to ſee us thus; and moſt ſincerely wiſhed the affair could be cleared up." He ſaid that Lord Beauclair, had been more exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt us ſince Lord Sidly's death, knowing that his unkindneſs to him, which drove him abroad, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely owing to us:" He begged we would keep up our ſpirits; he did not in the leaſt doubt the authenticity of the will, (which we had ſhewn him) and hoped we might have it in our power to prove it.—He ſeemed much amazed, when we informed him of Mr. Scrip's ſudden diſappearance. At parting, he put a note of five hundred pounds in Maria's hand, and ſaid he would ſee us again ſhortly.</p>
            <p>I NOW ſet about ſettling my affairs,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033744_0092_0FF909ABDBD95560"/>
as I was reſolved to leave England, as ſoon as I could procure my liberty.— At the end of three weeks, Lord Sidly arrived, with an order for my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He ſaid he was ſorry to own, his father ſeemed unreaſonably incenſed againſt us; and he would adviſe me to leave England;—at leaſt for a time. That I might depend upon his intereſt, though he did not dare openly to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe my cauſe.—I told him, it was our intention, as I had no wiſh to ſtay in a place, in which I had experienced ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rubs from fortune.—He then gave me a note for £. 400, and told me I might every year draw upon him for the like ſum, through Mr. Traffic; and if ever the will could be proved, he ſhould with pleaſure reſign the eſtate his brother left us.</p>
            <p>WE now prepared for our departure; we took our paſſage in a ſhip ready to ſail
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:033744_0093_0FF909AD74E7F9D0"/>
for India. Mr. Traffic gave me letters to his friends in Madeira, as the veſſel was to touch there. We were juſt ready to ſail, when we were informed, that Lord Sidly was dead, occaſioned by a fall from his horſe; and that in his laſt moments, he had beſeeched his parents to remember their unhappy daughter. We were now again overwhelmed with grief and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; this ſhock had ſo great an effect on my poor Maria's health, that we were near loſing our paſſage. She, however, exerted the utmoſt of her ſtrength, and we went on board.</p>
            <p>I left Lord Sidly's will with Mr. Traffic, and a power (if it could be proved,) to ſue for the eſtate. I made no doubt, but Lord Beauclair's hatred would ſtill follow me; ſo thought it expedient to change my name to Villars, which indeed was my real one; but as I never had received any of the eſtate of Beverly, I was not obliged

to keep the name. Our whole fortune, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter providing for our ſea ſtores, amounted to no more than twelve hundred pounds. We took no ſervant with us, but Mrs. Worthy, the nurſe, and a girl, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Louiſa, who was eleven months old.</p>
            <p>THE fourth of June, 1766, we ſailed. The weather was exceeding fine, and continued ſo, till the next afternoon, when a guſt ſuddenly came up. The veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel rolled exceſſively, and my wife and poor little Henry were very ſick. Mrs. Worthy took him for the benefit of the air, on deck, but unuſed to the motion of a ſhip, her head turned; ſhe reeled, and fell overboard—and I never ſaw them more."—Here Mr. Villars was for ſome time incapable of proceeding. "It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs" continued he, after he had recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, "to deſcribe our diſtreſs on this occaſion: the veſſel immediately
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033744_0095_0FF909B2D564AB58"/>
brought to, but the waves ran ſo high, it was impoſſible to ſave them. We ſaw two fiſhing boats at a diſtance, but there could be no poſſibility of their taking them up.</p>
            <p>MY wife continued in fits for many hours; after they left her, ſhe remained in a violent fever, and in her delirium was continually calling for her child; and it was many days e'er ſhe became more tranquil.—I now ſaw it was the will of the Almighty to chaſtiſe us, and prayed fervently for fortitude, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the trial I was in all probability to go through. Our attention was now rouſed by the illneſs of our little Louiſa; who had been obliged to be weaned, during her mother's illneſs; ſhe was for many days ſo bad, that we did not expect ſhe would have got to Madeira alive. After a ſhort paſſage we reached that Iſland; I had letters to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:033744_0096_0FF8C324A4E242C0"/>
many of the principal Merchants there, which not long after our arrival I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; and received the greateſt polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them.</p>
            <p>MY wife and child's ill health, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to ſtay in Madeira. I wrote to Mr. Traffic, and informed him of my loſs, and my intention of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the iſland, which I deſired him to keep ſecret, as well as my changing my name. I alſo incloſed letters to my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſiſter, whom I had not heard from in ſome time; I placed my ſmall ſtock, in a principal houſe; and was enabled to live tolerably well.</p>
            <p>NOTHING material happened, during our reſidence in Madeira; except my wife preſenting me with another ſon, who we called Edward, after my father.— The climate not agreeing with either of us; we embarked for America. We
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033744_0097_0FF909B5D8B8B470"/>
were now poſſeſſed of about two thouſand pounds ſterling. "To you ſir," addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to Mr. Sommers, "I was recommended, and have received the greateſt marks of friendſhip from many gentlemen in this town.—I have lived ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years comfortably; and had it not been for the recollection of paſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I might ſay happily.—Here my youngeſt ſon was born, who after the Hon. Charles Sidly, we named Charles. —At the commencement of the war, we retired to the Village, where we now live, and endeavour in peaceful retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be grateful to God, who has ſupported us through ſo many trials, and has now placed us in a ſituation to enjoy the neceſſaries, and many of the comforts of life."</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS here ended his ſtory; and the company expreſſed the greateſt obligations to him for his condeſcenſion.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:033744_0098_0FF91103DEF07C88"/>
Mr. Hargrave, who could contain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf no longer, and who had diſcovered viſible marks of uneaſineſs, now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached Mr. Villars; and told him, "he was extremely happy to find the family, whom moſt on earth he wiſhed to ſee; and ſhould ever think the accident that drew him to his houſe, the peculiar work of Providence."</p>
            <p>Mr. Villars ſeemed ſurpriſed, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to explain himſelf. "You ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, ſir," continued Mr. Hargrave, "an orphan honoured with the favour of Lord and Lady Beauclair. I have been brought up under their care, and taught (though only a diſtant relation of her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's) to look upon myſelf as their heir. —I had often heard of the ſon they had loſt; but untill within a few years, I never heard the name of Lady Maria; and was much ſurpriſed to find it was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether ſhe was ſtill living.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:033744_0099_0FF90D929B390A38"/>I EVER after this looked on myſelf as an uſurper; and determined to make all poſſible enquiries for the perſon who had a prior right to favours, I was daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; and in caſe I ſhould be ſo fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as to find her, to uſe all my intereſt towards reconciling her to her family.— Heaven has in one reſpect, heard my prayer, and I beg I may be allowed to go immediately to Lady Beauclair."—"By no means, my excellent young friend," replied Mr. Villars, "I cannot expreſs my obligations to you, for your genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; but Lord Beauclair's hatred againſt me and mine, is ſo deeply rooted, that you would, by interceding for us, only deprive yourſelf of his favour, without rendering us any eſſential ſervice.</p>
            <p>HARGRAVE ſaid, he would be ruled by him, for the preſent, but if ever Lord Beauclair's eſtate came in his poſſeſſion, he ſhould not deter him from doing juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Many obliging things were ſaid, on
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033744_0100_0FF90D9509B22998"/>
both ſides, but it growing late, the party ſeparated for the night, after Colonel Rightly had engaged them to dine with him the next day. Miſs Sommers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the generoſity of her heroic Harry (as ſhe often called him) retired, but not to reſt, the drowſy god was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from her eyes, by pleaſing reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſhe roſe, and determined to ſpend the remainder of the night in writing to her dear Louiſa, to whom ſhe gave a full account of what had paſſed. "Be happy my dear Louiſa," concluded ſhe, "you will have a fortune that Sir William Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more can have no objections to, whilſt I glory in beſtowing mine, on the man, who ſo nobly prefers generoſity to afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." It was very late before Miſs Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers finiſhed her letter, which ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched early next morning.</p>
            <p>AT two o'clock, Captain Bellmore and Mr. Hargrave attended the ladies to Col.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:033744_0101_0FF90D9969DC9550"/>
Rightly's, as Mr. Sommers had buſineſs that would engage him till late. The old gentleman received them with his uſual politeneſs, and paſſed many encomiums on the generous behaviour of Hargrave, in which all the company joined him. Mr. Villars and Mr. Sommers ſoon join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and the day was ſpent with the utmoſt cordiality. Soon after dinner Mr. Hargrave went out of the room, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time. Mrs. Sommers, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf to Col. Rightly, ſaid, "I dare ſay our young friend is gone to pay a viſit to his old nurſe:" "No doubt of it madam," replied he. He then informed Mr. Villars of the many particulars relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Mrs. Carely; "come," continued he, "we will paſs her room, as if by chance, and you will be more than ever delighted with Hargrave. I think he never appears in a more amiable light, than when he is ſaying obliging things to this poor woman," Mr. Villars then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:033744_0102_0FF90D9D069B2598"/>
him. The room door was open; they entered.—"Harry," ſaid Colonel Rightly, "I am going to aſk Mr. Villars's opinion of ſome curioſities in my green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; will you be of the party?" Mrs. Carely roſe as they entered, on ſeeing Mr. Villars, ſhe ſtarted, and ſeemed very much aſtoniſhed; Mr. Villars was equally ſtruck. What is the matter ſir?" ſaid Hargrave, "do you know this good woman. "Oh!" ſaid he, ſhe is ſo like; — He had no time to ſay more, ſhe flew to him, and graſping his knees, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is he—it is he himſelf, and fell ſenſeleſs on the floor. Mr. Hargrave ran for water, while Col. Rightly aſſiſted, to lay her on the bed. Villars walked the room, in great agitation; the Col. and Hargrave, were equally aſtoniſhed; both wiſhed, but dared not aſk an explanation. An account of Mrs. Carley's ſituation, reached the reſt of the company, who all immediately went to her room; ſhe at
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:033744_0103_0FF90DA2C8E9B918"/>
length opened her eyes, but ſeemed inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible who were around her. Mr. Villars ſtill continued walking, ſometimes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and looking at Hargrave, then at Mrs. Carley.—Hargrave at length broke ſilence. "Sir," ſaid he, "if you were to ſpeak to her, it might perhaps bring her to her recollection." Oh! returned he, graſping his hand, could I be but certain; a diſapointment would be too—too much —Here a friendly ſhower of tears came to his relief; the ſound of his voice rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mrs. Carley from her lethargy—
"Where—where is he, ſaid ſhe, riſing; "can I once more behold my beloved Maſter."
"My dear Mrs. Worthy," exclaimed he, "where is my"—. He could not proceed.</p>
            <p>"I KNOW what you would aſk," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe: "there," pointing to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, "behold and bleſs your ſon.— Here, gentle reader, we muſt draw a veil
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:033744_0104_0FF90DA46B511C80"/>
o'er the enſuing ſcene, which words are too weak to paint. Let the affectionate Father—the dutiful Son—the ſincere Friend—figure to themſelves the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this joyful moment.</p>
            <p>Mrs. CARELY was now ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to tell Mr. Villars they were taken up by a fiſherman; that after much trouble and difficulty, ſhe had conveyed the child to his Grand-Mama, where he was brought up in ignorance of his birth. —When her ſpirits were more compoſed, ſhe ſaid, ſhe would give him all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>"AH! my dear Harry!" ſaid Mr. Villars, "I can now eaſily account for my feelings, when I firſt ſaw you. I then thought it proceeded from your likeneſs to Lord Sidly; but it was nature that pointed out my ſon. How thankful ought
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:033744_0105_0FF90DA7E2739098"/>
I to be to Divine Providence, who by an unforeſeen accident, has beſtowed the greateſt of bleſſings on me."</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore now approached; and taking a hand of each, ſaid, "he ſhould ever think the event that had near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put a period to his days, the happieſt of his life, ſince it had been productive of ſo pleaſing a diſcovery."—"How much am I obliged to my dear William for his generous ſentiments," returned Hargrave, "Heaven, for wiſe purpoſes, often chaſtiſes, to give us the higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for the bleſſings he intends us. The day you mention, was to me the moſt diſtreſſing; and it has proved the moſt fortunate of my life."</p>
            <p>COL. Rightly now informed the Ladies tea was waiting. They then bid Mrs. Carely good night, and returned to the parlour.—After tea, the company
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:033744_0106_0FF90DAA58813950"/>
returned to Mr. Sommers's, and the evening was ſpent with the greateſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.—Mr. Villars, long a ſtranger to happineſs, now confeſſed, that thus unexpectedly meeting with his ſon, and finding him ſo amiable, amply compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for all the troubles he had met with. Though ſtill his joy was not complete until his beloved Maria was acquainted with, and a partaker of his felicity.— He then propoſed they ſhould ſet out the next day for—. This Col. Rightly and Mr. Sommers objected to, ſaying, it would be wrong to ſurpriſe Mrs. Villars; and adviſed him to write and prepare her for their coming.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS conſented, (though with ſome reluctance) to be guided by them; but ſaid his ſpirits were ſo much flurried, he could not write. The ſprightly Eliza (whoſe vivacity had been clouded at the thoughts of her Henry's leaving her)
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:033744_0107_0FF90DADC8559F08"/>
ſaid, ſhe would with pleaſure undertake the taſk if Mr. Villars would permit her. —The eagerneſs with which ſhe ſpoke, plainly diſcovered the ſentiments of her heart.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS, at that moment, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the converſation that had paſſed at his houſe, when firſt Miſs Sommers was mentioned.—He took her hand, and ſmiling, ſaid, "go, my dear Eliza, write your friends the happineſs that await them, and give them your opinion of my Henry."—A deeper dye now o'erſpread her lovely face; and, happy at having an opportunity to retire, ſhe curtſied and withdrew.—She met <note n="*" place="bottom">He is ſtill called Hargrave—as it was not thought proper Lord Beauclair ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the diſcovery.</note> Hargrave in the paſſage and told him, ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to write to Louiſa. He begged her to let him add a poſtſcript. "I muſt tell
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:033744_0108_0FF90DB37ABC1648"/>
my ſiſter," added he, "my felicity will not be complete, until I have made her amiable friend her ſiſter."—"Ah! ſaid Eliza, ſmiling, can I aſpire to the grandſon of Lord Beauclair?"—"Aſpire! my deareſt girl! virtues like thine, merits much more, than I have, or can have, to beſtow. If I was ſo happy as to gain a ſmall place in your eſteem, when I could not tell you on whom you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that favour, let now the brother of your Louiſa plead for a confirmation of that happineſs, he only dared to hope for."</p>
            <p>"HARGRAVE," ſaid ſhe, (reſuming her ſprightly air) "you ſurely forget I have a long letter to write, and do you think I can write any thing coherent, after you have been talking to me in this manner. —But go and comfort Capt. Bellmore, for I ſee his face amazingly lengthened ſince your journey to — has been
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:033744_0109_0FF90DB9552C2E68"/>
poſtponed for a few days."—"I will obey you," replied he, "for believe me, next to the happineſs I hope for with my beloved Eliza, the firſt wiſh of my heart, is to ſee him happy with Louiſa. He then left her, and went in ſearch of his friend, who was waiting for him with Mr. Villars.</p>
            <p>Mr. SOMMERS begged the company the next day to dine, and propoſed that good Mrs. Carely ſhould be there; as he ſuppoſed ſhe had many intereſting things to relate: this was concluded on, and they wiſhed him a good night.—Eliza ſpent part of the night in writing to Louiſa; but, as the reader is already acquainted with the purport of the letter, we will omit it, and return to Mr. Hargrave; who, after wiſhing his Father a good night, returned to his friend, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom was torn between hopes and fears. His Louiſa's promiſe he knew was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:033744_0110_0FF90DBD1C3ABAF8"/>
but the uncertainty of Mr. Villars favouring his wiſhes, made him wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—he was walking the room in a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner, when his friend entered.— "What, William," ſaid he, "ever thoughtful—come, be chearful, and be a partaker of the happineſs I now enjoy. Your Henry is not the nothing, he once thought himſelf."—"I do indeed moſt ſincerely rejoice in this unexpected diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very," returned the Captain, "you know my heart—I need not tell my friend, that whatever gives him pain or pleaſure, has the ſame effect on me; how great then muſt be my ſatisfaction, to find him a member of ſo worthy a family."</p>
            <p>"I NEVER," ſaid Hargrave, "was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in my ſituation, though I experienced the greateſt kindneſs from Lord and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Beauclair. I ever looked on myſelf as an uſurper; and the idea of Lady Maria's ſufferings were always in my mind. I
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:033744_0111_0FF90DF352F50ED0"/>
had heard of many things that my Father related, and it was my determination to find her, if alive; but, Oh! William, what muſt be my feelings, to find that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured woman in my Mother.—I wiſh much to hear Mrs. Carely's account, for I am convinced Lord Beauclair is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of my being his grand-ſon."</p>
            <p>"BUT, my dear friend," ſaid the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, "you mention nothing of your lovely ſiſter; ſhall I be happy, or forever miſerable?"—"Can you doubt my wiſhes to ſee you happy?"—replied Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave; "be aſſured no intereſt of mine ſhall be wanting to make you ſo; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I ſee no great difficulty—you are ſure of Louiſa's affection, and ought to be ſatisfied for the preſent." And do you make no allowance for the impatience of a lover?" ſaid Belmore. "Indeed I do," returned he, "for I have experienced a a great deal of it myſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="unknown:033744_0112_0FF90E252E9B4A28"/>MUCH more was ſaid on the ſame ſubject, and Hargrave had nearly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Capt. to hope, and be happy, when the clock, by one ſtroke, reminded them of its being time to retire. The next day, the company all aſſembled at Mr. Sommers's; as ſoon as the cloth was removed, Mrs. Carely was called up; ſhe was no ſooner ſeated, than Mr. Villars begged ſhe would favour them with an account of what befel her, after her fall from the ſhip. "Ah! ſir, we met with many difficulties; but ſince I am ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to ſee my dear young maſter with you, I ſhall die contented." She then began as follows:</p>
            <p>"YOU no doubt ſir, remember maſter Harry was very ſick, and I carried him on deck for the benefit of the air; it was careleſs in me to walk ſo nigh the ſide of the veſſel. I know not what it was, but ſomething ſtruck me, and I fell over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board;
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:033744_0113_0FF90E545FC20CF8"/>
I claſped the child in my arms, and I believe for ſome time I floated on the water; the firſt I remembered was finding myſelf in a dirty fiſhing-boat, with two men; they carried us to a ſhore which was not far diſtant, and which they told me was the coaſt of Ireland. I was too weak to walk, and one of the men ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me, while the other carried the child; they carried me to a neat little houſe near the banks of the river, and the women ſupplied us with dry clothes; the dear child ſeemed almoſt inſenſible to every thing till the next day, he then cried very much for his Mamma. The good woman allowed us to ſtay ſeveral days, and then adviſed me to apply for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which I did; but I could earn very little with the child. I had three guineas, which I endeavoured to keep, to pay our paſſage to England.</p>
            <p>I worked a year in Ireland, to get myſelf
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:033744_0114_0FF90EFB46289D48"/>
and the child a few clothes; but this I could not have accompliſhed, had it not been for the humanity of the lady, with whom I lived. I told her, and no one elſe, who we were; and ſhe adviſed me to write to Lord Beauclair. This I did not, as I knew it would be in vain; but I wiſhed much to go to England, and ſhe was ſo good as to furniſh me with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the paſſage.</p>
            <p>THE poor dear child, had forgot to call on his papa and mamma; and I would not remind him of them, as I thought it beſt in our preſent ſituation, to call him my own. When we arrived in Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, I had but two guineas left; I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended going to Briſtol, to Mr. Traffic, from whom I was in hopes to hear of you and my Lady. I ſet out in a waggon. I met on the road a fellow ſervant, that had lived with us at Bath. I aſked him, if Mr. Traffic ſtill lived in Briſtol; he ſaid
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:033744_0115_0FF90EFEBA4CBA78"/>
he did, but that he had left town for the ſummer. I begged him to tell me if there was any accounts from you? He ſaid he had been informed, you had ſailed for India; that the ſhip was loſt, and it was ſuppoſed, all had periſhed.</p>
            <p>OH! Sir, I now indeed thought my heart would have broke.—This very night our dear child fell ſick, occaſioned by fatigue; we ſtopped at a ſmall farm-houſe, and were obliged to ſtay there ſeveral weeks; the child remained long ſick, and had he been well, I knew not where to go; I had but one brother, (and he lived in Wales) and no other relations, that had it in their power to ſerve me. The ſickly looks of my poor boy prevented any one's hiring me; I was reduced to my laſt crown, when a thought ſtruck me, that if lady Beauclair ſaw the child, ſhe might perhaps have compaſſion on him; as his parents were dead, their hatred
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:033744_0116_0FF90F008C454FC8"/>
might be at an end: I thought ſhe would know him by the medal, which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, Sir, ſhe tied about his neck at Bath, and which he had worn ever ſince.</p>
            <p>I determined to go to London, if I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged my way. I ſet out the next day, carrying the child on my back; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would walk a little way. I ſold the beſt gown I had, and was enabled to hire a lodging every night. We at length arrived in London; and I waited on Lady Beauclair, at a time I knew his Lordſhip was out. I got admittance, and related the whole ſtory to her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſhe at firſt thought me an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; but when I ſhewed her the medal, ſhe wept exceedingly; "poor boy!" ſaid ſhe, "it is hard he ſhould ſuffer for the faults of his parents. Here, nurſe," added ſhe, "is ſix guineas, take a ſmall lodging nigh, and let me ſee you again, as ſoon as you have an opportunity." I
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:033744_0117_0FF8C353430DC0E8"/>
had thanked her, and was taking my leave, when the child began to cry.— "What is the matter with him, nurſe," ſaid her Ladyſhip, "nurſe," cried the child, "I uſed to call her nurſe, and there was ſomebody I uſed to call Papa and Mama—but they are all gone now," ſaid he crying, "and I have no friend left but my poor mother here: Won't you, madam, be my friend?" This ſo affected her Ladyſhip, ſhe could ſcarce ſpeak: "yes, indeed, I will," anſwered ſhe, "but I cannot ſee you longer now. Go home, nurſe," continued ſhe, "and be ſure you let no one know whoſe child he is." I ſoon after took my leave. I went again in a few days; her Ladyſhip aſked me very particularly, if I had obeyed her orders? I told I had; ſhe then told me, ſhe would ſee me in a ſhort time in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Lord Beauclair, and that I muſt not contradict any thing ſhe ſaid. I the next day was ſent for. I was ſhewn
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:033744_0118_0FF90F045721E7D0"/>
into my Lady's dreſſing-room. She told me, ſhe wiſhed to have the child in the houſe; and had mentioned him, as a poor child ſhe had taken a fancy to, and that I muſt moſt ſolemnly promiſe, not to mention to the child or any one elſe who he was; or make any enquiry about his parents. Though my heart recoiled at this promiſe, I was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to make it.—She then left me, and returned to the parlour: I was ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent for.—My Lord ſoon entered. "Here, my Lord," ſaid ſhe "is the little boy I mentioned to you."—"He is a fine fellow," anſwered he: "and I dare ſay if you wiſh to take the child, his parents will have no objection: as it will be greatly to his advantage.—"His parents are dead," replied her Ladyſhip, "and he has no one to take care of him but this good woman."—"Then you had better take her in your ſervice, as the child will want a nurſe," returned his
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:033744_0119_0FF90F0B95507B60"/>
Lordſhip.—I was now ordered to give up my lodging, and return immediately.—Oh, Sir! I thought my heart would have burſt, to ſee the dear child taken into his Grandfathers houſe as an object of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I believe my Lady read my thoughts; for as ſoon as we were alone, ſhe ſaid, "you no doubt, nurſe, think it ſtrange, that I do not own my Grandſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, I would willingly do it; but if Lord Beauclair had the moſt diſtant idea of his being Beverly's ſon, he would never be prevailed on to ſee him."—She then told me to call him Henry Hargrave.</p>
            <p>I WAS ſhewn to a very genteel apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment near her Ladyſhip's: in this room were two beds, one for my ſweet boy, and the other for myſelf.—There was one cloſet filled with genteel cloathing for him, and a great deal of very good for myſelf. The other was filled with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of curious toys.—I ſhall never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:033744_0120_0FF90F0E1A2EE180"/>
the joy he expreſſed in the opening of theſe cloſets; I had got all his things down, and he was ſitting in the midſt of them, when her Ladyſhip entered; he was ſo deeply engaged, he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her; ſhe held up her finger in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſilence, and ſtood for ſome time ſilently admiring him; he at laſt ſaw, and ran to her; he took her hand and kiſſed it.</p>
            <p>"AH, madam!" ſaid he, "have you put all theſe pretty things here for me?" "Yes my dear," anſwered her Ladyſhip, "and you ſhall have a great many more, if you are a good boy."—"Indeed I will be very good; and love you dearly, if you will allow it," ſaid he.—This ſeemed to affect her very much: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was a long time before ſhe could ſee him unmoved.—Her affection for him ſeemed daily to encreaſe, and my Lord grew very fond of him. Maſters of every
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:033744_0121_0FF90F1081A15008"/>
kind were got for him, and my whole employment was to wait on this dear child; and had it not been for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of yourſelf and my Lady, I ſhould have been perfectly happy.</p>
            <p>I SAW with pleaſure the improvement of my little maſter; nothing material happened during ſeveral years. Maſter Harry grew faſt, and had every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a young man of faſhion could have. —He paſſed for a diſtant relation of her Ladyſhip's, and was beloved by every body.</p>
            <p>ABOUT four years ago, he heard Lord Beauclair had a daughter, whom he had diſinherited; and it was uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was ſtill living. He ſeemed more thoughtful, and would ſometimes aſk me queſtions that rung my very ſoul; and I was often tempted to break my promiſe; but fearing it might be a diſadvantage to him, I remained ſilent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:033744_0122_0FF90F13B2D1A8A8"/>SOMETIME after the war broke out in America, he expreſſed a deſire to go into the army. My Lord and Lady were very much averſe to it; but my Lord ſeeing him ſo anxious, he procured him a lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy.—During my ſtay at lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair's, I married Edward Carely, his Lordſhip's Butler. My Lady was ſo very uneaſy at Mr. Hargrave's going alone to America, that my Lord, to make her eaſy, gave Edward twenty guineas to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and then procured him a halbert, that we might come out with Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave, which we did; and both of us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be as ſerviceable as was in our power.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! my poor Edward was ſhot at the defeat of Cornwallis;—ſince that time, I have ſtill continued with Mr. Hargrave.—The regiment had orders to march one morning by the dawn of day: I went, as uſual, to know if my young
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:033744_0123_0FF90F1607880250"/>
maſter had any commands for me; when, to my great ſurpriſe, I found his bed not tumbled. He was gone—and I knew not where to look for him. I made every enquiry for him, but to no purpoſe.— The fourth day, I heard two officers talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about him: they ſaid, that Captain Bellmore was certainly killed; and if Mr. Hargrave had gone in ſearch of him, he would have been back, had he not been taken. They then ſaid, it would, they were afraid, go hard with him, as he would doubtleſs be taken for a ſpy.</p>
            <p>THIS terrified me to ſuch a degree, I ſcarcely know how I got to the tent.— I immediately took the little money I had, and a change of cloaths in a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſet out I knew not whether.— I thought I heard the gentlemen ſay, he would be brought to this place.—I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired my way: and had not proceeded far, before I was taken up and ſearched.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:033744_0124_0FF90F184787A0A8"/>
They ſaid, I had been employed by the enemy to carry letters to diſaffected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and gain intelligence: this I poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denied. I told them the reaſon of my leaving the camp, but was not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.—I was immediately put under guard, and after ſome months confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, brought here, where I muſt have died, had not your dear ſon heard of me, and came to my relief."</p>
            <p>HERE the good woman ceaſed; and the company thanked her for the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhe had given them. Mr. Villars ſaid he ſhould ever regard her for the care ſhe had taken of his ſon; and the extreme tenderneſs ſhe had ſhewn him; he then ſaid, when Colonel Rightly could provide a perſon to take her place, ſhe ſhould go and ſpend the remainder of her days with them, to which ſhe eagerly conſented.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="unknown:033744_0125_0FF90F1C588F5698"/>IT was now concluded they ſhould ſet out in a few days. As nothing material happened during theſe few days, we will leave the gentlemen, and return to the little cottage of Mr. Villars, where the charming Louiſa was ſitting at work with her mamma.—Love until now, a ſtranger to her breaſt, had robbed her cheeks of its wonted bloom, and left a languid paleneſs, that rather added to her charms. Mrs. Villars ſaw, with pain, the change; and had for ſome time ſought an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak to her.</p>
            <p>POOR Louiſa knew a Peace between England and America, was negociating; and conſequently, the troops would be recalled. Though ſhe would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a clandeſtine marriage, ſtill ſhe could not ſupport the thought of never again beholding her beloved William.— Forgetting ſhe was not alone, ſhe ſighed deeply. Mrs. Villars now ſpoke: what
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:033744_0126_0FF90F1DF13E00B8"/>
is the matter Louiſa?" ſaid ſhe, "you are not well, I fear.—A conſcious bluſh o'er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread her cheek; "I am very well, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, why do you think otherwiſe?"— "No, my dear Louiſa," replied Mrs. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, "your heart is not at eaſe; be not ſurpriſed, when I tell you I have long known the cauſe of the change, which I grieve to ſee in your health."</p>
            <p>LOUISA, ever uſed to make her mama her friend and confidant, now threw herſelf into her arms, and confeſſed her love, her promiſe to Captain Bellmore, and all her doubts and fears.—Mrs. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars embraced her tenderly, and ſaid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny affectionate things; which, though ſhe did not attempt to cheriſh her hopes, was ſtill a balm to her drooping ſpirits.</p>
            <p>SOME hours paſt in this manner; when Louiſa <note n="*" place="bottom">The letter Miſs Sommers wrote, for permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to discover Mr. Villars's family, never came to hand.</note> received a letter from her friend,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:033744_0127_0FF90F2102F9BBE8"/>
which gave them an account of Mr. Hargrave's generous behaviour before he was diſcovered to be the ſon of Mr. Villars.</p>
            <p>THEY had ſcarcely time to extol his diſintereſtedneſs, when Edward entered with another, which contained the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come news of the diſcovery. The joy of this worthy Family may be more eaſily imagined than deſcribed. To find in ſo fine a youth, the ſon, ſhe had ſo long loſt, was too much for the depreſſed ſpirits of Mrs. Villars; and Louiſa and her little brothers could ſcarcely keep her from fainting. She at length recovered ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to thank the Supreme Being, who, for wiſe purpoſes, had robbed her of her Son, and now bleſſed the declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years, by returning him ſo worthy.</p>
            <p>THE boys expreſſed their ſatisfaction in the livelieſt manner. Louiſa for a time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the ſorrows of her heart; and the
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:033744_0128_0FF90F235ADC82B8"/>
voice of joy and gladneſs reſounded in this peaceful habitation. They paſſed three days in the utmoſt impatience; on the fourth, which was the day they were expected, Louiſa, attended by her two brothers, and ſeveral of the genteel peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the village, rode out to meet them. At the end of four miles, they perceived them advancing. At the ſight of Capt. Bellmore, (who Louiſa had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed was coming with them,) the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle dropped from her hand, and ſhe was near falling to the ground. A Miſs Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, and her brother, who were nigh, ſupported her, and ſhe ſoon recovered, ſufficiently to go on.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS was extremely pleaſed with this mark of attention in his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; the amiable Henry immediately diſmounted, and flew to his ſiſter. "Let me aſſiſt you to alight, my dear Louiſa," ſaid he, "you look ill; ſhall I call for
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:033744_0129_0FF90F25B65F9DE0"/>
any aſſiſtance?" "No, my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my ſpirits are only a little flurried at this unexpected happineſs," returned ſhe. The company now all advanced: The complaiſance which was due to the brother on this occaſion, could ſcarcely reſtrain the Capt. from flying to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her brother, who, after tenderly preſſing her to his breaſt, left her to his friend, and returned to his Father, who was receiving the congratulations of his neighbours; which took up ſo much time, that the lovers had an opportunity, unobſerved, to pour forth the tendereſt effuſions of the heart.</p>
            <p>LOUISA, being now perfectly recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, remounted her horſe, and they all proceeded toward the village, where they arrived in a ſhort time.—Mrs. Villars did not wiſh to meet her ſon in company; —his Father and Louiſa, therefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to her apartment.—Inured to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:033744_0130_0FF90F2A75E253A8"/>
grief, and a ſtranger to exceſs of joy, Mrs. Villars could not ſummon reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient to receive him with any degree of compoſure: when he entered the room, ſhe was nigh fainting; and could only ſay when he threw himſelf at her feet. "My beloved! my long loſt Son!"—and fell ſenſeleſs in his arms.— A maternal tear came to her relief, and ſhe ſoon recovered.</p>
            <p>AFTER ſome time ſpent in the moſt affecting manner, ſhe aſked him ſeveral queſtions concerning her Parents; this was the ſubject, of all others, he moſt wiſhed to avoid. "When you are more compoſed, my dear madam," ſaid he, "I will give you all the information in my power; at preſent, let us join our friends, and be happy."—She conſented, and ſuffered herſelf to be led to the parlour, where the company were all aſſembled. —The day was ſpent with the utmoſt joy
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:033744_0131_0FF8C357E7E7A320"/>
and ſatisfaction; and concluded with a ſocial dance.</p>
            <p>THE next morning, Mr. Hargrave took an opportunity to tell Louiſa, he hoped to have it in his power to make her happy with his friend, if ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as much of the turtle as he had ſince they left her.—"Believe me, my dear ſiſter," ſaid he, "I cannot be completely happy, while you and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam are wretched;—our departure for England muſt be ſpeedy." At theſe words, the tears ſtarted in her eyes.— Oh! my brother," ſaid ſhe, "are you again to leave us."—"It cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided," replied he, "our troops will ſoon be recalled; and indeed all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt demand my going."</p>
            <p>I intend mentioning to my grandmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the diſcovery I have made; and make no doubt but I ſhall be able to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:033744_0132_0FF90F2F3AA2E8F8"/>
bring about a reconciliation; for ſince Lord Beauclair's health has been declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have had great reaſon to think ſomething hangs heavy at his heart. This once accompliſhed, Sir John Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more's conſent to your union is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."</p>
            <p>"My dear, brother," ſaid Louiſa, "in ſtriving to reconcile the families, you will ruin your future proſpects."— "No no, my dear," returned he, "I ſhall go cautiouſly to work for all our ſakes; keep up your ſpirits, and hope the beſt: but do not mention my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to any one."</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore now approached;— Henry, making an excuſe, left them; "William," ſaid he, turning to Louiſa as he went out, "knows my intentions; you need be under no reſtraint with him." —"What an excellent Brother have I,"
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:033744_0133_0FF90F324810DD78"/>
ſaid Louiſa.—"You know not nigh his worth," returned the Captain. She then told him the converſation which had juſt paſſed.—"Oh! my dear Louiſa," ſaid he, "he has not let you into half his views, he ſeems determined to make us happy."—"You muſt ſoon leave us," interrupted ſhe, "perhaps never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn."—"My deareſt life," cried he, preſſing her to his heart, nothing but death ſhall keep me from you.—I am obliged to go with the regiment; but I will ſoon return."</p>
            <p>LOUISA could with difficulty refrain from tears; the thought of their going was too much for her.—A converſation the moſt tender, enſued; and nigh two hours paſt imperceptibly.</p>
            <p>THE generous Henry was not unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at this time; he took his parents aſide, and, finding they were acquainted
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:033744_0134_0FF90F33DEE30F08"/>
with the attachment of his friend and ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, endeavoured to gain their conſent to their union.—Mr. Villars ſaid he had not the leaſt objection, if Sir John Bellmore's conſent could be obtained.</p>
            <p>HENRY told him ingenuouſly, that there was no reaſon to expect that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fortune; but he ſhould endeavour to obtain it, and only begged his Father if he failed, not to oppoſe an union, on which the happineſs of two people moſt dear to him, depended.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS was ſo happy at again find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this long-loſt Son, it was difficult for him to refuſe him any thing. He at length ſaid, he would do nothing to oppoſe their happineſs. This was ſo nigh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, the ſon would preſs no farther; but acknowledged it a particular favour done himſelf.</p>
            <p>He then returned to the lovers, and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:033744_0135_0FF90F36314075A0"/>
told them, as he was tired of ſeeing long faces, he had been making intereſt to get them in bondage, ſince he found nothing ſhort of everlaſting chains would content them; they both ſmiled, but could not comprehend him: he in a few words explained himſelf. The gloom was immediately baniſhed from their countenances, and there was not a heavy heart at the cottage.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL weeks was ſpent in the greateſt felicity; when Mr. Hargrave received a letter from Mr. Sommers, in which he requeſted him to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to town, as he had received diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches from England for him. He immediately prepared for his journey, and ſet out the next day; leaving his friend, who was now as lively as himſelf, to keep up their ſpirits until his return.</p>
            <p>THE thought of ſeeing his Eliza, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:033744_0136_0FF90F3884E1C568"/>
almoſt every other idea, and he arrived in town much ſooner than could be expected.—Mr. Sommers was gone out of town, and not expected in leſs than two days. Mrs. Sommers received him with the greateſt cordiality, and begged he would make her houſe his home, whilſt in town; to this he willingly conſented—and his time was ſpent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely with his beloved Eliza, excepting a viſit to Col. Rightly, and the good Nurſe, Mrs. Carely.</p>
            <p>Mr. SOMMERS at length arrived; and on ſeeing Mr. Hargrave, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to meet him, he bowed reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and taking a letter out of his pocket, preſented it to him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Hargrave had requeſted Mr. Sommers to open all his letters.</note>—My Lord," ſaid he, I beg leave to wiſh your Lordſhip joy of a title and fortune, of which few are as deſerving." He ſtarted,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:033744_0137_0FF90F3AD4460870"/>
turned pale, and let the letter drop from his hand: Mr. Sommers took it up, and again preſented it to him.—"Be not ſurpriſed, my Lord," ſaid he, Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair lived to a good old age, and died ſenſible of his error.—Ah! then let me ſee the letter," ſaid he eagerly; and wip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the tears which flowed very faſt, he opened it, and read as follows:

            <p>"Oh!" cried he, his tears flowing afreſh, "had I been with him in his laſt days!—Providence, for wiſe purpoſes, had ordered it otherwiſe," ſaid Mr. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers; "had you not come to America, you would, in all probability, never have diſcovered the worthieſt of parents." "True," anſwered he, "I muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. I loved Lord Beauclair as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, though I only thought him a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, and to have attended him in his illneſs and to have adminiſtered conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his afflicted mind, would have
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:033744_0140_0FF90F4202131CD8"/>
been a great ſatisfaction to me; but I thank the Almighty who, by the moſt myſterious means, has led me to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and enabled me to make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their decline of life." "Thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents," anſwered Mr. Sommers, "are worthy of yourſelf."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Sommers and her daughter now roſe, to pay the accuſtomary compliments to the young Lord; after her mother, Miſs Sommers attempted to ſpeak, but her heart was too full lor utterance; ſhe thought him entirely loſt to her; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents died away on her tongue, and ſhe would have ſunk on the ſofa, had he not caught her in his arms, and turning to Mr. Sommers, "On you, Sir, depends my fate, I cannot be happy without your charming daughter; I often attempted to ſpeak to you on this ſubject, but my dependant ſtate kept me ſilent; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that awaits me, I ſhall only prize in
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:033744_0141_0FF90F4450FBC358"/>
ſharing it with her." Mr. Sommers had for ſome time ſeen an attachment between his young friend and daughter, and would never have been averſe to the match; but now to hear him ſpeak in this manner, was quite beyond his moſt ſanguine expectation. "My Lord," ſaid he, "I hope Eliza is ſenſible of the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our you do her, nothing can give me more pleaſure than ſuch a connection; though your fortune is more than ſhe has a right to expect; believe me, I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem your virtues much higher, and ſhould have been happy, had you put it in my power to have convinced you, that my conſent would have as freely been given to Mr. Hargrave as to Lord Beauclair." "Oh! Sir," returned his Lordſhip, "you have long ſince convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me of your friendſhip; you now make me the happieſt of men; I will endeavour to merit, as far as lies in my power, the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:033744_0142_0FF90F492AEF0B08"/>
treaſure you have beſtowed on me; her happineſs ſhall be my chief ſtudy."</p>
            <p>During the above converſation, Miſs Sommers retired to the window, to avoid confuſion; he went to her, and preſſing her to his boſom, ſaid, "my dear Eliza, you ſay nothing." "You cannot, my Lord," returned ſhe, "think me inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the honour your Lordſhip does me." "This ſtill from <hi>you,</hi> my Eliza— I am ſtill your Henry, ſpeak to me as you uſed to do, and I am happy." "If any thing I can ſay or do will make you happy, believe me, you will never be otherwiſe. "Come, come, my dear," ſaid Mr. Sommers to his Lady, "I ſee theſe young people ſeem to underſtand each other ſo well, I believe they will diſpenſe with our company." So ſaying, they left the room.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair told her, there was
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:033744_0143_0FF90F4AC5261998"/>
an abſolute neceſſity for his going imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to England; and earneſtly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have the ceremony performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went.—The thought of parting, drew tears from Eliza. She conſented, to his wiſhes; and it was concluded, the marriage ſhould take place as ſoon as Mr. Villars's family could come to town.</p>
            <p>IT was late when they parted; Lord Beauclair retired to write to Lady Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair, as an opportunity offered for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He wrote to her in the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate manner, giving her a full account of his meeting with his parents; his engagements with Miſs Sommers, and his intention of ſoon returning: he ſaid nothing of a deſign he had of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading his father and his family to return with him to England, leaſt he ſhould fail. —He ſpent the next day with his Eliza, and the following ſet out for—, where he ſoon arrived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="unknown:033744_0144_0FF90F4E8F5454E8"/>Mrs. VILLARS bore the death of her father, with greater reſignation than her ſon expected; his having mentioned her with kindneſs in his laſt moments, ſeemed a great conſolation. "He has forgiven me!" exclaimed ſhe, claſping her hands, "he no doubt, bleſſed me with his dying breath! and I am happy my mother too! could I once more throw myſelf at her feet."</p>
            <p>"YOU ſhall, my deareſt madam." an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Lord Beauclair; it is my earneſt deſire that we will return to England." —"What," ſaid Mr. Villars, "go to a place where I have never experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any thing but trouble."—"Every comfort awaits you now, my dear Sir; —If the fifteen thouſand pounds my Grandfather has left my Mother, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, as much of my fortune as you wiſh to make uſe of, is entirely at your ſervice."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="unknown:033744_0145_0FF90F5028939A90"/>AH! my Henry, ſuch a Son as you are, can be refuſed nothing. Fifteen thouſand pounds is much more than we want for your Mother; and I will never alter our manner of living. If we go with you to England, we muſt inſiſt on living retired." In this he was joined by Mrs Villars.</p>
            <p>THEIR amiable ſon took a hand of each. "You ſhall live as you pleaſe, my dear Parents," ſaid he, "only let me have the happineſs of having you near me." He then informed them of his engagements with Miſs Sommers. He begged his Father's pardon for not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting him; he ſaid his affections were engaged, before he knew he had a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That as he had often heard his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Miſs Sommers, he had ventured to aſk his Papa's conſent; which he had obtained, and expreſſed a wiſh, that the union might ſoon take place. Mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:033744_0146_0FF8C35AEF262508"/>
told him, he had ſeen the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them; that it gave him pleaſure, and he ſhould not retard their happineſs.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair thanked him; and as he thought he ſaw no obſtacle to the union of his ſiſter and friend, mentioned it.—Mr. Villars ſaid he had no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but he thought Sir John Bellmore's conſent ought to be gained. "But,"— added he, "he is ſaid to be an odd kind of a man; and I make no doubt, but he has made engagements for his ſon."</p>
            <p>AT that moment, Capt. Bellmore and Louiſa, with her Brothers, returned from walking. They were all ſoon acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what had happened: (as ſoon as they entered, Mrs. Villars retired to her chamber, to indulge her tears.) They all advanced, to congratulate the young Lord. A tear ſtole down the cheek of
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:033744_0147_0FF90F52820C75B8"/>
the gentle Louiſa: her Brother's good fortune, was occaſioned by the death of her Grandfather; who, unkind as he had been, ſhe was always taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere: "come my dear Louiſa," cried her Brother, "be chearful; what do you ſay for a trip to England." "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, looking at her Father. "True," ſaid Mr. Villars, your brother has even perſuaded me to go. She then turned her eyes on the Captain, who was in an extacy—"my dear Henry," ſaid he to him in a low voice, "you are the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Angel of us all." Louiſa and her Brother, expreſſed much ſatisfaction at the thoughts of going to England.— Mr. Villars ſaid it would ever make him happy, to have his children ſo; but could he have kept them all with him, he would have preferred ſtaying in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>TRANQUILITY again reigned at the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:033744_0148_0FF90F54D38AE248"/>
cottage; and the hearts of the worthy poor, were gladdened by the generoſity of the amiable Henry. The report of their quitting the place, was ſoon known; and moſt ſincerely regretted. A gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe lands joined Mr. Villars, purchaſed the farm; and preparations were made for their removal; which was accompliſhed in ſix weeks.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair, and his ſiſter, wrote to Miſs Sommers, to apprize her of their coming; they had a ſhort paſſage, and arrived, amidſt the congratulations of their friends. Mr. Sommers inſiſted on their making his houſe their home, during their ſtay in town. The worthy Mrs. Carely, immediately waited on Mrs. Villars; ſhe threw herſelf at her feet, and bathed her hands with her tears. Mrs. Villars was very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, ſhe wiſhed to aſk her many queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:033744_0149_0FF90F57253B6328"/>
and for that purpoſe retired with her to her chamber.</p>
            <p>SOON after they arrived, preparations were made for the nuptials of Lord Beauclair and Miſs Sommers; which took place in a month. The ſprightly Eliza, though always charming, this day ſhone more than ever. Her dreſs, was a white luſtring ſprigged with ſilver, and flounced with a ſilver net; feſtooned with bunches of white roſes, and lillies of the valley; her fine dark hair, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed by powder, hang in ringlets down her neck; on her head, ſhe wore a ſprig of lillies of the valley, and a white feather.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair looked remarkably well; he was dreſſed entirely in his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, excepting a white ſattin veſt, trimmed with ſilver lace. Louiſa appeared uncommonly beautiful. Capt. Bellmore,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:033744_0150_0FF90F5975904F90"/>
who had recovered his ſpirits, from the pleaſing hopes he now enjoyed; was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably chearful, which made him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (particularly to Louiſa) more charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than ever. Soon after the nuptials, they were informed a fleet would ſail for England, ſome time in July, with a diviſion of the troops. As peace had taken place, it was not difficult for them to obtain leave to return home.</p>
            <p>PREPARATIONS were made for the paſſage; and in a few weeks they were ready to embark for England.— Lady Beauclair felt a reluctance at quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her parents; which nothing but the extreme affection ſhe had for her Lord, could eraſe.</p>
            <p>THE fleet being ready to ſail, they embarked;—Mrs. Carely again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her beloved Miſtreſs's ſervice.— Mr. Sommers returned home with his
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:033744_0151_0FF90F5BCD235F70"/>
family, and though they parted with their daughter, with reluctance, they were happy to ſee her ſo well ſituated. The paſſage was pleaſant; they ſpent the time happily, and arrived in perfect health, the firſt week in September.</p>
            <p>WHEN they arrived in London, Lord Beauclair took lodgings not far from Lady Beauclair; as he wiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Grandmother for the interview, ſhe ſo little expected. Mrs. Villars would gladly have flown to her mother; but ſhe was perſuaded to reſtrain her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience for a ſhort time. Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair, ſent to inform her of his arrival, and his intention of waiting on her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. The old Lady met him with emotion; "Oh! my Son!" ſaid ſhe, am I once more permitted to fold thee in theſe arms?—But ſay, can you forgive me? can you forgive the ſhade of your departed Grandfather, for the unkind
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:033744_0152_0FF90F5E235201E8"/>
uſage your poor mother has received, and our bringing you up in ignorance of your birth?—"Dear madam," ſaid he, "I have nothing to forgive; you have been a parent to me, all happens for the beſt; had I known my birth, I might not have gone to America, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have never found my Parents." "Oh!" ſaid ſhe, "heaven directed you to them: my poor Maria! ſhall I ever behold her again—but ſhe cannot wiſh to ſee me." "Your Ladyſhip is miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken," returned he; ſhe wiſhes nothing ſo much as to throw herſelf at your feet, and crave your bleſſing." Ah! how readily would I give it: poor Beverly, how hardly he has been uſed too.</p>
            <p>AFTER ſome time, Lord Beauclair told her of his marriage, and of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents having returned with him. She ſeemed in an extacy; ſhe would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to ſtay a moment, but inſiſted on
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:033744_0153_0FF90F607967E470"/>
his bringing them all to her immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which he accordingly did: the old Lady's ſpirits had been ſo exhauſted, that ſhe felt herſelf unequal to the taſk of meeting them all together, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee her daughter alone; the meeting can be eaſier imagined than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: they remained ſome time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then joined the company: as Lady Beauclair entered, ſhe turned to Mr. Villars; "Mr. Beverly," ſaid ſhe, holding out her hand, "we have uſed you unkindly; can you forgive?"— "Madam," replied he; "the happineſs I now enjoy, compenſates for all paſt troubles." "I would not blame our departed friend," ſaid ſhe, but believe me, I always wiſhed to be a friend to you, had it been in my power." Mr. Villars begged ſhe would think of nothing that had paſſed—but give him leave to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his children to her; ſo ſaying, he took Lady Beauclair in one hand, and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:033744_0154_0FF91094CFB11AE8"/>
Louiſa in the other; and led them to her Ladyſhip, who received them in the moſt affectionate manner; Lord Beauclair preſented his two brothers, and his friend. After a conſiderable time, Lady Beauclair, addreſſing herſelf to Mr Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, aſked him why he had changed his name, and how he wiſhed to ſettle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. "Is not my houſe," continued ſhe, large enough for us all? If not, Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton-Hall <note n="*" place="bottom">Her Ladyſhip's Country Seat.</note> is at your ſervice."</p>
            <p>HER firſt queſtion he evaded; as he did not wiſh to revive diſagreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances but as little as poſſible. "With regard to my ſettling," ſaid he, troubles in early life.—She ſighed; "excuſe me, Madam—troubles have imbibed in us a love of retirement; and any other way of life, I feel, can never make me happy." "You ſhall live as you pleaſe," replied
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:033744_0155_0FF9109757CEC9A0"/>
her Ladyſhip; "but you would not wiſh to retire from your friends." "By no means," anſwered he, "I ſhould prefer a ſnug place in the country, where I could always enjoy myſelf and be happy with my friends."</p>
            <p>THEY all approved his choice; and it was concluded, that they ſhould ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with her Ladyſhip; and Lord Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair ſhould in a few days attend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in looking for a place to ſuit him. Capt. Bellmore would again have return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his lodgings, but the old Lady would not allow him.</p>
            <p>THE next day, he ſet out for Portland-Grove, his Father's country ſeat. He had not an opportunity of ſpeaking to Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa in private; but, at parting, put a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into her hand, filled with the moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profeſſions of love, and a promiſe to ſee her again in a ſhort time. After taking a
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:033744_0156_0FF9109FE5707130"/>
polite leave, he mounted his horſe, and rode off.</p>
            <p>THE old Lady ſaw the trembling tear in the languid blue eye of Louiſa, which followed him until out of ſight; and her pretence to quit the room, did not paſs unobſerved.</p>
            <p>"MY dear Eliza," ſaid Lady Beauclair, "has not this handſome Captain made an impreſſion on the heart of your ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter!"—"Why does your ladyſhip think ſo?" "I think I ſee it," ſaid ſhe; it is not from curioſity; but I have heard Sir John Bellmore has made engagements for his Son, with Sir Danvers Lovemore, who has an only Daughter, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune will be forty thouſand pounds.</p>
            <p>"AH!" ſaid Eliza, whoſe gentle heart caught the alarm for her friend, "my dear madam," do not mention this to
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:033744_0157_0FF910A7A0A75C18"/>
Louiſa—it is then as I feared, cried the old Lady, "if this is the caſe," anſwered Lady Beauclair, "they are the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people on earth."</p>
            <p>Mrs. VILLARS and Louiſa juſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put a ſtop to the diſcourſe. Louiſa perceived her friends countenance change, "What is the matter, my dear Eliza," ſaid ſhe, "are you not well?" "O yes," replied ſhe, "only a little vaporiſh; I will go and look for your Brother, and we will take a walk in the Park:" ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe quitted the room. "Indeed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſaid Louiſa," turning to her Mama, "my ſiſter is not well; I had better fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low." "You are a good girl, Louiſa," ſaid her Grandmother, I believe your fears are without foundation,"—Louiſa, ſat down; but ſeemed very uneaſy.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair ſoon came in leading
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:033744_0158_0FF910AB76F083A0"/>
his Lady, who had on her hat and gloves. "Come Louiſa," ſaid he, "Eliza wiſhes to walk in the Park this morning; get your hat." She roſe immediately, and accompanied them. They had not walked far, before they paſt two Ladies; one moſt ſuperbly dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and very much affected, hanging on the arm of the other; and talked ſo loud, that the converſation was plainly heard by Lord Beauclair and the Ladies. "Lord, my dear," ſaid the affected Lady, "it is monſtrous to walk thus without a Beau; why does Sir George leave us?" "He will return directly, ſaid the other—but is not your intended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from America?" "No, I believe not," replied ſhe careleſsly; "I am very eaſy about it, I aſſure you."— "Why," returned the other, "he is very handſome, they tell me."—"Aye, but he has no title; its a freak of Papa's, becauſe there is a good deal of money.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:033744_0159_0FF910B242D547E0"/>
But, upon my life, I had rather have Lord Boquet, with his ſmall fortune."</p>
            <p>"BUT, my dear," ſaid her friend, you are not acquainted with this hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young Captain.—"True; but they ſay he is as grave as a Methodiſt Parſon; and would you believe it, he would as ſoon touch a ſnake as a card." At that moment, a gentleman joined them, and they walked another way.</p>
            <p>"WHO can that affected creature be?" ſaid Lady Beauclair.—"A Miſs Lovemore," replied my Lord: A fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical fool, with a great fortune; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome miſerly fellow has been mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bargain with her father to encreaſe his ſon's riches, at the expence of his peace." "I am ſure," ſaid Louiſa, "I ſhould ſincerely pity the man that is ſold for a fortune, to ſuch a creature."— "You would indeed have thought ſo,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:033744_0160_0FF910B4C09AE458"/>
Lady Beauclair, if you knew who it was."</p>
            <p>SHE had told his Lordſhip, what his Grandmother had told her, (but did not mention the name, as it had eſcaped her memory). He would not credit it, but laughed at it as an idle report. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, however, convinced her of its truth, and ſhe was happy to find the Lady ſo indifferent. As ſoon as an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offered, ſhe mentioned it to his Lordſhip, who now began to think ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly of the matter; and to form ſchemes to ſerve his friend; where we will leave him, and return to Captain Bellmore, who arrived at his Father's gate juſt as he was returning from riding.</p>
            <p>"MY dear William," ſaid he, "how glad I am to ſee you. I intended writing to you by the next packet."—"I am happy, Sir," replied he, "to have ſaved you that trouble.". They now entered
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:033744_0161_0FF910B70B7282F0"/>
the houſe; his Mother and Siſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with the greateſt joy. Sir John ſeemed in high ſpirits, and often hinted having ſomething of conſequence to impart to him.</p>
            <p>THE next morning, Miſs Bellmore followed her Brother into the garden.— "I come, my dear William, to prepare you for a diſagreeable piece of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which you will no doubt ſoon hear."—She then briefly informed him of the engagements his Father had formed for him.</p>
            <p>HE ſtood like one amazed: at length "my Auguſta," ſaid he, "whatever mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary views my Father may have for me, I call my God to witneſs can never be fulfilled."—"Huſh! William, you know my Father is arbitrary."</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore then informed his
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:033744_0162_0FF910BDE11EED78"/>
Siſter of his attachment to Louiſa; and his poſitive determination to marry no one elſe.—The gentle heart of Miſs Bellmore was pained from the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this affair: how much more did ſhe feel for him, when ſhe found his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections were engaged. She once had loved a worthy object; and but for the unbounded avarice of Sir John, had been happy. Her tears flowed too faſt for ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance; her brother's ſituation reminded her of her own. She wept for both— and, waving her hand in ſilent anguiſh, left him" and Capt. Bellmore returned to the houſe with a heavy heart.</p>
            <p>AT breakfaſt, Sir John told him, he had ſomething of conſequence to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him: and deſired him to follow him to his ſtudy; in a few words, Sir John informed him of the engagements he had made, and deſired he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fulfil them.—His ſon, in vain,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:033744_0163_0FF910C6123DE048"/>
endeavoured to remonſtrate with him; he gave him only two days to conſider of his propoſal; and if he would not conſent to marry Miſs Lovemore, he ſhould immediately ſail for India; and there ſtay until he found himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to obey.</p>
            <p>HIS ſon now told him, his affections were engaged to a Lady, whoſe connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were far more noble than Miſs Lovemore's, and whoſe fortune, though not ſo large, was very handſome. His father replied, "had he known it ſooner, he might, perhaps, have conſidered of it; but his word was given to Sir Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and he was determined to be obeyed, on pain of his laſting diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; ſo ſaying, he flounced out of the room.</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore threw himſelf on the ſofa, and gave a looſe to tears he could
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:033744_0164_0FF910C864DE9558"/>
not retain.—Lady Bellmore came to him, and taking his hand, ſaid, "my dear William! compoſe yourſelf."—"Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam," cried he, riſing, "my Father has given me two days to conſider of his hated propoſal;—there needs not two hours; tell him, I will leave the country if he inſiſts upon it; for never, never, will I conſent to this deteſted marriage; ſo ſaying, he left the room, ordered his horſes; and, after bidding his mother and ſiſter, (who intreated him to ſtay) adieu, he ſet out for London.</p>
            <p>SIR John was in a violent rage, when he heard of his ſon's determination and departure.—Lady Bellmore wept, and begged him to break with Sir Danvers, but in vain.</p>
            <p>WHEN Capt. Bellmore arrived in London, he waited only to dreſs, and flew immediately to his Louiſa. His
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:033744_0165_0FF910CD860EB090"/>
pale and altered countenance, directly informed her ſomething had happened.</p>
            <p>THERE was a great deal of company when he arrived; and he had not an opportunity of ſpeaking to Louiſa, until the evening. "What is the matter?" ſaid ſhe; "you are ill, or ſomething has troubled you."—"Oh, my Louiſa! my beloved Louiſa! we muſt part! I muſt leave you—perhaps for ever."</p>
            <p>SHE heard no more, but fell ſenſeleſs in his arms; at that inſtant, Lord and Lady Beauclair entered.—Oh! my friend, ſaid the unhappy William, "my inhuman Father will be the death of us both."—"I know how it will be," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Lordſhip; "I dreaded this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, but endeavour to be eaſy, all may yet be well."</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore heard him not; he
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:033744_0166_0FF910CF1D084428"/>
claſped his lovely burden to his breaſt, whilſt Lady Beauclair was endeavouring to bring her to life. Mrs. Villars and her mother now entered; Bellmore ſeemed not to ſee them; but, bathing the hands of his Louiſa with his tears, ſaid, "would to heaven, my angel, thou hadſt let me die in the American foreſt; we then had both been happy."</p>
            <p>LOUISA then looked up. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, wildly, "they have taken him away; he is gone—he is gone."—"No, my life," cried he, "I am here, and if you can take a beggar to thy arms, will never leave thee.</p>
            <p>THE old Lady ſeemed very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. "Theſe hearts," ſaid ſhe, muſt not be parted.—Mrs. Villars, whoſe fright had rendered her in almoſt the ſame ſituation with Louiſa, now advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards her. "Louiſa," ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:033744_0167_0FF910D649D472F0"/>
"you muſt go and lay down; you will be better preſently."—She roſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her Mama, giving Capt. Bellmore, who ſtood motionleſs, a look of infinite diſtreſs. The Ladies all went with Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, for whom they were very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair attempted to comfort his friend. "William," ſaid he, "you have no reſolution; why ſo ſoon caſt down; we have heard of your Father's deſign, and have the pleaſure to tell you the Lady has not more inclination to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the engagement, than yourſelf. He then related the converſation they had heard in the Park. This afforded ſome conſolation to his depreſſed ſpirits; and he conſented that Lord Beauclair ſhould endeavour to perſuade Miſs Lovemore to refuſe him.</p>
            <p>ELIZA now entered in tears; ſhe ſaid
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:033744_0168_0FF910DA14B7F868"/>
Louiſa was very ill; that ſhe made no anſwer to any thing that was ſaid to her; that Lady Beauclair, and her Mama, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Capt. Bellmore would go to her, and appear to be quite compoſed; they both followed her to Louiſa's room: Lord Beauclair approached the bed, and affecting a lively air; "what is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Louiſa," ſaid he? "Brother," an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe, wildly; "William is gone— he ſaid he muſt leave me for ever;"— "you miſtake," replied the Captain— "your William is here." He then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and threw himſelf on his knees by her bed-ſide; here I am, my love, no force on earth ſhall tear me from you." "Why did you ſay, we muſt part then?" ſaid ſhe. A flood of tears now came to her relief, and ſhe ſeemed better. "Tell me, William," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe; "what has troubled you,"— "when you are more compoſed, my life, anſwered he. "I am much better
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:033744_0169_0FF910DE03B65CF8"/>
now," ſaid ſhe, raiſing herſelf on the bed. "My dear ſiſter," cried Lady Beauclair; "you muſt aſk no queſtions to night, it is late; to-morrow you ſhall be informed of what you wiſh to know." Capt. Bellmore, after folding her in his arms; and ſwearing no force on earth ſhould conſtrain him to leave her, took his leave. Lord Beauclair was obliged to do the ſame, as his Eliza would not be prevailed on to leave her friend that night.</p>
            <p>THE old Lady, and Mrs. Villars had left the room, when they found her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon returning, leaſt their preſence might be a reſtraint. As ſoon as the Captain left the room, they returned, and finding her ſo much better, wiſhed her a good night, and left her with Lady Beauclair.</p>
            <p>LOUISA roſe with the ſun, and ſtole from her ſiſter, who had juſt fallen in a
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:033744_0170_0FF910E110B84DD0"/>
deep ſleep. She went to the ſaloon, where, as ſhe expected, ſhe met Capt. Bellmore, who had no more inclination for ſleep than herſelf. "My dear Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa," ſaid he; "why will you riſe ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; you have no regard for your health." —"O!" I am quite well; you muſt now tell me what has happened, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear this ſuſpenſe." He then led her to a ſettee, and briefly related what the reader is already informed of. She heard him with a tolerable degree of compoſure. "So," cried ſhe, with a ſigh; when he concluded, "you had determined to obey him."—"But partly my love; could I expect my Louiſa would marry a beggar! —My determination was to go to India, and endeavour to acquire a competence, which, if I ſucceeded in, to return to you—if I failed—to die in a foreign country."</p>
            <p>"COULD you conſent to leave me?"
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:033744_0171_0FF910E4FA7D4FF8"/>
ſaid ſhe, the tears ſtarting from her eyes: "Eaſily, my Louiſa," tenderly preſſing her to his boſom; "Heaven knows the conflicts of my heart; your diſcerning eye perceived it. The tender manner in which you aſked the cauſe, threw me off my guard, and I abſolutely uttered words that ſo much affected you: But, Oh! my Louiſa, to find myſelf ſo dear to you, compenſates for all I have met with."</p>
            <p>JUST now Eliza entered, and rallied Louiſa ſeverely, for giving her the ſlip. She imagined Capt. Bellmore had related his ſtory to her, and was happy to ſee her ſo compoſed. They were ſoon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to breakfaſt; Louiſa ſeemed much confuſed at meeting the reſt of the Family; but her indiſpoſition was ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched on; and the converſation changed to a different ſubject.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair thought no time like
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:033744_0172_0FF910E9DB43C450"/>
the preſent, and went as ſoon as dreſſed, to wait on Miſs Lovemore; he ſent up his name; ſhe had ſeen him, and had heard of his new acquired title, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered herſelf, his Lordſhip would be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the train of her admirers, as ſhe had not heard of his marriage; ſhe kept him waiting ſome time, in order to add new luſtre to her charms, by a prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous dreſs, rouge, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SHE at laſt came ſwimming into the room, with ſuch an air, that his Lordſhip could with difficulty, keep his muſcles in order. After ſome converſation, too trifling to relate, he mentioned Capt. Bellmore, and the connection which he heard was to take place. "O Lord," I hate theſe made up matches; I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I ſhall deteſt him, and my Father need not think I will ever conſent to the match."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="unknown:033744_0173_0FF910EE92D22550"/>LORD Beauclair ſaid he was happy to ſee her ſo averſe to it, "for," added he, "the Captain, though he is a fine young man, is much too grave for you—a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your life and ſpirits, would ſuit much better with a man of the Bon Ton." "You do me honour, my Lord, "I aſſure you I will never marry Capt. Bellmore; I can't abide the thought of a huſband, whoſe grave looks would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be giving one leſſons of morality; they tell me, he does not touch cards." O no, Madam; when he is from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, he ſpends his time in reading, and writing love-ſonnets on the favourite of his heart, or perhaps, ſpending a ſocial hour where cards and ſcandal are perhaps never thought of."—"Oh! heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me from ſuch a huſband," cried ſhe, with an affected laugh; "I ſhall give him a poſitive refuſal, the firſt time he comes."—"Upon my word, Madam, if that is your intention, I think you had
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:033744_0174_0FF910F05FE9A5B0"/>
better put an end to this affair, by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; and by ſo doing, bring it to a more ſpeedy concluſion; as the young man, after having the pleaſure of ſeeing you, and finding you ſo faſcinating, may not ſo readily reſign you."</p>
            <p>"OH! you have hit it," ſaid ſhe, "I will poſitively write to him. I told Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa yeſterday, I was determined not to marry him, unleſs he would purchaſe him a title; but I knew the old gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was too fond of his money to do that. Will you do me the honour, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to be the bearer of the letter?"</p>
            <p>SHE conſented, and flew to write; but ſhe ſoon returned, and preſented a letter to his Lordſhip, though he had ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make her imagine him her lover. She ſeemed much diſappointed, when he took leave; ſhe, however, comforted
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:033744_0175_0FF910F5C2D62A70"/>
herſelf, with the thought of ſoon ſeeing him again.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair returned in high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and delivered the letter to Capt. Bellmore, who read as follows:

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU have, no doubt, heard that our fathers have very wiſely deſigned a match between us; as I am entirely averſe to it, I hope you will not give yourſelf the trouble to wait on me; as my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is fixed, I beg you will not urge any thing to alter it; I never can, or will, be any thing more to you, than</p>

               <pb n="174" facs="unknown:033744_0176_0FF910F8132B9F90"/>THE Captain folded him in his arms, and called him his guardian angel; he flew to Louiſa with the welcome intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Lord Beauclair then related their converſation, which afforded a great deal of diverſion; the next day Capt. Bellmore ſet off for his Father's. When he arrived, Sir John was out; his Mother and Siſter, flew to welcome him; are you returned to make us happy, ſaid they; "I hope ſo, Madam," returned he. He then ſhewed his Mother the letter; at that inſtant, Sir John entered; "well, William," ſaid he, "are you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a ſenſe of your duty." He made no anſwer, but put the letter in his hand; he frowned: "damned non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe," cried he? "what are her whims, to Sir Danvers and my engagements?" "what a life do you think Sir, two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo averſe to each other could lead; beſides, I have heard Sir Danvers will not thwart his daughter's inclinations."
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:033744_0177_0FF910FCC003EFD0"/>
Well, well, if Sir Danvers has a mind to let this fooliſh girl rule him, I am willing to let it drop."</p>
            <p>AUGUSTA had told Lady Bellmore, of her brother's attachment to Miſs Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and that, it was more than proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe would have a genteel fortune; Lady Bellmore had mentioned it to Sir John, which was the reaſon he was ſo eaſily perſuaded to relinquiſh his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſcheme. A few days after Sir John called the Captain to his ſtudy, and queſtioned him, with regard to his affections for Miſs Villars; and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be angry at his engaging his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without his knowledge; he aſked him, what her fortune would be;— in this he could not ſatisfy him, but told him it would be ſomething very handſome. Sir John ſaid, Sir Danvers had wrote to him, and begged to be off, which he had agreed to; and if he
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:033744_0178_0FF910FFD4F6B300"/>
liked Miſs Villars's fortune, he would have no objection to the match. That he ſhould go to London, and he would call on her Father.</p>
            <p>AFTER the Captain's departure from London, Lady Beauclair preſented Mr. Villars a deed for twenty thouſand pounds, for Louiſa's fortune; ten to be paid on the day of her marriage, and the other ten at her death; ſaying, ſhe made no doubt, but her grandſon would add to it if it was required.</p>
            <p>Mr. VILLARS was thinking her in terms ſhe merited, when ſhe interupted him, ſaying, "the only compenſation I can make for what you have ſuffered, is to make you and your children happy.</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair, who had been made acquainted with Lady Beauclair's genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, added ten thouſand pounds more to
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:033744_0179_0FF90D8E4B2823E0"/>
Louiſa's fortune; and a few days after, Sir John arrived, and was ſo pleaſed with Louiſa, that he was as eager for the match, as he before had been againſt it.</p>
            <p>HE returned and told his Son, he might go and ſee his little blue-eyed girl as ſoon as he pleaſed, that he liked her very well. The now happy Captain flew on the wings of love.—Mr. Villars receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with open arms.—"Welcome, my dear Bellmore," cried he, let me now have the pleaſure of making my children happy. "So ſaying, he led him to Louiſa, who, bluſhing, roſe to receive him." "God bleſs you both," ſaid he, joining their hands, "and may you meet with the reward of your merits."</p>
            <p>LORD Beauclair preſſed his friend to his boſom, ſaying, "my dear, dear Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, ſhall I be ſo happy as to call you Brother."—In leſs than a month, the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:033744_0180_0FF911063B4B2F18"/>
marriage was ſolemnized, to the general ſatisfaction of their friend; and Miſs Bellmore for a time, forgot her own ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, in the joy ſhe felt at ſeeing her Brother happy.</p>
            <p>A FEW days after, the whole family went to ſpend ſome time at the grove.</p>
            <p>AFTER they returned to London; and the ceremony of viſiting was over, Mr. Villars and his family, retired to a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful little retreat, Lord Beauclair had purchaſed for them nigh Hampton-Hall. Lord and Lady Beauclair continued with the old Lady, and ſpent their ſummers with her in the country.</p>
            <p>CAPT. Bellmore went to live at Union-Park, (a ſeat which his Father had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him on his marriage) about five miles from the Hall. He gave up his commiſſion, and reſided wholly in the
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:033744_0181_0FF9110AE6416178"/>
country: bleſſed with his Louiſa, his happineſs was complete, and joy beam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed around. Lady Beauclair lived to an advanced age, honoured by her children.</p>
            <p>Mr. and Mrs. VILLARS, in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of life, enjoyed every felicity. Bleſſed in ſeeing their children happy, their every wiſh was complete.</p>
            <p>THEIR ſons, Edward and Charles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the univerſity, poſſeſſed of every manly grace and virtue.</p>
            <p>LORD and Lady Beauclair, already bleſſed with two fine boys and a girl, live beloved by their friends, and adored by their domeſtics.</p>
            <p>Mr. SOMMERS in a few years returned to England, and ſettled in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.—The lively Caroline, whoſe beauty was much improved, made an
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:033744_0182_0FF911120D936338"/>
impreſſion on the youthful heart of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Villars, which ended in a happy marriage.</p>
            <p>Miſs BELLMORE was united to the man of her heart, who returned from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, with a fortune equal to the moſt mercenary wiſh of Sir John.—Mrs. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley grew old in the ſervice of the Family, and found friends in every branch of it; ſhe latterly attached herſelf to the little daughter of Louiſa; and in the decline
of life, received the reward of her fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
