            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> BRIDGWATER has been a Town favoured of GOD; yea, ſome Favours of Heaven unto it, have indeed been diſtinguiſhing.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>planted a Noble Vine.</hi>— And may no more of the Text from whence this Phraſe is borrowed, ever be applied unto it! The <hi>Firſt Planters</hi> of it, were a ſett of People, who made RELIGION their main <hi>Intereſt</hi>; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came their <hi>Glory.</hi> There was a Time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it ſtood in a <hi>Land of unwalled Vill<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ages,</hi> with fierce Armies of Bloody <hi>Indians</hi> deſtroying round about them; And the Diſpenſations of GOD our SAVIOUR towards it at <hi>this time,</hi> were ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that the ſhort Report thereof given in, <hi>The Church-Hiſtory of New-England,</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be here tranſcribed and repeated.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Remarkable was the Fate of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi> a moſt <hi>Praying,</hi> and a moſt <hi>Pious</hi> Town, ſeated in the very <hi>midſt</hi> of the Dangers of the <hi>War;</hi> that altho' they were often aſſaulted by formidable

Numbers of the Enemies, yet in all their ſharp Aſſaults, they <hi>never loſt one</hi> of their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, Young or Old. They were ſollicited ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſert their Dwellings: but they reſolved, that they would keep their <hi>Stations.</hi> And now on <hi>May 8. 1676.</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> began to Fire the Town; but the Inhabitants with notable Courage, iſſued forth from their Garriſons, to fight the Enemy; and <hi>GOD from Heaven</hi> at the ſame time fought for them, with a Storm of <hi>Lightning, Thunder, and Rain,</hi> whereby a conſiderable part of their Houſes were preſerved. Thou, Church of <hi>Bridgwater,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O niminus dilecta Deo, cui militat aether.</hi> One that was no <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſo ſang the Favours of Heaven to the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi>; and ſo might the <hi>Pagan</hi> Foe now ſing of thy Salvations!</p>
            </q>
            <p>Ever ſince that memorable Day, the Town has been proceeding, with the Smile of GOD upon them, and upon the Intentions of His Goſpel among them, until they are <hi>now become Two Bands.</hi> They are Lovingly and Peaceably ſwarmed into a <hi>New Aſſembly,</hi> and began to meet in their <hi>New Edifice</hi> on a <hi>Day of Prayer</hi> (as 'tis the manner of <hi>New-England,</hi>) when the Two SERMONS were Preached, which the affected Hearers have here Publiſhed. GOD grant, that from the Tokens of His Gracious Preſence with them, the Place may claim the Name of, <hi>Mahanaim</hi>

               <hi>Fruitful Chriſtians,</hi> Exemplarily <hi>Living to GOD,</hi> and <hi>by the Faith of the Son of GOD</hi>; May a <hi>value</hi> for the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR, be ſo preſerved in Vigour with them, and the <hi>Succeſs</hi> thereof appear in all <hi>Real and Vital Godlineſs</hi> quickened among the <hi>Young</hi> as well as the <hi>Old</hi> among them; And may their <hi>Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Love continue</hi> at ſuch a rate, that it may be plainly ſeen, GOD is yet among them. <hi>Wo to them, if I depart from them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been a ſingular Felicity unto this Good People, that from the very Infancy of their Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they have ſatt under the Miniſtry of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Faithful, Humble Servant of GOD, who <hi>continues with them to this Day.</hi> He has been a Precious <hi>Gift</hi> of our <hi>Aſcended</hi> LORD un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and they have hitherto <hi>Rejoyced in his Light;</hi> and <hi>We</hi> Rejoyce with them, that after Fifty Four Years, his <hi>Light</hi> yet ſhines with ſuch Brightneſs among them.</p>
            <p>We can make no Doubt, but that, as they have grown into ſuch Good Circumſtances under his painful and patient conduct, they will ſtudy in all the Methods if Goodneſs, to render his <hi>Old Age</hi> comfortable to him, and ſo multiply all the Offices and Expreſſions of a <hi>Grateful People</hi> towards him, with an Affection and Reverence, like what the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> paid unto their Aged <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp,</hi> that he may anon Die, Bleſſing of them,

                  <p>Thus ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of, by the Houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, to do it for them.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shall not inſiſt upon the Diviſion of this Chapter, into the ſeveral parts of it; Only we may conſider for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to the Text, that from the four and twentieth verſe to the cloſe of the Chapter, we have a Number of <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes</hi> made to <hi>Iſrael</hi>; Promiſes both of Spiritual and Temporal Bleſſings. In the firſt place, there are Promiſes made to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001888_0007_0FB9C6CB8D6BAF28"/>
them of a <hi>new Heart</hi> and a <hi>right Spirit,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of <hi>Pardoning Mercy,</hi> and promiſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting and Sanctifying Grace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we have an addition of Promiſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting <hi>Temporal Bleſſings,</hi> the bleſſings of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,</hi> the Increaſe of Men, the bleſſings of <hi>Peace,</hi> of quietneſs and ſafety in their Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; the Bleſſings of plentiful Proviſion in the increaſe of the Field, and the fruit of the Trees. After a long Enumeration of Divine Bleſſings, the Lord ſhews them in our Text, <hi>what is to be done</hi> on their part in order to the obtaining of the great Bleſſings he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to beſtow upon them.</p>
            <p>We may conſider the Text, as it contains a ſolemn Declaration; and therein we have,</p>
            <p>Firſt: The <hi>Author</hi> of it, and that is <hi>the Lord.</hi> That which we have in the Text was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared in a miniſterial way, by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> by divine Inſpiration and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority; ſo the Text expreſſeth, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God</hi>; It was from the Great and Glorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Self-Exiſting, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and Eternal Being, the Fountain of all being and bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>Object,</hi> unto whom this Declaration is directed, and that is <hi>The Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> the Family, the Poſterity of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; who were ſeparated from the reſt of the Nations, and taken into ſpecial Covenant
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001888_0008_0FB9C6CDA2661F30"/>
Relation unto God. As this is firſtly and more immediately directed to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo it is of concernment unto <hi>all the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God,</hi> unto all the Churches and People of God thorow all Generations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. We have the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>means</hi> to be attended in order to the Enjoyment of the good which God hath promiſed to beſtow; and therein we have</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have the <hi>Good</hi> to be ſought for from the Lord; <hi>For this I will be enquired of that I may do it for them,</hi> i. e. that I may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Word to them, that the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of Mercy and Bleſſing I have made to them may have their Accompliſhment.

            <p>This is that which God expects from his People, this is that he hath obliged them to, as to all the Good which he hath promiſed to beſtow upon them; This is the great <hi>Means</hi> which God hath inſtituted, which muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the greateſt ſeriouſsneſs and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, This is that the Lord inſiſts upon in all Caſes; <hi>He will be enquired of,</hi> He will have <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication</hi> to be made to him in order to the Diſpenſation of all Covenant Bleſſings.</p>

Among many Scriptures which might be cited I would refer particularly and peculiarly unto that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jer. 29.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>For I know the thoughts which I think towards you, ſaith the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected End; Then ſhall ye call upon me and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you, and ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your heart! and I will be found of you ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the opening of the Doctrine we are to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God hath a <hi>People</hi> in the World, unto whom he hath made <hi>Promiſes</hi> of great Bleſſings. All the People in the World, the whole Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> ſucceſſively from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation, conſidered in their natural Apoſtatic State, have <hi>forfeited</hi> the Bleſſing, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and from Communion with God, and as Sinners, as Tranſgreſſors of the Law of God, are all juſtly expoſed to the <hi>curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Notwithſtanding God hath in infinite Mercy ſingled out a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number</hi> of the loſt Race of <hi>Adam</hi> to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> After that Man had broken the <hi>Firſt Covenant of Works,</hi> it pleaſed God to make a <hi>New Covenant</hi> with a <hi>Select Number</hi> of the Children of Men, a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and Mercy, which is eſtabliſhed in the hand of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001888_0011_0FB9C6D82AB21590"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, our Glorious <hi>Mediator,</hi> by whom all the Good of the Covenant is purchaſed and conveyed; According to that Covenant God doth prepare and <hi>form a People for himſelf in the World, to be to the praiſe of his Glory.</hi> Iſai. 43.21. <hi>This People have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my Praiſe.</hi> Such a People the Lord had under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; It was the great privilege of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that they were ſet apart to be a <hi>peculiar People unto God,</hi> Exod. 19.5. Such a People the Lord hath raiſed up and multiplied and will yet multiply more and more, both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> under the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, whom he will preſerve through all Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations unto the Worlds End. The Grace and Mercy of the <hi>New-Covenant</hi> is diſplayed in the viſible Diſpenſation of it in <hi>viſible Church Relation</hi> to God, in the outward Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the Covenant, the Miniſtry of the Word and Sacraments, &amp;c. But more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the ſaving Diſpenſation of it unto his Elect and Choſen, unto all <hi>true Believers,</hi> to his called, his juſtifyed and ſanctifyed Ones. Such a Number the Lord hath among Men who are for a <hi>peculiar People</hi> to him. We have their Characters in the Word of Truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are diſtinguiſhing from all others in the World, as in, Pſal. 15. They <hi>are ſuch as walk uprightly, and work righteouſneſs and ſpeak
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001888_0012_0FB9C6D9A8B60AF8"/>
the truth in their hearts.</hi> Again in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.3, 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. at the beginning; and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elſewhere. It is to ſuch that all the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Covenant Bleſſings</hi> are made and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Chriſt Jeſus; However they be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by the Men of the World, yet they are the <hi>Bleſſed of the Lord</hi>; On them the Lord will beſtow the Bleſſings both of the <hi>upper and nether Springs,</hi> the Bleſſings of Time and of Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch as live in the neglect of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication</hi> to God, have no right to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of God, they can lay no claim to any <hi>Covenant Bleſſings.</hi> Such a number there is in the World, that have no regard to <hi>Prayer,</hi> and they are by far the greateſt Number among Men. It is ſo univerſally with the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> by nature. Pſal. 14.2, 3. <hi>The Lord looked down from Heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God, they are all gone aſide.</hi> So, Rom. 3, 11. <hi>There is none that ſeek after God:</hi> This is the black Character of all that are <hi>Ungodly,</hi> They <hi>call not upon the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 14.4. Such is their State, that they do not ſeek the Lord, they <hi>will not ſeek after God,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. In that reſpect they have <hi>no Right</hi> to any Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Bleſſing. Indeed ſuch may be favoured according to the <hi>Sovereign Will</hi> of God in the way of his <hi>Common Providence</hi> with many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001888_0013_0FB9C6DB53B2FBE8"/>
Mercies, with the bleſſings of Peace and Plenty, yea of all outward <hi>Proſperity</hi>; they may be favoured with the outward viſible privileges of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they can have nothing from God in a way of <hi>ſpecial Favour and Covenant Mercy</hi>; inſtead of a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> they are expoſed to the <hi>Curſe,</hi> the Curſe of the Lord. Such is the caſe of all <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>Prayerleſs</hi> Families, of every <hi>Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> Society, or every individual Perſon in the World, that doth not <hi>ſeek after God.</hi> Pſal. 79.6. Jer. 10.25.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it is a <hi>moral Duty</hi> incumbent upon all Men to ſeek the Lord by <hi>Prayer</hi>; ſo it is eminently the Duty of the <hi>People of God</hi> to <hi>Pray,</hi> to preſent their Supplications to the Lord. I ſay, it is the Duty of <hi>all,</hi> of all Ranks, Orders and Degrees of Men to Pray. As the Divine Exiſtence, the Eternal Being of <hi>God</hi> is manifeſt by the <hi>Light of Nature</hi>: So the Light and the Law of Nature doth oblige all to <hi>Pray to God.</hi> It is an Homage due to God as the Glorious Creator and Preſerver of Men, as the Great <hi>Benefactor</hi> on whom all have their Dependance. It is a part of that <hi>natural Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> due to God which is required in the <hi>Firſt Commandment,</hi> Exod. 20.3. There are indeed no Promiſes from God, that he will hear the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Ungodly</hi>; they have no <hi>Faith</hi> and therefore he can take no pleaſure in their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001888_0014_0FB9C6E1B4ACA268"/>
               <hi>Prayers.</hi> Heb. 11.6. <hi>Without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe him.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſuch is the Goodneſs and Mercy of God, that his Ear is open to the cries of <hi>ſuch</hi> in the Times of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Pſal. 107.19. <hi>They cry unto the Lord in their Trouble, he ſaveth them out of their Diſtreſſes.</hi> Many ſuch Inſtances there are in the way of his Providence.</p>
            <p>But we are further to conſider, That it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently the Duty of the <hi>People of God</hi> to <hi>Pray</hi>; It is commended unto them, not only as a part of <hi>natural Worſhip,</hi> but as a ſpecial part of <hi>inſtituted Worſhip</hi>; and they are under <hi>peculiar Obligations</hi> thereunto above all others in the World. This the Lord expects from the <hi>Houſe of Iſrael</hi>; ſo the Text. As to all the Good that God hath promiſed to his People, He will be <hi>enquired of,</hi> he will be ſought unto, that he may do it for them.</p>
            <p>For the further Explication of this Head, there are divers things to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That God hath given a <hi>Directory for Prayer.</hi> We have in the Holy Scriptures a compleat <hi>Directory</hi> with reſpect to all the parts of Religious <hi>Worſhip</hi> and particularly of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot give you a better Definition of Prayer than that you have in the <hi>Aſſemblies Catechiſm</hi> wherein you have been inſtructed, as it is drawn from the Word of God.</p>
            <p>All Prayer muſt be directed to <hi>God,</hi> as the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001888_0015_0FB9C6E36CFC5B80"/>
One only Object of all Religious Worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. It is the Glory of the Lord to be the <hi>Hearer of Prayer,</hi> and his <hi>Glory he will not give to another,</hi> Pſal. 65.1.2.</p>
            <p>As Prayer muſt be made to the One True and Living <hi>God,</hi> ſo in the <hi>Name</hi> of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in His Name alone, as he is the One only <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Man. 1 Tim. 2.5. in whoſe <hi>Name</hi> alone we are commanded and encouraged to ask. Joh. 14.13. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that I will do.</hi> Heb. 4.14, 15, 16. <hi>Having ſuch a Great High Prieſt, who is paſſed into the Heavens, even Jeſus the Son of God, Let us come to the Throne of Grace with boldneſs.</hi> In that reſpect <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be carryed on, not in our own Strength, but by the help of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. Rom. 8.26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The Petitions we preſent to God muſt be for things <hi>agreeable to his Will,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.14.</p>
            <p>Again, Our Prayers to God muſt be with penitential <hi>Confeſſions of our Sins,</hi> Pſal. 32.5. Pſal 51.3, 4. with a Soul humbling ſenſe of our <hi>Unworthineſs</hi> of the leaſt of all the Mercies we ask of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. and ſo with due Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God, of all his benefits. Phil. 4.6. <hi>In every thing by Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, Let your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts be made known to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001888_0016_0FB9C6E4F3B6D888"/>2. All that belong to God, have the <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> given unto them to reſt upon them, by whoſe powerful and gracious influences they are enabled to <hi>Pray.</hi> In that reſpect the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Mercy</hi> of God is diſplayed towards his <hi>Elect</hi> and Choſen Ones who <hi>ſeek him not,</hi> who have not called upon his Name. Iſai. 65.1. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought me not.</hi> When God is about to accompliſh his Eternal Purpoſe in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Elect, he pours upon them the <hi>Spirit of Prayer,</hi> Zech. 12.10. In that reſpect we have a great Inſtance of the Grace of God in <hi>Paul</hi> upon his Converſion. Act. 9.11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he prayeth. Prayer</hi> is the Voice of the <hi>New Creature,</hi> of <hi>new born Babes,</hi> of all that are born of God by Regeneration; it is their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar property to be diſpoſed unto <hi>Prayer,</hi> and it is a ſure evidence of their Relation to God as his <hi>Children,</hi> Gal. 4.6. <hi>Becauſe ye are Sons, God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father.</hi> This is the Duty and peculiar Privilege of the Saints of the Lord. Pſal. 32.6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee, in a Time when thou mayſt be found.</hi> There are <hi>common Gifts</hi> of the Spirit, great <hi>Gifts of Prayer</hi> beſtowed upon many, who have no ſaving Relation to God; But all true Converts have the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God reſting upon them as a <hi>Spirit of Grace and of Supplication,</hi> tho'
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001888_0017_0FB9C6E74A9434C8"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the ſame meaſure and degree. Hence it is, that none who are born of God can live without <hi>Prayer.</hi> There are indeed Times of <hi>Temptation</hi> and Reſtraint that paſs upon the Saints of the Lord, Times wherein they are <hi>ſo troubled that they cannot ſpeak,</hi> Pſal. 77.4. But whatever the <hi>withdrawings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> may be for a ſeaſon from any of the Children of God, He will return to them, he will open their <hi>Hearts</hi> and open their <hi>Lips,</hi> ſo that they ſhall have Freedom and Liberty to pour out their Hearts before Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the Duty of the People of God to wait on the Lord, both in the way of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary Prayer</hi>: and ſo it muſt be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is an <hi>Ordinary Courſe of Prayer</hi> to be attended by all that would approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to God. <hi>Prayer</hi> muſt be the <hi>conſtant Exerciſe</hi> of the Saints and People of God; and ſo Prayer is to be conſidered both as <hi>mental</hi> and <hi>vocal. Mental Prayer</hi> conſiſts in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſires and breathings of the <hi>Soul</hi> after God. Pſal. 25.1 <hi>Unto thee, O Lord do I lift up my Soul.</hi> With <hi>mental Prayer, vocal Prayer,</hi> Prayer with the Voice, muſt be joyned by thoſe on whom God hath beſtowed the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Speech. Pſal. 5.3. <hi>My Voice ſhalt thou hear in the Morning, O Lord.</hi> The <hi>Voice</hi> is to be improved in <hi>Prayer</hi> in ſuch a way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001888_0018_0FB9C6ECF5475010"/>
and to ſuch a degree, as may be moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Honour and Glory of God, our perſonal Relief, the Comfort and Edification of others.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Ordinary Prayer,</hi> it is further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that there are divers ways of Prayer to be attended. There is the Duty of <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> of Praying ſingly and apart, of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and particular Application to God, which ought to be and will be the <hi>daily Exerciſe</hi> of all that belong to God. Mat. 6.6. <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet, and pray to thy Father which is in ſecret.</hi> The Children of God have many <hi>ſecret Caſes</hi> of Prayer, many <hi>ſecret</hi> wants and neceſſities both Temporal and Spiritual, to preſent to him, ſuch as the World doth not know and ſuch as are not meet for the World to know. The <hi>Life of Religion</hi> depends much upon that way of Converſe with God by <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Prayer.</hi> Again, There is the Duty of <hi>Family Prayer</hi> to be attended by Heads of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> with thoſe that appertain to them: There are many Obligations upon the Servants of God to attend that Duty, to preſent to God a <hi>Morning and Evening Sacrifice of Prayer</hi>; and there are ſuch <hi>Examples</hi> of Devotion left on Sacred Record, which may convince all that will conſult the Oracles of God, that <hi>Family Prayer</hi> is an eſſential part of practical Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. Alſo
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001888_0019_0FB9C6EF5DBDA5C0"/>
ſee Joſh. 24.25. Job. 1.5. All <hi>Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies</hi> that would approve themſelves to God, muſt <hi>walk within their Houſes with a perfect Heart,</hi> according to that great Example, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.2. There can be no Evidence of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with ſuch as live in the habitual Neglect of <hi>Family Prayer</hi>; however ſuch may <hi>think themſelves ſomething, they are nothing,</hi> their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, With reſpect to <hi>Ordinary Prayer,</hi> there muſt be <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> made to God in Church Aſſembles. <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2.42. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a ſpecial part of that <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> which is to be performed to God on the Sabbath; All other Ordinances muſt be attended with <hi>Prayer,</hi> as the Miniſterial Diſpenſation of the <hi>Word,</hi> the Adminiſtration of the Holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> the Seals of the <hi>Covenant</hi>; all muſt be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Prayers and Supplications unto God.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It is to be conſidered, that there are <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Prayers</hi> to be made to God by his People; as they are liable to <hi>Extraordinary Diſpenſations</hi> of Providence, ſo they are to ſeek God by <hi>Extraordinary Prayer</hi> as the great means of their relief in all Caſes of diſtreſs. So God is to be ſought by <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> by a particular and perſonal Application to him; for this we have many Examples preſented to us, as that of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.24, 25. Hoſ. 12.4. <hi>He wept
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001888_0020_0FB9C6F040D8A8D8"/>
and made Supplication</hi>; of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 35.13. <hi>I humbled my Soul with Faſting and my Prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into mine own boſom</hi>; of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 6.10. Above all we have the Example of our Lord Chriſt, Luk. 6.12. Luk. 22.44. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an agony, he prayed the more earneſtly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as <hi>Extraordinary Prayer</hi> is to be made in <hi>Secret</hi> ſingly and apart; ſo alſo by <hi>Families,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.5. There are many <hi>Family Caſes</hi> which call for ſuch Prayer.</p>
            <p>Withal, there are <hi>Extraordinary Prayers</hi> to be made to God by his People in their <hi>Publick Aſſemblies.</hi> Times and Caſes of <hi>Extraordinary diſpenſation</hi> call for ſuch Prayer. For this we have plain Commands and great Examples, which ſtand for our inſtruction and imitation, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Act.</hi> 12.5. Such Prayer is neceſſary for the preventing and removing of ſpecial Plagues and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in order to the obtaining ſpecial Mercies, poſitive, <hi>Extraordinary Bleſſings,</hi> both Temporal and Spiritual. As there are times of <hi>extraordinary diſtreſs</hi> that paſs upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, wherein they are to Pray in an <hi>extraordinary way</hi>; ſo there are <hi>extraordinary Communications</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> in ſuch times of diſtreſs, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. Thus God doth diſpenſe to his People, as he is gracious and merciful, abundant in goodneſs and truth; when God doth ſo diſpenſe, it is an evident

The greateſt Mercies are obtained in that way of Prayer; ſo we may find from, Jer. 31.18, 19, 20. <hi>I have heard Ephraim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning himſelf, turn thou me and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; Upon that earneſt cry of <hi>Ephraim</hi> we have that return from the Lord, <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him.</hi> So Jer. 50.45. <hi>In thoſe days and in that time, ſaith the Lord, the children of Iſrael ſhall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping, they ſhall go and ſeek the Lord their God, They ſhall ask the way to Sion, with their faces thitherward.</hi> The Anſwer to thoſe Prayers we have in that which follows, ver. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts the God of Iſrael, Behold I will puniſh the King of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon and his Land, as I have puniſhed the King of Aſſyria and I will bring Iſrael again to his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation—In that time, ſaith the Lord, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Iſrael ſhall be ſought for and there ſhall be none, and the ſins of Judah and they ſhall not be found; for I will pardon them whom I reſerve.</hi>

            <p>Conſider, 2. There are <hi>Difficulties</hi> before you, and ſuch wherein you will need Help, ſpecial Help from God, Counſels, Supports and Aſſiſtances from the Lord, that you may be able to uphold and carry on that which you have begun: This is that you ought all to be ſenſible of. You know how it was with the Jews upon their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> in rebuilding the Wall and Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the great oppoſition that Work met with: you muſt not think it ſtrange, if you be tryed in like manner; you muſt reckon upon Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Temple Work</hi> and arm your ſelves againſt it, and therefore you muſt have your recourſe to God by <hi>Prayer,</hi> both Ordinary and Extra-Ordinary Prayer; you muſt follow that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

On the other hand, if your Hearts be ſet aright for God, if you be ſincerely devoted to his Service to follow him and to cleave to him in all thoſe ways which he hath inſtituted and preſcribed; He will be <hi>your God</hi> and acknowledge you to be <hi>His People,</hi> according to that great Promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.39.

Further as to Reformation reſpecting <hi>Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi> againſt the Second Table, beſides other Evils which might be mentioned, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer particularly to that of <hi>Intemperance,</hi> the exceſſive and prodigious expence upon Strong Drink, above all that of RUM, I ſay the ſcandalous and horrible abuſe of RUM, which threatens Ruine unto this Land and to this Place, a Ruine to all our deareſt Intereſts both Civil and Religious. If there be any ſuch Houſes among you, as I fear there are, that Vend that Strong Drink contrary to the Law of God and the Wholeſome Law of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, let ſuch of you who are veſted with Civil Power, and ſtand obliged under the Oath of God ſee that ſuch grievous Profanations be ſuppreſſed, leaſt that Iniquity, <hi>The Abuſe of Rum,</hi> be our Ruine.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Finally. You muſt wait on the Lord with <hi>quiet Expectation</hi> for the performance of all the Great things he hath promiſed to do for his People.

this Chapter, together with many other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in the Holy Prophets refer to the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom of Chriſt among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we muſt <hi>wait</hi> for the performance of them. Tho' there have been many and great Diſappointments as to <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seaſons,</hi> with reſpect to the Deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the Converſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Gathering of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Nations; all theſe things ſhall be done in the <hi>appointed Time,</hi> the Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, the <hi>Viſion will ſpeak at the end and not lie</hi>; Times of Accompliſhment are in the Lord's Hand, and as he <hi>is a God of Judgment, bleſſed are all they that wait for him,</hi> Iſai. 30.18.</p>
            <p>As to that which refers to this <hi>New Society,</hi> who are deſigned for the Worſhip and Service of God, you muſt continue <hi>inſtant in Prayer</hi> to God, he will yet be enquired of, that you may be eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> that you may be built up to be an <hi>Habitation of God through the Spirit:</hi> you muſt avoid haſte and hurries; <hi>He that believeth ſhall not make haſte,</hi> Iſai. 28.16. Wait on the Lord and keep his way, that it may be well with you. Be perſwaded to ſuffer this Word of Exhortation which is given you from the Lord by your Aged Paſtor, who hath ſerved you in the Goſpel now full <hi>Fifty Four Years,</hi> and I hope by the Grace of God in ſome meaſure of Sincerity, tho' attended with much Weakneſs, great Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

and manifold Temptations. Let theſe Counſels of the Lord be acceptable to you, labour to have them engraven upon the <hi>Tables</hi> of your hearts; and ſee that all your deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and improvements be ſuch, that the Lord may take pleaſure in your Proſperity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Riches of his Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, that true Religion, <hi>pure and undefiled Religion</hi> in the power, beauty and glory of it may live with you and with your Children after you unto all Poſterity. In order thereunto I ſhall conclude with that ſolemn Prayer of the Apoſtle on your behalf, Heb. 13.20, 21. <hi>Now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that Great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be Glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

                  </gap> Complaint before the Lord.</hi> Their days in that Captivity were <hi>conſumed like ſmoke,</hi> ver. 3. in which is nothing ſolid, neither ſtrength, beauty nor delight. Their <hi>Bones were burnt as an Hearth</hi>; The continual Grief on their Spirits dryed up <hi>their Bones,</hi> Prov. 17.22. So that it's ſaid of the Church in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>Shall theſe dry Bones live?</hi> Ezek. 37.2, 3, 4. They were like <hi>withered graſs pulled up by the Roots,</hi> which therefore muſt needs dye, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. The Church was then like a <hi>Pelican of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> ver. 6. forſaken of all Friends, and loving ſolitude and ſolitarineſs, <hi>like a Sparrow alone on an houſe top,</hi> ver. 7. When her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition call'd moſt for pity, her Enemies added more Affliction to her by their <hi>Reproaches,</hi> ver. 8. The Church to her own apprehenſion was in a decaying, waſting, declining ſtate, <hi>like the ſhade of the Sun</hi> that is going down, which va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries every moment 'till it end in total darkneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. In this Priſon of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Church lay groaning, like a Son of Death, like a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Sentenced to Death, of whoſe Life was no hope as to an eye of ſenſe or reaſon.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Jewiſh Church <hi>weaken'd</hi> when they were in the heighth of their Strength and Splendor, in the midſt of their Proſperity, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 24. <hi>Caſt down</hi> and depreſſed from the height

Godly Men are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that God doth <hi>not willingly grieve nor afflict</hi> the Children of Men, that God acts not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but for juſt cauſes and holy ends; that their Sins kindle God's Anger againſt them, and bring Puniſhments upon them. This grief for their Sins works in them, <hi>Repentance unto Salvation. Thou haſt caſt me down,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>thou haſt weakned my ſtrength and ſhortned my days,</hi> ver. 23. They take notice of an Hand of <hi>God</hi> in all Calamities; that there is <hi>no Evil in the City, but God hath done it.</hi>

Church, to reſtore Peace to them and to take Vengeance on their Enemies. <hi>God will have mercy upon Zion</hi>; that is, the Church, which is called the Daughter of <hi>Sion</hi>; by <hi>pardoning the Sins</hi> of his People upon their Repentance, <hi>accepting them into Favour</hi> with God, bringing them back to their own Land, and reſtoring their Civil Polity, and eſpecially the Worſhip of God and the Privileges of his Houſe, unto them; and that in the appointed Time, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould come in the Fleſh, who ſhould reſtore all things.

Alſo God's People <hi>took pleaſure in the ſtones and favoured the duſt of Sion,</hi> ver. 14. They had excited in them an inflamed love to their Country, their Religion and the inſtituted Worſhip of God; their want of them had taught them highly to prize and value them as their precious things, more precious then Duſt of Gold, or the richeſt Pearls: and they believed that out of the <hi>Stones and Duſt of Sion,</hi> tho' now confuſed, ſhould ſpring forth, by Divine Power, a New Temple, and that there ſhould be a Glorious Reſurrection and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of Religion; for they believed that God himſelf would <hi>appear gloriouſly,</hi> and make it evident that it is his <hi>own Work</hi> peculiarly,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001888_0043_0FB9C727D1AEA450"/>
to <hi>build up Sion,</hi> ver. 17. to gather the Jews from their diſperſions and to ſet up their civil Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, with the Temple and Divine Worſhip: which Work of God ſhould be famous, like the making of dry and dead Bones to live, or like the raiſing of dead Bodies out of their Graves. When this work is accompliſhed, it will be apparent that God has done it and not Man; that <hi>God himſelf hath looked down from the heighth of his Sanctuary in Heaven</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the Earth; that he hath ſet at Liberty the <hi>Priſoners appointed to Death,</hi> ver. 20. that they may proclaim God's Name in Sion and his Praiſe in Jeruſalem, in their own Land.

the <hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> ſhall hear of it to the impreſſing ſome fear and dread of God upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Yea the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that were Strangers to <hi>Iſrael</hi> and Enemies to them, by the Beauty and Comelineſs of the Lord put upon <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould be moved to joyn with them in Praiſing God, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles into the Church is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be predicted in this Pſalm.</p>
            <p>During the Seventy Years Captivity of the <hi>Jews</hi> there was little of Religion, little of the Remembrance of God's Name and Worſhip left in the World; but Pious Souls did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themſelves, that the time drew near when not only the Temple ſhould be reſtored, but the Church ſhould be enlarged by the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This Prophecy was eſpecially fulfilled in the times of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; to <hi>him ſhall the Gathering of the Nations be,</hi> Gen. 49.10.</p>

And ſome extend the Name ſo far as to take in Mount <hi>Moriah</hi>; on which Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Temple</hi> was built. The <hi>Church of the Jews</hi> was called <hi>Sion,</hi> becauſe that was the Place where they aſſembled.

            <p>In ſeveral reſpects the Church might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled unto <hi>Sion</hi>; namely, As <hi>Sion</hi> was a Fort of the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> who were Strangers to God and the true Religion, ſo the Church conſiſts of ſuch who are <hi>Strangers to God</hi> before their Converſion; ſuch as were Spiritually <hi>halt</hi> and <hi>blind</hi> by nature. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.6, 7. in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6, 7.

on this Work; but until Men do hear the voice of God ſpeaking to their hearts as well as the voice of Men ſpeaking to their ears they will not be Converted; until they feel the power of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> which goes beyond any humane power in the efficacy of it, their <hi>hard Hearts</hi> will not be broken for and from Sin, nor their <hi>blind Minds</hi> be ſavingly enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened in the knowledge of Chriſt ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him for Salvation, nor will their <hi>love to Sin</hi> be turned to an hatred thereof, nor will they accept of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ſubmit to him in all his Offices and Ordinances and upon his own Terms on which he is offered in the Goſpl.</p>
            <p>And after Men are Converted the ſame Divine creating power doth <hi>appear in its Glory</hi> to preſerve Grace alive in their Souls. We need the <hi>freſh Anointings</hi> of the Spirit to give new ſupplies of ſtrength and nouriſhment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faith and every other Grace in us: we need to have our <hi>Souls watered</hi> every moment from above to preſerve Grace in a thriving and flouriſhing ſtate in our Souls: we need the help of God to recover us from decays in Grace, to quicken and revive Grace in us, to ſtrengthen us with might in <hi>the inner man by the Glorious Power</hi> of his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to enable us to get a victory over <hi>Sin</hi> dwelling in us, and over <hi>Satan</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> without us, which are the Enemies that fight

againſt our Souls, and to enable us to conflict with and conquer that <hi>laſt Enemy Death,</hi> that we may enter into Heaven, triumphing over our Spiritual Enemies, after the end of our preſent Militant eſtate on Earth.</p>
            <p>This internal <hi>Building up of Zion</hi> in the hearts of the Elect, is that peculiar work of God which he chiefly aims at and intends to ſee accompliſhed in this World; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is <hi>the World</hi> itſelf preſerved in its being 'till all the Elect of God are born into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in the World and New-born unto Chriſt by their Regeneration: All other the works of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> are put in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency unto this great work of the calling home of the Elect unto Chriſt, even as <hi>many as were fore-ordained unto Eternal Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Building up of Sion Viſibly,</hi> or the upholding and enlarging the Viſible Church is the <hi>peculiar work</hi> of God, in effecting where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he doth <hi>appear in his Glory.</hi> For, God is wont to carry on his <hi>inviſible work</hi> in the Hearts of his Elect, by the <hi>outward means</hi> of Grace, by the Word Preached and by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances adminiſtred; therefore for the Elects ſake God will uphold and preſerve a <hi>Viſible Sion</hi> or Church ſtate upon Earth, until all his Elect are gathered in unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And God has promiſed that Chriſt ſhall <hi>ſee his Seed,</hi> that is, ſhall have a <hi>Viſible Seed</hi> upon

Earth in all Generations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.9. Alſo it is for the declarative or manifeſtative <hi>Glory</hi> of God in the World, that a <hi>Viſible Church</hi> ſhould be preſerved therein. The forming or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Churches,</hi> the new forming or giving forth new Editions of the Church, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of it in the ſeveral ages of the World; the defending of it againſt its Enemies, are ſuch diſplays of the Wiſdom, Power, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Grace of God, yea of all his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, that it may be juſtly ſaid, that the Lord doth <hi>appear in his Glory</hi> here on Earth, when this good work is going forward.</p>
            <p>God the <hi>Father</hi> hath therefore in his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſels reſolved that Chriſt ſhall have a <hi>Viſible Kingdom</hi> upon Earth, and the contrary <hi>works of the Devil</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed; by means whereof the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied upon Earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.22, 27, 30, 31.</p>
            <p>Take ſome Inſtances of the <hi>Glorious Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> of God in building up his Viſible Church and Kingdom upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There was a <hi>Viſible Church</hi> erected or formed in <hi>Adam's</hi> Family, after his Fall: The foundation on which it was built, was the <hi>promiſed Seed,</hi> the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> that <hi>Seed of the Woman who was to break the Serpents head,</hi> who was to come into the World to <hi>deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi> In that Church, the Worſhip of God by <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> was upheld, and there was <hi>Church
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001888_0052_0FB9C73FA6D1BE80"/>
Diſcipline</hi> exerciſed therein, as when <hi>Cain</hi> was rejected from the enjoyment of the preſence of God in his Houſe and Ordinances. In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam's Family</hi> was formed the firſt <hi>Viſible Goſpel Church</hi> that ever was in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Lord did <hi>appear in His Glory</hi> to build up his Church Viſible in the days of <hi>Noah:</hi> with him was the Covenant of Grace renewed; by him who was a <hi>Preacher of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> was Chriſt preached; and by the <hi>Ark</hi> a Type of Chriſt, Men were taught that in Chriſt only Mankind could be ſaved from the deluge of Eternal Wrath: alſo <hi>Laws</hi> of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip were given to <hi>Noah</hi>; and the apoſtatized World of Men, were ſwept out of the World by that univerſal Flood, that they might no longer obſtruct the thriving and flouriſhing of the true Religion upon Earth, ſeeing they were become incorrigible in their Sins. Thus we ſee that God was content to part with a <hi>whole World</hi> of ſinful Men, rather than <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould not be upheld in the World; rather than Sinners by their numerouſneſs and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhould obſtruct the work of <hi>Reformation</hi> and the Progreſs of <hi>Religion</hi> upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Another remarkable Period, wherein the Lord did appear in his Glory for the <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sion,</hi> was at the time of the <hi>Diſperſion</hi> of Mankind by the confuſion of their Languages at <hi>Babel.</hi> For hereby vaſt number of <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001888_0053_0FB9C7425CE9EE88"/>
were ſeparated from the true Church and purged out from fellowſhip with the Church; while <hi>Religion</hi> (and probably the <hi>Original Language</hi> alſo) was preſerved in the Houſe of <hi>Shem,</hi> the Father of <hi>Heber,</hi> Gen. 10.21. who would not (as is conceived) joyn with the reſt in building the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>Confuſion of Languages</hi> proved a Bar to hinder the reſt of the World from hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Communion with the true Church, nor was this Bar or <hi>Partition Wall</hi> remov'd 'till <hi>Chriſt made Peace by the Blood of the Croſs</hi> and obtained the <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi> in order to the publiſhing of the Goſpel among all Nations, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Another remarkable Period, wherein God appeared in his Glory for the <hi>Building up of Sion,</hi> was when God renewed his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with <hi>Abraham.</hi> For, tho' during thoſe Ten Generations from the Confuſion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages at <hi>Babel</hi> until the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Church enjoyed a Miniſtry by excellent Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for <hi>Noah</hi> lived <hi>Three Hundred &amp; Forty Years</hi> after the Flood, and ſerved in the Church as a great Prophet, as alſo <hi>Shem</hi> was preſerved in life 'till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, and <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> who was a <hi>Prieſt</hi> to offer Sacrifices and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the meaning of them, as well as a <hi>King</hi> to do Juſtice. Yet <hi>Religion</hi> was before the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Abraham</hi> almoſt extinct in the World,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001888_0054_0FB9C748CB51A0F8"/>
being miſerably decayed and corrupted: The Lord therefore thought it high time to <hi>appear in his Glory</hi> for the preſervation and reſtoration of it: by calling <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſeparate himſelf even from his Fathers Houſe and his Native Land, and by revealing himſelf unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and Covenanting with him to be a <hi>God to him and to his Seed</hi>; and made him the <hi>Father</hi> in reſpect of this Covenant renewed with him, not only of his own natural Seed but of his <hi>adopted Seed in all Nations,</hi> namely, of all that ſhould have the like Faith in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was wrought in <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 12.1. and he became <hi>Heir of the World</hi> or of the Church in the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and thus in <hi>Abrahams Family</hi> God preſerved a <hi>Seed to ſerve him,</hi> diſtinguiſht from the reſt of the Apoſtate World.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Another Period of time wherein there was a very <hi>Glorious Appearance</hi> of God for the Building up of the Church, was in the time of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> were become very ignorant, and being kept like Slaves and Drudges under their Taskmaſters, laboured under woful diſadvantages for the upholding of Religion and the Worſhip of God. The Lord, rather than <hi>Religion</hi> ſhould be wholly loſt upon Earth, was pleaſed by remarkable works of Providence to revive it out of the aſhes. He raiſed up <hi>Moſes,</hi> reveal'd himſelf
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001888_0055_0FB9C74A30780138"/>
to him from Heaven, taught <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Ten Commandments from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> appointed Ordinances of Worſhip and the Rules of a <hi>Church State</hi> as well as of a well ordered Civil Polity: which Laws and Ordinances Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Judicial were of force for the ſpace of <hi>Fifteen Hundred Years,</hi> namely 'till the coming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Yet in this interval between <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Church fell under woful Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and Apoſtacy into Vice and Idolatry; ſo that God was provoked to ſend them into <hi>Babylon</hi> for Seventy Years. But at the end of that term it pleaſed God to proceed to a <hi>New Forming</hi> of his Church that he might have a People ſet apart <hi>for himſelf to ſhew forth his Praiſe</hi> viſibly on Earth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. and the <hi>Temple</hi> was rebuilt and the Ordinances of Divine Worſhip again ſet up: This our Text ſeems to refer unto.</p>
            <p>But at length the Jews fell to idolizing the very Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> expecting <hi>Juſtification</hi> by the literal obſervance of it; which was a great diſhonour to Chriſt the true <hi>Mediator,</hi> that the <hi>Shadow</hi> ſhould be preferr'd before the <hi>Subſtance</hi>; yet thus they did, for under an Opinion of being ſteady <hi>Diſciples of Moſes,</hi> they refuſed to become <hi>Diſciples of Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p>Hence at this time and age of the World, there was as much need of <hi>making all things</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:001888_0056_0FB9C74BD92A4A90"/>
new, or of new forming the Church as there was at the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, when the <hi>whole World had corrupted their ways</hi>; and as there was in any other of the aforementioned Periods.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Hereupon, <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> appeared in the World, as the greateſt of Prophets and the chief Builder to carry on this work of <hi>Building up the Church</hi> and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtate of it ſtill more glorious. He ſo ordered, that the <hi>Temple</hi> and its Worſhip, which the Jews idolized, ſhould be deſtroyed, that the <hi>Law of Ceremonies</hi> ſhould be abrogated; and as being <hi>Lord of his Houſe</hi> did appoint the Laws of it, and inſtituted the Ordinances of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords-Supper</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be obſerved in the Church in theſe days of the Goſpel. He pulled down the <hi>Wall of Partition</hi> betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> enlarged the Curtains of the <hi>Tabernacle of David</hi> (Iſai. 54.2. Amos 9.11.) takes the <hi>Gentiles</hi> within the Covenant and within the pale of the <hi>Church,</hi> engrafting them into that <hi>Vine</hi> from which the Jews for their impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and for their rejecting of Chriſt, were cut off. He beſtowed <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi> on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to furniſh them for the carrying on of this work, the propagation of <hi>Religion</hi> in the World, and there were remarkable effuſions of the Spirit in the days of the Apoſtles, by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001888_0057_0FB9C74D253B0D38"/>
which God did <hi>appear in his Glory</hi> for the <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome inſtances of the glorious Appearances of God in the World for the carrying on his work, which deſerve to be enlarged upon by a better Hand. But theſe Hints may be of preſent uſe unto us. Alſo much might be added concerning the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful appearance of God in carrying on the work of <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> in latter Ages; how the Grace, Faithfulneſs, Power and Wiſdom of God have been diſplayed in many ſignal Steps thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us proceed to conſider, that the Lord doth alſo <hi>glorify</hi> his Name in building up his Church, in the more <hi>ordinary Courſe</hi> and Methods of his Providence, for the preſerving of <hi>Religion</hi> where it is ſet up and propogating of it to ſucceeding Generations. Take ſome inſtances of God's Wiſdom and Grace appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God hath taken care and made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Parents</hi> ſhould be eſteemed to belong to his <hi>Church</hi> and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdom; and hath commanded their Parents to bring them up for God and doth ſet the Mark of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> upon them to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from the unbelieving World, and they are brought under Obligations Sealed at their <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to be the Covenant People of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001888_0058_0FB9C751C816E858"/>
God. If God had not made this Proviſion, there would have been great <hi>Chaſms</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies</hi> in the diſpenſation of the <hi>Viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; for then the Children of Believers would not have been Children of the <hi>Church,</hi> nor under the care of the Church any more than <hi>Pagans</hi> and Infidels, and being left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to chuſe their Religion, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſore Temptations to Apoſtacy, which would tend to diſſolve the Church ſoon after it is planted.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Chriſt as Head of the Church, doth in every Age beſtow <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> upon ſome to qualify them to teach and lead his Church upon Earth, namely <hi>Wiſdom, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi> and <hi>Utterance,</hi> to know how to <hi>ſpeak a Word in Seaſon</hi> for the inſtruction and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 50.4. Theſe Gifts are to qualify ſome to be <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to the Lord in Goſpel times, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.21. Called <hi>Prophecyings,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.20. 1 Cor. 14.22.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> are ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to and conferred on Perſons ſince the Apoſtles days, by a <hi>Miniſterial Education</hi> in the <hi>Schools of the Prophets.</hi> As there is the <hi>Seed of the Church</hi> in Viſible Profeſſors Educated from their Infancy under the Chriſtian care of their Parents and under the watch of the Church; ſo there is the <hi>Seed of the Prophets</hi> preſerved in the Sons of the Prophets whom
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001888_0059_0FB9C753502D1918"/>
Chriſt raiſes up for his peculiar Service, and the Spirit of Prophecy (or of Miniſterial Gifts) and Chriſts Word ſhall <hi>not depart out of their Mouths for ever,</hi> Iſai. 59.20. But Chriſt will take care that there ſhall be a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thus educated and qualifyed for Publick Service in his Churches in all ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, 'till the end of the World. This was the way God took for the continuance of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophets</hi> in the Old Teſtament; for tho' there was a more immediate effuſion of the Spirit on the <hi>Seventy Elders,</hi> Numb 11.25. yet it was afterwards continued in the <hi>School of the Prophets</hi> wherein ſome ancient experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Prophet was a <hi>Spiritual Father</hi> and the <hi>Scholars</hi> were called his <hi>Sons: Samuel, Elijah, Eliſha</hi> were <hi>Fathers</hi> in that School, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.5, 7, 15. <hi>Amos</hi> 7.14.

faithful Men, who ſhould be able to teach others alſo.</hi> The conferring of Miniſteral Gifts and Grace is a Token of Chriſt's ſpecial Love to his Churches and of his <hi>Preſence</hi> with them; One of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to evidence that Chriſt is come in the Fleſh is, <hi>The Spirit on Earth,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.8. namely, the Gifts of the <hi>Spirit</hi> for the building up of the Church. This <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> or Gifts of the Spirit to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Churches, is the <hi>Teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 19.10. namely, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is Head of the Church</hi> and ſtill lives in Heaven and takes care of it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. Happy are they who hear what this <hi>Spirit ſaith to the Churches.</hi> By this <hi>Spirit</hi> is <hi>Life</hi> preſerved in the Church in evil times. When this <hi>Salt</hi> hath not <hi>loſt its ſavour</hi> then it goes well with the Churches.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. The <hi>Building up of Sion,</hi> tho' it be <hi>God's peculiar work</hi> yet he carries it on in the World, as a <hi>Return &amp; Anſwer to the Prayers of his People,</hi> who are deeply humbled for their Sins and ſenſible that they can do nothing of themſelves for the promoting this Work, to effect, without God's Help, Bleſſing and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>internal Temple-work</hi> carryed on in the hearts of God's Elect, it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or promoted by <hi>outward Means</hi> alone, without the powerful influences and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of God by his <hi>Spirit. Paul may plant, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo may water,</hi> but <hi>God only giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the <hi>Extraordinary Revivals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and New Formations or Recoveries of the Church after great Apoſtacies, in ſeveral Ages of the Church: they have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by remarkable Diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and more than ordinary effuſions of the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby it is evident <hi>God</hi> hath effected them and not <hi>Men</hi>; tho' God has been pleaſed to make uſe of <hi>Men</hi> in that work. And the Lord hath done this work in <hi>Anſwer to the Prayers</hi> of his People when they were deeply humbled before him and deſtitute of help in themſelves; like <hi>Iſrael</hi> when the Sea was before them and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> behind them, and Mountains on each ſide of them, having no way left for their Relief but to <hi>look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> towards Heaven, by Faith and Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Prayers. Tho' the carnal World deſpiſe the Church, as a <hi>feeble Folk,</hi> as weakneſs itſelf, yet the <hi>Strong God</hi> appears to be on their ſide, to take their part, and they are <hi>Strong in the Lord and in the Power of his Might.</hi> God indites the <hi>Prayers</hi> of his People for them by his Spirit, ſo that they Pray for ſuch things as are agreeable to God's Will and tend to his Glory; He fills their hearts with holy deſires after the <hi>Revival of Religion</hi> and Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of the Church; and having accepted their <hi>Perſons</hi> for Chriſt's ſake, doth alſo accept of their <hi>Prayers</hi> and works wonderfully in anſwer to their Prayers, even <hi>beyond what they could ask or think</hi>; and they will not ceaſe Praying, 'till they have obtained of God the Deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and of the Kingdom of Satan.

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="2">(2.) We are by <hi>Prayer</hi> to obtain from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this great Bleſſing of God, that the Churches may be ſupplied ſucceſſively with <hi>Officers</hi> qualifyed with thoſe <hi>Gifts of the Spirit</hi> as well as with Grace, whereby they may be capable to become <hi>Paſtors after God's own heart,</hi> to feed and lead the Flocks of Chriſt with <hi>Knowlege and Underſtanding</hi>; that God would be pleaſed plentifully to beſtow Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial Abilities on ſuch as he improves in his Churches. Even <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf writes in, 1 Theſ. 5.25. <hi>Brethren, pray for us.</hi> and 2 Theſ. 3.1.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We ought in a way of earneſt <hi>Prayer</hi> to endeavour the <hi>Planting of the Goſpel</hi> in the <hi>dark Corners</hi> of our Land: and that God would <hi>appear in his Glory</hi> for the ſucceeding our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for that end.

ſlighted unleſs the Lord enlighten a People to ſee the worth and value of it.

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Why will God have this Work, the Building up of Sion carryed on in Anſwer to the Prayers of a penitent and humble People?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe thoſe who are brought into a penitent <hi>humble prayerful frame,</hi> are in ſome meaſure <hi>prepared</hi> to give unto the Lord the <hi>Glory due unto his Name</hi> for the progreſs of this work of Religion. They ſee their own <hi>ſinfulneſs</hi> and vileneſs, that they are unworthy of ſuch a favour from God; they ſee their own <hi>inability</hi> and inſufficiency to do any thing that ſhall ſubſerve to the building up of <hi>Sion</hi>; therefore when any thing of that nature and tendency is effected, they will ſay, <hi>Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to thy Name be the Glory.</hi> The leſs of <hi>Man</hi> is ſeen, the more of <hi>God</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this Work. We ſhall not duly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the glorious <hi>Efficiency</hi> of God in carrying on this Work, 'till we ſee our own <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs.</hi> We are indeed to acknowledge the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001888_0065_0FB9C76F115B7B40"/>
               <hi>Inſtruments</hi> whom God makes uſe of (as they did, Luk 5.7. <hi>He hath loved our Nation and built us a Synagogue</hi>) but in ſuch a way as not to derogate from the Glory of <hi>God,</hi> but to bleſs God for enabling ſuch to be inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in promoving his Work. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The more <hi>humble, penitent and prayerful</hi> we are, before ſuch favours are beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, the more ground there is to hope that our ſpiritual and ſaving <hi>good</hi> will be furthered by them. An impeninent and unhumbled heart is not fit to improve a Mercy to his own ſpiritual good and advantage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When God moves the <hi>Wheels of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> by his <hi>Spirit in the Wheels</hi> (Ezek. 1.12.) He is wont at ſuch a time to move the <hi>Wheels of Grace</hi> in the hearts of his People, filling them with longing deſires after the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that Work which God hath in hand, for his Glory. The <hi>building up of Sion</hi> externally is attended with the <hi>building up of Grace</hi> in the hearts of true Believers: for at ſuch a time there will be a freſh and renewed exerciſe of <hi>Love</hi> to God, <hi>Fear</hi> of God, <hi>Faith</hi> and Truſt in God: yea every <hi>Grace</hi> of God's Spirit will take its turn to be in Exerciſe at ſuch a time.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:001888_0066_0FB9C77152FE4630"/>4. That <hi>Mercy</hi> hath a <hi>double ſweetneſs</hi> in it, unto a Soul truly Pious, which comes from Heaven in anſwer to <hi>penitential and fervent Prayer</hi>: when a Soul can ſay, <hi>This is that very Mercy which I wreſtled with God for; and he hath heard my Prayer and Supplication.</hi> How ſweet is that Mercy!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe, We <hi>continually need</hi> the directing, ſupporting and comforting <hi>Preſence</hi> of God with us and his co-operating <hi>Providence,</hi> both as to the beginning and as to the progreſs of any Work of God which we engage in.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We need God to <hi>direct</hi> us by his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> in every ſtep we take in his Service: that we may do his work <hi>after the right Order,</hi> ſo as may pleaſe him: for <hi>God is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Confuſion but of Peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33. and he made a breach upon <hi>Uzzah</hi> when he acted indiſcreetly and inconſiderately in God's Work and not <hi>after the due Order,</hi> 1 Chron. 15.13. Its matter of Joy to Good Men to <hi>behold the Order of the Saints</hi> in their proceedings in any good Work. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5. and that there may not be the <hi>noiſe of Hammers,</hi> &amp;c. in the building of their <hi>Temple,</hi> 1 Kin. 6.7. that all clamour and diſturbances may be avoided, and that peace and calmneſs may attend us in our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; we had need to pray earneſtly to God to reſtrain and mortify our prid

paſſions, envy, ſelf-ſeeking, and all other <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Inclinations</hi> that will be ſpringing up in us when we are about God's Work.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) We need the <hi>aſſiſting</hi> and <hi>comforting</hi> preſence of God with us, when we ſet about any good Work; ſhould therefore pray to him to <hi>ſtrengthen us with might in the inner Man,</hi> Eph. 3.16. and that we <hi>may not faint and be weary in well doing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gal. 6.9. that God would encourage our hearts and ſtrengthen our hands in his work; and that his Work may not be marred and ſpoyled and prove abortive by paſſing through our defiled hands.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) We have need to pray for the <hi>co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Providence</hi> and efficiency of God with our endeavours to build up <hi>Sion:</hi> that he would cauſe a <hi>Coincidence</hi> of all things to the accompliſhing his Work; that he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or give us Wiſdom and Grace to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the multitude of <hi>Obſtructions</hi> which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan from time to time endeavours to lay in the way, to ſtop the progreſs of God's Work: and that it may appear that <hi>God himſelf doth work with us,</hi> for us and by us.—And that God would be pleaſed to ſupply our wants and afford us ſuch means and ſuch a meaſure of outward <hi>Wealth</hi> as he ſees is needful for the carrying on his Work and ſupporting of his Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:001888_0068_0FB9C77424C738E0"/>6. Becauſe we are always beholden or obliged to the <hi>Free Grace of God</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> of our Perſons and to accept of thoſe mean Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which we do for his Name and Glory. Such <hi>Acceptance</hi> we can't expect unleſs we be <hi>Prayerful and Penitent</hi>: and how ſad a thing will it be, if all we do ſhould be rejected of God, and our Perſons rejected alſo, for want of true Faith and Repentance in us, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.11, —15. Let us then offer up our ſelves and our poor Services unto God in and by Chriſt, that they may prove an <hi>acceptable offering, of a ſweet ſmelling ſavour unto God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. God builds up <hi>Sion</hi> in anſwer to Prayer conjoyned with Humiliation and Repentance, becauſe he will put that honour and reſpect upon the duty of <hi>Prayer</hi> with Faſting and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Soul for our Sins; which is a Duty of his <hi>Appointment</hi> and Inſtitution. Therefore God will ſo order things in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that Chriſtians ſhall find by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that all Good Works which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in do ſucceed the better when carryed on by <hi>Prayer</hi>; and that the neglect of that duty and the neglect of exerciſing thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required unto the acceptable performance of that Duty is one cauſe why <hi>Religion</hi> thrives and flouriſhes no more, and makes no greater progreſs in the World. When a <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:001888_0069_0FB9C77A4908A710"/>
and Supplication is poured out upon a People, then God's Work proſpers and goes forward; When <hi>Moſes hands</hi> were lifted up, then <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed. When our <hi>hands hang down</hi> (i. e. when we omit and neglect <hi>Prayer</hi>) then the work of Chriſt in our hands goes on heavily and ſlowly.</p>
            <div type="application">

               <p>Hence we infer, that we are this Day in the way of our <hi>duty,</hi> while we ſet apart this Day to humble our Souls before God and to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate at the Throne of Grace for Mercy, in reference to the preſent ſtate of the Work of God in this Place.</p>
               <p>This <hi>New Building</hi> wherein we are now met for the exerciſe of Sacred Worſhip, may ſerve to put us in mind of the <hi>Building up of Sion,</hi> ſpoken of in our Text, which is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar work which God is concern'd for in the this World. And the deſign of Erecting <hi>this Houſe,</hi> being for the more convenient Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of God's People who inhabit in this part of your Town, with an aim at the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and propagation of Religion to your Poſterity; It is therefore very needful that Prayer and Humiliation ſhould be attended, in your progreſs in this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:001888_0070_0FB9C77C653CDA28"/>But having been too large and tedious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, I ſhall cloſe the Diſcourſe with a few Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>ſearch our Hearts,</hi> our <hi>Houſes</hi> and our <hi>Converſations</hi> that we may find out the <hi>Sins</hi> which we ſhould this day mourn for and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and beg Pardon of; which if they are impenitently perſiſted in will obſtruct God's preſence with us and his bleſſing upon us. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hurt us but <hi>Sin</hi>; Sin provokes the Lord to withdraw himſelf from particular Perſons, who indulge themſelves therein. <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Sins</hi> unreformed provoke the Lord to hide himſelf from ſuch Families; and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>Sins of the Place</hi> and People where we live, bring down the Judgments of Heaven upon the Publick Society and procure the Frowns and Rebukes of God upon us: and bring a blaſt on Mens endeavours, tho' the work be materially Good which they ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. Let each of us labour to find out his own iniquity; and lament it before the Lord. Is there any Sin, which we have not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of and reformed? Let us do it <hi>now,</hi> for in this work we are engaging in, the God with whom we have to do is an <hi>Holy God,</hi> of <hi>purer Eyes than to behold iniquity</hi> with any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation thereof.</p>
               <p>Let us lament the <hi>pride</hi> of our hearts, the <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>carnality</hi> of our minds, our confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001888_0071_0FB9C77DE4C81B70"/>
to the ſinful courſes of the <hi>carnal World,</hi> the <hi>coldneſs</hi> and lukewarmneſs of our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards God and Religion, our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and indiſpoſedneſs to that which is Good, our want of <hi>Zeal</hi> againſt Vice, and that we have mourned and grieved ſo little for the Sins prevailing in the Time and Place where we have lived, and that we have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to uſe our utmoſt influence and intereſt for the reforming of them. Let us mourn for our <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> under the means of Grace, and that ſo many of us are not yet laid as poliſhed <hi>Stones in God's Building,</hi> namely <hi>The Church.</hi> That we have lived in Omiſſion of <hi>Family Prayer</hi> and of the Holy <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Divine Inſtitution: that we have been too negligent in giving good Counſel, Exhortations and Reproofs unto others, eſpecially to our own Children and Inferiours. And whatever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sin our Conſciences cannot but charge us with, upon ſerious Self-Examination; Let us mourn for it before the Lord this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us betake our ſelves by <hi>Faith</hi> unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Lamb of God who taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi> Waſh in the <hi>Fountain</hi> of the Blood of Chriſt which is <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened</hi> unto us in the Goſpel.

the Remiſſion of all our Sins, that we may be cleanſed from the Guilt and Filth of them; that through Chriſt our <hi>Peace</hi> may be renewed with God, all matter of Controverſy between God and us removed; and that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain well-grounded hopes, that God will <hi>not hide</hi> himſelf from us or withdraw his gracious preſence from us.

Let us look up to God by Faith that theſe our <hi>filthy Garments</hi> may be taken from us, and that the <hi>Robe of Chriſt's Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may be put upon us. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.3, 4. and that we may be cleanſed from the guilt and filth and power of our Sins, and may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Sanctifying virtue of the Holy Spirit <hi>unto every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us fix and exerciſe our <hi>Faith,</hi> upon the gracious <hi>Promiſes</hi> and Declarations of God's Will in his Word, referring to the <hi>Building up of Sion,</hi> the preſervation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogation of Religion.

He hath ſtored up Mercy in his Covenant for the <hi>Generations to come and for the People that are yet to be created,</hi> ver. 18. for the <hi>Children of his Servants and for their Seed,</hi> ver. 28.</p>
               <p>It is not in vain to Supplicate to the Lord for theſe Favours; that the riſing Generation and thoſe who ſucceed them may be privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged with a ſtanding and being planted within the pale of the Viſible Church and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the initiatory Seal of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; that their Parents may be moved from the Love they bear to their Children, to bring them near unto God and to offer and dedicate them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord in their <hi>Baptiſm</hi>; that they may enjoy the priviledge of <hi>Parental Chriſtian Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the knowlege and fear of God, and an Education under an Orthodox and Learned and Pious Miniſtry from their Youth until their riper Years, whereby they may be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a Generation whom the Lord ſhall take pleaſure in; of whom the Lord ſhall ſay, <hi>This People have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my Praiſe.</hi>
