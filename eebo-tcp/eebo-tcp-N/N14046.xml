            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE had the favor of your ſummons to attend a Court-Martial, appointed by his Excellency the Commander in Chief to ſit on the conduct of Major General Howe, on the complaint of the State of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. It is not unknown to Major General Howe, or to the Delegates of the State, that I declined to give evidence upon this ſubject whilſt the proſecution was in the form of an enquiry, and depoſitions taking in the War-Office by order of Congreſs, until meaſures ſhould be taken for obtaining the teſtimony of Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elbert, who commanded the Georgia brigade of continental troops on the 29th day of December, 1778, the corps which ſuffered the moſt by capture on that occaſion: And the ſacrifice or loſs of the troops being the principal object of the proſecution, I ſhould ſuppoſe that the trial would be partial without his evidence; or, at leaſt, that implied cenſure might be recorded againſt his conduct in the minutes of the Court, which might injure a moſt valuable citizen and ſoldier of the State. Indeed, I ſhould think myſelf acceſſary in the wrong which might take place, did I not plead that the trial might be fait and full, taking in his eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial evidence. For theſe reaſons, Sir, it is that I have hitherto and do now declined to attend the Court; but when it ſhall be decided to take General Elbert's teſtimony before the proceedings are cloſe, then ſhall I chearfully depoſe what I know in this caſe. I beg that you would pleaſe to make my reſpects to the Court, and acquaint the members with the reaſons aſſigned for my conduct.</p>

                     <p>THE Court-Martial ordered by his Excellency the Commander in Chief for the trial of Major General Howe, upon certain charges exhibited againſt him by the Delegates of the State of Georgia, having met and ſummoned the evidences whoſe names were given in, are acquainted that only Colonel Walton can be found, and that he declines to give his evidence, for the reaſons contained in his letter which is incloſed; that General Elbert and Colonel Marbury are in Maryland, and tho' ſummoned ſome time ſince to attend, as the Court are informed, are not yet arrived.—The Court therefore requeſt, Gentlemen, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are content the trial ſhould proceed upon ſuch evidence as can now be obtained, or whether you expect the trial to be poſtponed to a diſtant day, when the deficient evidence may be procured. I am, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</p>

                     <p>WE do ourſelves the pleaſure to reply to your letter of yeſterday, and are ſorry to underſtand that the operative powers of the Court are impeded for want of evidence in the caſe of Major General Howe, on the part of the State of Georgia. We are not informed by the Board of War with the time or conveyance of the ſummonſes ſent to General Elbert and Colonel Marbury; and it will appear pretty evident to you, that we have no coercive powers to compel evidence to attend. Under a train of circumſtances peculiar in themſelves, we cannot preſume to dictate to the Court; but if difficulties exiſt, the propriety of a reference to Congreſs will readily occur. We annex the names of ſuch perſons as have occurred to us ſince the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe to the Board of War, whoſe evidence we wiſh to have taken on the trial, in addition to the former. We are, Sir,</p>

               <p>The Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major Lucas was ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017772_0004_0FA2BC42488EA898"/>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Captain in the Georgia Line.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ſteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. I viſited the poſt at Girardeau's landing, where Captain Smith was poſted with about 75 men; my ſituation in the army prevented me from ſeeing the different poſts.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the oppoſition that was made to their landing?</p>
               <p>A. No; I heard a firing, but was not preſent.</p>
               <p>Q Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and at what diſtance was it from the place of landing?</p>
               <p>A. At Fair-Lawn, better than a mile from the place of landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. No; I underſtood, when I was priſoner, that they landed 2500 men at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they land at any other place?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you poſted that day?</p>
               <p>A. With my regiment in the Georgia brigade, on the left of the line.</p>
               <p>Q. After the enemy had landed, did the line move down to oppoſe them, or did they wait the enemy's attack?</p>
               <p>A. They waited the enemy's attack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy attack them in their poſition at Fair-Lawn, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. We were poſted in a poſition of defence againſt the enemy, the South-Carolina brigade on the right, the Georgia brigade on the left, the artillery in the centre, and a party of militia, under the command of Colonel Walton, on the right of the whole, to oppoſe the enemy at a paſs, I think a mile from the main body, where the enemy's infantry did attack them; but a ſmall reſiſtance being made by them, enabled the enemy's infantry to attack our right flanks immediately after, at which time the main body moved on, firing a few ſhot from their artillery, which did ſome ſmall damage in the Georgia brigade; about that time we had orders to retreat, agreeable to the diſpoſition given the night before, which was by a defile called Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill to M'Gilvray's gate, an advantageous piece of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the retreat conducted agreeably to the diſpoſition?</p>
               <p>A. No; the brigade I belonged to moved off in column, and were afterwards ordered by the commanding officer to form by files, and ſome time afterwards they broke, and the principal part went into Savanna. Two parties were taken out of the brigade, by order of General Howe, as we were moving in column, to act as infantry on the flanks; the piece of artillery ordered to cover the rear of that brigade quitted its ſtation, and left the brigade ſhortly after the retreat began.</p>
               <p>Q. By whoſe orders did the party go into town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the commanding officer with them?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay; I being in the front of the brigade moved on; the troops being formed in files, they extended to a great length. Some time after the troops were formed in files, Colonel Elbert left us, as I underſtood afterwards, to look for a paſs over M'Gilvray's creek. I arrived at the mouth of the creek with about eighty of the front of the column; for want of orders I ſtaid ſome time there, when a ſuperior officer hoiſted the flag, and ſurrendered the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the officer that ſurrendered the party?</p>
               <p>A. Major John Haberſham.</p>
               <p>Q. What number did your brigade conſiſt of?</p>
               <p>A. I can't certainly tell, I believe upwards of 300.</p>
               <p>Q. Were only the eighty men you mention, who arrived with you at the creek, included in the ſurrender of Major Haberſham?</p>
               <p>A. The greater part of thoſe who went into town had by that time arrived at the creek, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ſurrender.</p>
               <p>Q. To what number of troops did Major Haberſham ſurrender?</p>
               <p>A. The greateſt part of the enemy's army had by that time arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee Colonel Elbert, after he left you to look for the paſs?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were the head of the brigade, what occaſioned the brigade to leave the line of march, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the diſpoſition:</p>
               <p>A. Colonel Elbert was at the head of the brigade, when they left the route pointed out in orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from the time you took up the line of march, until the time you left the route laid down in the diſpoſition, ſee General Howe, or either of his Aids, with Colonel Elbert?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When your brigade left the route, was the front of it at its proper diſtance in the general column?</p>
               <p>A. The brigade had halted to form by files; this had occaſioned the brigade to fall about 3 or 400 yards in the rear of the artillery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had General Elbert been abſent from the column from the time you took up the line of march, till you left the route laid down in the diſpoſition?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the march by files a part of the general diſpoſition given out?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the firing commence at the landing?</p>
               <p>A. About ſun-riſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017772_0005_0FA2BC42F4409A28"/>Q. by General Howe. Where was the Georgia brigade ordered to break into files?</p>
               <p>A. Nigh the burying-ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there ſome roads which led into Savanna not far from the burying-ground?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee me at that place?</p>
               <p>A. No; I ſaw you a little time before paſs the brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me ſpeak to the officers and men as I paſſed the brigade?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men in good order when I paſſed them?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me, in general terms, commend the order the troops were in?</p>
               <p>A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any troops employed to break up the ground in front of the line?</p>
               <p>A. Detachments were ſent out the night before the action for that and other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town did the troops break into?</p>
               <p>A. About the centre.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the part of the ſwamp, where the enemy croſſed to attack the militia on the right, commonly known to be paſſable?</p>
               <p>A. I had always underſtood it was impaſſable.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. What time did the firing commence on the right with the militia, under Colonel Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?</p>
               <p>A. I can't exactly tell; about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What meaſures were taken to prevent the enemy's advance from the landing, and what oppoſition was made?</p>
               <p>A. Several detachments went from the line after the enemy had landed; I do not know for what purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Are you acquainted with the ſituation of Girardeau's plantation?</p>
               <p>A. I have been there frequently, but am not perfectly acquainted with its ſituation.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a large extent of rice-fields before it, and are thoſe fields perfectly level?</p>
               <p>A. There is an extenſive plain of rice-fields before it.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide do you think it is from Girardeau's houſe to the landing-place?</p>
               <p>A. I can't really ſay; I ſhould ſuppoſe about three quarters or a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any cauſeways through that rice-field?</p>
               <p>A. There are a great number of banks paſſable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in the rice-field?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What nature of ground is the field in general?</p>
               <p>A. Wet at times, but paſſable for infantry.</p>
               <p>Q. When the retreat was ordered, what was the order of march directed?</p>
               <p>A. In one column.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they move off in that order?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. by Court. Was the road through which the column marched practicable for a larger front than a file?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; large enough for any platoon.</p>
               <p>Q by General Howe. Did the troops keep in good order while they remained in column?</p>
               <p>A. They were in perfect good order whilſt in column.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived at the creek, did you attempt to paſs it?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any action between our troops and the enemy at Springhill defile?</p>
               <p>A. I was not there; I heard a firing, which I ſuppoſed to be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then?</p>
               <p>A. Near M'Gilvray's creek.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</p>

            <div type="proceedings_of_the_day">
               <head>DECEMBER <hi>15</hi>th.</head>
               <p>The Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Nicholas White produced to the Court a general order, appointing him to act as Judge Advocate, <hi>vice</hi> Captain Walker, whoſe indiſpoſition obliged him to retire, after which he was ſworn.</p>
               <p>Major Lucas's teſtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Why did you not paſs the creek?</p>
               <p>A. For want of orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from the enemy, when a priſoner, by what means they diſcovered the paſs on my right?</p>
               <p>A. I heard, when among them, it reported, that a Negroe had diſcovered to the commanding officer the defile by which they paſſed the ſwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. by Court. Whether, from your knowledge of the rice-fields near Mr. Girardeau's houſe, was it eaſy to overflow them with water?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Could you have croſſed the creek with your party, had you been ordered to do it?</p>
               <p>A. I could have croſſed myſelf by ſwimming, and ſuch of my party as could ſwim, with the loſs of our arms and accoutrements. On my arrival at the creek I met with Captain Day, of the Georgia line, who was then taking off his boots on purpoſe to croſs the creek; I aſked him if he had ſeen the commanding officer; he ſaid he had not, but that I was his commanding officer, and would act as I thought proper; on which he put on his boots and joined me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017772_0006_0FA2BC4614C15AC0"/>Q. Was it before, or upon the retreat, that the damage was done to the Georgia brigade by the enemy's artillery?</p>
               <p>A. Upon the retreat.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned to Thurſday morning, ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Wereat being under a neceſſity of leaving the city of Philadelphia, the Judge Advocate, on behalf of the proſecution, and Major General Howe in his own right, and by direction of the General Court-Martial, agreed to take his depoſition before one of the Juſtices of the Peace for the city of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The Judge Advocate having aſked Mr. Wereat the different queſtions propoſed by the Delegates of the State of Georgia, and he anſwering them in the negative, being a private citizen, the Judge Advocate did not think it neceſſary to aſk Mr. Wereat any further queſtions on behalf of the proſecution. Then the following queſtions were put by General Howe:</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that the inhabitants of the town were adviſed by me to remove their effects, for fear of accident?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was hinted to the inhabitants to provide againſt the worſt by removing their effects; that many did remove part of their property, and more would have done ſo, could they have procured boats and carriages for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the moraſs below Tatnall's gate, in front of the poſition of the troops on the 29th of December, and the ground on the other ſide of it?</p>
               <p>A. I am well acquainted with the road leading from Savanna by Tatnall's to the place where the enemy landed. Some diſtance below Tatnall's gate there is a cauſeway through a moraſs, or very boggy ſwamp, which I believe is not paſſable for a footman above the cauſeway, and but with difficulty below it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with that part of the ſwamp where the enemy paſſed on my right, and if you are, pleaſe to deſcribe it?</p>
               <p>A. I knew nothing of the ſwamp by which the enemy paſſed at that time, but have been through it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſince. It was not wide, but a thicket, and boggy. The French, at the ſiege of Savanna, made it paſſable, by laying poles acroſs it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the landing places above and below my poſition at Fair-Lawn, and is there any approach by Haner's mill, and if there is, where does it come into the town?</p>
               <p>A. There were a variety of landing-places, both above and below the place of the enemy's landing at Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardeau's; namely, Coſtin's Bluff, Half-moon Bluff, Mulbryne's and Thunderbolt, below, the former called three, and the latter five miles from Savanna by land, and may be ſomething more. Above, and by way of the Back river, there are Rae's and M'Gilvray's landings, the former five, and the latter two miles by land from Savanna, and five intermediate landing-places between them. All theſe landings, both above and below, are on high land, with roads leading from them towards Savanna. There is a road that goes round near Haner's mill, and comes in by the barracks. It was a very good one in September and October 1779.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the extent of the rice-field between Girardeau's houſe and the river; are there any cauſeways leading through it to the high land, beſide that leading directly to the houſe, and was the rice-field itſelf paſſable for infantry or not?</p>
               <p>A. The diſtance from Girardeau's houſe on the high land to the river I believe to be about half a mile, perhaps a little more. I believe there were other banks, beſide the main one, that led directly from the landing to the houſe. The field was extenſive, and the effects of the north-weſterly winds, that prevailed for ſeveral days before the approach of the enemy, kept the tides low, and I believe made the rice-field paſſable for infantry any where but acroſs creeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the rice-field, about the 29th December, have been eaſily overflown, and would or would not the ſluices, if they had been overflown, been under the command of the cannon of the enemy's ſhipping?</p>
               <p>A. This queſtion is anſwered in part by the preceding anſwer. The weſterly winds always make low tides, and there is no other way of flowing the fields, had the dams and ſluices been in good order, which I have reaſon to believe was not the caſe; but if they were, the enemy had the abſolute command of them by their veſſel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Governor of Georgia conteſt the command with me until after my taking poſition near Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall's houſe?</p>
               <p>A. The Governor (Houſton) of Georgia did contend for the command, and relinquiſhed it (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and believed) after the enemy appeared in the river, and only a day or two before they landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops halted at Treutlan's plantation, the bridges between that and Savanna preſerved, and were any parties ſent down the country for that purpoſe?</p>
               <p>A. I well remember the halt at Treutlan's about 36 miles above Savanna, either two or three nights, and one night at a plantation about a mile diſtant from Treutlan's, to the beſt of my recollection. The bridges were not taken up, and I remember to have heard General Howe ſay, that he would not put it out of the power of the inhabitants to remove; and from what he ſaid, I believe the ſecurity of the inhabitants and their property was the reaſon that the bridges were not deſtroyed, and I know that much property and ſome of the inhabitants were ſecured by this precaution. I alſo remember that a party of horſe was ſent to Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer-bridge, as I underſtood, to guard that paſs, and give notice of the approach of the enemy.</p>

Howe and the Judge Advocate conſented.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Judge Advocate. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was in the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a private on horſe-back, for the purpoſe of reconnoitering.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ſteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing, commonly called Brewton's plantations.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the oppoſition that was made to their landing?</p>
               <p>A. No; I heard there was a party of men there that fired upon them, and killed two or three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and what diſtance was it from the place of landing?</p>
               <p>A. At a plantation called Fair-Lawn, about a mile from Savanna, and about a mile and a quarter from the place of landing by the main road, and about three quarters of a mile upon a ſtrait line acroſs the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. I was told they landed from 2500 to 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they land at any other place?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you poſted that day?</p>
               <p>A. In the fore part of the day, as I was on horſe-back, I was ordered out to reconnoitre, and at the time of action I was with the militia, on the right of the continentals about three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay exactly; but from information, there were ſeveral, both above and below, where they might have landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any ſteps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at thoſe places?</p>
               <p>A. I was one of a party of mounted militia that was ſent down to a place called the Oyſter-houſe, upon Auguſtine creek, to watch the motions of the enemy, where we remained one night.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was known that the enemy had landed, what meaſures were taken to aſcertain their numbers, and to oppoſe them?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know what meaſures were taken to aſcertain their numbers; but as I was returning from the Oyſter-houſe, I met Colonel M'Intoſh, with a party of men, poſted about half a mile from where the enemy landed, and about three quarters of a mile from the main army.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where the enemy landed known in time, and was it defenſible?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know whether it was known in time or not, and can't ſay whether it was defenſible or not, having never been on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force was ſtationed there, and the reſiſtance made?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the poſition of the army the beſt poſſible to have been taken for the defence of the town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay, not being acquainted with military affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the paſſes leading indirectly to the town ſecured?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They came through a ſwamp oppoſite to where the militia was poſted, and on their diſcovering the militia they immediately formed, to the number of about 300, and ruſhed on, and there was little or no reſiſtance made by the militia when they broke and diſperſed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of our troops were taken, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I was informed there were 300 priſoners taken, and the reaſon of it was, they had gone below the paſs at Spring-hill, and could not croſs M'Gilvray's creek.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cannon and what ſtores were loſt?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſay.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army croſs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops at Auguſta and Sunbury ordered to leave the State, and by whoſe orders?</p>
               <p>A. On the night of the 29th of December I met an officer of the rank of Captain, I think his name was Moſeby, who informed me that he was going with orders to the commanding officer at Sunbury to evacuate that poſt, by order of General Howe.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Were you with the militia poſted on the right, to oppoſe the paſſage of the enemy through the ſwamp on the 29th of December?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Colonel Walton?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee him at the poſt where the enemy croſſed the ſwamp, or any where in the field in the courſe of that day?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect that I did, except in the fore part of the day, before the militia took poſt at the ſwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. When the militia broke, had the enemy fired on them?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they quit the field?</p>
               <p>A. In a very diſorderly and irregular manner, and with the greateſt expedition</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017772_0008_0FA2BC47896FE4C0"/>Q. Do you know of any orders given by Colonel Walton before or at the advance of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any parties ſent from Treutlan's plantation to guard the bridges between that and Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I believe there was a party ſent to guard one bridge between Ebenezer and Treutlan's plantation.</p>

               <p>Colonel Nicola, Majors Olney and Rochefontaine ſworn in as Members, <hi>vice</hi> Colonels Humpton, Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan and Major Burnet, whoſe duty obliges them to leave this city.</p>
               <p>Colonel George Walton ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Were you in the American army in Georgia, at the time the Britiſh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act, and under whoſe command did you conceive yourſelf to be?</p>
               <p>A. As a ſenior Colonel of the militia of the State, I was under the immediate command of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor until the 24th of December, 1778, on which day the Governor, by public orders, relinquiſhed the command to Major General Howe, and ordered the militia to receive and obey his orders; which as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Commandant of the militia I did, altho' the Governor iſſued orders to the militia afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long, previous to the invaſion of Georgia, General Howe received intelligence of the deſigns of the enemy, and what ſteps were taken by him in conſequence?</p>
               <p>A. Some time about the middle of November, or a few days later, in the year 1778, part of the Britiſh troops from Eaſt Florida arrived at Sunbury by way of Colonel's iſland, while another penetrated the State by land. They evidently expected to have co-operated with a northern force, which not having arrived, they ſoon retreated. About the ſame time, or a few days after, a tranſport veſſel put into Tybee, which had been ſeparated from a fleet convoying troops of the enemy from New-York, under the conduct of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Campbell; but this veſſel alſo finding that fleet not arrived, again put to ſea, not, however, until ſhe had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a man to deſert to us. This man gave a particular and circumſtantial account of the fleet and troops coming from New-York, and was generally believed. As a proof, it was made the foundation of an act of the Governor and Council, appointing Dr. Hall and myſelf to go to General Lincolt, who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived or expected at Charleſtown, in order to communicate this intelligence, as well as the general condition of the State. General Howe being in South-Carolina, and advices of this having been tranſmitted to that State, I take it for granted that he had the information as early as others; but when, or by whom he received it, is impoſſible for me to tell, and what ſteps were taken by him in conſequence. I cannot aſcertain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the day on which General Howe arrived at Savanna. It did not appear that he was expected, as it was underſtood, by the arrival of the Georgia delegates from Congreſs, that he had been recalled from his command in that department, and Major General Lincoln appointed to it. He, however, did come, reaſſumed the command, and gave aſſurances that he would defend the town, and that there was little danger. The Carolina troop; which came ſome time after united with the troops of Georgia, and an encampment formed in a line, leading from near Tatnall's houſe towards the fort at the Truſtees gardens. And here the army lay until the afternoon of the 29th December, when the enemy made their attack. During this time, General Howe went ſeveral times to reconnoitre Girardeau's hill, Cauſtin's Bluff, and the banks of Auguſtine creek, lower down. I was with him more than once, and generally underſtood that it was his opinion that the enemy would land at Cauſtin's Bluff, on account of the landing being good, and approachable by water two ways.</p>
               <p>A large wood, which lies between that and the town, I underſtood was to have been cut down to obſtruct the enemy's progreſs by that route; but it was never done.</p>
               <p>On the 28th December, in the afternoon, the enemy's veſſels ſailed up the Savanna river, conſiderably above the entrance of Auguſtine creek, which looked as if the landing was intended to be higher up; and in the evening, ſome time before ſun-ſet, the Vigilante with heavy metal, and ſome other veſſels, caſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor oppoſite Girardeau's cauſeway, which operated as a general demonſtration of their intention to land there. As the ſun was ſetting. I accompanied General Howe and the principal officers of the army down to the Bluff oppoſite. Upon that occaſion I underſtood that it was judged that the enemy would land there, and that works were to be thrown up in the night, and the cauſeway defended, but it was not done. The only force ſent there, I underſtood, was a few men in the nature of a picquet. After we returned from the Bluff, I went to the militia which were at the fort, and preſently afterwards received orders from one of General Howe's family (Major Grimkie I believe) to keep the militia upon the ground where they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til morning, and then to move them and take poſt to the left of the Georgia brigade, commanded by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Elbert; but in the morning I received orders (but whether from the ſame Aid or not I do not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) to remove back in the common and wait further orders, for that the balls from the enemy's veſſels fell frequently on Elbert's left, and the militia would be expoſed. As the morning of the 29th opened, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ſeen to move from their veſſels in boats, and to land at the lower end of the cauſeway; and yet no alteration, that I know of or believe, took place in the arrangement and poſition of the American army.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017772_0009_0FA2BC48367FF338"/>
The enemy marched along a narrow cauſeway, upwards of half a mile in length, with a deep ditch on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, and in fight of the army, without any other oppoſition than what was made by the ſmall corps or picquet I have mentioned. They aſcended a ſteep bluff, and took poſſeſſion of the higheſt grounds about Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanna, and there deliberately formed their army. Being ignorant of what was really intended to be done, and tired with the ſuſpenſe in which I had ſo long remained, ſome time in the afternoon I took Colonels Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane and Martin, who had engaged to act with me that day, down upon the bluff on the left of the army, with a view to obſerve the motions of the enemy, who began to make ſome tittle parade on the rice-fields, as though an attempt was deſigned upon our left by way of the fort. I inſtantly formed the conjecture that it was a deception, and that they would attempt our right by the way of the paſs to Milledge's old field, and I immediately determined to order the militia that way, and mentioned it to them, and ſaid that I would then go to General Howe, let him know what I had done, and my fears of the deſigns of the enemy. I preſently found the General at the right of the army, and immediately aſked him if he was not afraid that the light troops of the enemy would get round upon our right? he told me that he was not, for that he had fortified the only paſs below Tatnall's houſe. I aſked him where that work was? and he pointed to the place. I told him that the enemy would not attempt to croſs the ſwamp there; that there was a very eaſy dry paſs lower down, and more convenient for the enemy. He ſaid I was ſurely miſtaken, and deſired me to go and look at the work he had cauſed to be thrown up. I rode down, examined it, and returned to the General, repeating what I had firſt ſaid; and ſeeing that he had confidence that this work had been thrown up at the proper place, the more certainly to convince him, I made uſe of the following expreſſions, or words to the like purpoſe:
<q>General, in order that you may be convinced that what I ſay to you is true, I aſſert to you, upon my honor, that before the war I have frequently croſſed the paſs I mean in a chair, with young ladies, picking jeſſamines.</q>
This had the deſired effect; he appeared convinced, aſked me where my regiment was; I told him I had moved it to the right; he thanked and deſired me to go and reconnoitre the paſs I had mentioned. I inſtantly went off, and as I entered the ſwamp along that paſs, I perceived the Britiſh light infantry hopping over the little difficulties with great agility. I was perceived, but not fired at. Foreſeeing that the enemy would be ſoon round, I rode full ſpeed with the intelligence to the ground where the militia horſe were poſted, and ſent it to General Howe (but by whom I do not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I believe there were ſeveral that rode off with it) and followed immediately after myſelf, and reported to the General himſelf, that the enemy were in force on our right. I was ordered to the militia, in the front of which, at about 70 or 80 yards, the enemy formed the line of two deep, in numbers, as appeared then and ſince, about 350. Once or twice a field piece had already been diſcharged at the enemy, and ſome execution done, when Colonel Marbury rode up and told me, that General Howe ordered me to attack the light infantry immediately. I told him the field-piece was already directed againſt them, and, pointing to the ſmallneſs of my numbers, which was then under 100 men, and at the time in ſome little confuſion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I beg you to give my compliments to the General, and aſſure him that I will do every thing in my power; but I do moſt earneſtly entreat that he will either wheel one of the brigade's round, or only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me with a ſingle company of continental troops, to countenance the militia. He went off, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the enemy in my front opened their line, and commenced a heavy fire of muſketry upon my ſmall corps, which obliged it to retire, and which it did in ſafety, ſave thoſe killed or maimed upon the field. Having a thigh broke in the action, I took the reſolution of endeavouring to get into town, and croſſed the General in his retreat, the whole army having been removed from their field poſition without waiting the attack of Colonel Campbell, except artillery, or turning the right, and attacking the light infantry under Sir James Baird.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walton's teſtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. From all the information which had been received, it appeared that the 71ſt Britiſh regiment and Delancey's brigade of American recruits were part of the enemy's army, by which it was concluded by every body that they were in force. From the fort where the militia were in the dawn of the morning of the 29th, the enemy's light infantry were plainly ſeen to land at the lower end of the cauſeway, and to march up and take poſt at the Bluff, where the ſmall number of troops or picquet was poſted. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned what their numbers were. I did not perceive that any more troops were landed until they gained that poſt, and then the debarkation continued until the invading army was compleated, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about two o'clock in the afternoon, to the beſt of my recollection. I do not know their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but believe them to have been 2000 at leaſt. I underſtood, that before they advanced the enemy had been reconnoitered by Major Moore, and that he reported to the General that there were upwards of 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compoſition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. The army under the command of Major General Howe was compoſed of a brigade of continental troops from South-Carolina, the Georgia brigade, and the militia under my command. The number of either of the brigades I do not know, and by conſequence neither their amount when combined; but I believe the whole together were leſs than 1000 men, including Colonel Roberts's artillery, which I forgot to mention.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. I have already mentioned, that I had formed the conjecture ſome time in the afternoon of that day, that the enemy intended to endeavour to gain our right by Milledge's paſs; and of courſe I expected that the main body would approach our line by the road leading from Savanna to the Governor's gate, as a brigade of ours was poſted on either ſide of that road, while the artillery was placed in its centre. When the light infantry had gained the paſs on the right, and had received a fire from the field piece with me,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017772_0010_0FA2BC48F4261130"/>
it appeared that the enemy's artillery, taking this for the ſignal, was advanced, and began to play at long ſhot upon our line, which I underſtood was done by our artillery at the ſame time. No doubt the infantry was alſo advancing, but not being preſent, I could not ſee them. I always underſtood, however, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the retreat was ordered and in execution before they came within fighting diſtance.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. That part of the army with me retreated towards the Spring-hill and Sheftall's tan-yard; but being unable to proceed with them, I turned off towards town. I underſtood they retreated by thoſe routes. About midway from the ſouth-weſt corner of the town and the Spring-hill, being faint, I was taken from my horſe. After recovering, which was almoſt immediately, I perceived ſcattered troops and citizens out of the town running and riding in great diſorder towards that hill. The muſket-bullets then began to reach the place where I lay, but ſeemed to be ſpent. Before I was taken down, one of General Howe's Aids (Captain Turner) paſſed me, going towards the hill; and preſently after the General himſelf. Major Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie and ſome others came up. I then learned that the day was wholly unfortunate. Having found myſelf better, and the light infantry which had driven the militia from their ground having puſhed in towards the town, with an evident view to cut off the rear of our army, I deſired the General to leave me, and was put again upon my horſe, and proceeded as faſt as poſſible to Mr. Watts's, in Yamacraw. Juſt as I got there, I ſaw a number of the Georgia troops running along the ſtreet towards Nunez's creek in the like confuſion. I did then ſuppoſe that ſome mode of croſſing it had been eſtabliſhed, as it was a work of ſcarce an hour, by throwing over it a piece of ſcantling; but I underſtood ſoon afterwards that many of them were captured upon its banks, it not having been then, or indeed at any other time fordable.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment. Major Dexter ſworn as a Member, in the room of Major Moore, whoſe indiſpoſition obliged him to retire.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walton's teſtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. What wat the loſs in men, cannon and ſtores, and by what means were they loſt?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know particularly the loſs in either. I have ſeen a return made by each of the Brigades, the amount of both was ſomewhere about 300, tho' I do not exactly recollect; they were chiefly loſt by capture. The army were kept with an apparent view of fighting the enemy; but the enemy having got in the rear of the right of the line before any attack was made in front, the continental line was ordered to retreat. Before it was effected, the enemy on our right defeated the militia under my command, and part of them puſhed in upon their flank. I afterwards ſaw the rear broken and retreating towards Nunez's, as I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. I believe that moſt of the cannon in the town and in the field were loſt; how many were ſaved I cannot tell, being a priſoner. The one with the militia was abandoned upon being overpowered by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. With regard to thoſe in the town, as well as the ſtores in general, they appeared to me to have been loſt by the jealouſies and a ſupineneſs which characterize and tincture the tranſactions of that time. Mutual applications, complaints and reproaches, between the Governor of the State and the General, took place of real exertion, and the cannon and ſtores were not removed; in conſequence fell into the enemy's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army croſs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Auguſta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. No; I do not poſitively.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. In the year 1773, Government ordered a return of the men to be made from the age of 16 to 60, as I recollect, and by that return it appears that there were two thouſand five or ſix hundred men, the preciſe number I do not recollect. Since that return was made, there was a conſiderable augmentation of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to the weſtward, but I do not believe they made up for the number of fugitive tories that ſought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the enemy from the lower country. So that I ſuppoſe that at that day the number of fighting men might be nearly equal with that returned in 1773, or not ſo much.</p>
               <p>Q. When the invaſion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was requeſted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017772_0011_0FA2BC4B9A7BA1F0"/>Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. The proſpect of loſing the town and the neighbouring country, I believe, prevented many from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the army, they being employed in removing their families and property from the more ſouthern parts, except about Sunbury, as well as in the neighbourhood of Savanna; and whether thoſe from the weſtward had been called for in tim I do not know, but there were a very ſmall proportion in ſervice upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. What number were in arms with the corps at Sunbury I do not know. I had under my command at Savanna, including infantry, artillery and the company of horſe, which I did not include in my former eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſomething above 100 men; the preciſe number I cannot aſcertain. I believe another cauſe why the militia was backward upon that occaſion was, the diſputes already ſuggeſted between the Governor and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the army provided with tools to erect the works propoſed at Girardeau's Bluff?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You mention your party being in confuſion at the time you were ordered to attack the Britiſh light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry. What was the occaſion of that confuſion?</p>
               <p>A. The ſuperior numbers of the enemy who were drawn up in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any previous diſpoſitions made by General Howe in caſe of retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, I never received any orders to retreat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee the General's orders iſſued previous to the affair of the 29th?</p>
               <p>A. I did not; the only general order I ſaw was that putting the militia in general orders <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental command, to the beſt of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Milledge's paſs from the poſt then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</p>
               <p>A. I have already ſaid that the head of the ſecond branch was about a mile diſtant from town, and from thence about half a mile to the paſs; ſo that the paſs being about a mile and an half from town, in the circuit of the path, and the poſition of General Howe's main body being below the town, the circuit would be continued about one quarter of a mile farther; therefore, to the beſt of my judgment, the diſtance was about one mile and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the general face of the country over which the enemy paſſed to make their attack?</p>
               <p>A. In the front of the American line lay a bed or row of ſprings, which formed to the leſt a gut extending to the river, whilſt thoſe which lay more to the right make a marſh in the oppoſite direction. Immediately below Tatnall's fence, it aſſumes the appearance of a ſwamp (by which I mean low, watry and miry ground, largely wooded and thickly underbruſhed.) At the commencement of this ſwamp, that is a little below Tatnall's fence, was the ſmall work which the General had cauſed to be thrown up on his right, and which, by his deſire, I examined. To the right of that work, about half a mile, to the beſt of my judgment, though I never traverſed it in a direct line, is the paſs acroſs the ſwamp to Milledge's old field. The dull way or path which leads from town to this paſs begins its courſe about oppoſite the burying-ground, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a ſouthern direction until it gains the head of a ſecond marſhy branch, about one mile diſtant from town, to the beſt of my judgment. It then turns down that branch in a north-eaſt direction to the paſs, in diſtance about half a mile, to the beſt of my judgment. From the other, or eaſtern ſide, to the Governor's gate, is about three quarters of a mile, or not quite ſo much, at which place the path uſed to enter the great road; but latterly, and before that day, moſt of the old fields, and all the ground lying between that and the gate, had been encloſed and under cultivation. At this croſſing-place, the waters appear to me to have forced themſelves into a ſingle bed, and to form a kind of running branch of creek, over which there appears to have been once a wooden bridge; but ſince my remembrance, there were only two or three ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or logs acroſs. On my way from reporting to the General, and before I got quite up to my command, Colonel William M'Intoſh, who commanded the horſe that day, cried out that the enemy were croſſing the branch, which I that moment perceived. It was the branch neareſt to town, and the place they croſſed ſome little diſtance below the path-way, ſay about 100 or 150 yards. I take it, they ſtept over upon roots and high tufts, which are common in the marſhy branches of that country. Upon their croſſing this branch, I neither went or ſent to the General, becauſe, from the intelligence I had already given, it was an event he muſt have expected, and that it would have been preſently announced by firing.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever mention to General Howe Milledge's paſs previous to the day of action?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember to have mentioned it to him until the time I have already mentioned. The firſt object was to guard againſt the enemy's landing, which occupied my mind; and after they had landed at Girardeau's, I was not with the General until the time I have mentioned, as I recollect. When I went down, in the anxiety I have heretofore related, the firſt enquiry was reſpecting that paſs.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the reaſons that prevented your ſeeing the general orders on the day of attack?</p>
               <p>A. I know of no particular reaſon; the militia had but lately been put under continental command, and I was not in the practice of going for orders, nor were they ſent to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the ſhores above Nunez's creek were equally practicable for the enemy to land as thoſe below?</p>
               <p>A. The ſhores or bluffs above Nunez's creek are not ſo ſteep and abrupt as the hill at Girardeau's; but the navigation to them is much more difficult. Muſgrove's or Nunez's creek was more difficult to croſs by an enemy, than the obſtruction below the town.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walton's teſtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the town of Savanna fortified in any degree?</p>
               <p>A. The town itſelf was not fortified. At the north-eaſt point of the Truſtees gardens, a fort had been ſome conſiderable time before erected, and ſome pieces of 18 pound cannon and others of leſs ſize planted in it, for the evident defence of the town. I do not recollect any other works, except thoſe ſlightly thrown up in the field upon that occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017772_0012_0FA2BC4CAA9DF150"/>Q. When General Howe gave aſſurance of defending the town, did you underſtand from him upon what principles he meant to defend it?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the principles upon which the defence of the town was undertaken, in any military point of view. I heard General Howe ſay, in preſence of a number of the inhabitants of the town, on the 23th or 26th preceding the attack, I forget which, that the enemy's army was compoſed of raw boys from the Highlands and of Delancey's green-coats, who would not fight, and that he did not care if they were double the number.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Do you know at what time the Governor of Georgia informed me that the militia was under my command?</p>
               <p>A. The orders by which the militia were put under continental command were dated the 24th December, and the next day, to the beſt of my recollection, the militia were put in general orders; hence I conclude that the General muſt have been informed the evening of the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body of militia join you, beſides thoſe of your own regiment?</p>
               <p>A. About 20 men, a few more or leſs, I cannot recollect, came down from the neighbourhood of Ebene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer; but whether they were with me on the day of attack or not I forget. Some gentlemen from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were volunteers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed with Dr. Hall to South-Carolina, agreeable to the reſolution of the Governor and Council.</p>
               <p>A. I did not. Dr. Hall was not at firſt ready, and when he was, I deſired him to proceed; that having much better horſes, I could go much faſter: The evening preceding the day I was to have ſet out, an expreſs arrived from Skidaway, announcing the arrival of a fleet upon the coaſt. I then deemed it improper to leave my regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When General Provoſt firſt penetrated the State of Georgia with troops, did I repair to that State?</p>
               <p>A. I have already mentioned that General Howe was in South-Carolina, and expected to go to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When the troops from Eaſt-Florida firſt came into the State, neither the General nor General Elbert was in the State. He came, as I now recollect, ſoon after the retreat of the enemy from purſuing our troops to Ogechee hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I with the troops at the ſouth ſide of Ogechee river, when you were there with the militia?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and your party returned, did you not leave me at that place?</p>
               <p>A. I remember that the militia under my command did duty upon the hill at Ogechee with the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal troops under the command of Major General Howe, and I believe when they returned the army was left upon that ground.</p>
               <p>Q. After the report ſuppoſed to be from a deſerter, was a body of Carolina militia, under the command of Colonel Bull, marched to Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I remember that Colonel Bull came over into Georgia with a body of South-Carolina militia; but I do not recollect the particular time, or upon whoſe application they came over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were a detachment of Carolina continental infantry and artillery marched into Georgia, ſubſequent to a report of an intended invaſion, and previous to the invaſion?</p>
               <p>A. With regard to the firſt, I do not know when any continental artillery or infantry were marched into Georgia, ſubſequent to the report of an invaſion; previous to the attack both infantry and artillery arrived. There might have been a detachment there ſooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any conſiderable time elapſe after a report made by the deſerter, without any further intelligence of an invaſion?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot aſcertain the preciſe time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other information received by the State of an invaſion, beſides that of the deſerter?</p>
               <p>A. At this diſtance of time I do not recollect what particular informations were received. The invaſion was generally expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Governor and Council receive information from any perſon of the tranſport veſſel, except from the deſerter already mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the nature of the information received by the Governor and Council, nor from whom, not having been a member.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the apprehenſions of an invaſion in a great meaſure ſubſiding?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know or believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the Carolina militia, after remaining ſome few days at the barracks, diſmiſſed?</p>
               <p>A. I was chiefly out of town about that time, and do not know whether or by whom they were diſmiſſed. They went ſoon away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any regiments of militia of the State of Georgia, ſubſequent to the report of an invaſion, called forth by the State, and kept embodied?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect that I knew what Government did about that time as to ordering the militia to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, but there was none in actual ſervice, except parts of my regiment occaſionally.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were in the Aſſembly, did you ſee any official letters of mine to the Legiſlature of the State, pointing out the weakneſs of it, and preſſing upon them the neceſſity of fortifying it?</p>
               <p>A. I have ſeen ſeveral letters of the General to the Legiſlature of that State, without being able to advert to their particular objects; I believe one was adviſing fortifications.</p>
               <p>Q. After General Prevoſt retreated, previous to the arrival of Colonel Campbell, have you any knowledge of my applying to the Governor for hands, tools, and other materials for fortifying the State?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect to have had any particular knowledge of particular applications, but I verily believe that applications were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the Negroe you met acted as a guide to the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I looked upon him to be in the ſervice of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not various landing-places above the town of Savanna, which were acceſſible by the back river?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017772_0013_0FA2BC4CBB805490"/>A. I have already ſaid, or meant to ſay, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of the horſe remain with the militia on the right that day?</p>
               <p>A. When the enemy croſſed the branch and formed, I aſked for the horſe, and was told by Colonel M'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toſh that they had all been ſent different ways by the General. I had none at that time as I ſaw or recollect, except Colonel M'Intoſh and Mr. O'Brian.</p>

               <head>JANUARY <hi>10</hi>th.</head>
               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major Benjamin Porter ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Britiſh troops under the command of Colonel Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Major in the Georgia line previous to the invaſion, and on the 29th of December acted as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer Aid with General Howe, having reſigned my commiſſion in the line five or ſix weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. What ſteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. The troops were drawn up on a piece of ground called Fair-Lawn, nearly as ſome gentlemen have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented who were examined before me, and ſome guards poſted between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I believe one at the landing, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compoſition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. The number I do not certainly know, but I believe they were about 600, excluſive of the militia; they conſiſted of the Georgia and South-Carolina troops.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy firſt approached in front of our troops, but very little reſiſtance was made, as the troops retreated immediately after it was known the enemy were gaining our right.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The army retreated immediately after I reported to General Howe that the enemy were gaining our right, and in column, the South-Carolina in front, the artillery in the centre, and the Georgia in the rear.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the loſs in men, cannon and ſtores, and by what means were they loſt?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. When, where and in what manner did the army croſs Savanna river?</p>
               <p>A. The army croſſed Savanna river at the Siſters a few days after the 29th in boats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Auguſta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confuſion in the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. Not the leaſt confuſion among the continental troops as long as I ſtaid with them, having left them near the burying-ground, at 3 or 400 yards from where the retreat commenced, and went into Savanna to diſpatch my ſervant with my baggage, whom I ordered to hold himſelf in readineſs.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What was the firſt duty you were ſent upon, after being an extra Aid to me?</p>
               <p>A. To reconnoitre the enemy and the ground between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. What guards were between the troops at Fair-Lawn and the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. There was one on the road leading to Girardeau's houſe, another in a wood ſtill nearer to it, and I heard of and believe there was another at the landing before mentioned, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the diſtance from the poſition at Fair-Lawn to the place where the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. About a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the diſtance between Girardeau's houſe and the landing place, and what is the nature of the ground?</p>
               <p>A. I ſuppoſe it may be about 500 yards from the landing place to Girardeau's houſe; there was a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way leading directly from the landing to the houſe; there were ſeveral ditches alſo leading thro' a rice-field different ways; the dirt thrown out of them made banks which appeared dry enough to walk on; ſo appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the field to be generally, tho' I was not on the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy's ſhipping command the landing-place?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I think effectually.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the moraſs in front of our poſition at Fair-Lawn, what is the nature of it, and of the ground on each ſide of it?</p>
               <p>A. I think I am acquainted with the nature of the ground, as I croſſed the creek in front of our troops that were drawn up near the moraſs, which appeared to me deep, and impracticable for troops to croſs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. After the bridge was taken up, I found difficulty in getting my horſe over, tho' planks were laid down for that purpoſe. The moraſs on each ſide of the creek, eſpecially on the ſide of Fair-Lawn, appeared very boggy, and I think impaſſable for troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the moraſs directly in our front be ſeen by perſons approaching it until they came near it?</p>
               <p>A. I think not, as the moraſs was wide, the deſcent ſudden, and at a diſtance appeared like a plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from any converſation that paſſed between us, or from any other circumſtance, underſtand whether or not I was acquainted with the paſs of which the enemy availed themſelves?</p>
               <p>A. I thought you were acquainted with the ground from your ſending me ſeveral times to viſit it, and from your ſeeming apprehenſive of danger, ſhould the enemy paſs that way. I don't know certainly to this minute where the enemy did paſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017772_0014_0FA2BC4D8FE67710"/>Q. Did I or did I not expreſs to you my apprehenſion of the enemy paſſing on my right, and deſired you and Major Deheyſer alternately to watch them cloſely?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any particular converſation on that ſubject, but well remember you ſent Major Dehey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer and myſelf to examine the ground, which we did, and reported to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any horſe poſted that way?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; there was a party of volunteer horſe poſted in a wood, near the ſwamp on our right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any parties patrole on our right?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I ſaw ſome horſemen riding through the wood between where the party of horſe was and the ſwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. When I was informed that the enemy was gaining my right, what ſteps were taken?</p>
               <p>A. I remember to have informed General Howe the enemy had paſſed the ſwamp on our right, when he ordered a retreat, and ſent me to take off a picquet which was poſted on our right, and direct the officer to take the neareſt route on the flanks of our army to Spring-hill defile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the orders for retreat given previous to any firing, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. Previous to any firing, except from Colonel Roberts's artillery, at a party of the enemy directly in front, as well as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee me in the retreat, and what were your obſervations?</p>
               <p>A. I ſaw you on the flanks of the army, and you appeared to be attentive to the troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you join me after you had been ſent with orders to the picquet on the right?</p>
               <p>A. I joined you on the plain near the burying-ground, and as well as I recollect there was a road that led into Savanna.</p>
               <p>Q. In what order were the troops at that time?</p>
               <p>A. They were marching in column, and appeared to be in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. By what way did you make your retreat from the town of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. After being detained ſome time enquiring for my ſervant, I retreated over M'Gilvray's creek, ſome diſtance below the Spring-hill defile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it paſſable for troops, or otherwiſe?</p>
               <p>A. It was by no means paſſable for troops in order, though they might have eſcaped that way, as I got over with ſome difficulty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any heavy firing on the troops, when you left them to go into Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not retreat by the Spring-hill defile?</p>
               <p>A. I made an attempt to go that way, but hearing a ſmart fire, which appeared to be at that place, I was induced to belive the enemy had taken poſſeſſion, and that I was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the country in the vicinity of Savanna abound with waggons and teams?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any militia arriving at Savanna from South-Carolina?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; a party commanded by Colonel Bull.</p>
               <p>Q by General Howe. Did you ſee me riding to the right of the army, previous to the action of 29th December?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I ſaw you once or twice in the courſe of the day through a wood on the right of the army, and on the ſame ſide of the ſwamp with it.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Glaſcock ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Britiſh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As Lieutenant in the firſt regiment in the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ſteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. I only know of one detachment ſent to oppoſe the landing of the enemy, which was from the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia brigade, commanded by Lieutenant Moſeby.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. I believe about 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They advanced by the road leading through the centre of the continentals; the only oppoſition that was made, that I know of, was the firing of a few cannon, and a ſmall fluſh that was thrown up in that road that they advanced, in which were two field-pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The South Carolina brigade in front, and part of the artillery in the centre, the Georgia brigade in the rear of the whole, except a field-piece commanded by Captain Defoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confuſion in the retreat, and to what was it owing?</p>
               <p>A. There was, and it appeared to me that the confuſion was occaſioned by the enemy's cannon being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the column, and the firing of ſmall arms on our left flank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Georgia troops during the retreat ſeparate from the column?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by what cauſe, and by whoſe orders?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature, extent and conſequence of the confuſion you mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. The Georgia brigade, which I had a view of, were entirely confuſed, and the conſequence was the moſt part of them were captured.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the diſpoſitions, in caſe of a retreat, mentioned in general orders previous to the action?</p>
               <p>A. Yes they were, and we were to retreat, if diſperſed, to the road where the fork leads to M'Gilvray's houſe, as well as I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017772_0015_0FA2BC4EC1A04A50"/>Q. Was this rendezvous pointed out for the whole, or only part of the army?</p>
               <p>A. For the whole of the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the troops ordered to retreat in column?</p>
               <p>A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue in good order while the column was preſerved?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any change made in the formation, and if there was, what was it?</p>
               <p>A. The arrangement of the Georgia brigade from platoons to files was a change made by order of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elbert.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the order obſerved after that part of the column was reduced?</p>
               <p>A. Somewhat confuſed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any halt made by the Georgia brigade after they broke into files?</p>
               <p>A. The rear platoons, of courſe, were obliged to wait for thoſe advanced in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occaſion any ſpace between the two brigades?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the troops go into town?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. At what place did they go into town?</p>
               <p>A. Near the centre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they receive any orders to that purpoſe that you know of?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any detachment made from your brigade to reinforce the guard at Girardeau's landing on the 28th December?</p>
               <p>A. Only Lieutenant Moſeby's detachment, which I have already mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Do you know the reaſon of the column's being changed from platoons to files, or did you hear General Elbert give any reaſon for that manoeuvre?</p>
               <p>A. It appeared to me that the arrangement of the Georgia brigade was changed from the enemy's cannon being directed at the column, and a ſhot ſtriking near the centre, and immediately an alteration took place, but I do not recollect of ever hearing General Elbert give it as a reaſon.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What number of ſhot were fired previous to the alteration?</p>
               <p>A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Did you ſee General Howe with the Georgia brigade, after that change of diſpoſition was made?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. At what diſtance from the rear of the column do you ſuppoſe the artillery of the enemy was?</p>
               <p>A. Six or ſeven hundred yards.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Edward Lloyd being ſworn informs the Court, that on the 29th December, 1778, juſt as the enemy were approaching, he was requeſted by the Major of the regiment of militia to which he belonged to act as Serjeant-Major, and to get the men in order, but previous to that day he acted as a private, and that he knew nothing with reſpect to the general diſpoſition of the army. The Court are of opinion that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in which Lieutenant Lloyd acted on 29th December, would not admit of his knowing any matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the charges exhibited againſt General Howe, and therefore thought it unneceſſary to aſk him any further queſtions on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Mordecai Shefftal ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time that the Britiſh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was, and acted as Deputy Commiſſary General of Iſſues to the continental troops that were there, and Commiſſary General of Purchaſes and Iſſues to the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of proviſions had you on hand on or about the 29th of December, 1778?</p>
               <p>A. About 560 barrels of flour, 150 barrels of beef, 11 barrels of pork, a few barrels of bread, 12 hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheads of rum, 2 hogſheads of brandy, and a ſmall quantity of candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, on or about the 29th of December, made a return or report to General Howe of the quantity of proviſions on hand?</p>
               <p>A. On the 25th of December I reported to General Howe that I had a quantity of proviſions on hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on or previous to the 29th of December, receive any orders from General Howe to remove theſe proviſions?</p>
               <p>A. On the 25th I applied to General Howe, to know whether I ſhould remove the proviſions. He ſaid he thought there was no danger. I told him, I thought there was. He then told me, if I thought proper, I might remove them. I then told him I could put ſome of them on board a veſſel on freight. He then gave me an order for a Corporal and four privates, to impreſs Negroes to remove them from the ſtore to the veſſel. I ſet about it, and removed 78 barrels of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the flour you removed?</p>
               <p>A. It ſat off from the wharff to go up the river, but what became of it afterwards I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee any general orders reſpecting the removal of proviſions from Savanna, on or before the 29th of December?</p>
               <p>A. I never ſaw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the proviſions you have mentioned been removed ſo as to be out of the reach of the enemy, and the landing of the enemy ſo retarded as to require a longer ſtay of the army near Savanna, had you any means in that caſe to ſupply the army?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:017772_0016_0FA2BC4EF4154850"/>A. The Commiſſary of Purchaſes ſupplied me with freſh proviſions for the uſe of the army, and what quantity he had by him I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Could teams and waggons be procured in a ſhort time from the inhabitants, for the removal of the ſtores to any iſland diſtant?</p>
               <p>A. I do not think there could.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppoſing the ſtores to have been removed by water, could they have been depoſited in places inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the veſſels and boats of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. They could have been ſecured for ſome time.</p>
               <p>Q. From what authority did you hold your appointment as Commiſſary to the continental troops?</p>
               <p>A. From General Elbert, then Colonel Commandant of the troops belonging to that State.</p>
               <p>Q. When you applied to General Howe on the 25th of December, did you inform him that there was a ſufficient quantity of veſſels for the removal of proviſions?</p>
               <p>A. I told General Howe that there was a number of veſſels at the wharff, if I had authority to impreſs them.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Was the flour and beef, ſet forth in your teſtimony, all continental property?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you roll down to the landing any more than you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; on Monday, the 28th, there were 240 barrels of flour rolled down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the moſt of the crafts about town uſed by the inhabitants to remove their effects?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the Quarter-maſter to procure boats and veſſels to remove the proviſions?</p>
               <p>A. No; I know of none.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received orders to impreſs the Negroes, were you limited to any number?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the veſſel you did obtain loaded?</p>
               <p>A. No; becauſe ſhe could not have gone up the river if ſhe was loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. By whoſe orders were the 240 barrels of flour (mentioned in your anſwer to General Howe's queſtion) removed?</p>
               <p>A. By General Howe's order, and by a fatigue-party ſent by him for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they tranſported by water?</p>
               <p>A. They were not; they were left on the wharff, as the Spaniard who was to have taken them on board ſhipped his faſt and ran up the river on the appearance of the veſſels of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Captain John Budd ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Lieutenant in Colonel Roberts's regiment of artillery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ſteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. As there is ſuch a length of time elapſed, I do not recollect any particular circumſtance relative to the diſpoſitions of the army.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your poſt in the column in the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. Immediately in front of the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your poſt in the line in the time of action?</p>
               <p>A. On the right of the continentals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what period of the retreat the Georgia brigade quitted the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect at what particular period, but the firſt I obſerved of their being gone was when we wanted them to ſupport the field-piece when we arrived on the hill, where one of our horſes and driver were ſhot, which was the means of our loſing the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you advanced in front of the Georgia brigade when the army took up their line of march on the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. About twenty or thirty paces.</p>
               <p>Q. How far diſtant from the town was the hill you ſpeak of?</p>
               <p>A. About half a mile to the northward.</p>
               <p>Q. How far was the rear of the South-Carolina brigade advanced in your front at the time you halted?</p>
               <p>A. There were three field-pieces and two ammunition-waggons between the infantry and the field-piece with which I was, and we were as cloſe as we could be to the ammunition-waggon when we halted, and the front of the artillery cloſe to the rear of the South-Carolina brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your piece particularly attached to the Georgia brigade?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more field-pieces, beſide the one you mention, loſt in the action of that day?</p>
               <p>A. Not belonging to the continental troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fire your field-piece in the line, before the retreat commenced?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; we did fire four or five times with round ſhot, at the diſtance of 150 paces.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any grape or caſe ſhot?</p>
               <p>A. We had a great quantity of grape, but no caſe.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Did you ſee me in the courſe of the retreat, and where?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:017772_0017_0FA2BC50018A0718"/>A. Yes; I ſaw you ſpeaking to Colonel Roberts immediately on the right of the field-piece with which I was, about mid-way between Spring-hill defile and Fair-Lawn, when Colonel Roberts told us that it was the orders for us to go on as quick as poſſibly we could.</p>
               <p>Mr. Coſhman Pollock ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Britiſh troops under Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was in the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a private.</p>
               <p>The Court were of the ſame opinion with reſpect to Mr. Pollock, as to Mr. Lloyd.</p>
               <p>Major General Elbert ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the American army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia, and in what capacity?</p>
               <p>A. I was, and in the capacity of Colonel Commandant of the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long previous to the invaſion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the deſigns of the enemy, and what ſteps were taken by him in conſequence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know that General Howe had any previous information of the deſigns of the enemy to invade the State of Georgia. Some time about the beginning of November 1778, being in Charles-Town on bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the public, where General Howe then was, accounts were received that Colonel Provoſt, with a conſiderable force from Eaſt-Florida, had invaded that State. I immediately received the General's orders to return to Georgia, where, I think the ſecond day after my arrival, I was joined by him, who informed me that he had ordered ſome continental troops from the State of South-Carolina to our aſſiſtance, and that ſome militia of that State were aſſembling for the like purpoſe; the latter, after being ſome days in Georgia, returned. Colonel Provoſt having retreated before their arrival, part of the continentals ordered from South-Carolina were brought into Georgia, and the remainder poſted at Puryſburgh. Nearly about the time of Colonel Provoſt's invaſion, a veſſel arrived at Tybee, and after remaining a day or two ſailed again. From this veſſel we had a deſerter, who informed that ſhe was a tranſport with Britiſh troops on board, and one of a conſiderable fleet that had ſailed from New-York to invade the State. Some time the latter end of December, a fleet appeared upon the coaſt, and a few days after arrived at Tybee; upon which General Howe drew all the troops of the State and thoſe of South-Carolina before-mentioned to Savanna, except a garriſon left in the ſort at Sunbury, and Colonel Marbury's regiment poſted at Auguſta. On the 28th De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the enemy's fleet proceeded up the river Savanna, the van of which anchored nearly oppoſite Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's, where, from ſome of their movements, it was judged they would attempt to land their troops. In the evening of that day I was at the above place with General Howe and ſeveral other officers, reconnoitering the enemy. The General, on leaving the place, requeſted that I would remain and poſt a picquet he had ordered there, and deſired that I would order the officer commanding the picquet to cauſe the dam leading from the river to the hill to be cut acroſs. When the picquet arrived, I poſted them in the manner that I thought would beſt anſwer the purpoſe for which they were ſent, and gave the officer the orders I had in charge from the General. I then marked out the ground where I judged it neceſſary to throw up ſome works, and told the officer I would go to the General and try to have his party, which conſiſted of only thirty men, conſiderably reinforced, and at the ſame time obtain an order to have ſome entrenching tools ſent down. I waited upon the General, and informed him that I had every reaſon to believe that the enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to land at Girardeau's, and recommended to him to have the picquet there conſiderably reinforced, and requeſted that he would immediately order ſome entrenching tools to the place, as the party was entirely without. I am not certain, but I believe I recommended at the ſame time to the General to ſend a field-piece or two to the ſame place. His reply was, that he would conſider of it, and requeſted that I would call on him in an hour or two. On my return to the General, at about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him that the entrenching tools were ſent. With reſpect to the reinforcement, he told me that he could not ſpare more than 20 men, which he requeſted that I would go down with. I did ſo, and on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival was ſurprized to find that no tools were at the place. It being then too late to obtain them, ſo as to be of any ſervice, I told Captain Smith, who commanded the picquet, that at day-light I did not doubt but he would ſee the enemy landed, and recommended that he would reſerve his fire until they got within 50 or 60 yards, then to commence a cool, deliberate fire, and retreat up until he was either ſupported or forced from his ground. As I judged it happened, but the party were ſoon forced from the hill, when the enemy gained footing a little after day-light, and were the moſt of that day, the 29th, in full view, landing their troops and artillery, without the leaſt interruption from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. The force with which the enemy invaded the State amounted to full 3000 men. I believe they had about 2000 landed when they advanced towards us.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compoſition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. Between 5 and 600 continental troops, and a detachment of artillery with four or five field-pieces, and about 100 militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy advanced in two columns, their right along a path leading through Sir James Wright's plantation, halting in full view of us at a place called Gay's, their left down the main road leading from Girardeau's to Savanna; while we were amuſed by the firſt column in front, the latter filed by their left, along a bye-path leading through the back of Milledge's old field, and acroſs a ſwamp upon our right to an open pine barren at the back of the new barracks, where they were met by the militia under Colonel Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who, after a ſmart ſkirmiſh, were forced from their ground. I know of no other reſiſtance, except by the picquet at Girardeau's, and the firing of a few field-pieces in the front of our line that was made to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017772_0018_0FA2BC52C45E1A60"/>A. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th, the army was ordered to retire in the following order; the South-Carolina troops to retreat firſt to the Spring-hill, and there form and cover the retreat of the artilletry and Georgia troops, the latter to form ſomewhere about M'Gilvray's path, and there remain, until joined by the former. Our army was formed acroſs the road leading from Savanna to Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's, near half a mile below the town, under a hill of eaſy aſcent in an open field, with a ravine in front, Tatnall's buildings better than 100 yards on our right, and Governor Wright's barn about the ſame diſtance on our left, with a traverſe acroſs the road in our centre with two field-pieces, and a field-piece advanced in front of each wing; on our right was a ſwamp, ſome diſtance up which, at the back of Tatnall's buildings, a path led from Milledge's to town; on this path a work was thrown up, in which was poſted a detachment of continental ſoldiers, and to the right of this, up the ſame ſwamp, I underſtood the militia were to have been poſted. Our left was in ſome degree covered by a battery at ſome diſtance wide of its rear, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded part of a low rice-field not very acceſſible. As ſoon as the enemy, who were in our front, obſerved the Carolina troops go off the field and our artillery limbered, they moved briſkly forward, and commenced a ſharp cannonade on the Georgia brigade, which was formed in a cloſe column by ſections by the left, with the left in front. As ſoon as the artillery moved off the field, I faced the column to the right about, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in that order. As we croſſed the road, the enemy's artillery made ſome impreſſion on the column, notwithſtanding which it preſerved perfect good order. Juſt as we gained the ſummit of the hill, a heavy fire of muſquetry commenced towards our left, when I perceived our artillery go off on a full gallop. I moved as quick as I poſſibly could without getting into diſorder. About 100 yards before I got to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt extremity of the town, a body of the enemy, advanced to the eaſt of the new barracks, commenced a heavy fire of muſquetry on our left flank; at the ſame time obſerving the Carolina brigade beyond the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt extremity of the town, in ſome diſorder, puſhing for the Spring-hill, and a body of the enemy near that place keeping up a ſmart fire on them, I judged it too late for me to attempt that defile, as the enemy muſt be in full poſſeſſion of it before I could poſſibly reach it. In this ſituation, with the enemy in front, flank and rear, I formed the deſign of attempting to force my way up the Ogechee road, where I obſerved the enemy's line to be the weakeſt, and with this view ordered my light infantry to advance and attack the enemy on my flanks, to draw their fire while I reduced the column, and to divert their attention from my main deſign. Immediately after the order to the light infantry, as we advanced, I ordered an open column, as ſoon as I ſaw that there was a proper diſtance between the ſections, which happened juſt as we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the burying-ground. I loſt no more time than was neceſſary for the following words of command: Halt: Sections, to the left face: By files to the right wheel: March. Before I got the rear well clear of the burying-ground, the line broke about the centre, and the whole, except three or four ſections, fell up one of the ſtreets. Obſerving the few that followed me, I led them through where a ſquare of buildings had but late been burnt down, and halted before the Court-houſe door, which being a brick building, I had thought of throwing myſelf into it, but previous to taking this ſtep, I determined to conſult Colonel Harris, the next officer in command to myſelf. I called him to me, and aſked if he could recommend any place through which I could effect a retreat? he anſwered that we might get over Muſgrove's creek. I obſerved to him that it was a full tide, and that the creek could not be paſſable. He replied that there was a log, which he had been fifty times over. I replied, lead me to it, it is a happy circumſtance, we will ſave our men; and called out, Follow me, ſoldiers, and I will conduct you to a ſafe retreat. I heard the words, Follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, frequently repeated; and leſt they might not know what I intended, I kept waving my ſword over my head, and moved ſlowly on at the head of the few that yet preſerved their order, and ſent Colonel Harris back to the rear with orders to puſh them on, and deſired that he would join me in time before I got to the creek. This he did, but when we got there he could not find the log, owing I ſuppoſe to the high tide. As the only alternative, I then ordered the ſoldiers to ſwim the creek; a few obeyed my command, others alledged that they could not ſwim. The enemy, who had got poſſeſſion of the Spring-hill defile, moved down and kept a ſmart fire on us, and, rather than be taken priſoner, I ſaved myſelf by ſwimming, as did Colonel Harris. Major Grimkie, one of the General's Aids, ſwam a little above where I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the loſs in men, cannon and ſtores, and by what means were they loſt?</p>
               <p>A. The manner in which the Georgia troops were loſt I have already anſwered; reſpecting thoſe of South-Carolina I can't ſay. I believe the number of continental troops loſt that day exceeded 200. One field-piece was taken from the militia, another from the continental artillery, owing, as I was informed, to the driver being killed. Five other long braſs field-pieces not properly mounted, that were removed out of town, with a quantity of ammunition, in conſequence of our misfortune fell into the enemy's hands. Several iron pieces, with a quantity of ſtores that it was impoſſible to move after the enemy made their appearance, were likewiſe loſt.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army croſs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Auguſta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. The General informed me of the orders he had ſent to the garriſon of Sunbury. I don't recollect what they exactly were, but they were ſuch as I approved of at the time, and only lament they were not obeyed. With reſpect to the orders given to the troops at Auguſta I can't ſay.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. I believe the whole militia of the State of Georgia amounted to about 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the invaſion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was requeſted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. About the time of the invaſion General Howe was frequently with the Governor, and at that time I am certain the General informed me of every material matter that paſſed between them; but at this time I don't recollect any particulars of conſequence, tho' to the beſt of my belief he repreſented to the Governor, that as many militia as could be collected would be neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017772_0019_0FA2BC5402C048E0"/>Q. Do you know of any previous diſpoſitions made by General Howe, in caſe of a retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The general orders before-mentioned, that were iſſued reſpecting the mode of retreating, if neceſſary, may be deemed a previous diſpoſition. I know of no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the militia of the State of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. The militia of the State of Georgia were in general but indifferently armed. Thoſe belonging to the town of Savanna I judged to be very well armed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. The town of Savanna ſtands on a high ſandy ridge, which terminates in a bluff near a mile in extent on the river. This ridge runs backward, upwards of two miles, nearly the ſame width, and is a remarkable level open pine-barren. On each ſide of the ridge a creek empties into the river, which occaſions two ſwamps, both of which, rather farther back than the tows, are cultivated, the uncultivated parts are very thickly wooded; that to the ſouth-eaſt of the town is paſſable in many places; the other, to the ſouth-weſt of the town, is ſcarcely paſſable but where the road runs through it. On the oppoſite ſide of the ſwamp, below the town, is Girardeau's place, a bluff 40 or 50 feet high, and ridge nearly ſimilar to that on which the town ſtands, with this difference, that the ridge terminates nearly three quarters of a mile from the river, and leaves a remarkably level ſwamp, overflowed by every ſpring-tide.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the army in poſſeſſion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</p>
               <p>A. I don't believe that the army had a proper ſupply of entrenching tools, but I am certain that a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity could have been obtained to throw up works that would have been of ſervice.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legiſlative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</p>
               <p>A. With reſpect to any further applications I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Do you know what reaſons operated to prevent the enemy's being oppoſed in landing their troops?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the enemy any veſſels of force to cover the landing of their troops?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, and from the diſpoſitions of thoſe veſſels, I judged they intended landing at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Were or were not the legiſlative and executive bodies of the State of Georgia, at different times, frequently applied to by me, both perſonally and by letter, to fortify the country at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, beſide other meaſures ſtrongly recommended by me for the general defence of the State?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ſee any letters of mine to that State for that purpoſe?</p>
               <p>A. Some conſiderable time before the invaſion, I recollect ſeeing a letter from you, very fully on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, laid before the Aſſembly, which gave offence; in conſequence, as I apprehended, of your attempting to dictate to them.</p>
               <p>Colonel Marbury ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, when the enemy under Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. I had the command of a regiment, but it was not preſent. The day previous to the 29th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I arrived at Savanna, and acted as Aid to General Howe on the latter part of the day the enemy landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long previous to the invaſion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the deſigns of the enemy, and what ſteps were taken by him in conſequence?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know when General Howe received the intelligence, and as I was out of town, do not know what ſteps were taken previous to the evening of the 28th December, 1778, when I joined the General about ſun-ſet at Girardeau's. He was then, in company with ſeveral gentlemen of the army, reconnoitering the ground, and ſpoke of it's being very defenſible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. It was generally ſaid, and I believe they landed at leaſt 2000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compoſition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. About 500 continentals, with a detachment of Colonel Roberts's artillery, four or five field pieces, and about 100 militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what reſiſtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They advanced in two columns, one by the path leading thro' Sir James Wright's plantations, the other on the main road leading to Savanna. They appeared in full view at Gay's gate, from a little below which place a detachment filed off, and thro' a thick ſwamp gained our right and charged Colonel Walton, who, with about 80 militia and a field-piece, was poſted back of the new barracks, and from the enemy's great ſuperiority of numbers was obliged to leave the ground, and retreat precipitately after a ſhort engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I don't know of any other reſiſtance made, except a few ſhot from the artillery in front of our army, before a retreat was made, and a fire from Captain Smith, who commanded the party at Girardeau's, on the enemy, as they advanced to take poſſeſſion of Girardeau's hill.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I was not on the ground when the retreat was ordered; but I think about or a little after three o'clock, as I was going with a requiſition from Colonel Walton to the General for troops to ſupport him, I met Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe, at the head of the Carolineans, retreating, about half way between Tatnall's and the town. They were then in good order.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the loſs in men, cannon and ſtores, and by what means were they loſt?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the loſs of either, nor can I account by what means.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army croſs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. On the night of the 30th General Howe reached Treutlan's, which is about 45 miles above Savanna, and ſent out to ſecure the boats, and began to croſs the baggage on the morning following at the Two Siſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017772_0020_0FA2BC550A5629F8"/>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Auguſta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. After we had retreated to Cherokee hill, about eight miles from Savanna, the General ſent Captain Wood with orders to the officer commanding the troops at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, to retreat and join the General. On the next day, or day after, Major Deheyſer was ſent to Auguſta, with orders for the troops ſtationed there to croſs the river, and join the continental army wherever they might be.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. I think there was about two thouſand five hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the invaſion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was requeſted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any previous diſpoſitions made by General Howe, in caſe of a retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Milledge's paſs from the poſt then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</p>
               <p>A. I think it is about half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the militia of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. They were badly armed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I am not well enough acquainted with the place to deſcribe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the army in poſſeſſion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legiſlative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</p>
               <p>A. I have heard mention made of frequent applications, but cannot attempt to ſay what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What were the orders given you by me on that day, and other circumſtances that paſſed between us?</p>
               <p>A. On the evening of the 28th December 1778, after returning from Girardeau's with General Howe, he requeſted that I would collect three or four gentlemen, and patrole the country that night between the ſea and Savanna, to obſerve if any of the enemy had landed below, or if any of the country people appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be going to the Britiſh veſſels. I did ſo, and returned juſt about day-break, and ſoon after a firing commenced by Captain Smith at Girardeau's, who was ſoon forced from his poſt, and it occupied by the Britiſh. A little after I returned to town, and about twelve o'clock rode to head-quarters at Tatnall's houſe, in company with Colonel Huger and General Elbert. They informed me that the General had called a council, wherein it was determined to remain on the ground where they were and receive the enemy. Thoſe gentlemen informed General Howe that they had juſt returned from reconnoitering the ground on our right, that the ſwamp was paſſable, and they did not like their ſituation. The General ſaid he was not well pleaſed with it, or words to that purpoſe, and requeſted thoſe gentlemen to take the opinions of the officers who had compoſed the council. Some little time after this, the General requeſted me to take a view of the ground, and immediately return to him; I did ſo, and gave information ſimilar to what he had before received. I aſked the General if he thought it would be amiſs to ſend a company to the place where it was thought the enemy would croſs the ſwamp, about a quarter of a mile higher up, where there was a ſmall breaſt-work, occupied by Captain Keith of South-Carolina, with a company of regular troops, I think about 30 or 40. He ſaid it was a lucky thought, and requeſted me to take the command. Having no other at that time, my regiment being in Auguſta, I accepted it chearfully. The General deſired me to ride up and look out a convenient place, and he would order up the men. He ſent Major Grimkie, his Aid, directly after me, who informed me that the militia under Colonel Walton were to occupy the ground I ſpoke of, and that he ſhould not ſend up any regulars. I then returned to the General, told him that I did not wiſh to remain as an idle ſpectator, and would be glad he would employ me. He told me to remain with him, and if the enemy advanced I might be of ſervice. A little after the enemy appeared in view, and the General requeſted me to go up and remain on the right between, and have an eye on the breaſt-work and the militia. I went up, and about three o'clock (I think) the enemy appeared, and ſhortly after formed on an eminence that the militia had left a little before, and which Colonel Walton attempted to regain, but was too late. The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia appeared in confuſion, and could not be reduced to order. A field-piece was fired once or twice in front of the militia, and though the Colonel prevailed on them to advance and gave them three cheers, they were ſtill in confuſion. I aſked him if it would not be neceſſary to get a ſupport of regulars. He requeſted me to ride to General Howe, to inform him of his ſituation, that he would maintain the ground as long as poſſible, but was afraid he could not do it long without ſupport, and requeſted the General to ſend a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his aſſiſtance. On my way to head-quarters I paſſed near to the ſmall work occupied by Captain Keith, who called and informed me that General Howe had retreated, and aſked what he had beſt do. I pointed out his route, and adviſed him to make the beſt of his way, and then came up to General Howe, about half way between Tatnall's and town, at the head of the Carolina troops, who were in good order. I let him know Colonel Walton's requeſt. He ordered me back to him immediately with orders to retreat; but when I returned behind the barracks, I found the Britiſh on the ground, and the militia flying towards the Spring-hill, about 200 yards before me. I did not ſee Colonel Walton again, and never got up with the whole of the militia till they had got over the defile that we had to paſs. There in vain I endeavoured to rally them, and on my return met General Howe about the Spring-hill (the troops were then in great confuſion) who immediately requeſted me to try again to rally the militia, and was the ſecond time as unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as the firſt. By the time I returned, the artillery and troops had reached the Red-Houſe, called M'Gilvray's, near the upper end of the defile, where they halted; and after a ſhort time the General ſent me to Colonel White, who had command of the galleys and other veſſels laying above Race-Hall, to inform him of our retreat and to order him to move up the river with the veſſels, and when at any advantageous

place to come to, in order to prevent any veſſels running up the river and landing men to cut off our retreat; but at the ſame time not to remain in any place ſo long, as to endanger the veſſels under his command.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the militia poſted when you firſt ſaw them after you were ſent to the right?</p>
               <p>A. On a ſmall eminence near a branch, at ſome diſtance from the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went to them the ſecond time?</p>
               <p>A. Between that eminence and the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a part of the Carolina brigade you ſaw when you returned from endeavouring to rally the militia, or the main body?</p>
               <p>A. Only a part.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you with me before I ſent you to the gallies?</p>
               <p>A. I do not believe it was more than a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Ternant was ſworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army at the invaſion of Georgia by Colonel Campbell?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you then act?</p>
               <p>A. As Inſpector to the army.</p>
               <p>Q. At the commencement of the invaſion, what ſteps were taken by Major General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. From the 24th of December, when the Britiſh fleet firſt entered the Savanna river, to the 29th, when the action took place, the General, with Governor Houſton and ſeveral officers of the army, viſited the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places where it was moſt probable the enemy would land. I was preſent at thoſe reconnoitering excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The landing at Girardeau's was generally looked upon as the moſt likely to be choſen by the enemy, which occaſioned diſcuſſion about the means moſt effectual to prevent them, and in general to counteract their operations. It was generally thought neceſſary, and as I underſtood agreed on between the Governor and General, to erect a battery on the banks of the river, ſo as to prevent the approach of the ſhipping to the cauſeway, and conſequently the enemy's landing and taking poſt on the bluff. The fort on Savanna was alſo to be repaired and encloſed. The high banks raiſed along the river, from Savanna-bluff to Girardeau's cauſeway, for the purpoſe of watering and draining the rice-fields, were to be broken ſo as to overflow thoſe fields at high water, and render the whole extent of them, from Girardeau's cauſeway to the cauſeway in front of the troops on Fair-Lawn, as impaſſable as poſſible, and theſe fields without that prevention were then thought paſſable for infantry by files, tho' not without difficulty. Some other field works were likewiſe to be made in the vicinity of the place, extended as a poſition for the troops, which then might amount to about 650 regulars and about 100 militia. The means neceſſary to make theſe field preparations being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the hands of the executive of Georgia, ſuch as Negroes, tools of all kinds, horſes and gears for the tranſportation of artillery, applications were made by the General to procure them. They were promiſed ſeveral times in my preſence by Governor Houſton, but never furniſhed, any further than by ſending three Negroes the 26th in the morning with two tools, and theſe went away in the evening of the ſame day and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared again. I heard the General many times expreſs his complaints about it, and repeatedly ſent his Aids, but to no purpoſe. The chief command was even diſputed him, which occaſioned confuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in every meaſure; and how ſoon the diſpute ended by the Governor giving up the command to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I can't tell. On the 28th, fix of the enemy's veſſels having come up and anchored oppoſite to Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's bluff, the erecting of any battery on the banks of the river became impracticable; upon which a picquet of 50 men was poſted at the houſe on the bluff, with an intention, as I heard the General expreſs, to watch the motions of the enemy at that place, and oppoſe them ſo far as to be reinforced in time, whenever it ſhould be aſcertained that they really intended to land there. On the 29th, early in the morning, a firing was heard at that place, in conſequence of the enemy's landing; upon which the General ordered me there, but before I reached half way, I found that and another picquet retreating. I had collected the whole toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the General joined us, and ordered me to take command of them, and remain on the ſpot where we were till further orders. I omitted to obſerve that a mounted militia man was left with the commanding officer of the picquet, to give the earlieſt intelligence of the enemy's apparent movements, but who never to my knowledge reported to the General, tho' he was ſent in time for that purpoſe, as I heard the commanding officer of the picquet ſay.</p>
               <p>Q. At what diſtance from the main body of the army was the place the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. Between a mile and a mile and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. What force did they land at that time?</p>
               <p>A. I underſtood, after the action, they landed upwards of 2000 men at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</p>
               <p>A. There were ſeveral places above and below the town, whoſe names have partly eſcaped my memory, but which rendered every poſition that could be taken with an inferior force in the vicinity of the town, for the purpoſe of defending it, exceedingly precarious.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any ſteps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at thoſe places?</p>
               <p>A. Parties of militia were poſted at each of thoſe places below the town, and a picquet of 50 continental troops at Girardeau's, as the moſt probable place of landing. The two gallies were ſo poſted as to watch any movement the enemy could make by the back river, for the purpoſe of landing above the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy land at any other place than Girardeau's bluff?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was known that the enemy landed, what meaſures were taken to aſcertain their numbers and to oppoſe them?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ſpeak to the firſt part of that queſtion, further than that I heard the General ſeveral times complain he could get no information to be depended on, either about their force or deſigns. About three hours after the enemy had landed, I received orders to return to the army with the advanced picquets, who
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017772_0022_0FA2BC5697D53240"/>
immediately joined their reſpective corps. Two hours before the action a council of war was called of the field officers of the army, and from the uncertainty of the information procured by the General of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and deſign of the enemy, and to gain as much time as poſſible for the removal of public and private property from the town, it was unanimouſly agreed that the army ought to remain on the ſpot where they were then poſted at Fair-Lawn until the views of the enemy could be known, and their ſuperiority ſo aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as to urge and juſtify a retreat. In conſequence of that determination, the following diſpoſition was made and iſſued in general orders:</p>

                           <p>THE Carolina troops are to be told off into 16 platoons of eight files each, with the remaining files formed on their right as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by Colonel Huger. The Georgia troops to be formed into eight platoons of ten files each, with the remaining files on their left as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by General Elbert. The officers to take poſt as uſual by ſeniority in their reſpective lines. Thoſe who do not command platoons to fall in the rear of them as bringers-up, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve order and regularity through the line. Both corps to be formed in columns; thoſe of Carolina by platoons on their right, and the others likewiſe by platoons on their left, and to remain in that formation, with the light infantry at the head of each column, until further orders. The artillery to remain in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſition, and to be in the utmoſt readineſs to move or act as occaſion may require. The General requeſts and expects that both officers and men will diſtinguiſh themſelves by their firmneſs and perſeverance, and by an exact obſervance of orders. Should they be compelled to retreat, it is to be in the following order. The troops will move off in columns in the order ſet forth. The light infantry of Carolina to form the advance guard, to march rapidly by the ſhorteſt route to the Spring-hill defile, which they will poſſeſs on both ſides and endeavour to maintain. The artillery, all but one field-piece, will follow the Carolina brigade, and Colonel Roberts, when he arrives at the defile, will poſt his pieces ſo as beſt to cover the retreat of the Georgia brigade; Colonel Huger, his men ſo as moſt effectually to anſwer the ſame purpoſe, and to ſecure the artillery. The Georgia troops will follow their light infantry with a field-piece, forming the rear of the line, and as ſoon as they reach the defile this colomn, with the whole of the artillery, will paſs and form on the other ſide of it, in ſuch manner as the commanding officer ſhall think beſt to prevent inſults from the enemy, and to ſecure the retreat of the troops from the head of the defile. Should a root take place, the troops are to re-aſſemble beyond the defile at M'Gilvray's road. Further orders are to be applied for, or will be given, as circumſtances ſhall require.</p>

               <p>I was then ſent again to reconnoitre the paſſes through the ſwamp on our right, and was accompanied by two militia-men whoſe names I do not recollect. The principal gap was defended by a ſtrong picquet, whoſe numbers I have forgot, and a redan which occupied the whole ſpace of the paſſage. The other paſs was that mentioned to exiſt about a quarter of a mile further; I immediately went to viſit it; we attempted three times to go through the ſwamp at that place, and upon my guides pronouncing it impracticable we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the troops on Fair-Lawn. The General then ordered me to join a body of militia intended as a further ſecurity to his right flank, and to poſt them in ſuch a manner as beſt to anſwer that object. I found them drawn up in one rank to the number of ninety-three, with a field-piece, nearly oppoſite to the paſs laſt mentioned. They being a too great diſtance from the ſwamp, it was thought beſt to advance them cloſer to it; but before the neceſſary movements could be performed with that irregular body, the enemy's light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry came out of the ſwamp, filing off to the right and left, ſo as to come on the flanks of the militia, who from that moment would not be prevailed on to make the ſmalleſt alteration in their actual poſition. As ſoon as I ſaw the enemy from the ſwamp, I ordered a mounted militia-man to go and acquaint the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with it. Mean while the field-piece was directed to fire on the thickeſt of the enemy, and the militia encouraged to keep their ground, until the enemy by approaching higher would be fired upon and ſkirmiſhed with, ſo as to cover as far as in their power the retreat of the troops on Fair-Lawn. As ſoon as the enemy, who had performed this angular evolution out of the reach of muſquetry, had arrived to both wings of the militia, they marched briſkly, or rather ruſhed with great ſhouts. The militia, probably ſtruck with the ſuperiority of the enemy, who amounted to about 700 men, broke without firing, and fled towards the Spring-hill cauſeway; a few only fired their muſquets in retiring. Upon this the enemy poured in a heavy fire, and as ſoon as the field-piece was ſpiked up I attempted to join the continental troops, whom I met about a hundred yards to the weſtward of the barracks, retreating in tolerable good order, except thoſe of Georgia under General Elbert, who, contrary to the diſpoſition, had quitted the line of march and gone into the town. I marched with the troops to the defile. Two houſes that ſtood on each ſide of it were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied for a few minutes, and when all hopes of the Georgia troops arriving were over, and the enemy preſſing upon us, the troops with the artillery, except one field-piece, got over the cauſeway, and made a halt of a few minutes on the other ſide of it.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Were the reports of the invaſion given by the deſerter, ſaid to come from the tranſport, previous to the retreat of the troops that invaded Georgia from St. Auguſtine, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. They reached us at Sunbury, after the retreat of thoſe troops to Frederica.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any converſation with Colonel Walton at the poſt on our right, or any where on our right, in the courſe of that day?</p>

               <p>A. At the place where I met the troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Did I remain at the Spring-hill defile with General Huger till the troops had paſſed it?</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major General Howe proceeds in his defence as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Preſident, and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CONSCIOUS as I am that I have to the utmoſt of my abilities endeavoured to ſerve my country—that from principle I entered into the preſent conteſt with the earlieſt, reſolved not to retire but with the lateſt, or at leaſt not until my life or American grievances had a period—that my zeal in the common cauſe was equal to any, and that my ardor to promote it could be exceeded by none—I little dreamed that I ſhould at this day, or indeed on any other, have ſtood arraigned at a military tribunal for imputed crimes, which malice would ſtrive to magnify and fix upon me, and by which my reputation might, for a time at leaſt, be held in ſuſpence, even by the good. How painfully this muſt affect me, let military ſenſibility determine: For in a profeſſion ſo chaſte as that of arms, where honor is ſo feelingly alive that it muſt ſmart and agonize at the leaſt ſhadow of aſperſion, expreſſion can give no proper colourings to my anxieties; indeed it yields me none, but what, compared to my feelings, would be poor and contemptible. Happily for me, however, I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before a Court where Juſtice, with its delicate auxiliary Honor, ſit as Judges; a Court where, of all others, had I been guilty, I ſhould be moſt appalled at appearing, but by which, conſcious of my innocence, I moſt rejoice to be tried. Tho' it would not perhaps be very difficult to ſhew that Georgia, as a State, had very little to do in this proſecution, yet, deſirous to be juſtified by facts alone, and fearing no ſearch, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, tho' malevolence directs the probe, I ſhall admit, for the preſent at leaſt, that having been miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by or miſrepreſented to the State of Georgia, they have thought proper to bring me where now you ſee me. The charges againſt me are heavy—let us ſee how they have been ſupported; and though Colonel Walton is not the firſt, yet, as he is the arch evidence upon this occaſion, I ſhall begin with him, and the more eſpecially, as he ſo very comprehenſively in his teſtimony alludes to every charge brought againſt me, that remarking upon his evidence will, in a great meaſure, do away the neceſſity of deſcanting upon the reſt. He tells you that the Britiſh troops from Eaſt Florida penetrated Georgia two ways; that they evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected co-operating troops from the northward, which not arriving, they returned. That troops did enter the State in the manner he ſays is true; but by what ſpirit of divination it was made evident to him that they expected co-operation, and retired for the want of it, I am at a loſs to determine. If circumſtances at that time made it evident, thoſe circumſtances ſhould have been declared; or if ſubſequent events evinced it, every principle of common juſtice, could they have influence upon the Colonel, ought to have impelled him to relate them, that no undue deductions might be drawn from what he ſaid in injury to a man by his means on trial for his reputation. It is not however from this inſtance alone that I am warranted to ſay that he is ſeldom explicit, but where he thinks what he ſays will condemn me; end throws in ſo dubious light every thing of a contrary tendency, that he appears to hope unfavourable inferences may be drawn from it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that until the arrival of the deſerter he ſpeaks of, which was after the Eaſt Florida troops had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, the ultimate end of their views appeared and was believed to be no more than an intention to ravage and lay waſte as much of the State of Georgia as they could, to plunder the inhabitants and drive off the ſtock,—the latter of much more importance to St. Auguſtine than people, unacquainted with its ſituation and the precariouſneſs of its ſupplies, would be apt to imagine. I confeſs that after-events demonſtrated plainly that co-operation was then expected, but as nothing previous exiſted to induce the idea, the Colonel ſhould have expreſſed himſelf in ſuch a manner as to have left no poſſibility of implication that there did; and this I doubt not he would have done, had juſtice been all that he aimed at. I however ſet at defiance the utmoſt ſtretch of his malice, either within theſe walls or without them. He tells you further, that this account given by the man of the tranſport was ſo much credited, that Doctor Hall and himſelf were ſent by the Governor and Council to Charleſtown to commune with General Lincoln (then either arrived or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) upon the general ſituation of the State, and to give him the intelligence brought by the deſerter; that I was in South-Carolina when theſe advices were tranſmitted, and he takes it for granted I had them as early as others, but when or by whom he knows not, or what meaſures were taken in conſequence; that the time I arrived at Savanna he cannot preciſely aſcertain, but that it appeared I was not expected, as the Delegates lately arrived from Congreſs had reported I was recalled from the department, and General Lincoln was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on to ſupercede me. Come, however, he ſays I did, reaſſumed the command, gave aſſurances that I would defend the town, and that there was little danger. What the Colonel means by the greateſt part of this I am at a loſs to determine. I think I may be pretty certain that he does not mean to ſerve me by it, and yet I cannot ſee how it can operate to injure me. It appears, in ſhort, altogether inſignificant as to any relative tendency until the latter end of it, when the cloven foot appears in the inſinuation that I gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper encouragement to the inhabitants to ſtay in town, that I was not expected, and that the command was aſſumed; that is, I ſuppoſe, though he does not ſpeak out, that having been recalled I had no buſineſs there. If this be his meaning, I am amazed that a ſenior Colonel of a State and Commandant of militia had not, in the courſe of ſervice, or by the dictates of common ſenſe, been taught, that though another General had been appointed to the department. I could not with military propriety leave it until his arrival, and that therefore I could not reaſſume what had not been laid aſide. I am authorized to ſay that in a part of this ſtuff, intended by the Colonel for teſtimony, he has abſolutely deviated from facts. I had, upon the firſt information of General Provoſt's incurſion into Georgia, poſted to that State, and took the command of the troops on the ſouth ſide of Ogechee, where the Colonel was, and remained in Georgia till after the 29th of December. This he could not but remember, and upon croſs-examination has confeſſed, any more than I can forget that he left me and took off his party in that advanced ſituation, though I was very weak in numbers, while the enemy were ſtill in the State, and by all accounts no further off than between Newport river and the Altamaha. The Colonel amuſes the Court with an account of the reconnoitering parties we

Had the cutting down of this wood been neceſſary, which was far from being the caſe, Mr. Walton cannot but know of the repeated applications made by me to his Governor for tools, hands and many other matters, for purpoſes of much greater conſequence, and that no aſſiſtance was yielded me; how then this wood was to have been cut down, or how he could expect it to be done, I cannot imagine, unleſs he had lately been reading Taſſo, and, as he has talents for romance, might think that, like one of Taſſo's heroes, I could fell foreſts with one ſtroke of my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The leaſt movement that way would have neceſſitated me to retreat above them, by which means the town muſt have been left open to them, or, had I remained in or about it, captivity would inevitably have been the conſequence. The ſituation at Girardeau's appeared to me to have many vices, which may not perhaps have ſtruck others. I had examined it with the utmoſt ſtrictneſs, both alone and in company. I had walked over all its cauſeways, and through many parts of its rice-fields, and found, to my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The enemy therefore would not have been comported to attack us merely by the approach leading directly to the houſe, but might, had I fixed myſelf there, have doubled either flank, or embraced both. Any manoeuvre like this would have made our retiring neceſſary, and perhaps we ſhould have been obliged to do it under fire, and by that means have reaſſumed our main poſition at Fair-Lawn, in that confuſion incident to young troops retreating before an enemy; beſides this, the bridge and roads between Girardeau's and Fair-Lawn could not have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

Theſe were ſome of the reaſons which governed my conduct upon that day. They will, I flatter myſelf, have weight with the Court, and, if they do not convince Colonel Walton, will at leaſt invalidate his teſtimony. Upon examining this ground with Colonel Roberts, commanding officer of artillery, a gentleman as diſtinct in character as in ſentiment from the man laſt mentioned, a man of abilities in his profeſſion, of honor, integrity and benevolence of heart, in whom were united the gentleman and the ſoldier, who, knowing the value of reputation in himſelf, would have revolted at the idea of wounding it in another, who would have diſdained to proſtitute official influence to the vile purpoſes of private pique and perſonal prejudices, and who, if he muſt reſent, would have reſented by manly ways; this officer, who has ſince nobly fallen in the cauſe of his country, from whoſe fall the ſervice has received a deep wound, and of whoſe loſs I never think but the ſigh of anxiety expands my boſom, upon my aſking his opinion whether it was eligible to take meaſures for a capital oppoſition at Girardeau's, expreſſed himſelf in the ſtrongeſt terms againſt it; and though I had reſerved my own opinion at the time I requeſted his, he gave reaſons very ſimilar to thoſe I have uttered, and added, that he thought a ſmart guard, not ſo formidable as to make the enemy advert to other landing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, or to diſhearten them from attempting the approach by the cauſeway to the houſe, and yet capable of giving them a handſome check, was all he thought neceſſary to be done. The guard at Girardeau's, under Captain Smith, had been increaſed to about 70 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the cauſeway cut through within fire of the hill. Colonel Ternant has told you it could not be done for want of tools, as after all my efforts, and the efforts of the Quarter-maſter, none were obtained until it was too late. Near this poſt evidence demonſtrates two guards were placed, and there certainly were others, though no proof has been had of it. Thoſe guards were intended by me to anſwer a duplicate end; that of guarding the approaches to the main body at Fair Lawn, and to ſupport Captain Smith, as occaſion ſhould make it requiſite. I believe it will be thought that as there was a variety of other places to attend to, which required men, that ſo ſmall a main body as I had could not well ſpare, more than what thoſe detachments amounted to for any particular purpoſe. Two perſons, who were well mounted, active, and thought truſt-worthy, were ordered to attend Captain Smith, and he was directed to ſend inſtant information of the firſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy to land. One of theſe men was accordingly diſpatched by the Captain at leaſt an hour before the firing began, but he truſted the meſſage to a third perſon, and went to give notice of the enemy's motions to a relation of his four or five miles off and below the poſt; ſo that neither the guards in advance or I had the leaſt intimation of the enemy's motions until the action commenced, and conſequently Captain Smith miſſed of the ſupport intended him, and, after behaving with great gallantry, made good his retreat. From hence I think it appears (that though I did not place my whole reliance upon the enemy's landing at Girardeau's, and approaching by the main cauſeway, or throw ſo large a guard within view of them as ſome may think that I ought to have done) that I took meaſures to ſupport the guard, in order to a more obſtinate reſiſtance; and as the troops were kept conſtantly upon their arms, I ſhould have had time, had the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence intended me by Captain Smith reached me when it ought, to have ſupported him with the whole of the troops, had the enemy, by confining themſelves to the cauſeway, made the meaſure warrantable. It muſt be evident to the Court from teſtimony, that as the field before the houſe was near <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </gap> oppoſe them there, and after they had gained the high land, it would have been the heighth of madneſs with troops ſo inferior in number, to have attempted to meet them on the plain; for without ſome advantage of ſituation, the conſequence muſt be obvious. It was therefore thought beſt by me, and by many, not to waſte the men by fruitleſs efforts, but to withdraw the guards, and let them join their ſeveral corps at the main poſition. At this place, in front, the ſituation was exceedingly defenſible; ſo much ſo, that had the enemy attacked us there, I think there was every probability that the events of that day had been determined in our favour. I had reaſons, which appeared to me ſtrong, to induce the belief that they would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked us in that manner. The road which led to us was wide, and though it had been broken up, ſo as not to be paſſable immediately under the command of a field-piece, yet it was done in ſuch a manner that it did not appear to thoſe in approach till almoſt arrived at it. The moraſs in front, and the ground on each ſide of it, was ſo formed, that at a very little diſtance the whole appeared level; and as the paſſes on my right had no roads to them, at leaſt none that had been uſed for a conſiderable time, there was a great chance that they might not advert to them. The enemy's own accounts ſhew that my hope of their not finding the paſſes and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> atacking me in front were well founded; for they ſay, in their official accounts, that this would have been the caſe, had not a Negroe deſerted to them and become their informer and guide. Theſe reaſons, joined with the conſideration that even the ſhew of reſiſtance on our part might occaſion heſitation and delay on their's (and half a day or even an hour was precious, as the public and private property was removing) induced me to remain where I was. Colonel Walton has aſſerted that I, by my own confeſſion, appeared ignorant of the paſſes on my right. It is not common, I believe, for a man to deviate from truth, where it muſt in conſequence and obviouſly make againſt himſelf; and ſurely I muſt have deviated from truth had I ſaid ſo, for your records teem with evidence that I was acquainted with the paſſes. They were ſources of conſtant anxiety to me, they were in fact the diſeaſe of my poſition; I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not cure them, nor could I guard them effectually—the next eligible thing was to watch them cloſely, and who, after hearing the evidence adduced, can accuſe me of not having done ſo. Patroles of horſe were ordered to be continually going, ſtationary videts were appointed, ſeveral private confidential characters, who acted as volunteers upon this occaſion, beſides two extra Aids-de-Camp, military characters, active, vigilant and well mounted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in evidence to have been employed for this purpoſe, beſides various other meaſures that were purſued. Do not all theſe precautions demonſtrate that I was painfully ſenſible how tender our ſituation was upon the right? What though I might not have known the exact ſpot where jeſſamines were to be plucked, or noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gays had been made, I was well informed of the general weakneſs of that part on my flank, and though I hoped the enemy might not attempt it, yet I took every method to be informed of it if they did; after which I never meant to remain on the ground a moment, as my conduct as well as the teſtimony given in evinces. The paſs the enemy availed themſelves of was ſo remote on my right, that I thought I ſhould have had time to retreat without loſs, ſhould they endeavour to paſs it. Careful as I was, I have my doubts that the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not ſo early as I might have expected. In ſaying this, I do not mean to reflect upon any of thoſe individuals who undertook to look out that way. They were reſpectable characters, with every ability and deſire to ſerve the cauſe; but it is poſſible for accident ſometimes to occaſion an enemy to elude the greateſt vigilance, and if a moment was loſt, I am convinced it muſt have ariſen from accident alone. A party was detailed for this paſs, and Colonel Marbury was to have commanded it. I have it much to ſorrow for, that any innovation took place. That reſpectable, ſpirited officer would not have poſted his party near the barracks, and far in the rear of the troops, but would have ſtationed them where they ought to have been, directly on the ſpot they were intended to guard; by which means, if all other vigilance had failed, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between him and the enemy would have announced their approach many minute ſooner than the firing that did happen gave it me. But if it was criminal in me not to know this paſs, what ſhall be ſaid of him who undertook to guard it for me, and yet took poſt remote from it. Colonel Walton declares to the Court, that Colonel Marbury delivered him an order from me to attack the Britiſh light-infantry, and relates, not indeed that he obeyed the order, but theatrically deſcribes his ſituation and the enemy's. I do not recollect, and think I may aſſert that no ſuch order was ever ſent him. If it was, can that memory, which appears to be ſuch a faithful regiſter of trifles, not be impreſſed with the name of the perſon who brought the order; and ſtranger ſtill it is that the Colonel ſhould believe, or at leaſt aſſert, that Colonel Marbury was the perſon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017772_0026_0FA2BC5C67CE8958"/>
who delivered it. But the deep groves and flowery bowers the Colonel had ſtrayed into, in company with fair damſels, had awakened in his imagination a ſpirit of Chivalry, and, like Knight-Errants of old romance, becomes his province, and his relations are as extraordinary as any thing in Amadis of Gaul, Pariſmus and Pariſmenus, the Fairy Tales, or any other books of that ſort. The ſimilarity however breaks in this, that thoſe fables have morals, while morals in the Colonel's fables are left out. Colonel Walton, in that part of his evidence which relates to the detaching of ſo many of the militia-horſe, by the turn of his expreſſion, and ſome volunteer exploſions of fancy which have not been made a record of, but which through the whole of his teſtimony he has been too apt to let off, appears to blame me for thoſe detachments. They were however diſpoſed of to the beſt of all uſes our ſituation would admit of, that of watching the various approaches which called for attention, and which our numbers could not guard. The Colonel one would think is a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky; for where he wiſhes to condemn he contributes to acquit, and where he means to commend he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures—his friendſhip by this means becomes more dangerous than his enmity. I am in another place accuſed, in the Colonel's teſtimony, of retreating without ſending him notice of it. Notice, however, was aſſuredly ſent him, and was repeated by Colonel Marbury. It was not, I dare ſay, received, becauſe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Colonel's retreat began firſt, or ſo early after me that the meſſenger might not have been arrived. Colonel Marbury mentions that one of the continental picquets had received no orders when he ſaw it. This picquet had been put under the orders of Colonel Walton, and I believe he ſent directions to it to retire; but, abſtracted from this, Major Porter was diſpatched to call off the picquets, and has told you that he did do it. As I had reaſons for wiſhing the picquets to remain on the ground a ſhort time after the troops moved off, Major Porter might not have got to them when Colonel Marbury ſaw them, who, having been deſired to have an eye on the picquets, acted with his uſual propriety in ordering that picquet off. The diſpoſition for the day is before the Court, and muſt ſpeak for itſelf. I flatter myſelf it makes proviſion for every proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contingence, and that it will bear the inſpection of any military eye. From that it appears that I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the army to retreat in column, as it ſhortened the line of march, and threw the men more in the countenance of their officers; that they were to proceed by the ſhorteſt route to the Spring-hill defile; ſo that I could not have the leaſt idea of their going into town. That this order of march and the route laid down was not or could not be purſued was a misfortune to me indeed, but ought not to be imputed to me as a fault. My friend General Elbert has juſtified me as to never having given any order for it, and juſtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a recital of the accidents which compelled him to deviate from the diſpoſition. That deſerving officer and myſelf have lived in a courſe of friendſhip for a length of time, and in ſituations critical and intricate have ſeldom upon military matters differed in opinion. His aſſiſtance and advice have laid me under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, and his ſpirit and abilities have ſerved his country. Having omitted ſomething relative to the ſituation at Girardeau's, I beg a moment's indulgence of the Court to revert to it. As moſt rice-fields in that country can at times be laid under water, it may appear ſtrange to ſome, upon a ſuperficial view, that Girardeau's fields were not put in that ſtate. I had this once in object, and examined the flood-gates, but found moſt of them ſo out of repair that they would not keep in the tides; and if they could, as thoſe vents are ſituated by and empty themſelves into the river, they would have been under the enemy's command. Had thoſe objections however been out of the queſtion, the winds which had prevailed for ſeveral days made, as was uſual to thoſe winds, ſuch low tides, that until the afternoon of the 29th the lands could not have been overflowed. Mr. Wereat's evidence proves this fact. I have confeſſed that I ordered the garriſon at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, and I will add that I was ſo anxious to have it done, that my firſt order was written with a pencil, on horſeback, in the field, and on the retreat. Fearful that this order might miſcarry, and ſtill anxious for the fate of the garriſon, upon a halt we made about eight miles from town, I, in another letter more explicit in its content, repeated the order for evacuation, and directed, that if the ſtores could not be removed they ſhould be deſtroyed, and the cannca ſpiked. This letter, and another to the ſame purpoſe not an hour afterwards, were diſpatched by officers. Some, if not all, were received, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor who commanded there delayed obeying the order until he heard from me again, in conſequence of which he and his party fell into the enemy's hands a few days afterwards. How this order, had it been wrong in itſelf, ſince it was not obeyed, could contribute to ſacrifice the capital and the State, let thoſe who framed the charge explain. I think it appears plain that nothing very erroneous in my conduct has happened, when, notwithſtanding a ſtrong deſire to have me cenſured, charges ſo futile and ill-grounded are exhibited againſt me. It would have been horrid in me to have ſuffered a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Had I done ſo, and been arraigned for that, I ſhould have ſtood in this preſence with very different ſenſations than now I do; nor would I ſo juſtly have incurred the cenſure of my own heart to pleaſe the executive authority of the whole world, though every individual which compoſed it had been a Colonel Commandant of Militia. Major Lane, who commanded the fort, had recently been in it ſecond in command, when an attack upon it by the enemy had been gallantly repulſed. The Magiſtrates and citizens of the town, hoping to defend it again, ſolicited, implored, and beſet him to remain in it.

                  </gap> an enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic ardour for fame, which it is better for an officer ſometimes to be miſled by than never to feel, and which, tho' it may now and then induce exceſs, it is at word but the exceſs of a good quality. All theſe prevailed upon him to delay an execution of his orders, and he had his puniſhment in his fault. The croſſing of Savanna river very early after the retreat I have alſo confeſſed. Some of the reaſons that operated upon me muſt be my defence; half of them, I pledge myſelf, will be a ſufficient juſtification. The gallies and veſſels with private and public ſtores had been ordered to Puryſburgh, and had arrived; the river at that place was ſo narrow that they muſt have been loſt, had they been attempted even by infantry alone. Beſides this, all Carolina, as yet uninjured, was open to the enemy, and no inroad by land more eligible to them than Puryſburgh; the battalions in that State were reduced by the expiration of enliſtments to a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the bulk of its militia lie remote from the ſea, and are not to be collected upon a ſudden emergency ſo ſpeedily as is to be wiſhed; the whole country between Puryſburgh and Charles-Town lay expoſed to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the enemy, and was much nearer to them than Auguſta; indeed, had they loſt no time in Georgia,

but by a rapid movement had made Charles-Town their object, I think, in the then ſituation of affairs, their proſpects of carrying it were very probable. Theſe circumſtances, and ſome others, combined to make me preſs my arrival at Puryſburgh, after three or four days ſtay at the Two Siſters, during which time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears I was not negligent of the inhabitants. Before I had croſſed the river myſelf, tho' moſt of the troops were over, General Lincoln arrived on the other ſide, and ſent for me. Had it been proper to proceed to Auguſta, we were as near to it from thence as from the ſide I had left, and the General no doubt would have adopted the meaſure; but matters ſo plainly pointed out to him the neceſſity of haſtening to Puryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, that the troops were ordered to march by dawn of day, and we had but juſt got to that place when advanced parties of the enemy appeared on the oppoſite ſide of the ferry, which demonſtrated the rectitude of the meaſure of arriving there as ſoon as poſſible. Theſe reaſons, if they juſtify at all, will have force as to call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the few troops that were at Auguſta; and theſe General Lincoln, whoſe prudence is not to be doubted, would likewiſe have remanded, had it been requiſite. Colonel Walton told the Court in ſome part of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I gave aſſurances to the inhabitants that I would defend the town. By this it would appear, if you take it ſingly, as he no doubt would have you to do, that I had pledged myſelf to the people at all events to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, lulling them thereby into a ſtate of abſolute ſecurity, and by that means inducing them to remain with their effects. Upon further examination, however, theſe aſſurances, even by his own account of them, amount to no more than my ſpeaking of the compoſition of the enemy's troops, in a way which might inſpirit thoſe who heard me to exert themſelves in defence. It was not ſurely my province to diſpirit a people whoſe aſſiſtance I wanted, both for their ſakes and my own; but certain it is I mentioned to many of the inhabitants the removal of their goods as a cautionary ſtep for fear of accident, and this I think may appear from Mr. Wereat's evidence. I recommended it more than once to the Governor, whoſe duty it was to adviſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants upon this head, and I am conſcious I have nothing to accuſe myſelf of upon this occaſion. This alſo I ſhould have mentioned ſooner, and I beg the excuſe of the Court for not having done ſo; but in ſuch a farrago of evidence as the Colonel's, where facts are ſo few, and ſo wrapped up in beliefs, ſuppoſitions and opinions, no wonder if one or two of them ſhould eſcape being unfolded. Mr. Sheftall, the Deputy Commiſſary General of Iſſues, has been brought by the proſecutors to prove upon me, as I ſuppoſe, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the public ſtores. I have ever had a favourable opinion of Mr. Sheftall as an honeſt man, and from the teſtimony of ſuch I knew I had nothing to fear; his evidence therefore is in my favour. Many meaſures however were purſued, that Mr. Sheftall might have had no knowledge of. It was in the Deputy Quarter Maſter General's department to provide veſſels and carriages for the removal of ſtores. Colonel Wily, who filled this office, was a man of rank, character and activity. He was directed to, and I am ſure did purſue every method to obtain them, both by himſelf and a very active Deputy, Doctor Wadden; but their efforts were in vain. The veſſels at that time at Savanna were either the property of private individuals, or in their employment. On board of theſe, as it is natural to ſuppoſe, the inhabitants were crouding their effects, and theſe veſſels by civil means could not be obtained. I might indeed, by dint of bayonet, have tumbled out of the veſſels both the people and their effects; but humanity, honor and conſcience militated againſt it. I have warred to preſerve civil rights, and pride myſelf in the thought that I have never violated them. But had I been ſo dead to every ſenſe of feeling, ſhould I not have been liable to the actions of each of thoſe I had injured, and who would, who ought to have indemnified me? A veſſel, as appears, was at laſt procured, capable of receiving the ſtores, and a party was then furniſhed (and it would have been uſeleſs to have done it before) to move the ſtores to the wharff; but the maſter of the veſſel, alarmed a long while ſooner than he need to have been, ran away with the veſſel and left the ſtores behind. It appears in evidence, that upon the invaſion of Georgia from Eaſt Florida I gave it, as ſoon as poſſible, my perſonal aid; that I ordered on a body of continental troops, which ſoon followed; that militia likewiſe upon that occaſion were to come in from Carolina. Before theſe were collected, the troops from Eaſt Florida had retired; but upon the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence given by the deſerter from the tranſport of an intended invaſion under Colonel Campbell, they were not countermanded, but arrived in Savanna. They came about the middle of December, and were after ſome time diſmiſſed, I know not why, by the Governor of Georgia. It has alſo been given in evidence, that I requeſted of the Governor of Georgia all the militia he could collect. It appears alſo to the Court, as I flatter myſelf, that every circumſtance which had a claim to my attention received it, and particularly that on the retreat I paid every poſſible attention to the men. Some diſtance on the retreat I halted until the whole were paſt me, and a better organized column I have ſeldom ſeen even upon parade. Juſt at this time, I had intelligence that a party of Britiſh were ſeen coming down the Ogechee road, a good way beyond the barracks. Upon this I galloped to where General Huger was, and obſerving that this body of the enemy, though at a conſiderable diſtance, ſeemed haſtening to poſſeſs the Spring-hill defile, I deſired General Huger to proceed there, ſee in what manner Major Wiſe, who had been ſent there with a party and ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the paſs to the laſt man, had poſted them, and, if he thought more men requiſite, to reinforce the party with the advanced guard of the line, or take off as many platoons from the head of the column as he ſhould think proper. Directly after this I was returning to the rear, but when I came to the artillery found the troops that I left in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rear of it miſſing. Upon this I ſent orders to the troops in front to haſten their march for the defile, and directed Colonel Roberts to preſs on the artillery, as I was anxious for its fate, as its rear was now in air. When I came to the defile, I found General Huger had poſted the party to my entire ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that gallant officer offering to head it, I accepted his offer, and told him I would remain with him. We ſtaid ſome time there under a pretty ſmart fire, hoping that the troops miſſing, or ſome part of them, might arrive; but being informed by ſome perſon who came out of the town, that he ſaw them going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Yamacraw, and as the Carolina brigade with the artillery had entirely paſſed the defile, and was ſome diſtance on their retreat, all object for remaining there ceaſed, and we retired to the other end of the paſs, where again we made ſome ſtand, after which we halted no more until we reached Cherokee-hill. What more could be expected of me I am at a loſs to know. The reputation of a man is in great danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, at leaſt for a time, when proſecutions are commenced againſt him under the auſpices of a State. Mankind at large will be apt to ſuppoſe that he might be faulty, when the majority of a community appear

to think him ſo, and perhaps the concluſion is commonly juſt. If characters in general are in this way vulner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, military characters in particular are much more obnoxious to the wound. There exiſts in republican governments a jealouſy, perhaps laudable, of men of the ſword. The glare of the character excites the envy of the vulgar, and as the gallantry of the profeſſion ſeems to elevate thoſe who adopt it above the common level, men feel a malignant happineſs in pulling them down. If this be a fault, it is a fault in human nature, which, though it may bear hard upon individuals, is not perhaps without its ſocial benefits. It may ſoften that haughtineſs, but too apt to infect the minds of military men, and make them correct that deſpotiſm of temper, which a long habit of being implicitly obeyed is but too apt to induce, fix in their remembrance the relation they bear and the duty they owe to civil ſociety, and eſtabliſh in them a courteſy of conduct to their fellow-citizens (which might otherwiſe forſake them) when they reflect that even their favorite miſtreſs, Fame, is enjoyed upon the precarious tenure of retaining the good-will of the people. The right in States, however, to cenſure and arraign is a prerogative of a delicate nature, the dignity of which conſiſts in a very ſparing and very judicious uſe of it—and hard is the fate of that man, againſt whom a State ſets itſelf.—Whether he be right or wrong—it is not but upon the moſt palpable certainty of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it, that they ought to do it. Hard, however, as it is, it is the duty of every man to ſubmit. It is a tax he owes to the public, which, though he pays with anxiety, he ſhould pay without murmuring. This is more particularly incumbent upon military men, who, upon every occaſion, ſhould demonſtrate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity that they have not ſunk the idea of a citizen in that of a ſoldier. Actuated by ſentiments like theſe, I now pay my tribute to the State of Georgia, in full confidence that the events of this trial will prove to them, that I faithfully whilſt with them, to the utmoſt of my abilities, ſtrove to fill the meaſure of my duty both to them and the common cauſe, and that where malice and miſrepreſentation have prevailed upon them to cenſure me moſt, I leaſt of all have deſerved it at their hands. I was very early in this conteſt impreſſed with a ſenſe of the great importance of the State of Georgia to the common weal. It was this conviction of their worth, joined to the true reſpect and good-will I bore them, that made me ſo often preſs upon them the abſolute neceſſity of taking meaſures to place themſelves in a ſtate of defence. It was this which made me point out to them, in the ſtrongeſt expreſſions I was maſter of, that, affailable as they were at a variety of places, they were at none prepared for defence; that while other States were exerting themſelves to be in the beſt poſſible ſtate of ſecurity, they remained ſo unprepared, that they ſeemed to invite an attack; that, deſtitute as they were of arms, ammunition, military ſtores and implements of all kinds, they ought without loſs of time to exert themſelves to obtain them; that their internal reſources not being very great, and the aſſiſtance from other States too remote upon ſudden emergency to be had in time, that they ought therefore to put themſelves, by works, in a ſituation to maintain their country until collateral aids could be called in, and that all idea of expence ſhould be loſt in the importance of the object. This I reiterated upon them, as their records will ſhew, and have it much to lament that I reiterated in vain. Colonel Walton could have told you this, for he was of the body to which I ſpoke it, and candour ſhould have exacted of him at leaſt to have told it to the adminiſtration, which, after his liberation from captivity, he had the ingenuity to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; but it was not popular to inform them of the fatal apathy which pervaded the former Legiſlatures, in which he himſelf had no inconſiderable ſhare. The State of Georgia laboured under peculiar diſadvantages. The climate was thought much more unfavourable to exotic conſtitutions than it really was. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had originally been military, conſequently not congenial to liberty. A number of men of liberal ſentiments were therefore diſcouraged from reſorting there, and though it contained at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> many characters equal in every particular to any in other States, yet, comparatively to thick <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſettled countries, they were but a few. A number of theſe had been appointed to places of honorary or pecuniary emolument under the crown, and moſt of them, as has been common in other States, withdrew themſelves when the conteſt waxed warm. From the ſelect few that remained, their civil and military officers were appointed, who, by a fatal clauſe in the conſtitution of the State, were rendered inelegible to any ſhare in their Legiſlature. By this means, not ſo great a choice of characters as was to be wiſhed remained, and many floated into notice who had otherwiſe remained out of view. A number of theſe, however innocent, were totally unconverſant in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, and ſo were liable to be faſhioned by the crafty and deſigning. Thus a Gwinnet, a Truitland, a Houſton and a Walton became their Governors; thus deſign and ſelf-intereſt became the ruling principle of adminiſtration; and thus I became an object of perſecution. The thunder however, as I underſtand, ſlept until Mr. Walton awakened it. For tho' a government had been ſet up ſome months before he came out, yet not one word of complaint, I believe, had officially been heard of againſt me. This government, it is true, had not been conſtitutionally eſtabliſhed; becauſe ſo many of the Repreſentatives of the State had evacuated it, that the numbers ſet forth by the conſtitution as adequate to the choice of a Preſident and Council could not be collected. Thoſe, however, who remained, alarmed by the enormities which for want of government were daily committed with impunity, thought themſelves warranted by neceſſity to deviate from common rules, and therefore met and elected public officers. The perſons choſen were men of real patriotiſm; and feeling a reluctance to aſſume powers not conſtitutionally veſted in them, they forebore proceeding to executive operations until moſt, if not all, of the people of the State had ſanctified their nomination, by requeſting to be governed by them. Some time alter this, Mr. Walton returns from captivity, and though this government was progreſſing faſt to its periodical diſſolution, even that ſhort time was too long for a man of his ſtrong aſpirations after power to wait. A few members of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, much leſs than the number which ſet up the other Governor, were therefore by ſome means got together, and Mr. Walton is elected Governor, and other public officers nominated. Thus two adminiſtrations actually exiſted at one moment in the ſame State, a phoenomenon in the world of civil policy almoſt as much to be wondered at, as if two Suns appeared at the ſame time in one firmament in the natural world. During this government, if ſo it may be called, of Mr. Walton's, and which a verv re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable

                  </gap> of blame to caſt on the Aſſembly at large. In the light I was ſhewn to them, their treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of me has been proper. They were labouring under the preſſure of diſtreſs, were made ſore by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of war. It was natural for them to enquire into the origin of their misfortunes. It would not have been popular or ſafe to let them recollect, that ſome of the very men they had inveſted with authority had been leading men in all the meaſures of the State precedent to its misfortunes; that they had been dead to every ſenſe of danger, or criminally negligent of every means of averting it, and this notwithſtanding the moſt animated and pointed applications to them to fall upon meaſures to place their country in a ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for want of which it at laſt fell a melancholy ſacrifice. To prevent this recollection, it became neceſſary to divert their attention to another object, and who ſo convenient as him who had been the military commander of the department? He was a thouſand miles abſent from the ſcene of accuſation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not defend himſelf. He had no connexions of conſanguinity or affinity to take his part, was an alien to the State, and moſt of the friends he had obtained in it in courſe of acquaintance were abſent as well as himſelf. He therefore was proper game to run at, and it was determined to hunt him down. Perſonal prejudices in one of the leaders ſtimulated alſo to this meaſure, ſo that ſelfiſh policy and inveteracy united in the chace. Hence has perſecution been let looſe upon me, and every method tried to ruin my fame. The embers of time have been raked up, to ſee if no ſpark of error was to be found, that the breath of malevolence might puff it into flame. After three long years have paſſed by, I am called to trial for actions, when the motives of many of them might have been forgotten by myſelf. In ſhort, every meaſure has been purſued to immolate my reputation upon the altar of malice; but I truſt, I know it has been tried in vain. Had I, in ſo early a period of the war, committed any military error in judgment, my zeal in the common cauſe, and my unabating efforts to promote it, would have induced any man, to whoſe boſom the leaſt ray of candour could find its way, to caſt a veil over the miſtake. To the ſervice of my country, I glory in having devoted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Six years have clapſed, and, a few weeks excepted, I have never aſked or accepted one moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from ſervice; for to ſervice I have ſacrificed all other conſiderations, however intereſting, endearing or heart-felt they might have been. Should illiberal minds cenſure me for being too much of an egotiſt in ſaying this, let them be taught that there are occaſions which warrant a man's ſpeaking of himſelf, and that my enemies have involved me in this predicament. The length of time that has paſſed ſince the tranſactions happened for which I am under trial, though a great, is not the moſt capital diſadvantage I ſuſtain. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident has deprived me of many of my official papers; and many, not thinking they would have been uſeful to me, have been deſtroyed by myſelf. I feel the want of them moſt ſeverely on this day. They would have eſſentially elucidated many parts of my conduct through the courſe of a command, in various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances intricate, critical, perplexing and vexatious. But above all, I lament the abſence of a Secretary and an Aid de Camp, who, having lived with me long in uninterrupted intimacy and confidence, were acquainted with the minutiae and aggregate of my conduct; had been with me often in Georgia, and reſided there with me for months at a time; copied all my orders and official letters; knew with what earneſtneſs I ſtrove, and what ſacrifices I made to avoid any conteſt with the executive of that State; and that ſuch was my regard for civil rights, that I never did by military exertion, what with ſafety to ſervice could be done by the authority of a conſtable. This indeed may not be ſo immediately neceſſary to my defence againſt the matter with which I am charged; but, trained as I have been in republican principles, the reverence I bear to civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to which it is my pride and pleaſure to be ſubordinate, makes every appearance of conteſt with it a matter wounding to my happineſs, and I ſhould have been glad, ſince conteſt did happen, to have ſhewn that I could not avoid it. The evidence now, Mr. Preſident, and my defence are gone through: the reſult is with you and the Court. I have to thank you, and through you the Court alſo, for your attention to me during a trial, made longer than it need to have been by a number of untoward accidents. I flatter myſelf, that very little of the delay that has happened can be imputed to me. A day or two excepted, when I was truly too indiſpoſed to attend you, I can accuſe myſelf of none. On the part of the Court. I am glad to bear teſtimony of the happy blend of candour and ſtrictneſs, with which through the whole of this trial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences have been examined, and in which the dignity of a Court Military ſo much conſiſts.
