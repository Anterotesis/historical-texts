            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE had the favor of your ≈øummons to attend a Court-Martial, appointed by his Excellency the Commander in Chief to ≈øit on the conduct of Major General Howe, on the complaint of the State of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia. It is not unknown to Major General Howe, or to the Delegates of the State, that I declined to give evidence upon this ≈øubject whil≈øt the pro≈øecution was in the form of an enquiry, and depo≈øitions taking in the War-Office by order of Congre≈øs, until mea≈øures ≈øhould be taken for obtaining the te≈øtimony of Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elbert, who commanded the Georgia brigade of continental troops on the 29th day of December, 1778, the corps which ≈øuffered the mo≈øt by capture on that occa≈øion: And the ≈øacrifice or lo≈øs of the troops being the principal object of the pro≈øecution, I ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe that the trial would be partial without his evidence; or, at lea≈øt, that implied cen≈øure might be recorded again≈øt his conduct in the minutes of the Court, which might injure a mo≈øt valuable citizen and ≈øoldier of the State. Indeed, I ≈øhould think my≈øelf acce≈ø≈øary in the wrong which might take place, did I not plead that the trial might be fait and full, taking in his e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial evidence. For the≈øe rea≈øons, Sir, it is that I have hitherto and do now declined to attend the Court; but when it ≈øhall be decided to take General Elbert's te≈øtimony before the proceedings are clo≈øe, then ≈øhall I chearfully depo≈øe what I know in this ca≈øe. I beg that you would plea≈øe to make my re≈øpects to the Court, and acquaint the members with the rea≈øons a≈ø≈øigned for my conduct.</p>

                     <p>THE Court-Martial ordered by his Excellency the Commander in Chief for the trial of Major General Howe, upon certain charges exhibited again≈øt him by the Delegates of the State of Georgia, having met and ≈øummoned the evidences who≈øe names were given in, are acquainted that only Colonel Walton can be found, and that he declines to give his evidence, for the rea≈øons contained in his letter which is inclo≈øed; that General Elbert and Colonel Marbury are in Maryland, and tho' ≈øummoned ≈øome time ≈øince to attend, as the Court are informed, are not yet arrived.‚ÄîThe Court therefore reque≈øt, Gentlemen, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are content the trial ≈øhould proceed upon ≈øuch evidence as can now be obtained, or whether you expect the trial to be po≈øtponed to a di≈øtant day, when the deficient evidence may be procured.

                     <p>WE do our≈øelves the plea≈øure to reply to your letter of ye≈øterday, and are ≈øorry to under≈øtand that the operative powers of the Court are impeded for want of evidence in the ca≈øe of Major General Howe, on the part of the State of Georgia. We are not informed by the Board of War with the time or conveyance of the ≈øummon≈øes ≈øent to General Elbert and Colonel Marbury; and it will appear pretty evident to you, that we have no coercive powers to compel evidence to attend. Under a train of circum≈øtances peculiar in them≈øelves, we cannot pre≈øume to dictate to the Court; but if difficulties exi≈øt, the propriety of a reference to Congre≈øs will readily occur. We annex the names of ≈øuch per≈øons as have occurred to us ≈øince the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of tho≈øe to the Board of War, who≈øe evidence we wi≈øh to have taken on the trial, in addition to the former.

               <p>The Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major Lucas was ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:017772_0004_0FA2BC42488EA898"/>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Captain in the Georgia Line.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ≈øteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. I vi≈øited the po≈øt at Girardeau's landing, where Captain Smith was po≈øted with about 75 men; my ≈øituation in the army prevented me from ≈øeeing the different po≈øts.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the oppo≈øition that was made to their landing?</p>
               <p>A. No; I heard a firing, but was not pre≈øent.</p>
               <p>Q Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and at what di≈øtance was it from the place of landing?</p>
               <p>A. At Fair-Lawn, better than a mile from the place of landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. No; I under≈øtood, when I was pri≈øoner, that they landed 2500 men at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they land at any other place?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you po≈øted that day?</p>
               <p>A. With my regiment in the Georgia brigade, on the left of the line.</p>
               <p>Q. After the enemy had landed, did the line move down to oppo≈øe them, or did they wait the enemy's attack?</p>
               <p>A. They waited the enemy's attack.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy attack them in their po≈øition at Fair-Lawn, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. We were po≈øted in a po≈øition of defence again≈øt the enemy, the South-Carolina brigade on the right, the Georgia brigade on the left, the artillery in the centre, and a party of militia, under the command of Colonel Walton, on the right of the whole, to oppo≈øe the enemy at a pa≈øs, I think a mile from the main body, where the enemy's infantry did attack them; but a ≈ømall re≈øi≈øtance being made by them, enabled the enemy's infantry to attack our right flanks immediately after, at which time the main body moved on, firing a few ≈øhot from their artillery, which did ≈øome ≈ømall damage in the Georgia brigade; about that time we had orders to retreat, agreeable to the di≈øpo≈øition given the night before, which was by a defile called Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill to M'Gilvray's gate, an advantageous piece of ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the retreat conducted agreeably to the di≈øpo≈øition?</p>
               <p>A. No; the brigade I belonged to moved off in column, and were afterwards ordered by the commanding officer to form by files, and ≈øome time afterwards they broke, and the principal part went into Savanna. Two parties were taken out of the brigade, by order of General Howe, as we were moving in column, to act as infantry on the flanks; the piece of artillery ordered to cover the rear of that brigade quitted its ≈øtation, and left the brigade ≈øhortly after the retreat began.</p>
               <p>Q. By who≈øe orders did the party go into town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the commanding officer with them?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay; I being in the front of the brigade moved on; the troops being formed in files, they extended to a great length. Some time after the troops were formed in files, Colonel Elbert left us, as I under≈øtood afterwards, to look for a pa≈øs over M'Gilvray's creek. I arrived at the mouth of the creek with about eighty of the front of the column; for want of orders I ≈øtaid ≈øome time there, when a ≈øuperior officer hoi≈øted the flag, and ≈øurrendered the party.</p>
               <p>Q. Who was the officer that ≈øurrendered the party?</p>
               <p>A. Major John Haber≈øham.</p>
               <p>Q. What number did your brigade con≈øi≈øt of?</p>
               <p>A. I can't certainly tell, I believe upwards of 300.</p>
               <p>Q. Were only the eighty men you mention, who arrived with you at the creek, included in the ≈øurrender of Major Haber≈øham?</p>
               <p>A. The greater part of tho≈øe who went into town had by that time arrived at the creek, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the ≈øurrender.</p>
               <p>Q. To what number of troops did Major Haber≈øham ≈øurrender?</p>
               <p>A. The greate≈øt part of the enemy's army had by that time arrived.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee Colonel Elbert, after he left you to look for the pa≈øs?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were the head of the brigade, what occa≈øioned the brigade to leave the line of march, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in the di≈øpo≈øition:</p>
               <p>A. Colonel Elbert was at the head of the brigade, when they left the route pointed out in orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from the time you took up the line of march, until the time you left the route laid down in the di≈øpo≈øition, ≈øee General Howe, or either of his Aids, with Colonel Elbert?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. When your brigade left the route, was the front of it at its proper di≈øtance in the general column?</p>
               <p>A. The brigade had halted to form by files; this had occa≈øioned the brigade to fall about 3 or 400 yards in the rear of the artillery.</p>
               <p>Q. Had General Elbert been ab≈øent from the column from the time you took up the line of march, till you left the route laid down in the di≈øpo≈øition?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the march by files a part of the general di≈øpo≈øition given out?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. What time did the firing commence at the landing?</p>
               <p>A. About ≈øun-ri≈øe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017772_0005_0FA2BC42F4409A28"/>Q. by General Howe. Where was the Georgia brigade ordered to break into files?</p>
               <p>A. Nigh the burying-ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there ≈øome roads which led into Savanna not far from the burying-ground?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee me at that place?</p>
               <p>A. No; I ≈øaw you a little time before pa≈øs the brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me ≈øpeak to the officers and men as I pa≈ø≈øed the brigade?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the men in good order when I pa≈ø≈øed them?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear me, in general terms, commend the order the troops were in?</p>
               <p>A. I think I did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any troops employed to break up the ground in front of the line?</p>
               <p>A. Detachments were ≈øent out the night before the action for that and other purpo≈øes.</p>
               <p>Q. What part of the town did the troops break into?</p>
               <p>A. About the centre.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the part of the ≈øwamp, where the enemy cro≈ø≈øed to attack the militia on the right, commonly known to be pa≈ø≈øable?</p>
               <p>A. I had always under≈øtood it was impa≈ø≈øable.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. What time did the firing commence on the right with the militia, under Colonel Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?</p>
               <p>A. I can't exactly tell; about two o'clock.</p>
               <p>Q. What mea≈øures were taken to prevent the enemy's advance from the landing, and what oppo≈øition was made?</p>
               <p>A. Several detachments went from the line after the enemy had landed; I do not know for what purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Are you acquainted with the ≈øituation of Girardeau's plantation?</p>
               <p>A. I have been there frequently, but am not perfectly acquainted with its ≈øituation.</p>
               <p>Q. Is there a large extent of rice-fields before it, and are tho≈øe fields perfectly level?</p>
               <p>A. There is an exten≈øive plain of rice-fields before it.</p>
               <p>Q. How wide do you think it is from Girardeau's hou≈øe to the landing-place?</p>
               <p>A. I can't really ≈øay; I ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe about three quarters or a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Are there any cau≈øeways through that rice-field?</p>
               <p>A. There are a great number of banks pa≈ø≈øable.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you ever in the rice-field?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. What nature of ground is the field in general?</p>
               <p>A. Wet at times, but pa≈ø≈øable for infantry.</p>
               <p>Q. When the retreat was ordered, what was the order of march directed?</p>
               <p>A. In one column.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they move off in that order?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. by Court. Was the road through which the column marched practicable for a larger front than a file?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; large enough for any platoon.</p>
               <p>Q by General Howe. Did the troops keep in good order while they remained in column?</p>
               <p>A. They were in perfect good order whil≈øt in column.</p>
               <p>Q. When you arrived at the creek, did you attempt to pa≈øs it?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any action between our troops and the enemy at Springhill defile?</p>
               <p>A. I was not there; I heard a firing, which I ≈øuppo≈øed to be there.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you then?</p>
               <p>A. Near M'Gilvray's creek.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</p>

               <head>DECEMBER <hi>15</hi>th.</head>
               <p>The Court met according to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Nicholas White produced to the Court a general order, appointing him to act as Judge Advocate, <hi>vice</hi> Captain Walker, who≈øe indi≈øpo≈øition obliged him to retire, after which he was ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Major Lucas's te≈øtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Why did you not pa≈øs the creek?</p>
               <p>A. For want of orders.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you hear from the enemy, when a pri≈øoner, by what means they di≈øcovered the pa≈øs on my right?</p>
               <p>A. I heard, when among them, it reported, that a Negroe had di≈øcovered to the commanding officer the defile by which they pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. by Court. Whether, from your knowledge of the rice-fields near Mr. Girardeau's hou≈øe, was it ea≈øy to overflow them with water?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Could you have cro≈ø≈øed the creek with your party, had you been ordered to do it?</p>
               <p>A. I could have cro≈ø≈øed my≈øelf by ≈øwimming, and ≈øuch of my party as could ≈øwim, with the lo≈øs of our arms and accoutrements. On my arrival at the creek I met with Captain Day, of the Georgia line, who was then taking off his boots on purpo≈øe to cro≈øs the creek; I a≈øked him if he had ≈øeen the commanding officer; he ≈øaid he had not, but that I was his commanding officer, and would act as I thought proper; on which he put on his boots and joined me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:017772_0006_0FA2BC4614C15AC0"/>Q. Was it before, or upon the retreat, that the damage was done to the Georgia brigade by the enemy's artillery?</p>
               <p>A. Upon the retreat.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned to Thur≈øday morning, ten o'clock.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Wereat being under a nece≈ø≈øity of leaving the city of Philadelphia, the Judge Advocate, on behalf of the pro≈øecution, and Major General Howe in his own right, and by direction of the General Court-Martial, agreed to take his depo≈øition before one of the Ju≈øtices of the Peace for the city of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. The Judge Advocate having a≈øked Mr. Wereat the different que≈øtions propo≈øed by the Delegates of the State of Georgia, and he an≈øwering them in the negative, being a private citizen, the Judge Advocate did not think it nece≈ø≈øary to a≈øk Mr. Wereat any further que≈øtions on behalf of the pro≈øecution. Then the following que≈øtions were put by General Howe:</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect that the inhabitants of the town were advi≈øed by me to remove their effects, for fear of accident?</p>
               <p>A. I believe it was hinted to the inhabitants to provide again≈øt the wor≈øt by removing their effects; that many did remove part of their property, and more would have done ≈øo, could they have procured boats and carriages for that purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the mora≈øs below Tatnall's gate, in front of the po≈øition of the troops on the 29th of December, and the ground on the other ≈øide of it?</p>
               <p>A. I am well acquainted with the road leading from Savanna by Tatnall's to the place where the enemy landed. Some di≈øtance below Tatnall's gate there is a cau≈øeway through a mora≈øs, or very boggy ≈øwamp, which I believe is not pa≈ø≈øable for a footman above the cau≈øeway, and but with difficulty below it.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with that part of the ≈øwamp where the enemy pa≈ø≈øed on my right, and if you are, plea≈øe to de≈øcribe it?</p>
               <p>A. I knew nothing of the ≈øwamp by which the enemy pa≈ø≈øed at that time, but have been through it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ≈øince. It was not wide, but a thicket, and boggy. The French, at the ≈øiege of Savanna, made it pa≈ø≈øable, by laying poles acro≈øs it.</p>
               <p>Q. What are the landing places above and below my po≈øition at Fair-Lawn, and is there any approach by Haner's mill, and if there is, where does it come into the town?</p>
               <p>A. There were a variety of landing-places, both above and below the place of the enemy's landing at Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardeau's; namely, Co≈øtin's Bluff, Half-moon Bluff, Mulbryne's and Thunderbolt, below, the former called three, and the latter five miles from Savanna by land, and may be ≈øomething more. Above, and by way of the Back river, there are Rae's and M'Gilvray's landings, the former five, and the latter two miles by land from Savanna, and five intermediate landing-places between them. All the≈øe landings, both above and below, are on high land, with roads leading from them towards Savanna. There is a road that goes round near Haner's mill, and comes in by the barracks. It was a very good one in September and October 1779.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the extent of the rice-field between Girardeau's hou≈øe and the river; are there any cau≈øeways leading through it to the high land, be≈øide that leading directly to the hou≈øe, and was the rice-field it≈øelf pa≈ø≈øable for infantry or not?</p>
               <p>A. The di≈øtance from Girardeau's hou≈øe on the high land to the river I believe to be about half a mile, perhaps a little more. I believe there were other banks, be≈øide the main one, that led directly from the landing to the hou≈øe. The field was exten≈øive, and the effects of the north-we≈øterly winds, that prevailed for ≈øeveral days before the approach of the enemy, kept the tides low, and I believe made the rice-field pa≈ø≈øable for infantry any where but acro≈øs creeks.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the rice-field, about the 29th December, have been ea≈øily overflown, and would or would not the ≈øluices, if they had been overflown, been under the command of the cannon of the enemy's ≈øhipping?</p>
               <p>A. This que≈øtion is an≈øwered in part by the preceding an≈øwer. The we≈øterly winds always make low tides, and there is no other way of flowing the fields, had the dams and ≈øluices been in good order, which I have rea≈øon to believe was not the ca≈øe; but if they were, the enemy had the ab≈øolute command of them by their ve≈ø≈øel.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Governor of Georgia conte≈øt the command with me until after my taking po≈øition near Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall's hou≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. The Governor (Hou≈øton) of Georgia did contend for the command, and relinqui≈øhed it (as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood and believed) after the enemy appeared in the river, and only a day or two before they landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops halted at Treutlan's plantation, the bridges between that and Savanna pre≈øerved, and were any parties ≈øent down the country for that purpo≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. I well remember the halt at Treutlan's about 36 miles above Savanna, either two or three nights, and one night at a plantation about a mile di≈øtant from Treutlan's, to the be≈øt of my recollection. The bridges were not taken up, and I remember to have heard General Howe ≈øay, that he would not put it out of the power of the inhabitants to remove; and from what he ≈øaid, I believe the ≈øecurity of the inhabitants and their property was the rea≈øon that the bridges were not de≈øtroyed, and I know that much property and ≈øome of the inhabitants were ≈øecured by this precaution. I al≈øo remember that a party of hor≈øe was ≈øent to Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer-bridge, as I under≈øtood, to guard that pa≈øs, and give notice of the approach of the enemy.</p>

Howe and the Judge Advocate con≈øented.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Judge Advocate. Were you in the army in Georgia under the orders of General Howe the latter end of 1778, when the enemy invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was in the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a private on hor≈øe-back, for the purpo≈øe of reconnoitering.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ≈øteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy's landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing, commonly called Brewton's plantations.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the oppo≈øition that was made to their landing?</p>
               <p>A. No; I heard there was a party of men there that fired upon them, and killed two or three of them.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the main body of the army when the enemy landed, and what di≈øtance was it from the place of landing?</p>
               <p>A. At a plantation called Fair-Lawn, about a mile from Savanna, and about a mile and a quarter from the place of landing by the main road, and about three quarters of a mile upon a ≈øtrait line acro≈øs the fields.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. I was told they landed from 2500 to 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they land at any other place?</p>
               <p>A. Not to my knowledge.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were you po≈øted that day?</p>
               <p>A. In the fore part of the day, as I was on hor≈øe-back, I was ordered out to reconnoitre, and at the time of action I was with the militia, on the right of the continentals about three quarters of a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay exactly; but from information, there were ≈øeveral, both above and below, where they might have landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any ≈øteps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at tho≈øe places?</p>
               <p>A. I was one of a party of mounted militia that was ≈øent down to a place called the Oy≈øter-hou≈øe, upon Augu≈øtine creek, to watch the motions of the enemy, where we remained one night.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was known that the enemy had landed, what mea≈øures were taken to a≈øcertain their numbers, and to oppo≈øe them?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know what mea≈øures were taken to a≈øcertain their numbers; but as I was returning from the Oy≈øter-hou≈øe, I met Colonel M'Into≈øh, with a party of men, po≈øted about half a mile from where the enemy landed, and about three quarters of a mile from the main army.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the place where the enemy landed known in time, and was it defen≈øible?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know whether it was known in time or not, and can't ≈øay whether it was defen≈øible or not, having never been on the ground.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force was ≈øtationed there, and the re≈øi≈øtance made?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the po≈øition of the army the be≈øt po≈ø≈øible to have been taken for the defence of the town?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay, not being acquainted with military affairs.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the pa≈ø≈øes leading indirectly to the town ≈øecured?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They came through a ≈øwamp oppo≈øite to where the militia was po≈øted, and on their di≈øcovering the militia they immediately formed, to the number of about 300, and ru≈øhed on, and there was little or no re≈øi≈øtance made by the militia when they broke and di≈øper≈øed.</p>
               <p>Q. How many of our troops were taken, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I was informed there were 300 pri≈øoners taken, and the rea≈øon of it was, they had gone below the pa≈øs at Spring-hill, and could not cro≈øs M'Gilvray's creek.</p>
               <p>Q. How many cannon and what ≈øtores were lo≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øay.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army cro≈øs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the troops at Augu≈øta and Sunbury ordered to leave the State, and by who≈øe orders?</p>
               <p>A. On the night of the 29th of December I met an officer of the rank of Captain, I think his name was Mo≈øeby, who informed me that he was going with orders to the commanding officer at Sunbury to evacuate that po≈øt, by order of General Howe.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Were you with the militia po≈øted on the right, to oppo≈øe the pa≈ø≈øage of the enemy through the ≈øwamp on the 29th of December?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know Colonel Walton?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I know him.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee him at the po≈øt where the enemy cro≈ø≈øed the ≈øwamp, or any where in the field in the cour≈øe of that day?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect that I did, except in the fore part of the day, before the militia took po≈øt at the ≈øwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. When the militia broke, had the enemy fired on them?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did they quit the field?</p>
               <p>A. In a very di≈øorderly and irregular manner, and with the greate≈øt expedition</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:017772_0008_0FA2BC47896FE4C0"/>Q. Do you know of any orders given by Colonel Walton before or at the advance of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any parties ≈øent from Treutlan's plantation to guard the bridges between that and Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I believe there was a party ≈øent to guard one bridge between Ebenezer and Treutlan's plantation.</p>

               <p>Colonel George Walton ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Were you in the American army in Georgia, at the time the Briti≈øh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act, and under who≈øe command did you conceive your≈øelf to be?</p>
               <p>A. As a ≈øenior Colonel of the militia of the State, I was under the immediate command of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor until the 24th of December, 1778, on which day the Governor, by public orders, relinqui≈øhed the command to Major General Howe, and ordered the militia to receive and obey his orders; which as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Commandant of the militia I did, altho' the Governor i≈ø≈øued orders to the militia afterwards.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long, previous to the inva≈øion of Georgia, General Howe received intelligence of the de≈øigns of the enemy, and what ≈øteps were taken by him in con≈øequence?</p>
               <p>A. Some time about the middle of November, or a few days later, in the year 1778, part of the Briti≈øh troops from Ea≈øt Florida arrived at Sunbury by way of Colonel's i≈øland, while another penetrated the State by land. They evidently expected to have co-operated with a northern force, which not having arrived, they ≈øoon retreated. About the ≈øame time, or a few days after, a tran≈øport ve≈ø≈øel put into Tybee, which had been ≈øeparated from a fleet convoying troops of the enemy from New-York, under the conduct of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Campbell; but this ve≈ø≈øel al≈øo finding that fleet not arrived, again put to ≈øea, not, however, until ≈øhe had <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> a man to de≈øert to us. This man gave a particular and circum≈øtantial account of the fleet and troops coming from New-York, and was generally believed. As a proof, it was made the foundation of an act of the Governor and Council, appointing Dr. Hall and my≈øelf to go to General Lincolt, who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived or expected at Charle≈øtown, in order to communicate this intelligence, as well as the general condition of the State. General Howe being in South-Carolina, and advices of this having been tran≈ømitted to that State, I take it for granted that he had the information as early as others; but when, or by whom he received it, is impo≈ø≈øible for me to tell, and what ≈øteps were taken by him in con≈øequence. I cannot a≈øcertain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely the day on which General Howe arrived at Savanna. It did not appear that he was expected, as it was under≈øtood, by the arrival of the Georgia delegates from Congre≈øs, that he had been recalled from his command in that department, and Major General Lincoln appointed to it. He, however, did come, rea≈ø≈øumed the command, and gave a≈ø≈øurances that he would defend the town, and that there was little danger. The Carolina troop; which came ≈øome time after united with the troops of Georgia, and an encampment formed in a line, leading from near Tatnall's hou≈øe towards the fort at the Tru≈øtees gardens. And here the army lay until the afternoon of the 29th December, when the enemy made their attack. During this time, General Howe went ≈øeveral times to reconnoitre Girardeau's hill, Cau≈øtin's Bluff, and the banks of Augu≈øtine creek, lower down. I was with him more than once, and generally under≈øtood that it was his opinion that the enemy would land at Cau≈øtin's Bluff, on account of the landing being good, and approachable by water two ways.</p>
               <p>A large wood, which lies between that and the town, I under≈øtood was to have been cut down to ob≈øtruct the enemy's progre≈øs by that route; but it was never done.</p>
               <p>On the 28th December, in the afternoon, the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels ≈øailed up the Savanna river, con≈øiderably above the entrance of Augu≈øtine creek, which looked as if the landing was intended to be higher up; and in the evening, ≈øome time before ≈øun-≈øet, the Vigilante with heavy metal, and ≈øome other ve≈ø≈øels, ca≈øt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor oppo≈øite Girardeau's cau≈øeway, which operated as a general demon≈øtration of their intention to land there. As the ≈øun was ≈øetting. I accompanied General Howe and the principal officers of the army down to the Bluff oppo≈øite. Upon that occa≈øion I under≈øtood that it was judged that the enemy would land there, and that works were to be thrown up in the night, and the cau≈øeway defended, but it was not done. The only force ≈øent there, I under≈øtood, was a few men in the nature of a picquet. After we returned from the Bluff, I went to the militia which were at the fort, and pre≈øently afterwards received orders from one of General Howe's family (Major Grimkie I believe) to keep the militia upon the ground where they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til morning, and then to move them and take po≈øt to the left of the Georgia brigade, commanded by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Elbert; but in the morning I received orders (but whether from the ≈øame Aid or not I do not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect) to remove back in the common and wait further orders, for that the balls from the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels fell frequently on Elbert's left, and the militia would be expo≈øed. As the morning of the 29th opened, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were ≈øeen to move from their ve≈ø≈øels in boats, and to land at the lower end of the cau≈øeway; and yet no alteration, that I know of or believe, took place in the arrangement and po≈øition of the American army.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017772_0009_0FA2BC48367FF338"/>
The enemy marched along a narrow cau≈øeway, upwards of half a mile in length, with a deep ditch on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, and in fight of the army, without any other oppo≈øition than what was made by the ≈ømall corps or picquet I have mentioned. They a≈øcended a ≈øteep bluff, and took po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the highe≈øt grounds about Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanna, and there deliberately formed their army. Being ignorant of what was really intended to be done, and tired with the ≈øu≈øpen≈øe in which I had ≈øo long remained, ≈øome time in the afternoon I took Colonels Bri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane and Martin, who had engaged to act with me that day, down upon the bluff on the left of the army, with a view to ob≈øerve the motions of the enemy, who began to make ≈øome tittle parade on the rice-fields, as though an attempt was de≈øigned upon our left by way of the fort. I in≈øtantly formed the conjecture that it was a deception, and that they would attempt our right by the way of the pa≈øs to Milledge's old field, and I immediately determined to order the militia that way, and mentioned it to them, and ≈øaid that I would then go to General Howe, let him know what I had done, and my fears of the de≈øigns of the enemy. I pre≈øently found the General at the right of the army, and immediately a≈øked him if he was not afraid that the light troops of the enemy would get round upon our right? he told me that he was not, for that he had fortified the only pa≈øs below Tatnall's hou≈øe. I a≈øked him where that work was? and he pointed to the place. I told him that the enemy would not attempt to cro≈øs the ≈øwamp there; that there was a very ea≈øy dry pa≈øs lower down, and more convenient for the enemy. He ≈øaid I was ≈øurely mi≈øtaken, and de≈øired me to go and look at the work he had cau≈øed to be thrown up. I rode down, examined it, and returned to the General, repeating what I had fir≈øt ≈øaid; and ≈øeeing that he had confidence that this work had been thrown up at the proper place, the more certainly to convince him, I made u≈øe of the following expre≈ø≈øions, or words to the like purpo≈øe:
<q>General, in order that you may be convinced that what I ≈øay to you is true, I a≈ø≈øert to you, upon my honor, that before the war I have frequently cro≈ø≈øed the pa≈øs I mean in a chair, with young ladies, picking je≈ø≈øamines.</q>
This had the de≈øired effect; he appeared convinced, a≈øked me where my regiment was; I told him I had moved it to the right; he thanked and de≈øired me to go and reconnoitre the pa≈øs I had mentioned. I in≈øtantly went off, and as I entered the ≈øwamp along that pa≈øs, I perceived the Briti≈øh light infantry hopping over the little difficulties with great agility. I was perceived, but not fired at. Fore≈øeeing that the enemy would be ≈øoon round, I rode full ≈øpeed with the intelligence to the ground where the militia hor≈øe were po≈øted, and ≈øent it to General Howe (but by whom I do not recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I believe there were ≈øeveral that rode off with it) and followed immediately after my≈øelf, and reported to the General him≈øelf, that the enemy were in force on our right. I was ordered to the militia, in the front of which, at about 70 or 80 yards, the enemy formed the line of two deep, in numbers, as appeared then and ≈øince, about 350. Once or twice a field piece had already been di≈øcharged at the enemy, and ≈øome execution done, when Colonel Marbury rode up and told me, that General Howe ordered me to attack the light infantry immediately. I told him the field-piece was already directed again≈øt them, and, pointing to the ≈ømallne≈øs of my numbers, which was then under 100 men, and at the time in ≈øome little confu≈øion, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I beg you to give my compliments to the General, and a≈ø≈øure him that I will do every thing in my power; but I do mo≈øt earne≈øtly entreat that he will either wheel one of the brigade's round, or only ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me with a ≈øingle company of continental troops, to countenance the militia. He went off, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently after the enemy in my front opened their line, and commenced a heavy fire of mu≈øketry upon my ≈ømall corps, which obliged it to retire, and which it did in ≈øafety, ≈øave tho≈øe killed or maimed upon the field. Having a thigh broke in the action, I took the re≈øolution of endeavouring to get into town, and cro≈ø≈øed the General in his retreat, the whole army having been removed from their field po≈øition without waiting the attack of Colonel Campbell, except artillery, or turning the right, and attacking the light infantry under Sir James Baird.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walton's te≈øtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. From all the information which had been received, it appeared that the 71≈øt Briti≈øh regiment and Delancey's brigade of American recruits were part of the enemy's army, by which it was concluded by every body that they were in force. From the fort where the militia were in the dawn of the morning of the 29th, the enemy's light infantry were plainly ≈øeen to land at the lower end of the cau≈øeway, and to march up and take po≈øt at the Bluff, where the ≈ømall number of troops or picquet was po≈øted. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned what their numbers were. I did not perceive that any more troops were landed until they gained that po≈øt, and then the debarkation continued until the invading army was compleated, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be about two o'clock in the afternoon, to the be≈øt of my recollection. I do not know their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but believe them to have been 2000 at lea≈øt. I under≈øtood, that before they advanced the enemy had been reconnoitered by Major Moore, and that he reported to the General that there were upwards of 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compo≈øition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. The army under the command of Major General Howe was compo≈øed of a brigade of continental troops from South-Carolina, the Georgia brigade, and the militia under my command. The number of either of the brigades I do not know, and by con≈øequence neither their amount when combined; but I believe the whole together were le≈øs than 1000 men, including Colonel Roberts's artillery, which I forgot to mention.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. I have already mentioned, that I had formed the conjecture ≈øome time in the afternoon of that day, that the enemy intended to endeavour to gain our right by Milledge's pa≈øs; and of cour≈øe I expected that the main body would approach our line by the road leading from Savanna to the Governor's gate, as a brigade of ours was po≈øted on either ≈øide of that road, while the artillery was placed in its centre. When the light infantry had gained the pa≈øs on the right, and had received a fire from the field piece with me,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017772_0010_0FA2BC48F4261130"/>
it appeared that the enemy's artillery, taking this for the ≈øignal, was advanced, and began to play at long ≈øhot upon our line, which I under≈øtood was done by our artillery at the ≈øame time. No doubt the infantry was al≈øo advancing, but not being pre≈øent, I could not ≈øee them. I always under≈øtood, however, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the retreat was ordered and in execution before they came within fighting di≈øtance.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. That part of the army with me retreated towards the Spring-hill and Sheftall's tan-yard; but being unable to proceed with them, I turned off towards town. I under≈øtood they retreated by tho≈øe routes. About midway from the ≈øouth-we≈øt corner of the town and the Spring-hill, being faint, I was taken from my hor≈øe. After recovering, which was almo≈øt immediately, I perceived ≈øcattered troops and citizens out of the town running and riding in great di≈øorder towards that hill. The mu≈øket-bullets then began to reach the place where I lay, but ≈øeemed to be ≈øpent. Before I was taken down, one of General Howe's Aids (Captain Turner) pa≈ø≈øed me, going towards the hill; and pre≈øently after the General him≈øelf. Major Grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie and ≈øome others came up. I then learned that the day was wholly unfortunate. Having found my≈øelf better, and the light infantry which had driven the militia from their ground having pu≈øhed in towards the town, with an evident view to cut off the rear of our army, I de≈øired the General to leave me, and was put again upon my hor≈øe, and proceeded as fa≈øt as po≈ø≈øible to Mr. Watts's, in Yamacraw. Ju≈øt as I got there, I ≈øaw a number of the Georgia troops running along the ≈øtreet towards Nunez's creek in the like confu≈øion. I did then ≈øuppo≈øe that ≈øome mode of cro≈ø≈øing it had been e≈øtabli≈øhed, as it was a work of ≈øcarce an hour, by throwing over it a piece of ≈øcantling; but I under≈øtood ≈øoon afterwards that many of them were captured upon its banks, it not having been then, or indeed at any other time fordable.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment. Major Dexter ≈øworn as a Member, in the room of Major Moore, who≈øe indi≈øpo≈øition obliged him to retire.</p>
               <p>Colonel Walton's te≈øtimony continued.</p>
               <p>Q. What wat the lo≈øs in men, cannon and ≈øtores, and by what means were they lo≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know particularly the lo≈øs in either. I have ≈øeen a return made by each of the Brigades, the amount of both was ≈øomewhere about 300, tho' I do not exactly recollect; they were chiefly lo≈øt by capture. The army were kept with an apparent view of fighting the enemy; but the enemy having got in the rear of the right of the line before any attack was made in front, the continental line was ordered to retreat. Before it was effected, the enemy on our right defeated the militia under my command, and part of them pu≈øhed in upon their flank. I afterwards ≈øaw the rear broken and retreating towards Nunez's, as I have before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. I believe that mo≈øt of the cannon in the town and in the field were lo≈øt; how many were ≈øaved I cannot tell, being a pri≈øoner. The one with the militia was abandoned upon being overpowered by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. With regard to tho≈øe in the town, as well as the ≈øtores in general, they appeared to me to have been lo≈øt by the jealou≈øies and a ≈øupinene≈øs which characterize and tincture the tran≈øactions of that time. Mutual applications, complaints and reproaches, between the Governor of the State and the General, took place of real exertion, and the cannon and ≈øtores were not removed; in con≈øequence fell into the enemy's hands.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army cro≈øs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu≈øta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. No; I do not po≈øitively.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. In the year 1773, Government ordered a return of the men to be made from the age of 16 to 60, as I recollect, and by that return it appears that there were two thou≈øand five or ≈øix hundred men, the preci≈øe number I do not recollect. Since that return was made, there was a con≈øiderable augmentation of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to the we≈øtward, but I do not believe they made up for the number of fugitive tories that ≈øought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from the enemy from the lower country. So that I ≈øuppo≈øe that at that day the number of fighting men might be nearly equal with that returned in 1773, or not ≈øo much.</p>
               <p>Q. When the inva≈øion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque≈øted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:017772_0011_0FA2BC4B9A7BA1F0"/>Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. The pro≈øpect of lo≈øing the town and the neighbouring country, I believe, prevented many from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the army, they being employed in removing their families and property from the more ≈øouthern parts, except about Sunbury, as well as in the neighbourhood of Savanna; and whether tho≈øe from the we≈øtward had been called for in tim I do not know, but there were a very ≈ømall proportion in ≈øervice upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion. What number were in arms with the corps at Sunbury I do not know. I had under my command at Savanna, including infantry, artillery and the company of hor≈øe, which I did not include in my former e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ≈øomething above 100 men; the preci≈øe number I cannot a≈øcertain. I believe another cau≈øe why the militia was backward upon that occa≈øion was, the di≈øputes already ≈øugge≈øted between the Governor and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the army provided with tools to erect the works propo≈øed at Girardeau's Bluff?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. You mention your party being in confu≈øion at the time you were ordered to attack the Briti≈øh light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry. What was the occa≈øion of that confu≈øion?</p>
               <p>A. The ≈øuperior numbers of the enemy who were drawn up in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any previous di≈øpo≈øitions made by General Howe in ca≈øe of retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I do not, I never received any orders to retreat.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee the General's orders i≈ø≈øued previous to the affair of the 29th?</p>
               <p>A. I did not; the only general order I ≈øaw was that putting the militia in general orders <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
                  </gap> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental command, to the be≈øt of my recollection.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Milledge's pa≈øs from the po≈øt then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</p>
               <p>A. I have already ≈øaid that the head of the ≈øecond branch was about a mile di≈øtant from town, and from thence about half a mile to the pa≈øs; ≈øo that the pa≈øs being about a mile and an half from town, in the circuit of the path, and the po≈øition of General Howe's main body being below the town, the circuit would be continued about one quarter of a mile farther; therefore, to the be≈øt of my judgment, the di≈øtance was about one mile and three quarters.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the general face of the country over which the enemy pa≈ø≈øed to make their attack?</p>
               <p>A. In the front of the American line lay a bed or row of ≈øprings, which formed to the le≈øt a gut extending to the river, whil≈øt tho≈øe which lay more to the right make a mar≈øh in the oppo≈øite direction. Immediately below Tatnall's fence, it a≈ø≈øumes the appearance of a ≈øwamp (by which I mean low, watry and miry ground, largely wooded and thickly underbru≈øhed.) At the commencement of this ≈øwamp, that is a little below Tatnall's fence, was the ≈ømall work which the General had cau≈øed to be thrown up on his right, and which, by his de≈øire, I examined. To the right of that work, about half a mile, to the be≈øt of my judgment, though I never traver≈øed it in a direct line, is the pa≈øs acro≈øs the ≈øwamp to Milledge's old field. The dull way or path which leads from town to this pa≈øs begins its cour≈øe about oppo≈øite the burying-ground, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in a ≈øouthern direction until it gains the head of a ≈øecond mar≈øhy branch, about one mile di≈øtant from town, to the be≈øt of my judgment. It then turns down that branch in a north-ea≈øt direction to the pa≈øs, in di≈øtance about half a mile, to the be≈øt of my judgment. From the other, or ea≈øtern ≈øide, to the Governor's gate, is about three quarters of a mile, or not quite ≈øo much, at which place the path u≈øed to enter the great road; but latterly, and before that day, mo≈øt of the old fields, and all the ground lying between that and the gate, had been enclo≈øed and under cultivation. At this cro≈ø≈øing-place, the waters appear to me to have forced them≈øelves into a ≈øingle bed, and to form a kind of running branch of creek, over which there appears to have been once a wooden bridge; but ≈øince my remembrance, there were only two or three ≈øleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or logs acro≈øs. On my way from reporting to the General, and before I got quite up to my command, Colonel William M'Into≈øh, who commanded the hor≈øe that day, cried out that the enemy were cro≈ø≈øing the branch, which I that moment perceived. It was the branch neare≈øt to town, and the place they cro≈ø≈øed ≈øome little di≈øtance below the path-way, ≈øay about 100 or 150 yards. I take it, they ≈øtept over upon roots and high tufts, which are common in the mar≈øhy branches of that country. Upon their cro≈ø≈øing this branch, I neither went or ≈øent to the General, becau≈øe, from the intelligence I had already given, it was an event he mu≈øt have expected, and that it would have been pre≈øently announced by firing.</p>
               <p>Q Did you ever mention to General Howe Milledge's pa≈øs previous to the day of action?</p>
               <p>A. I do not remember to have mentioned it to him until the time I have already mentioned. The fir≈øt object was to guard again≈øt the enemy's landing, which occupied my mind; and after they had landed at Girardeau's, I was not with the General until the time I have mentioned, as I recollect. When I went down, in the anxiety I have heretofore related, the fir≈øt enquiry was re≈øpecting that pa≈øs.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the rea≈øons that prevented your ≈øeeing the general orders on the day of attack?</p>
               <p>A. I know of no particular rea≈øon; the militia had but lately been put under continental command, and I was not in the practice of going for orders, nor were they ≈øent to me.</p>
               <p>Q. Whether the ≈øhores above Nunez's creek were equally practicable for the enemy to land as tho≈øe below?</p>
               <p>A. The ≈øhores or bluffs above Nunez's creek are not ≈øo ≈øteep and abrupt as the hill at Girardeau's; but the navigation to them is much more difficult. Mu≈øgrove's or Nunez's creek was more difficult to cro≈øs by an enemy, than the ob≈øtruction below the town.</p>

               <p>Q. Was the town of Savanna fortified in any degree?</p>
               <p>A. The town it≈øelf was not fortified. At the north-ea≈øt point of the Tru≈øtees gardens, a fort had been ≈øome con≈øiderable time before erected, and ≈øome pieces of 18 pound cannon and others of le≈øs ≈øize planted in it, for the evident defence of the town. I do not recollect any other works, except tho≈øe ≈ølightly thrown up in the field upon that occa≈øion.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:017772_0012_0FA2BC4CAA9DF150"/>Q. When General Howe gave a≈ø≈øurance of defending the town, did you under≈øtand from him upon what principles he meant to defend it?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the principles upon which the defence of the town was undertaken, in any military point of view. I heard General Howe ≈øay, in pre≈øence of a number of the inhabitants of the town, on the 23th or 26th preceding the attack, I forget which, that the enemy's army was compo≈øed of raw boys from the Highlands and of Delancey's green-coats, who would not fight, and that he did not care if they were double the number.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Do you know at what time the Governor of Georgia informed me that the militia was under my command?</p>
               <p>A. The orders by which the militia were put under continental command were dated the 24th December, and the next day, to the be≈øt of my recollection, the militia were put in general orders; hence I conclude that the General mu≈øt have been informed the evening of the 24th.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any body of militia join you, be≈øides tho≈øe of your own regiment?</p>
               <p>A. About 20 men, a few more or le≈øs, I cannot recollect, came down from the neighbourhood of Ebene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer; but whether they were with me on the day of attack or not I forget. Some gentlemen from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try were volunteers.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you proceed with Dr. Hall to South-Carolina, agreeable to the re≈øolution of the Governor and Council.</p>
               <p>A. I did not. Dr. Hall was not at fir≈øt ready, and when he was, I de≈øired him to proceed; that having much better hor≈øes, I could go much fa≈øter: The evening preceding the day I was to have ≈øet out, an expre≈øs arrived from Skidaway, announcing the arrival of a fleet upon the coa≈øt. I then deemed it improper to leave my regiment.</p>
               <p>Q. When General Provo≈øt fir≈øt penetrated the State of Georgia with troops, did I repair to that State?</p>
               <p>A. I have already mentioned that General Howe was in South-Carolina, and expected to go to the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. When the troops from Ea≈øt-Florida fir≈øt came into the State, neither the General nor General Elbert was in the State. He came, as I now recollect, ≈øoon after the retreat of the enemy from pur≈øuing our troops to Ogechee hill.</p>
               <p>Q. Was I with the troops at the ≈øouth ≈øide of Ogechee river, when you were there with the militia?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. When you and your party returned, did you not leave me at that place?</p>
               <p>A. I remember that the militia under my command did duty upon the hill at Ogechee with the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal troops under the command of Major General Howe, and I believe when they returned the army was left upon that ground.</p>
               <p>Q. After the report ≈øuppo≈øed to be from a de≈øerter, was a body of Carolina militia, under the command of Colonel Bull, marched to Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I remember that Colonel Bull came over into Georgia with a body of South-Carolina militia; but I do not recollect the particular time, or upon who≈øe application they came over.</p>
               <p>Q. Were a detachment of Carolina continental infantry and artillery marched into Georgia, ≈øub≈øequent to a report of an intended inva≈øion, and previous to the inva≈øion?</p>
               <p>A. With regard to the fir≈øt, I do not know when any continental artillery or infantry were marched into Georgia, ≈øub≈øequent to the report of an inva≈øion; previous to the attack both infantry and artillery arrived. There might have been a detachment there ≈øooner.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any con≈øiderable time elap≈øe after a report made by the de≈øerter, without any further intelligence of an inva≈øion?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot a≈øcertain the preci≈øe time.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any other information received by the State of an inva≈øion, be≈øides that of the de≈øerter?</p>
               <p>A. At this di≈øtance of time I do not recollect what particular informations were received. The inva≈øion was generally expected.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Governor and Council receive information from any per≈øon of the tran≈øport ve≈ø≈øel, except from the de≈øerter already mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the nature of the information received by the Governor and Council, nor from whom, not having been a member.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the apprehen≈øions of an inva≈øion in a great mea≈øure ≈øub≈øiding?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know or believe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the Carolina militia, after remaining ≈øome few days at the barracks, di≈ømi≈ø≈øed?</p>
               <p>A. I was chiefly out of town about that time, and do not know whether or by whom they were di≈ømi≈ø≈øed. They went ≈øoon away.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any regiments of militia of the State of Georgia, ≈øub≈øequent to the report of an inva≈øion, called forth by the State, and kept embodied?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect that I knew what Government did about that time as to ordering the militia to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied, but there was none in actual ≈øervice, except parts of my regiment occa≈øionally.</p>
               <p>Q. As you were in the A≈ø≈øembly, did you ≈øee any official letters of mine to the Legi≈ølature of the State, pointing out the weakne≈øs of it, and pre≈ø≈øing upon them the nece≈ø≈øity of fortifying it?</p>
               <p>A. I have ≈øeen ≈øeveral letters of the General to the Legi≈ølature of that State, without being able to advert to their particular objects; I believe one was advi≈øing fortifications.</p>
               <p>Q. After General Prevo≈øt retreated, previous to the arrival of Colonel Campbell, have you any knowledge of my applying to the Governor for hands, tools, and other materials for fortifying the State?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect to have had any particular knowledge of particular applications, but I verily believe that applications were made.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know whether the Negroe you met acted as a guide to the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. I looked upon him to be in the ≈øervice of the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there not various landing-places above the town of Savanna, which were acce≈ø≈øible by the back river?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017772_0013_0FA2BC4CBB805490"/>A. I have already ≈øaid, or meant to ≈øay, there were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any part of the hor≈øe remain with the militia on the right that day?</p>
               <p>A. When the enemy cro≈ø≈øed the branch and formed, I a≈øked for the hor≈øe, and was told by Colonel M'In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to≈øh that they had all been ≈øent different ways by the General. I had none at that time as I ≈øaw or recollect, except Colonel M'Into≈øh and Mr. O'Brian.</p>

               <head>JANUARY <hi>10</hi>th.</head>
               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Major Benjamin Porter ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Briti≈øh troops under the command of Colonel Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Major in the Georgia line previous to the inva≈øion, and on the 29th of December acted as a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteer Aid with General Howe, having re≈øigned my commi≈ø≈øion in the line five or ≈øix weeks before.</p>
               <p>Q. What ≈øteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. The troops were drawn up on a piece of ground called Fair-Lawn, nearly as ≈øome gentlemen have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented who were examined before me, and ≈øome guards po≈øted between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I believe one at the landing, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did the enemy land?</p>
               <p>A. At Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compo≈øition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. The number I do not certainly know, but I believe they were about 600, exclu≈øive of the militia; they con≈øi≈øted of the Georgia and South-Carolina troops.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy fir≈øt approached in front of our troops, but very little re≈øi≈øtance was made, as the troops retreated immediately after it was known the enemy were gaining our right.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The army retreated immediately after I reported to General Howe that the enemy were gaining our right, and in column, the South-Carolina in front, the artillery in the centre, and the Georgia in the rear.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lo≈øs in men, cannon and ≈øtores, and by what means were they lo≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. When, where and in what manner did the army cro≈øs Savanna river?</p>
               <p>A. The army cro≈ø≈øed Savanna river at the Si≈øters a few days after the 29th in boats.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu≈øta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confu≈øion in the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. Not the lea≈øt confu≈øion among the continental troops as long as I ≈øtaid with them, having left them near the burying-ground, at 3 or 400 yards from where the retreat commenced, and went into Savanna to di≈øpatch my ≈øervant with my baggage, whom I ordered to hold him≈øelf in readine≈øs.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What was the fir≈øt duty you were ≈øent upon, after being an extra Aid to me?</p>
               <p>A. To reconnoitre the enemy and the ground between Fair-Lawn and Girardeau's landing.</p>
               <p>Q. What guards were between the troops at Fair-Lawn and the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. There was one on the road leading to Girardeau's hou≈øe, another in a wood ≈øtill nearer to it, and I heard of and believe there was another at the landing before mentioned, as I heard a firing which appeared to be at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the di≈øtance from the po≈øition at Fair-Lawn to the place where the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. About a mile and a half.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the di≈øtance between Girardeau's hou≈øe and the landing place, and what is the nature of the ground?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øuppo≈øe it may be about 500 yards from the landing place to Girardeau's hou≈øe; there was a cau≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way leading directly from the landing to the hou≈øe; there were ≈øeveral ditches al≈øo leading thro' a rice-field different ways; the dirt thrown out of them made banks which appeared dry enough to walk on; ≈øo appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the field to be generally, tho' I was not on the field.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy's ≈øhipping command the landing-place?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I think effectually.</p>
               <p>Q. Are you acquainted with the mora≈øs in front of our po≈øition at Fair-Lawn, what is the nature of it, and of the ground on each ≈øide of it?</p>
               <p>A. I think I am acquainted with the nature of the ground, as I cro≈ø≈øed the creek in front of our troops that were drawn up near the mora≈øs, which appeared to me deep, and impracticable for troops to cro≈øs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. After the bridge was taken up, I found difficulty in getting my hor≈øe over, tho' planks were laid down for that purpo≈øe. The mora≈øs on each ≈øide of the creek, e≈øpecially on the ≈øide of Fair-Lawn, appeared very boggy, and I think impa≈ø≈øable for troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Could the mora≈øs directly in our front be ≈øeen by per≈øons approaching it until they came near it?</p>
               <p>A. I think not, as the mora≈øs was wide, the de≈øcent ≈øudden, and at a di≈øtance appeared like a plain.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, from any conver≈øation that pa≈ø≈øed between us, or from any other circum≈øtance, under≈øtand whether or not I was acquainted with the pa≈øs of which the enemy availed them≈øelves?</p>
               <p>A. I thought you were acquainted with the ground from your ≈øending me ≈øeveral times to vi≈øit it, and from your ≈øeeming apprehen≈øive of danger, ≈øhould the enemy pa≈øs that way. I don't know certainly to this minute where the enemy did pa≈øs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017772_0014_0FA2BC4D8FE67710"/>Q. Did I or did I not expre≈øs to you my apprehen≈øion of the enemy pa≈ø≈øing on my right, and de≈øired you and Major Dehey≈øer alternately to watch them clo≈øely?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect any particular conver≈øation on that ≈øubject, but well remember you ≈øent Major Dehey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øer and my≈øelf to examine the ground, which we did, and reported to you.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any hor≈øe po≈øted that way?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; there was a party of volunteer hor≈øe po≈øted in a wood, near the ≈øwamp on our right.</p>
               <p>Q. Did any parties patrole on our right?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I ≈øaw ≈øome hor≈øemen riding through the wood between where the party of hor≈øe was and the ≈øwamp.</p>
               <p>Q. When I was informed that the enemy was gaining my right, what ≈øteps were taken?</p>
               <p>A. I remember to have informed General Howe the enemy had pa≈ø≈øed the ≈øwamp on our right, when he ordered a retreat, and ≈øent me to take off a picquet which was po≈øted on our right, and direct the officer to take the neare≈øt route on the flanks of our army to Spring-hill defile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the orders for retreat given previous to any firing, or afterwards?</p>
               <p>A. Previous to any firing, except from Colonel Roberts's artillery, at a party of the enemy directly in front, as well as I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee me in the retreat, and what were your ob≈øervations?</p>
               <p>A. I ≈øaw you on the flanks of the army, and you appeared to be attentive to the troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Where did you join me after you had been ≈øent with orders to the picquet on the right?</p>
               <p>A. I joined you on the plain near the burying-ground, and as well as I recollect there was a road that led into Savanna.</p>
               <p>Q. In what order were the troops at that time?</p>
               <p>A. They were marching in column, and appeared to be in very good order.</p>
               <p>Q. By what way did you make your retreat from the town of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. After being detained ≈øome time enquiring for my ≈øervant, I retreated over M'Gilvray's creek, ≈øome di≈øtance below the Spring-hill defile.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it pa≈ø≈øable for troops, or otherwi≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. It was by no means pa≈ø≈øable for troops in order, though they might have e≈øcaped that way, as I got over with ≈øome difficulty.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any heavy firing on the troops, when you left them to go into Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. Why did you not retreat by the Spring-hill defile?</p>
               <p>A. I made an attempt to go that way, but hearing a ≈ømart fire, which appeared to be at that place, I was induced to belive the enemy had taken po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and that I was too late.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the country in the vicinity of Savanna abound with waggons and teams?</p>
               <p>A. I believe not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any militia arriving at Savanna from South-Carolina?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; a party commanded by Colonel Bull.</p>
               <p>Q by General Howe. Did you ≈øee me riding to the right of the army, previous to the action of 29th December?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; I ≈øaw you once or twice in the cour≈øe of the day through a wood on the right of the army, and on the ≈øame ≈øide of the ≈øwamp with it.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Gla≈øcock ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time the Briti≈øh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As Lieutenant in the fir≈øt regiment in the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ≈øteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing in that State?</p>
               <p>A. I only know of one detachment ≈øent to oppo≈øe the landing of the enemy, which was from the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia brigade, commanded by Lieutenant Mo≈øeby.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force they landed?</p>
               <p>A. I believe about 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They advanced by the road leading through the centre of the continentals; the only oppo≈øition that was made, that I know of, was the firing of a few cannon, and a ≈ømall flu≈øh that was thrown up in that road that they advanced, in which were two field-pieces.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The South Carolina brigade in front, and part of the artillery in the centre, the Georgia brigade in the rear of the whole, except a field-piece commanded by Captain Defoe.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any confu≈øion in the retreat, and to what was it owing?</p>
               <p>A. There was, and it appeared to me that the confu≈øion was occa≈øioned by the enemy's cannon being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected at the column, and the firing of ≈ømall arms on our left flank.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Georgia troops during the retreat ≈øeparate from the column?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know by what cau≈øe, and by who≈øe orders?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the nature, extent and con≈øequence of the confu≈øion you mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. The Georgia brigade, which I had a view of, were entirely confu≈øed, and the con≈øequence was the mo≈øt part of them were captured.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the di≈øpo≈øitions, in ca≈øe of a retreat, mentioned in general orders previous to the action?</p>
               <p>A. Yes they were, and we were to retreat, if di≈øper≈øed, to the road where the fork leads to M'Gilvray's hou≈øe, as well as I recollect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:017772_0015_0FA2BC4EC1A04A50"/>Q. Was this rendezvous pointed out for the whole, or only part of the army?</p>
               <p>A. For the whole of the army.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the troops ordered to retreat in column?</p>
               <p>A. They were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they continue in good order while the column was pre≈øerved?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any change made in the formation, and if there was, what was it?</p>
               <p>A. The arrangement of the Georgia brigade from platoons to files was a change made by order of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elbert.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the order ob≈øerved after that part of the column was reduced?</p>
               <p>A. Somewhat confu≈øed.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there any halt made by the Georgia brigade after they broke into files?</p>
               <p>A. The rear platoons, of cour≈øe, were obliged to wait for tho≈øe advanced in front.</p>
               <p>Q. Did it occa≈øion any ≈øpace between the two brigades?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the troops go into town?</p>
               <p>A. They did.</p>
               <p>Q. At what place did they go into town?</p>
               <p>A. Near the centre.</p>
               <p>Q. Did they receive any orders to that purpo≈øe that you know of?</p>
               <p>A. None.</p>
               <p>Q. Was any detachment made from your brigade to reinforce the guard at Girardeau's landing on the 28th December?</p>
               <p>A. Only Lieutenant Mo≈øeby's detachment, which I have already mentioned.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Do you know the rea≈øon of the column's being changed from platoons to files, or did you hear General Elbert give any rea≈øon for that manoeuvre?</p>
               <p>A. It appeared to me that the arrangement of the Georgia brigade was changed from the enemy's cannon being directed at the column, and a ≈øhot ≈øtriking near the centre, and immediately an alteration took place, but I do not recollect of ever hearing General Elbert give it as a rea≈øon.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What number of ≈øhot were fired previous to the alteration?</p>
               <p>A. Four or five.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Did you ≈øee General Howe with the Georgia brigade, after that change of di≈øpo≈øition was made?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. At what di≈øtance from the rear of the column do you ≈øuppo≈øe the artillery of the enemy was?</p>
               <p>A. Six or ≈øeven hundred yards.</p>

               <p>The Court met agreeable to adjournment.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Edward Lloyd being ≈øworn informs the Court, that on the 29th December, 1778, ju≈øt as the enemy were approaching, he was reque≈øted by the Major of the regiment of militia to which he belonged to act as Serjeant-Major, and to get the men in order, but previous to that day he acted as a private, and that he knew nothing with re≈øpect to the general di≈øpo≈øition of the army. The Court are of opinion that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in which Lieutenant Lloyd acted on 29th December, would not admit of his knowing any matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting the charges exhibited again≈øt General Howe, and therefore thought it unnece≈ø≈øary to a≈øk him any further que≈øtions on the ≈øubject.</p>
               <p>Mordecai Shefftal ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, at the time that the Briti≈øh troops under the command of Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was, and acted as Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary General of I≈ø≈øues to the continental troops that were there, and Commi≈ø≈øary General of Purcha≈øes and I≈ø≈øues to the militia.</p>
               <p>Q. What quantity of provi≈øions had you on hand on or about the 29th of December, 1778?</p>
               <p>A. About 560 barrels of flour, 150 barrels of beef, 11 barrels of pork, a few barrels of bread, 12 hog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øheads of rum, 2 hog≈øheads of brandy, and a ≈ømall quantity of candles.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you, on or about the 29th of December, made a return or report to General Howe of the quantity of provi≈øions on hand?</p>
               <p>A. On the 25th of December I reported to General Howe that I had a quantity of provi≈øions on hand.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you, on or previous to the 29th of December, receive any orders from General Howe to remove the≈øe provi≈øions?</p>
               <p>A. On the 25th I applied to General Howe, to know whether I ≈øhould remove the provi≈øions. He ≈øaid he thought there was no danger. I told him, I thought there was. He then told me, if I thought proper, I might remove them. I then told him I could put ≈øome of them on board a ve≈ø≈øel on freight. He then gave me an order for a Corporal and four privates, to impre≈øs Negroes to remove them from the ≈øtore to the ve≈ø≈øel. I ≈øet about it, and removed 78 barrels of flour.</p>
               <p>Q. What became of the flour you removed?</p>
               <p>A. It ≈øat off from the wharff to go up the river, but what became of it afterwards I know not.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ≈øee any general orders re≈øpecting the removal of provi≈øions from Savanna, on or before the 29th of December?</p>
               <p>A. I never ≈øaw any.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the provi≈øions you have mentioned been removed ≈øo as to be out of the reach of the enemy, and the landing of the enemy ≈øo retarded as to require a longer ≈øtay of the army near Savanna, had you any means in that ca≈øe to ≈øupply the army?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:017772_0016_0FA2BC4EF4154850"/>A. The Commi≈ø≈øary of Purcha≈øes ≈øupplied me with fre≈øh provi≈øions for the u≈øe of the army, and what quantity he had by him I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Could teams and waggons be procured in a ≈øhort time from the inhabitants, for the removal of the ≈øtores to any i≈øland di≈øtant?</p>
               <p>A. I do not think there could.</p>
               <p>Q. Suppo≈øing the ≈øtores to have been removed by water, could they have been depo≈øited in places inacce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to the ve≈ø≈øels and boats of the enemy?</p>
               <p>A. They could have been ≈øecured for ≈øome time.</p>
               <p>Q. From what authority did you hold your appointment as Commi≈ø≈øary to the continental troops?</p>
               <p>A. From General Elbert, then Colonel Commandant of the troops belonging to that State.</p>
               <p>Q. When you applied to General Howe on the 25th of December, did you inform him that there was a ≈øufficient quantity of ve≈ø≈øels for the removal of provi≈øions?</p>
               <p>A. I told General Howe that there was a number of ve≈ø≈øels at the wharff, if I had authority to impre≈øs them.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Was the flour and beef, ≈øet forth in your te≈øtimony, all continental property?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you roll down to the landing any more than you have mentioned?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; on Monday, the 28th, there were 240 barrels of flour rolled down.</p>
               <p>Q. Were not the mo≈øt of the crafts about town u≈øed by the inhabitants to remove their effects?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot tell.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the Quarter-ma≈øter to procure boats and ve≈ø≈øels to remove the provi≈øions?</p>
               <p>A. No; I know of none.</p>
               <p>Q. When you received orders to impre≈øs the Negroes, were you limited to any number?</p>
               <p>A. I don't recollect that I was.</p>
               <p>Q. Was the ve≈ø≈øel you did obtain loaded?</p>
               <p>A. No; becau≈øe ≈øhe could not have gone up the river if ≈øhe was loaded.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. By who≈øe orders were the 240 barrels of flour (mentioned in your an≈øwer to General Howe's que≈øtion) removed?</p>
               <p>A. By General Howe's order, and by a fatigue-party ≈øent by him for that purpo≈øe.</p>
               <p>Q. Were they tran≈øported by water?</p>
               <p>A. They were not; they were left on the wharff, as the Spaniard who was to have taken them on board ≈øhipped his fa≈øt and ran up the river on the appearance of the ve≈ø≈øels of the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Court adjourned till to-morrow morning, ten o'clock.</p>

               <p>Captain John Budd ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a Lieutenant in Colonel Roberts's regiment of artillery.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what ≈øteps were taken by General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. As there is ≈øuch a length of time elap≈øed, I do not recollect any particular circum≈øtance relative to the di≈øpo≈øitions of the army.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your po≈øt in the column in the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. Immediately in front of the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. What was your po≈øt in the line in the time of action?</p>
               <p>A. On the right of the continentals.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you recollect at what period of the retreat the Georgia brigade quitted the line of march?</p>
               <p>A. I do not recollect at what particular period, but the fir≈øt I ob≈øerved of their being gone was when we wanted them to ≈øupport the field-piece when we arrived on the hill, where one of our hor≈øes and driver were ≈øhot, which was the means of our lo≈øing the piece.</p>
               <p>Q. How far were you advanced in front of the Georgia brigade when the army took up their line of march on the retreat?</p>
               <p>A. About twenty or thirty paces.</p>
               <p>Q. How far di≈øtant from the town was the hill you ≈øpeak of?</p>

               <p>Q. How far was the rear of the South-Carolina brigade advanced in your front at the time you halted?</p>
               <p>A. There were three field-pieces and two ammunition-waggons between the infantry and the field-piece with which I was, and we were as clo≈øe as we could be to the ammunition-waggon when we halted, and the front of the artillery clo≈øe to the rear of the South-Carolina brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Was your piece particularly attached to the Georgia brigade?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know that it was.</p>
               <p>Q. Were there any more field-pieces, be≈øide the one you mention, lo≈øt in the action of that day?</p>
               <p>A. Not belonging to the continental troops.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you fire your field-piece in the line, before the retreat commenced?</p>
               <p>A. Yes; we did fire four or five times with round ≈øhot, at the di≈øtance of 150 paces.</p>
               <p>Q. Had you any grape or ca≈øe ≈øhot?</p>
               <p>A. We had a great quantity of grape, but no ca≈øe.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:017772_0017_0FA2BC50018A0718"/>A. Yes; I ≈øaw you ≈øpeaking to Colonel Roberts immediately on the right of the field-piece with which I was, about mid-way between Spring-hill defile and Fair-Lawn, when Colonel Roberts told us that it was the orders for us to go on as quick as po≈ø≈øibly we could.</p>

               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. As a private.</p>

               <p>Major General Elbert ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the American army when Colonel Campbell invaded Georgia, and in what capacity?</p>
               <p>A. I was, and in the capacity of Colonel Commandant of the Georgia brigade.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long previous to the inva≈øion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the de≈øigns of the enemy, and what ≈øteps were taken by him in con≈øequence?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know that General Howe had any previous information of the de≈øigns of the enemy to invade the State of Georgia. Some time about the beginning of November 1778, being in Charles-Town on bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs of the public, where General Howe then was, accounts were received that Colonel Provo≈øt, with a con≈øiderable force from Ea≈øt-Florida, had invaded that State. I immediately received the General's orders to return to Georgia, where, I think the ≈øecond day after my arrival, I was joined by him, who informed me that he had ordered ≈øome continental troops from the State of South-Carolina to our a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, and that ≈øome militia of that State were a≈ø≈øembling for the like purpo≈øe; the latter, after being ≈øome days in Georgia, returned. Colonel Provo≈øt having retreated before their arrival, part of the continentals ordered from South-Carolina were brought into Georgia, and the remainder po≈øted at Pury≈øburgh. Nearly about the time of Colonel Provo≈øt's inva≈øion, a ve≈ø≈øel arrived at Tybee, and after remaining a day or two ≈øailed again. From this ve≈ø≈øel we had a de≈øerter, who informed that ≈øhe was a tran≈øport with Briti≈øh troops on board, and one of a con≈øiderable fleet that had ≈øailed from New-York to invade the State. Some time the latter end of December, a fleet appeared upon the coa≈øt, and a few days after arrived at Tybee; upon which General Howe drew all the troops of the State and tho≈øe of South-Carolina before-mentioned to Savanna, except a garri≈øon left in the ≈øort at Sunbury, and Colonel Marbury's regiment po≈øted at Augu≈øta. On the 28th De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the enemy's fleet proceeded up the river Savanna, the van of which anchored nearly oppo≈øite Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's, where, from ≈øome of their movements, it was judged they would attempt to land their troops. In the evening of that day I was at the above place with General Howe and ≈øeveral other officers, reconnoitering the enemy. The General, on leaving the place, reque≈øted that I would remain and po≈øt a picquet he had ordered there, and de≈øired that I would order the officer commanding the picquet to cau≈øe the dam leading from the river to the hill to be cut acro≈øs. When the picquet arrived, I po≈øted them in the manner that I thought would be≈øt an≈øwer the purpo≈øe for which they were ≈øent, and gave the officer the orders I had in charge from the General. I then marked out the ground where I judged it nece≈ø≈øary to throw up ≈øome works, and told the officer I would go to the General and try to have his party, which con≈øi≈øted of only thirty men, con≈øiderably reinforced, and at the ≈øame time obtain an order to have ≈øome entrenching tools ≈øent down. I waited upon the General, and informed him that I had every rea≈øon to believe that the enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to land at Girardeau's, and recommended to him to have the picquet there con≈øiderably reinforced, and reque≈øted that he would immediately order ≈øome entrenching tools to the place, as the party was entirely without. I am not certain, but I believe I recommended at the ≈øame time to the General to ≈øend a field-piece or two to the ≈øame place. His reply was, that he would con≈øider of it, and reque≈øted that I would call on him in an hour or two. On my return to the General, at about ten or eleven o'clock at night, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood him that the entrenching tools were ≈øent. With re≈øpect to the reinforcement, he told me that he could not ≈øpare more than 20 men, which he reque≈øted that I would go down with. I did ≈øo, and on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival was ≈øurprized to find that no tools were at the place. It being then too late to obtain them, ≈øo as to be of any ≈øervice, I told Captain Smith, who commanded the picquet, that at day-light I did not doubt but he would ≈øee the enemy landed, and recommended that he would re≈øerve his fire until they got within 50 or 60 yards, then to commence a cool, deliberate fire, and retreat up until he was either ≈øupported or forced from his ground. As I judged it happened, but the party were ≈øoon forced from the hill, when the enemy gained footing a little after day-light, and were the mo≈øt of that day, the 29th, in full view, landing their troops and artillery, without the lea≈øt interruption from us.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. The force with which the enemy invaded the State amounted to full 3000 men. I believe they had about 2000 landed when they advanced towards us.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compo≈øition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. Between 5 and 600 continental troops, and a detachment of artillery with four or five field-pieces, and about 100 militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. The enemy advanced in two columns, their right along a path leading through Sir James Wright's plantation, halting in full view of us at a place called Gay's, their left down the main road leading from Girardeau's to Savanna; while we were amu≈øed by the fir≈øt column in front, the latter filed by their left, along a bye-path leading through the back of Milledge's old field, and acro≈øs a ≈øwamp upon our right to an open pine barren at the back of the new barracks, where they were met by the militia under Colonel Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who, after a ≈ømart ≈økirmi≈øh, were forced from their ground. I know of no other re≈øi≈øtance, except by the picquet at Girardeau's, and the firing of a few field-pieces in the front of our line that was made to the enemy.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017772_0018_0FA2BC52C45E1A60"/>A. Between three and four o'clock in the afternoon of the 29th, the army was ordered to retire in the following order; the South-Carolina troops to retreat fir≈øt to the Spring-hill, and there form and cover the retreat of the artilletry and Georgia troops, the latter to form ≈øomewhere about M'Gilvray's path, and there remain, until joined by the former. Our army was formed acro≈øs the road leading from Savanna to Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's, near half a mile below the town, under a hill of ea≈øy a≈øcent in an open field, with a ravine in front, Tatnall's buildings better than 100 yards on our right, and Governor Wright's barn about the ≈øame di≈øtance on our left, with a traver≈øe acro≈øs the road in our centre with two field-pieces, and a field-piece advanced in front of each wing; on our right was a ≈øwamp, ≈øome di≈øtance up which, at the back of Tatnall's buildings, a path led from Milledge's to town; on this path a work was thrown up, in which was po≈øted a detachment of continental ≈øoldiers, and to the right of this, up the ≈øame ≈øwamp, I under≈øtood the militia were to have been po≈øted. Our left was in ≈øome degree covered by a battery at ≈øome di≈øtance wide of its rear, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded part of a low rice-field not very acce≈ø≈øible. As ≈øoon as the enemy, who were in our front, ob≈øerved the Carolina troops go off the field and our artillery limbered, they moved bri≈økly forward, and commenced a ≈øharp cannonade on the Georgia brigade, which was formed in a clo≈øe column by ≈øections by the left, with the left in front. As ≈øoon as the artillery moved off the field, I faced the column to the right about, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in that order. As we cro≈ø≈øed the road, the enemy's artillery made ≈øome impre≈ø≈øion on the column, notwith≈øtanding which it pre≈øerved perfect good order. Ju≈øt as we gained the ≈øummit of the hill, a heavy fire of mu≈øquetry commenced towards our left, when I perceived our artillery go off on a full gallop. I moved as quick as I po≈ø≈øibly could without getting into di≈øorder. About 100 yards before I got to the ≈øouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ea≈øt extremity of the town, a body of the enemy, advanced to the ea≈øt of the new barracks, commenced a heavy fire of mu≈øquetry on our left flank; at the ≈øame time ob≈øerving the Carolina brigade beyond the ≈øouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we≈øt extremity of the town, in ≈øome di≈øorder, pu≈øhing for the Spring-hill, and a body of the enemy near that place keeping up a ≈ømart fire on them, I judged it too late for me to attempt that defile, as the enemy mu≈øt be in full po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it before I could po≈ø≈øibly reach it. In this ≈øituation, with the enemy in front, flank and rear, I formed the de≈øign of attempting to force my way up the Ogechee road, where I ob≈øerved the enemy's line to be the weake≈øt, and with this view ordered my light infantry to advance and attack the enemy on my flanks, to draw their fire while I reduced the column, and to divert their attention from my main de≈øign. Immediately after the order to the light infantry, as we advanced, I ordered an open column, as ≈øoon as I ≈øaw that there was a proper di≈øtance between the ≈øections, which happened ju≈øt as we were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the burying-ground. I lo≈øt no more time than was nece≈ø≈øary for the following words of command: Halt: Sections, to the left face: By files to the right wheel: March. Before I got the rear well clear of the burying-ground, the line broke about the centre, and the whole, except three or four ≈øections, fell up one of the ≈øtreets. Ob≈øerving the few that followed me, I led them through where a ≈øquare of buildings had but late been burnt down, and halted before the Court-hou≈øe door, which being a brick building, I had thought of throwing my≈øelf into it, but previous to taking this ≈øtep, I determined to con≈øult Colonel Harris, the next officer in command to my≈øelf. I called him to me, and a≈øked if he could recommend any place through which I could effect a retreat? he an≈øwered that we might get over Mu≈øgrove's creek. I ob≈øerved to him that it was a full tide, and that the creek could not be pa≈ø≈øable. He replied that there was a log, which he had been fifty times over. I replied, lead me to it, it is a happy circum≈øtance, we will ≈øave our men; and called out, Follow me, ≈øoldiers, and I will conduct you to a ≈øafe retreat. I heard the words, Follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, frequently repeated; and le≈øt they might not know what I intended, I kept waving my ≈øword over my head, and moved ≈ølowly on at the head of the few that yet pre≈øerved their order, and ≈øent Colonel Harris back to the rear with orders to pu≈øh them on, and de≈øired that he would join me in time before I got to the creek. This he did, but when we got there he could not find the log, owing I ≈øuppo≈øe to the high tide. As the only alternative, I then ordered the ≈øoldiers to ≈øwim the creek; a few obeyed my command, others alledged that they could not ≈øwim. The enemy, who had got po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Spring-hill defile, moved down and kept a ≈ømart fire on us, and, rather than be taken pri≈øoner, I ≈øaved my≈øelf by ≈øwimming, as did Colonel Harris. Major Grimkie, one of the General's Aids, ≈øwam a little above where I did.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lo≈øs in men, cannon and ≈øtores, and by what means were they lo≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. The manner in which the Georgia troops were lo≈øt I have already an≈øwered; re≈øpecting tho≈øe of South-Carolina I can't ≈øay. I believe the number of continental troops lo≈øt that day exceeded 200. One field-piece was taken from the militia, another from the continental artillery, owing, as I was informed, to the driver being killed. Five other long bra≈øs field-pieces not properly mounted, that were removed out of town, with a quantity of ammunition, in con≈øequence of our misfortune fell into the enemy's hands. Several iron pieces, with a quantity of ≈øtores that it was impo≈ø≈øible to move after the enemy made their appearance, were likewi≈øe lo≈øt.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army cro≈øs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu≈øta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. The General informed me of the orders he had ≈øent to the garri≈øon of Sunbury. I don't recollect what they exactly were, but they were ≈øuch as I approved of at the time, and only lament they were not obeyed. With re≈øpect to the orders given to the troops at Augu≈øta I can't ≈øay.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. I believe the whole militia of the State of Georgia amounted to about 3000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the inva≈øion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque≈øted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. About the time of the inva≈øion General Howe was frequently with the Governor, and at that time I am certain the General informed me of every material matter that pa≈ø≈øed between them; but at this time I don't recollect any particulars of con≈øequence, tho' to the be≈øt of my belief he repre≈øented to the Governor, that as many militia as could be collected would be nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the numbers actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:017772_0019_0FA2BC5402C048E0"/>Q. Do you know of any previous di≈øpo≈øitions made by General Howe, in ca≈øe of a retreat?</p>
               <p>A. The general orders before-mentioned, that were i≈ø≈øued re≈øpecting the mode of retreating, if nece≈ø≈øary, may be deemed a previous di≈øpo≈øition. I know of no other.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the militia of the State of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. The militia of the State of Georgia were in general but indifferently armed. Tho≈øe belonging to the town of Savanna I judged to be very well armed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. The town of Savanna ≈øtands on a high ≈øandy ridge, which terminates in a bluff near a mile in extent on the river. This ridge runs backward, upwards of two miles, nearly the ≈øame width, and is a remarkable level open pine-barren. On each ≈øide of the ridge a creek empties into the river, which occa≈øions two ≈øwamps, both of which, rather farther back than the tows, are cultivated, the uncultivated parts are very thickly wooded; that to the ≈øouth-ea≈øt of the town is pa≈ø≈øable in many places; the other, to the ≈øouth-we≈øt of the town, is ≈øcarcely pa≈ø≈øable but where the road runs through it. On the oppo≈øite ≈øide of the ≈øwamp, below the town, is Girardeau's place, a bluff 40 or 50 feet high, and ridge nearly ≈øimilar to that on which the town ≈øtands, with this difference, that the ridge terminates nearly three quarters of a mile from the river, and leaves a remarkably level ≈øwamp, overflowed by every ≈øpring-tide.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the army in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</p>
               <p>A. I don't believe that the army had a proper ≈øupply of entrenching tools, but I am certain that a ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity could have been obtained to throw up works that would have been of ≈øervice.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legi≈ølative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</p>
               <p>A. With re≈øpect to any further applications I don't recollect.</p>
               <p>Q. by the Court. Do you know what rea≈øons operated to prevent the enemy's being oppo≈øed in landing their troops?</p>
               <p>A. No.</p>
               <p>Q. Had the enemy any ve≈ø≈øels of force to cover the landing of their troops?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, and from the di≈øpo≈øitions of tho≈øe ve≈ø≈øels, I judged they intended landing at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. Were or were not the legi≈ølative and executive bodies of the State of Georgia, at different times, frequently applied to by me, both per≈øonally and by letter, to fortify the country at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, be≈øide other mea≈øures ≈øtrongly recommended by me for the general defence of the State?</p>
               <p>A. Yes, I believe they were.</p>
               <p>Q. Did you ever ≈øee any letters of mine to that State for that purpo≈øe?</p>
               <p>A. Some con≈øiderable time before the inva≈øion, I recollect ≈øeeing a letter from you, very fully on that ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, laid before the A≈ø≈øembly, which gave offence; in con≈øequence, as I apprehended, of your attempting to dictate to them.</p>
               <p>Colonel Marbury ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army in Georgia, when the enemy under Colonel Campbell invaded that State?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you act?</p>
               <p>A. I had the command of a regiment, but it was not pre≈øent. The day previous to the 29th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I arrived at Savanna, and acted as Aid to General Howe on the latter part of the day the enemy landed.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know how long previous to the inva≈øion of Georgia General Howe received intelligence of the de≈øigns of the enemy, and what ≈øteps were taken by him in con≈øequence?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know when General Howe received the intelligence, and as I was out of town, do not know what ≈øteps were taken previous to the evening of the 28th December, 1778, when I joined the General about ≈øun-≈øet at Girardeau's. He was then, in company with ≈øeveral gentlemen of the army, reconnoitering the ground, and ≈øpoke of it's being very defen≈øible.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know what force the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. It was generally ≈øaid, and I believe they landed at lea≈øt 2000 men.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the compo≈øition and number of the army under General Howe?</p>
               <p>A. About 500 continentals, with a detachment of Colonel Roberts's artillery, four or five field pieces, and about 100 militia.</p>
               <p>Q. In what manner did the main body of the enemy approach, and what re≈øi≈øtance was made?</p>
               <p>A. They advanced in two columns, one by the path leading thro' Sir James Wright's plantations, the other on the main road leading to Savanna. They appeared in full view at Gay's gate, from a little below which place a detachment filed off, and thro' a thick ≈øwamp gained our right and charged Colonel Walton, who, with about 80 militia and a field-piece, was po≈øted back of the new barracks, and from the enemy's great ≈øuperiority of numbers was obliged to leave the ground, and retreat precipitately after a ≈øhort engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I don't know of any other re≈øi≈øtance made, except a few ≈øhot from the artillery in front of our army, before a retreat was made, and a fire from Captain Smith, who commanded the party at Girardeau's, on the enemy, as they advanced to take po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of Girardeau's hill.</p>
               <p>Q. When, and in what manner did the army retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I was not on the ground when the retreat was ordered; but I think about or a little after three o'clock, as I was going with a requi≈øition from Colonel Walton to the General for troops to ≈øupport him, I met Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe, at the head of the Carolineans, retreating, about half way between Tatnall's and the town. They were then in good order.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the lo≈øs in men, cannon and ≈øtores, and by what means were they lo≈øt?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know the lo≈øs of either, nor can I account by what means.</p>
               <p>Q. When did the army cro≈øs Savanna river, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. On the night of the 30th General Howe reached Treutlan's, which is about 45 miles above Savanna, and ≈øent out to ≈øecure the boats, and began to cro≈øs the baggage on the morning following at the Two Si≈øters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:017772_0020_0FA2BC550A5629F8"/>Q. Do you know of any orders given to the troops at Augu≈øta and Sunbury to leave the State?</p>
               <p>A. After we had retreated to Cherokee hill, about eight miles from Savanna, the General ≈øent Captain Wood with orders to the officer commanding the troops at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, to retreat and join the General. On the next day, or day after, Major Dehey≈øer was ≈øent to Augu≈øta, with orders for the troops ≈øtationed there to cro≈øs the river, and join the continental army wherever they might be.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the number of militia belonging to the State of Georgia?</p>
               <p>A. I think there was about two thou≈øand five hundred men.</p>
               <p>Q. When the inva≈øion of Georgia took place, what proportion of militia was reque≈øted by General Howe of the executive authority?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know the number actually in the field at that time?</p>
               <p>A. I don't know.</p>
               <p>Q. Do you know of any previous di≈øpo≈øitions made by General Howe, in ca≈øe of a retreat?</p>
               <p>A. I do not.</p>
               <p>Q. How far is Milledge's pa≈øs from the po≈øt then occupied by the main body of General Howe's army?</p>
               <p>A. I think it is about half a mile.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the militia of Georgia in general armed, and in what manner?</p>
               <p>A. They were badly armed.</p>
               <p>Q. What is the general face of the country in the vicinity of Savanna?</p>
               <p>A. I am not well enough acquainted with the place to de≈øcribe it.</p>
               <p>Q. Were the army in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of a proportion of entrenching tools to erect works?</p>
               <p>A. I do not know.</p>
               <p>Q. What were the applications made at different times by General Howe to the legi≈ølative and executive authority of the State for means of defending it?</p>
               <p>A. I have heard mention made of frequent applications, but cannot attempt to ≈øay what they were.</p>
               <p>Q. by General Howe. What were the orders given you by me on that day, and other circum≈øtances that pa≈ø≈øed between us?</p>
               <p>A. On the evening of the 28th December 1778, after returning from Girardeau's with General Howe, he reque≈øted that I would collect three or four gentlemen, and patrole the country that night between the ≈øea and Savanna, to ob≈øerve if any of the enemy had landed below, or if any of the country people appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be going to the Briti≈øh ve≈ø≈øels. I did ≈øo, and returned ju≈øt about day-break, and ≈øoon after a firing commenced by Captain Smith at Girardeau's, who was ≈øoon forced from his po≈øt, and it occupied by the Briti≈øh. A little after I returned to town, and about twelve o'clock rode to head-quarters at Tatnall's hou≈øe, in company with Colonel Huger and General Elbert. They informed me that the General had called a council, wherein it was determined to remain on the ground where they were and receive the enemy. Tho≈øe gentlemen informed General Howe that they had ju≈øt returned from reconnoitering the ground on our right, that the ≈øwamp was pa≈ø≈øable, and they did not like their ≈øituation. The General ≈øaid he was not well plea≈øed with it, or words to that purpo≈øe, and reque≈øted tho≈øe gentlemen to take the opinions of the officers who had compo≈øed the council. Some little time after this, the General reque≈øted me to take a view of the ground, and immediately return to him; I did ≈øo, and gave information ≈øimilar to what he had before received. I a≈øked the General if he thought it would be ami≈øs to ≈øend a company to the place where it was thought the enemy would cro≈øs the ≈øwamp, about a quarter of a mile higher up, where there was a ≈ømall brea≈øt-work, occupied by Captain Keith of South-Carolina, with a company of regular troops, I think about 30 or 40. He ≈øaid it was a lucky thought, and reque≈øted me to take the command. Having no other at that time, my regiment being in Augu≈øta, I accepted it chearfully. The General de≈øired me to ride up and look out a convenient place, and he would order up the men. He ≈øent Major Grimkie, his Aid, directly after me, who informed me that the militia under Colonel Walton were to occupy the ground I ≈øpoke of, and that he ≈øhould not ≈øend up any regulars. I then returned to the General, told him that I did not wi≈øh to remain as an idle ≈øpectator, and would be glad he would employ me. He told me to remain with him, and if the enemy advanced I might be of ≈øervice. A little after the enemy appeared in view, and the General reque≈øted me to go up and remain on the right between, and have an eye on the brea≈øt-work and the militia. I went up, and about three o'clock (I think) the enemy appeared, and ≈øhortly after formed on an eminence that the militia had left a little before, and which Colonel Walton attempted to regain, but was too late. The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia appeared in confu≈øion, and could not be reduced to order. A field-piece was fired once or twice in front of the militia, and though the Colonel prevailed on them to advance and gave them three cheers, they were ≈øtill in confu≈øion. I a≈øked him if it would not be nece≈ø≈øary to get a ≈øupport of regulars. He reque≈øted me to ride to General Howe, to inform him of his ≈øituation, that he would maintain the ground as long as po≈ø≈øible, but was afraid he could not do it long without ≈øupport, and reque≈øted the General to ≈øend a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. On my way to head-quarters I pa≈ø≈øed near to the ≈ømall work occupied by Captain Keith, who called and informed me that General Howe had retreated, and a≈øked what he had be≈øt do. I pointed out his route, and advi≈øed him to make the be≈øt of his way, and then came up to General Howe, about half way between Tatnall's and town, at the head of the Carolina troops, who were in good order. I let him know Colonel Walton's reque≈øt. He ordered me back to him immediately with orders to retreat; but when I returned behind the barracks, I found the Briti≈øh on the ground, and the militia flying towards the Spring-hill, about 200 yards before me. I did not ≈øee Colonel Walton again, and never got up with the whole of the militia till they had got over the defile that we had to pa≈øs. There in vain I endeavoured to rally them, and on my return met General Howe about the Spring-hill (the troops were then in great confu≈øion) who immediately reque≈øted me to try again to rally the militia, and was the ≈øecond time as un≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsful as the fir≈øt. By the time I returned, the artillery and troops had reached the Red-Hou≈øe, called M'Gilvray's, near the upper end of the defile, where they halted; and after a ≈øhort time the General ≈øent me to Colonel White, who had command of the galleys and other ve≈ø≈øels laying above Race-Hall, to inform him of our retreat and to order him to move up the river with the ve≈ø≈øels, and when at any advantageous

place to come to, in order to prevent any ve≈ø≈øels running up the river and landing men to cut off our retreat; but at the ≈øame time not to remain in any place ≈øo long, as to endanger the ve≈ø≈øels under his command.</p>
               <p>Q. Where was the militia po≈øted when you fir≈øt ≈øaw them after you were ≈øent to the right?</p>
               <p>A. On a ≈ømall eminence near a branch, at ≈øome di≈øtance from the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Where were they when you went to them the ≈øecond time?</p>
               <p>A. Between that eminence and the barracks.</p>
               <p>Q. Was it a part of the Carolina brigade you ≈øaw when you returned from endeavouring to rally the militia, or the main body?</p>
               <p>A. Only a part.</p>
               <p>Q. What time were you with me before I ≈øent you to the gallies?</p>
               <p>A. I do not believe it was more than a quarter of an hour.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Colonel Ternant was ≈øworn.</p>
               <p>Q. Were you in the army at the inva≈øion of Georgia by Colonel Campbell?</p>
               <p>A. I was.</p>
               <p>Q. In what capacity did you then act?</p>
               <p>A. As In≈øpector to the army.</p>
               <p>Q. At the commencement of the inva≈øion, what ≈øteps were taken by Major General Howe to prevent the enemy landing?</p>
               <p>A. From the 24th of December, when the Briti≈øh fleet fir≈øt entered the Savanna river, to the 29th, when the action took place, the General, with Governor Hou≈øton and ≈øeveral officers of the army, vi≈øited the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places where it was mo≈øt probable the enemy would land. I was pre≈øent at tho≈øe reconnoitering excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions. The landing at Girardeau's was generally looked upon as the mo≈øt likely to be cho≈øen by the enemy, which occa≈øioned di≈øcu≈ø≈øion about the means mo≈øt effectual to prevent them, and in general to counteract their operations. It was generally thought nece≈ø≈øary, and as I under≈øtood agreed on between the Governor and General, to erect a battery on the banks of the river, ≈øo as to prevent the approach of the ≈øhipping to the cau≈øeway, and con≈øequently the enemy's landing and taking po≈øt on the bluff. The fort on Savanna was al≈øo to be repaired and enclo≈øed. The high banks rai≈øed along the river, from Savanna-bluff to Girardeau's cau≈øeway, for the purpo≈øe of watering and draining the rice-fields, were to be broken ≈øo as to overflow tho≈øe fields at high water, and render the whole extent of them, from Girardeau's cau≈øeway to the cau≈øeway in front of the troops on Fair-Lawn, as impa≈ø≈øable as po≈ø≈øible, and the≈øe fields without that prevention were then thought pa≈ø≈øable for infantry by files, tho' not without difficulty. Some other field works were likewi≈øe to be made in the vicinity of the place, extended as a po≈øition for the troops, which then might amount to about 650 regulars and about 100 militia. The means nece≈ø≈øary to make the≈øe field preparations being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the hands of the executive of Georgia, ≈øuch as Negroes, tools of all kinds, hor≈øes and gears for the tran≈øportation of artillery, applications were made by the General to procure them. They were promi≈øed ≈øeveral times in my pre≈øence by Governor Hou≈øton, but never furni≈øhed, any further than by ≈øending three Negroes the 26th in the morning with two tools, and the≈øe went away in the evening of the ≈øame day and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared again. I heard the General many times expre≈øs his complaints about it, and repeatedly ≈øent his Aids, but to no purpo≈øe. The chief command was even di≈øputed him, which occa≈øioned confu≈øion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in every mea≈øure; and how ≈øoon the di≈øpute ended by the Governor giving up the command to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral I can't tell. On the 28th, fix of the enemy's ve≈ø≈øels having come up and anchored oppo≈øite to Girar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deau's bluff, the erecting of any battery on the banks of the river became impracticable; upon which a picquet of 50 men was po≈øted at the hou≈øe on the bluff, with an intention, as I heard the General expre≈øs, to watch the motions of the enemy at that place, and oppo≈øe them ≈øo far as to be reinforced in time, whenever it ≈øhould be a≈øcertained that they really intended to land there. On the 29th, early in the morning, a firing was heard at that place, in con≈øequence of the enemy's landing; upon which the General ordered me there, but before I reached half way, I found that and another picquet retreating. I had collected the whole toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the General joined us, and ordered me to take command of them, and remain on the ≈øpot where we were till further orders. I omitted to ob≈øerve that a mounted militia man was left with the commanding officer of the picquet, to give the earlie≈øt intelligence of the enemy's apparent movements, but who never to my knowledge reported to the General, tho' he was ≈øent in time for that purpo≈øe, as I heard the commanding officer of the picquet ≈øay.</p>
               <p>Q. At what di≈øtance from the main body of the army was the place the enemy landed?</p>
               <p>A. Between a mile and a mile and an half.</p>
               <p>Q. What force did they land at that time?</p>
               <p>A. I under≈øtood, after the action, they landed upwards of 2000 men at that place.</p>
               <p>Q. How many probable places of landing were there in the vicinity of the town?</p>
               <p>A. There were ≈øeveral places above and below the town, who≈øe names have partly e≈øcaped my memory, but which rendered every po≈øition that could be taken with an inferior force in the vicinity of the town, for the purpo≈øe of defending it, exceedingly precarious.</p>
               <p>Q. Were any ≈øteps taken to watch the motions of the enemy at tho≈øe places?</p>
               <p>A. Parties of militia were po≈øted at each of tho≈øe places below the town, and a picquet of 50 continental troops at Girardeau's, as the mo≈øt probable place of landing. The two gallies were ≈øo po≈øted as to watch any movement the enemy could make by the back river, for the purpo≈øe of landing above the town.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the enemy land at any other place than Girardeau's bluff?</p>
               <p>A. Not that I know of.</p>
               <p>Q. After it was known that the enemy landed, what mea≈øures were taken to a≈øcertain their numbers and to oppo≈øe them?</p>
               <p>A. I cannot ≈øpeak to the fir≈øt part of that que≈øtion, further than that I heard the General ≈øeveral times complain he could get no information to be depended on, either about their force or de≈øigns. About three hours after the enemy had landed, I received orders to return to the army with the advanced picquets, who

immediately joined their re≈øpective corps. Two hours before the action a council of war was called of the field officers of the army, and from the uncertainty of the information procured by the General of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and de≈øign of the enemy, and to gain as much time as po≈ø≈øible for the removal of public and private property from the town, it was unanimou≈øly agreed that the army ought to remain on the ≈øpot where they were then po≈øted at Fair-Lawn until the views of the enemy could be known, and their ≈øuperiority ≈øo a≈øcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as to urge and ju≈øtify a retreat. In con≈øequence of that determination, the following di≈øpo≈øition was made and i≈ø≈øued in general orders:</p>

                           <p>THE Carolina troops are to be told off into 16 platoons of eight files each, with the remaining files formed on their right as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by Colonel Huger. The Georgia troops to be formed into eight platoons of ten files each, with the remaining files on their left as light infantry; the whole to be commanded by General Elbert.

Tho≈øe who do not command platoons to fall in the rear of them as bringers-up, the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve order and regularity through the line. Both corps to be formed in columns; tho≈øe of Carolina by platoons on their right, and the others likewi≈øe by platoons on their left, and to remain in that formation, with the light infantry at the head of each column, until further orders. The artillery to remain in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent po≈øition, and to be in the utmo≈øt readine≈øs to move or act as occa≈øion may require. The General reque≈øts and expects that both officers and men will di≈øtingui≈øh them≈øelves by their firmne≈øs and per≈øeverance, and by an exact ob≈øervance of orders. Should they be compelled to retreat, it is to be in the following order. The troops will move off in columns in the order ≈øet forth. The light infantry of Carolina to form the advance guard, to march rapidly by the ≈øhorte≈øt route to the Spring-hill defile, which they will po≈ø≈øe≈øs on both ≈øides and endeavour to maintain. The artillery, all but one field-piece, will follow the Carolina brigade, and Colonel Roberts, when he arrives at the defile, will po≈øt his pieces ≈øo as be≈øt to cover the retreat of the Georgia brigade; Colonel Huger, his men ≈øo as mo≈øt effectually to an≈øwer the ≈øame purpo≈øe, and to ≈øecure the artillery. The Georgia troops will follow their light infantry with a field-piece, forming the rear of the line, and as ≈øoon as they reach the defile this colomn, with the whole of the artillery, will pa≈øs and form on the other ≈øide of it, in ≈øuch manner as the commanding officer ≈øhall think be≈øt to prevent in≈øults from the enemy, and to ≈øecure the retreat of the troops from the head of the defile. Should a root take place, the troops are to re-a≈ø≈øemble beyond the defile at M'Gilvray's road. Further orders are to be applied for, or will be given, as circum≈øtances ≈øhall require.</p>

               <p>I was then ≈øent again to reconnoitre the pa≈ø≈øes through the ≈øwamp on our right, and was accompanied by two militia-men who≈øe names I do not recollect. The principal gap was defended by a ≈øtrong picquet, who≈øe numbers I have forgot, and a redan which occupied the whole ≈øpace of the pa≈ø≈øage. The other pa≈øs was that mentioned to exi≈øt about a quarter of a mile further; I immediately went to vi≈øit it; we attempted three times to go through the ≈øwamp at that place, and upon my guides pronouncing it impracticable we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the troops on Fair-Lawn. The General then ordered me to join a body of militia intended as a further ≈øecurity to his right flank, and to po≈øt them in ≈øuch a manner as be≈øt to an≈øwer that object. I found them drawn up in one rank to the number of ninety-three, with a field-piece, nearly oppo≈øite to the pa≈øs la≈øt mentioned. They being a too great di≈øtance from the ≈øwamp, it was thought be≈øt to advance them clo≈øer to it; but before the nece≈ø≈øary movements could be performed with that irregular body, the enemy's light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry came out of the ≈øwamp, filing off to the right and left, ≈øo as to come on the flanks of the militia, who from that moment would not be prevailed on to make the ≈ømalle≈øt alteration in their actual po≈øition. As ≈øoon as I ≈øaw the enemy from the ≈øwamp, I ordered a mounted militia-man to go and acquaint the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with it. Mean while the field-piece was directed to fire on the thicke≈øt of the enemy, and the militia encouraged to keep their ground, until the enemy by approaching higher would be fired upon and ≈økirmi≈øhed with, ≈øo as to cover as far as in their power the retreat of the troops on Fair-Lawn. As ≈øoon as the enemy, who had performed this angular evolution out of the reach of mu≈øquetry, had arrived to both wings of the militia, they marched bri≈økly, or rather ru≈øhed with great ≈øhouts. The militia, probably ≈øtruck with the ≈øuperiority of the enemy, who amounted to about 700 men, broke without firing, and fled towards the Spring-hill cau≈øeway; a few only fired their mu≈øquets in retiring. Upon this the enemy poured in a heavy fire, and as ≈øoon as the field-piece was ≈øpiked up I attempted to join the continental troops, whom I met about a hundred yards to the we≈øtward of the barracks, retreating in tolerable good order, except tho≈øe of Georgia under General Elbert, who, contrary to the di≈øpo≈øition, had quitted the line of march and gone into the town. I marched with the troops to the defile. Two hou≈øes that ≈øtood on each ≈øide of it were occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied for a few minutes, and when all hopes of the Georgia troops arriving were over, and the enemy pre≈ø≈øing upon us, the troops with the artillery, except one field-piece, got over the cau≈øeway, and made a halt of a few minutes on the other ≈øide of it.</p>

               <p>Major General Howe proceeds in his defence as follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. Pre≈øident, and Gentlemen of the Court,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CONSCIOUS as I am that I have to the utmo≈øt of my abilities endeavoured to ≈øerve my country‚Äîthat from principle I entered into the pre≈øent conte≈øt with the earlie≈øt, re≈øolved not to retire but with the late≈øt, or at lea≈øt not until my life or American grievances had a period‚Äîthat my zeal in the common cau≈øe was equal to any, and that my ardor to promote it could be exceeded by none‚ÄîI little dreamed that I ≈øhould at this day, or indeed on any other, have ≈øtood arraigned at a military tribunal for imputed crimes, which malice would ≈øtrive to magnify and fix upon me, and by which my reputation might, for a time at lea≈øt, be held in ≈øu≈øpence, even by the good. How painfully this mu≈øt affect me, let military ≈øen≈øibility determine: For in a profe≈ø≈øion ≈øo cha≈øte as that of arms, where honor is ≈øo feelingly alive that it mu≈øt ≈ømart and agonize at the lea≈øt ≈øhadow of a≈øper≈øion, expre≈ø≈øion can give no proper colourings to my anxieties; indeed it yields me none, but what, compared to my feelings, would be poor and contemptible. Happily for me, however, I am ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before a Court where Ju≈øtice, with its delicate auxiliary Honor, ≈øit as Judges; a Court where, of all others, had I been guilty, I ≈øhould be mo≈øt appalled at appearing, but by which, con≈øcious of my innocence, I mo≈øt rejoice to be tried. Tho' it would not perhaps be very difficult to ≈øhew that Georgia, as a State, had very little to do in this pro≈øecution, yet, de≈øirous to be ju≈øtified by facts alone, and fearing no ≈øearch, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øearch, tho' malevolence directs the probe, I ≈øhall admit, for the pre≈øent at lea≈øt, that having been mi≈øun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtood by or mi≈ørepre≈øented to the State of Georgia, they have thought proper to bring me where now you ≈øee me. The charges again≈øt me are heavy‚Äîlet us ≈øee how they have been ≈øupported; and though Colonel Walton is not the fir≈øt, yet, as he is the arch evidence upon this occa≈øion, I ≈øhall begin with him, and the more e≈øpecially, as he ≈øo very comprehen≈øively in his te≈øtimony alludes to every charge brought again≈øt me, that remarking upon his evidence will, in a great mea≈øure, do away the nece≈ø≈øity of de≈øcanting upon the re≈øt. He tells you that the Briti≈øh troops from Ea≈øt Florida penetrated Georgia two ways; that they evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected co-operating troops from the northward, which not arriving, they returned. That troops did enter the State in the manner he ≈øays is true; but by what ≈øpirit of divination it was made evident to him that they expected co-operation, and retired for the want of it, I am at a lo≈øs to determine. If circum≈øtances at that time made it evident, tho≈øe circum≈øtances ≈øhould have been declared; or if ≈øub≈øequent events evinced it, every principle of common ju≈øtice, could they have influence upon the Colonel, ought to have impelled him to relate them, that no undue deductions might be drawn from what he ≈øaid in injury to a man by his means on trial for his reputation. It is not however from this in≈øtance alone that I am warranted to ≈øay that he is ≈øeldom explicit, but where he thinks what he ≈øays will condemn me; end throws in ≈øo dubious light every thing of a contrary tendency, that he appears to hope unfavourable inferences may be drawn from it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that until the arrival of the de≈øerter he ≈øpeaks of, which was after the Ea≈øt Florida troops had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, the ultimate end of their views appeared and was believed to be no more than an intention to ravage and lay wa≈øte as much of the State of Georgia as they could, to plunder the inhabitants and drive off the ≈øtock,‚Äîthe latter of much more importance to St. Augu≈øtine than people, unacquainted with its ≈øituation and the precariou≈øne≈øs of its ≈øupplies, would be apt to imagine. I confe≈øs that after-events demon≈øtrated plainly that co-operation was then expected, but as nothing previous exi≈øted to induce the idea, the Colonel ≈øhould have expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in ≈øuch a manner as to have left no po≈ø≈øibility of implication that there did; and this I doubt not he would have done, had ju≈øtice been all that he aimed at. I however ≈øet at defiance the utmo≈øt ≈øtretch of his malice, either within the≈øe walls or without them. He tells you further, that this account given by the man of the tran≈øport was ≈øo much credited, that Doctor Hall and him≈øelf were ≈øent by the Governor and Council to Charle≈øtown to commune with General Lincoln (then either arrived or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) upon the general ≈øituation of the State, and to give him the intelligence brought by the de≈øerter; that I was in South-Carolina when the≈øe advices were tran≈ømitted, and he takes it for granted I had them as early as others, but when or by whom he knows not, or what mea≈øures were taken in con≈øequence; that the time I arrived at Savanna he cannot preci≈øely a≈øcertain, but that it appeared I was not expected, as the Delegates lately arrived from Congre≈øs had reported I was recalled from the department, and General Lincoln was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered on to ≈øupercede me. Come, however, he ≈øays I did, rea≈ø≈øumed the command, gave a≈ø≈øurances that I would defend the town, and that there was little danger. What the Colonel means by the greate≈øt part of this I am at a lo≈øs to determine. I think I may be pretty certain that he does not mean to ≈øerve me by it, and yet I cannot ≈øee how it can operate to injure me. It appears, in ≈øhort, altogether in≈øignificant as to any relative tendency until the latter end of it, when the cloven foot appears in the in≈øinuation that I gave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper encouragement to the inhabitants to ≈øtay in town, that I was not expected, and that the command was a≈ø≈øumed; that is, I ≈øuppo≈øe, though he does not ≈øpeak out, that having been recalled I had no bu≈øine≈øs there. If this be his meaning, I am amazed that a ≈øenior Colonel of a State and Commandant of militia had not, in the cour≈øe of ≈øervice, or by the dictates of common ≈øen≈øe, been taught, that though another General had been appointed to the department. I could not with military propriety leave it until his arrival, and that therefore I could not rea≈ø≈øume what had not been laid a≈øide. I am authorized to ≈øay that in a part of this ≈øtuff, intended by the Colonel for te≈øtimony, he has ab≈øolutely deviated from facts. I had, upon the fir≈øt information of General Provo≈øt's incur≈øion into Georgia, po≈øted to that State, and took the command of the troops on the ≈øouth ≈øide of Ogechee, where the Colonel was, and remained in Georgia till after the 29th of December. This he could not but remember, and upon cro≈øs-examination has confe≈ø≈øed, any more than I can forget that he left me and took off his party in that advanced ≈øituation, though I was very weak in numbers, while the enemy were ≈øtill in the State, and by all accounts no further off than between Newport river and the Altamaha. The Colonel amu≈øes the Court with an account of the reconnoitering parties we

were upon, in one of which he ob≈øerved a large wood which was to have been cut down, but he ≈øays it was never done, and in his manner of expre≈ø≈øing it ≈øeems to imply ≈øome neglect in me. Had the cutting down of this wood been nece≈ø≈øary, which was far from being the ca≈øe, Mr. Walton cannot but know of the repeated applications made by me to his Governor for tools, hands and many other matters, for purpo≈øes of much greater con≈øequence, and that no a≈ø≈øi≈øtance was yielded me; how then this wood was to have been cut down, or how he could expect it to be done, I cannot imagine, unle≈øs he had lately been reading Ta≈ø≈øo, and, as he has talents for romance, might think that, like one of Ta≈ø≈øo's heroes, I could fell fore≈øts with one ≈øtroke of my <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Among other things, he talks of a work at Girardeau's that was nece≈ø≈øary to be erected, but it was never done; of a long narrow cau≈øeway of more than half a mile's length where the enemy advanced, and yet no ≈øteps were taken, and ≈øo on.

The lea≈øt movement that way would have nece≈ø≈øitated me to retreat above them, by which means the town mu≈øt have been left open to them, or, had I remained in or about it, captivity would inevitably have been the con≈øequence.

The enemy therefore would not have been comported to attack us merely by the approach leading directly to the hou≈øe, but might, had I fixed my≈øelf there, have doubled either flank, or embraced both. Any manoeuvre like this would have made our retiring nece≈ø≈øary, and perhaps we ≈øhould have been obliged to do it under fire, and by that means have rea≈ø≈øumed our main po≈øition at Fair-Lawn, in that confu≈øion incident to young troops retreating before an enemy; be≈øides this, the bridge and roads between Girardeau's and Fair-Lawn could not have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

The≈øe were ≈øome of the rea≈øons which governed my conduct upon that day. They will, I flatter my≈øelf, have weight with the Court, and, if they do not convince Colonel Walton, will at lea≈øt invalidate his te≈øtimony. Upon examining this ground with Colonel Roberts, commanding officer of artillery, a gentleman as di≈øtinct in character as in ≈øentiment from the man la≈øt mentioned, a man of abilities in his profe≈ø≈øion, of honor, integrity and benevolence of heart, in whom were united the gentleman and the ≈øoldier, who, knowing the value of reputation in him≈øelf, would have revolted at the idea of wounding it in another, who would have di≈ødained to pro≈øtitute official influence to the vile purpo≈øes of private pique and per≈øonal prejudices, and who, if he mu≈øt re≈øent, would have re≈øented by manly ways; this officer, who has ≈øince nobly fallen in the cau≈øe of his country, from who≈øe fall the ≈øervice has received a deep wound, and of who≈øe lo≈øs I never think but the ≈øigh of anxiety expands my bo≈øom, upon my a≈øking his opinion whether it was eligible to take mea≈øures for a capital oppo≈øition at Girardeau's, expre≈ø≈øed him≈øelf in the ≈øtronge≈øt terms again≈øt it; and though I had re≈øerved my own opinion at the time I reque≈øted his, he gave rea≈øons very ≈øimilar to tho≈øe I have uttered, and added, that he thought a ≈ømart guard, not ≈øo formidable as to make the enemy advert to other landing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places, or to di≈øhearten them from attempting the approach by the cau≈øeway to the hou≈øe, and yet capable of giving them a hand≈øome check, was all he thought nece≈ø≈øary to be done.

the cau≈øeway cut through within fire of the hill. Colonel Ternant has told you it could not be done for want of tools, as after all my efforts, and the efforts of the Quarter-ma≈øter, none were obtained until it was too late. Near this po≈øt evidence demon≈øtrates two guards were placed, and there certainly were others, though no proof has been had of it. Tho≈øe guards were intended by me to an≈øwer a duplicate end; that of guarding the approaches to the main body at Fair Lawn, and to ≈øupport Captain Smith, as occa≈øion ≈øhould make it requi≈øite. I believe it will be thought that as there was a variety of other places to attend to, which required men, that ≈øo ≈ømall a main body as I had could not well ≈øpare, more than what tho≈øe detachments amounted to for any particular purpo≈øe. Two per≈øons, who were well mounted, active, and thought tru≈øt-worthy, were ordered to attend Captain Smith, and he was directed to ≈øend in≈øtant information of the fir≈øt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the enemy to land. One of the≈øe men was accordingly di≈øpatched by the Captain at lea≈øt an hour before the firing began, but he tru≈øted the me≈ø≈øage to a third per≈øon, and went to give notice of the enemy's motions to a relation of his four or five miles off and below the po≈øt; ≈øo that neither the guards in advance or I had the lea≈øt intimation of the enemy's motions until the action commenced, and con≈øequently Captain Smith mi≈ø≈øed of the ≈øupport intended him, and, after behaving with great gallantry, made good his retreat. From hence I think it appears (that though I did not place my whole reliance upon the enemy's landing at Girardeau's, and approaching by the main cau≈øeway, or throw ≈øo large a guard within view of them as ≈øome may think that I ought to have done) that I took mea≈øures to ≈øupport the guard, in order to a more ob≈øtinate re≈øi≈øtance; and as the troops were kept con≈øtantly upon their arms, I ≈øhould have had time, had the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence intended me by Captain Smith reached me when it ought, to have ≈øupported him with the whole of the troops, had the enemy, by confining them≈øelves to the cau≈øeway, made the mea≈øure warrantable.

It was therefore thought be≈øt by me, and by many, not to wa≈øte the men by fruitle≈øs efforts, but to withdraw the guards, and let them join their ≈øeveral corps at the main po≈øition. At this place, in front, the ≈øituation was exceedingly defen≈øible; ≈øo much ≈øo, that had the enemy attacked us there, I think there was every probability that the events of that day had been determined in our favour. I had rea≈øons, which appeared to me ≈øtrong, to induce the belief that they would have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked us in that manner. The road which led to us was wide, and though it had been broken up, ≈øo as not to be pa≈ø≈øable immediately under the command of a field-piece, yet it was done in ≈øuch a manner that it did not appear to tho≈øe in approach till almo≈øt arrived at it. The mora≈øs in front, and the ground on each ≈øide of it, was ≈øo formed, that at a very little di≈øtance the whole appeared level; and as the pa≈ø≈øes on my right had no roads to them, at lea≈øt none that had been u≈øed for a con≈øiderable time, there was a great chance that they might not advert to them. The enemy's own accounts ≈øhew that my hope of their not finding the pa≈ø≈øes and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

The≈øe rea≈øons, joined with the con≈øideration that even the ≈øhew of re≈øi≈øtance on our part might occa≈øion he≈øitation and delay on their's (and half a day or even an hour was precious, as the public and private property was removing) induced me to remain where I was.

Patroles of hor≈øe were ordered to be continually going, ≈øtationary videts were appointed, ≈øeveral private confidential characters, who acted as volunteers upon this occa≈øion, be≈øides two extra Aids-de-Camp, military characters, active, vigilant and well mounted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in evidence to have been employed for this purpo≈øe, be≈øides various other mea≈øures that were pur≈øued. Do not all the≈øe precautions demon≈øtrate that I was painfully ≈øen≈øible how tender our ≈øituation was upon the right? What though I might not have known the exact ≈øpot where je≈ø≈øamines were to be plucked, or no≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gays had been made, I was well informed of the general weakne≈øs of that part on my flank, and though I hoped the enemy might not attempt it, yet I took every method to be informed of it if they did; after which I never meant to remain on the ground a moment, as my conduct as well as the te≈øtimony given in evinces. The pa≈øs the enemy availed them≈øelves of was ≈øo remote on my right, that I thought I ≈øhould have had time to retreat without lo≈øs, ≈øhould they endeavour to pa≈øs it. Careful as I was, I have my doubts that the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not ≈øo early as I might have expected. In ≈øaying this, I do not mean to reflect upon any of tho≈øe individuals who undertook to look out that way. They were re≈øpectable characters, with every ability and de≈øire to ≈øerve the cau≈øe; but it is po≈ø≈øible for accident ≈øometimes to occa≈øion an enemy to elude the greate≈øt vigilance, and if a moment was lo≈øt, I am convinced it mu≈øt have ari≈øen from accident alone. A party was detailed for this pa≈øs, and Colonel Marbury was to have commanded it. I have it much to ≈øorrow for, that any innovation took place. That re≈øpectable, ≈øpirited officer would not have po≈øted his party near the barracks, and far in the rear of the troops, but would have ≈øtationed them where they ought to have been, directly on the ≈øpot they were intended to guard; by which means, if all other vigilance had failed, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between him and the enemy would have announced their approach many minute ≈øooner than the firing that did happen gave it me. But if it was criminal in me not to know this pa≈øs, what ≈øhall be ≈øaid of him who undertook to guard it for me, and yet took po≈øt remote from it. Colonel Walton declares to the Court, that Colonel Marbury delivered him an order from me to attack the Briti≈øh light-infantry, and relates, not indeed that he obeyed the order, but theatrically de≈øcribes his ≈øituation and the enemy's. I do not recollect, and think I may a≈ø≈øert that no ≈øuch order was ever ≈øent him. If it was, can that memory, which appears to be ≈øuch a faithful regi≈øter of trifles, not be impre≈ø≈øed with the name of the per≈øon who brought the order; and ≈øtranger ≈øtill it is that the Colonel ≈øhould believe, or at lea≈øt a≈ø≈øert, that Colonel Marbury was the per≈øon
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017772_0026_0FA2BC5C67CE8958"/>
who delivered it. But the deep groves and flowery bowers the Colonel had ≈øtrayed into, in company with fair dam≈øels, had awakened in his imagination a ≈øpirit of Chivalry, and, like Knight-Errants of old romance, becomes his province, and his relations are as extraordinary as any thing in Amadis of Gaul, Pari≈ømus and Pari≈ømenus, the Fairy Tales, or any other books of that ≈øort. The ≈øimilarity however breaks in this, that tho≈øe fables have morals, while morals in the Colonel's fables are left out. Colonel Walton, in that part of his evidence which relates to the detaching of ≈øo many of the militia-hor≈øe, by the turn of his expre≈ø≈øion, and ≈øome volunteer explo≈øions of fancy which have not been made a record of, but which through the whole of his te≈øtimony he has been too apt to let off, appears to blame me for tho≈øe detachments. They were however di≈øpo≈øed of to the be≈øt of all u≈øes our ≈øituation would admit of, that of watching the various approaches which called for attention, and which our numbers could not guard. The Colonel one would think is a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky; for where he wi≈øhes to condemn he contributes to acquit, and where he means to commend he cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures‚Äîhis friend≈øhip by this means becomes more dangerous than his enmity. I am in another place accu≈øed, in the Colonel's te≈øtimony, of retreating without ≈øending him notice of it. Notice, however, was a≈ø≈øuredly ≈øent him, and was repeated by Colonel Marbury. It was not, I dare ≈øay, received, becau≈øe proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Colonel's retreat began fir≈øt, or ≈øo early after me that the me≈ø≈øenger might not have been arrived. Colonel Marbury mentions that one of the continental picquets had received no orders when he ≈øaw it. This picquet had been put under the orders of Colonel Walton, and I believe he ≈øent directions to it to retire; but, ab≈øtracted from this, Major Porter was di≈øpatched to call off the picquets, and has told you that he did do it. As I had rea≈øons for wi≈øhing the picquets to remain on the ground a ≈øhort time after the troops moved off, Major Porter might not have got to them when Colonel Marbury ≈øaw them, who, having been de≈øired to have an eye on the picquets, acted with his u≈øual propriety in ordering that picquet off. The di≈øpo≈øition for the day is before the Court, and mu≈øt ≈øpeak for it≈øelf. I flatter my≈øelf it makes provi≈øion for every proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contingence, and that it will bear the in≈øpection of any military eye. From that it appears that I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the army to retreat in column, as it ≈øhortened the line of march, and threw the men more in the countenance of their officers; that they were to proceed by the ≈øhorte≈øt route to the Spring-hill defile; ≈øo that I could not have the lea≈øt idea of their going into town. That this order of march and the route laid down was not or could not be pur≈øued was a misfortune to me indeed, but ought not to be imputed to me as a fault. My friend General Elbert has ju≈øtified me as to never having given any order for it, and ju≈øtified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf by a recital of the accidents which compelled him to deviate from the di≈øpo≈øition. That de≈øerving officer and my≈øelf have lived in a cour≈øe of friend≈øhip for a length of time, and in ≈øituations critical and intricate have ≈øeldom upon military matters differed in opinion. His a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and advice have laid me under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, and his ≈øpirit and abilities have ≈øerved his country. Having omitted ≈øomething relative to the ≈øituation at Girardeau's, I beg a moment's indulgence of the Court to revert to it. As mo≈øt rice-fields in that country can at times be laid under water, it may appear ≈øtrange to ≈øome, upon a ≈øuperficial view, that Girardeau's fields were not put in that ≈øtate. I had this once in object, and examined the flood-gates, but found mo≈øt of them ≈øo out of repair that they would not keep in the tides; and if they could, as tho≈øe vents are ≈øituated by and empty them≈øelves into the river, they would have been under the enemy's command. Had tho≈øe objections however been out of the que≈øtion, the winds which had prevailed for ≈øeveral days made, as was u≈øual to tho≈øe winds, ≈øuch low tides, that until the afternoon of the 29th the lands could not have been overflowed. Mr. Wereat's evidence proves this fact. I have confe≈ø≈øed that I ordered the garri≈øon at Sunbury to evacuate the fort, and I will add that I was ≈øo anxious to have it done, that my fir≈øt order was written with a pencil, on hor≈øeback, in the field, and on the retreat. Fearful that this order might mi≈øcarry, and ≈øtill anxious for the fate of the garri≈øon, upon a halt we made about eight miles from town, I, in another letter more explicit in its content, repeated the order for evacuation, and directed, that if the ≈øtores could not be removed they ≈øhould be de≈øtroyed, and the cannca ≈øpiked. This letter, and another to the ≈øame purpo≈øe not an hour afterwards, were di≈øpatched by officers. Some, if not all, were received, but the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor who commanded there delayed obeying the order until he heard from me again, in con≈øequence of which he and his party fell into the enemy's hands a few days afterwards. How this order, had it been wrong in it≈øelf, ≈øince it was not obeyed, could contribute to ≈øacrifice the capital and the State, let tho≈øe who framed the charge explain. I think it appears plain that nothing very erroneous in my conduct has happened, when, notwith≈øtanding a ≈øtrong de≈øire to have me cen≈øured, charges ≈øo futile and ill-grounded are exhibited again≈øt me. It would have been horrid in me to have ≈øuffered a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Had I done ≈øo, and been arraigned for that, I ≈øhould have ≈øtood in this pre≈øence with very different ≈øen≈øations than now I do; nor would I ≈øo ju≈øtly have incurred the cen≈øure of my own heart to plea≈øe the executive authority of the whole world, though every individual which compo≈øed it had been a Colonel Commandant of Militia. Major Lane, who commanded the fort, had recently been in it ≈øecond in command, when an attack upon it by the enemy had been gallantly repul≈øed. The Magi≈øtrates and citizens of the town, hoping to defend it again, ≈øolicited, implored, and be≈øet him to remain in it. Combined with the≈øe, he was in the bloom of youth, in the hey-day of blood and ≈øpirits‚Äî<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

All the≈øe prevailed upon him to delay an execution of his orders, and he had his puni≈øhment in his fault. The cro≈ø≈øing of Savanna river very early after the retreat I have al≈øo confe≈ø≈øed. Some of the rea≈øons that operated upon me mu≈øt be my defence; half of them, I pledge my≈øelf, will be a ≈øufficient ju≈øtification. The gallies and ve≈ø≈øels with private and public ≈øtores had been ordered to Pury≈øburgh, and had arrived; the river at that place was ≈øo narrow that they mu≈øt have been lo≈øt, had they been attempted even by infantry alone. Be≈øides this, all Carolina, as yet uninjured, was open to the enemy, and no inroad by land more eligible to them than Pury≈øburgh; the battalions in that State were reduced by the expiration of enli≈øtments to a ≈ømall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; the bulk of its militia lie remote from the ≈øea, and are not to be collected upon a ≈øudden emergency ≈øo ≈øpeedily as is to be wi≈øhed; the whole country between Pury≈øburgh and Charles-Town lay expo≈øed to the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of the enemy, and was much nearer to them than Augu≈øta; indeed, had they lo≈øt no time in Georgia,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:017772_0027_0FA2BC5C78A51940"/>
but by a rapid movement had made Charles-Town their object, I think, in the then ≈øituation of affairs, their pro≈øpects of carrying it were very probable. The≈øe circum≈øtances, and ≈øome others, combined to make me pre≈øs my arrival at Pury≈øburgh, after three or four days ≈øtay at the Two Si≈øters, during which time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears I was not negligent of the inhabitants. Before I had cro≈ø≈øed the river my≈øelf, tho' mo≈øt of the troops were over, General Lincoln arrived on the other ≈øide, and ≈øent for me. Had it been proper to proceed to Augu≈øta, we were as near to it from thence as from the ≈øide I had left, and the General no doubt would have adopted the mea≈øure; but matters ≈øo plainly pointed out to him the nece≈ø≈øity of ha≈øtening to Pury≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, that the troops were ordered to march by dawn of day, and we had but ju≈øt got to that place when advanced parties of the enemy appeared on the oppo≈øite ≈øide of the ferry, which demon≈øtrated the rectitude of the mea≈øure of arriving there as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible. The≈øe rea≈øons, if they ju≈øtify at all, will have force as to call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the few troops that were at Augu≈øta; and the≈øe General Lincoln, who≈øe prudence is not to be doubted, would likewi≈øe have remanded, had it been requi≈øite. Colonel Walton told the Court in ≈øome part of his evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I gave a≈ø≈øurances to the inhabitants that I would defend the town. By this it would appear, if you take it ≈øingly, as he no doubt would have you to do, that I had pledged my≈øelf to the people at all events to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, lulling them thereby into a ≈øtate of ab≈øolute ≈øecurity, and by that means inducing them to remain with their effects. Upon further examination, however, the≈øe a≈ø≈øurances, even by his own account of them, amount to no more than my ≈øpeaking of the compo≈øition of the enemy's troops, in a way which might in≈øpirit tho≈øe who heard me to exert them≈øelves in defence. It was not ≈øurely my province to di≈øpirit a people who≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance I wanted, both for their ≈øakes and my own; but certain it is I mentioned to many of the inhabitants the removal of their goods as a cautionary ≈øtep for fear of accident, and this I think may appear from Mr. Wereat's evidence. I recommended it more than once to the Governor, who≈øe duty it was to advi≈øe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants upon this head, and I am con≈øcious I have nothing to accu≈øe my≈øelf of upon this occa≈øion. This al≈øo I ≈øhould have mentioned ≈øooner, and I beg the excu≈øe of the Court for not having done ≈øo; but in ≈øuch a farrago of evidence as the Colonel's, where facts are ≈øo few, and ≈øo wrapped up in beliefs, ≈øuppo≈øitions and opinions, no wonder if one or two of them ≈øhould e≈øcape being unfolded. Mr. Sheftall, the Deputy Commi≈ø≈øary General of I≈ø≈øues, has been brought by the pro≈øecutors to prove upon me, as I ≈øuppo≈øe, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the public ≈øtores. I have ever had a favourable opinion of Mr. Sheftall as an hone≈øt man, and from the te≈øtimony of ≈øuch I knew I had nothing to fear; his evidence therefore is in my favour. Many mea≈øures however were pur≈øued, that Mr. Sheftall might have had no knowledge of. It was in the Deputy Quarter Ma≈øter General's department to provide ve≈ø≈øels and carriages for the removal of ≈øtores. Colonel Wily, who filled this office, was a man of rank, character and activity. He was directed to, and I am ≈øure did pur≈øue every method to obtain them, both by him≈øelf and a very active Deputy, Doctor Wadden; but their efforts were in vain. The ve≈ø≈øels at that time at Savanna were either the property of private individuals, or in their employment. On board of the≈øe, as it is natural to ≈øuppo≈øe, the inhabitants were crouding their effects, and the≈øe ve≈ø≈øels by civil means could not be obtained. I might indeed, by dint of bayonet, have tumbled out of the ve≈ø≈øels both the people and their effects; but humanity, honor and con≈øcience militated again≈øt it. I have warred to pre≈øerve civil rights, and pride my≈øelf in the thought that I have never violated them. But had I been ≈øo dead to every ≈øen≈øe of feeling, ≈øhould I not have been liable to the actions of each of tho≈øe I had injured, and who would, who ought to have indemnified me? A ve≈ø≈øel, as appears, was at la≈øt procured, capable of receiving the ≈øtores, and a party was then furni≈øhed (and it would have been u≈øele≈øs to have done it before) to move the ≈øtores to the wharff; but the ma≈øter of the ve≈ø≈øel, alarmed a long while ≈øooner than he need to have been, ran away with the ve≈ø≈øel and left the ≈øtores behind. It appears in evidence, that upon the inva≈øion of Georgia from Ea≈øt Florida I gave it, as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible, my per≈øonal aid; that I ordered on a body of continental troops, which ≈øoon followed; that militia likewi≈øe upon that occa≈øion were to come in from Carolina. Before the≈øe were collected, the troops from Ea≈øt Florida had retired; but upon the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence given by the de≈øerter from the tran≈øport of an intended inva≈øion under Colonel Campbell, they were not countermanded, but arrived in Savanna. They came about the middle of December, and were after ≈øome time di≈ømi≈ø≈øed, I know not why, by the Governor of Georgia. It has al≈øo been given in evidence, that I reque≈øted of the Governor of Georgia all the militia he could collect. It appears al≈øo to the Court, as I flatter my≈øelf, that every circum≈øtance which had a claim to my attention received it, and particularly that on the retreat I paid every po≈ø≈øible attention to the men. Some di≈øtance on the retreat I halted until the whole were pa≈øt me, and a better organized column I have ≈øeldom ≈øeen even upon parade. Ju≈øt at this time, I had intelligence that a party of Briti≈øh were ≈øeen coming down the Ogechee road, a good way beyond the barracks. Upon this I galloped to where General Huger was, and ob≈øerving that this body of the enemy, though at a con≈øiderable di≈øtance, ≈øeemed ha≈øtening to po≈ø≈øe≈øs the Spring-hill defile, I de≈øired General Huger to proceed there, ≈øee in what manner Major Wi≈øe, who had been ≈øent there with a party and ordered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the pa≈øs to the la≈øt man, had po≈øted them, and, if he thought more men requi≈øite, to reinforce the party with the advanced guard of the line, or take off as many platoons from the head of the column as he ≈øhould think proper. Directly after this I was returning to the rear, but when I came to the artillery found the troops that I left in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Upon this I ≈øent orders to the troops in front to ha≈øten their march for the defile, and directed Colonel Roberts to pre≈øs on the artillery, as I was anxious for its fate, as its rear was now in air. When I came to the defile, I found General Huger had po≈øted the party to my entire ≈øatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that gallant officer offering to head it, I accepted his offer, and told him I would remain with him. We ≈øtaid ≈øome time there under a pretty ≈ømart fire, hoping that the troops mi≈ø≈øing, or ≈øome part of them, might arrive; but being informed by ≈øome per≈øon who came out of the town, that he ≈øaw them going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Yamacraw, and as the Carolina brigade with the artillery had entirely pa≈ø≈øed the defile, and was ≈øome di≈øtance on their retreat, all object for remaining there cea≈øed, and we retired to the other end of the pa≈øs, where again we made ≈øome ≈øtand, after which we halted no more until we reached Cherokee-hill. What more could be expected of me I am at a lo≈øs to know. The reputation of a man is in great danger of ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, at lea≈øt for a time, when pro≈øecutions are commenced again≈øt him under the au≈øpices of a State.

to think him ≈øo, and perhaps the conclu≈øion is commonly ju≈øt. If characters in general are in this way vulner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, military characters in particular are much more obnoxious to the wound. There exi≈øts in republican governments a jealou≈øy, perhaps laudable, of men of the ≈øword. The glare of the character excites the envy of the vulgar, and as the gallantry of the profe≈ø≈øion ≈øeems to elevate tho≈øe who adopt it above the common level, men feel a malignant happine≈øs in pulling them down. If this be a fault, it is a fault in human nature, which, though it may bear hard upon individuals, is not perhaps without its ≈øocial benefits. It may ≈øoften that haughtine≈øs, but too apt to infect the minds of military men, and make them correct that de≈øpoti≈øm of temper, which a long habit of being implicitly obeyed is but too apt to induce, fix in their remembrance the relation they bear and the duty they owe to civil ≈øociety, and e≈øtabli≈øh in them a courte≈øy of conduct to their fellow-citizens (which might otherwi≈øe for≈øake them) when they reflect that even their favorite mi≈øtre≈øs, Fame, is enjoyed upon the precarious tenure of retaining the good-will of the people. The right in States, however, to cen≈øure and arraign is a prerogative of a delicate nature, the dignity of which con≈øi≈øts in a very ≈øparing and very judicious u≈øe of it‚Äîand hard is the fate of that man, again≈øt whom a State ≈øets it≈øelf.‚ÄîWhether he be right or wrong‚Äîit is not but upon the mo≈øt palpable certainty of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerving it, that they ought to do it. Hard, however, as it is, it is the duty of every man to ≈øubmit. It is a tax he owes to the public, which, though he pays with anxiety, he ≈øhould pay without murmuring. This is more particularly incumbent upon military men, who, upon every occa≈øion, ≈øhould demon≈øtrate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity that they have not ≈øunk the idea of a citizen in that of a ≈øoldier. Actuated by ≈øentiments like the≈øe, I now pay my tribute to the State of Georgia, in full confidence that the events of this trial will prove to them, that I faithfully whil≈øt with them, to the utmo≈øt of my abilities, ≈øtrove to fill the mea≈øure of my duty both to them and the common cau≈øe, and that where malice and mi≈ørepre≈øentation have prevailed upon them to cen≈øure me mo≈øt, I lea≈øt of all have de≈øerved it at their hands. I was very early in this conte≈øt impre≈ø≈øed with a ≈øen≈øe of the great importance of the State of Georgia to the common weal. It was this conviction of their worth, joined to the true re≈øpect and good-will I bore them, that made me ≈øo often pre≈øs upon them the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of taking mea≈øures to place them≈øelves in a ≈øtate of defence. It was this which made me point out to them, in the ≈øtronge≈øt expre≈ø≈øions I was ma≈øter of, that, affailable as they were at a variety of places, they were at none prepared for defence; that while other States were exerting them≈øelves to be in the be≈øt po≈ø≈øible ≈øtate of ≈øecurity, they remained ≈øo unprepared, that they ≈øeemed to invite an attack; that, de≈øtitute as they were of arms, ammunition, military ≈øtores and implements of all kinds, they ought without lo≈øs of time to exert them≈øelves to obtain them; that their internal re≈øources not being very great, and the a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from other States too remote upon ≈øudden emergency to be had in time, that they ought therefore to put them≈øelves, by works, in a ≈øituation to maintain their country until collateral aids could be called in, and that all idea of expence ≈øhould be lo≈øt in the importance of the object. This I reiterated upon them, as their records will ≈øhew, and have it much to lament that I reiterated in vain. Colonel Walton could have told you this, for he was of the body to which I ≈øpoke it, and candour ≈øhould have exacted of him at lea≈øt to have told it to the admini≈øtration, which, after his liberation from captivity, he had the ingenuity to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate; but it was not popular to inform them of the fatal apathy which pervaded the former Legi≈ølatures, in which he him≈øelf had no incon≈øiderable ≈øhare. The State of Georgia laboured under peculiar di≈øadvantages. The climate was thought much more unfavourable to exotic con≈øtitutions than it really was. The govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had originally been military, con≈øequently not congenial to liberty. A number of men of liberal ≈øentiments were therefore di≈øcouraged from re≈øorting there, and though it contained at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

A number of the≈øe had been appointed to places of honorary or pecuniary emolument under the crown, and mo≈øt of them, as has been common in other States, withdrew them≈øelves when the conte≈øt waxed warm. From the ≈øelect few that remained, their civil and military officers were appointed, who, by a fatal clau≈øe in the con≈øtitution of the State, were rendered inelegible to any ≈øhare in their Legi≈ølature. By this means, not ≈øo great a choice of characters as was to be wi≈øhed remained, and many floated into notice who had otherwi≈øe remained out of view. A number of the≈øe, however innocent, were totally unconver≈øant in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, and ≈øo were liable to be fa≈øhioned by the crafty and de≈øigning. Thus a Gwinnet, a Truitland, a Hou≈øton and a Walton became their Governors; thus de≈øign and ≈øelf-intere≈øt became the ruling principle of admini≈øtration; and thus I became an object of per≈øecution. The thunder however, as I under≈øtand, ≈ølept until Mr. Walton awakened it. For tho' a government had been ≈øet up ≈øome months before he came out, yet not one word of complaint, I believe, had officially been heard of again≈øt me. This government, it is true, had not been con≈øtitutionally e≈øtabli≈øhed; becau≈øe ≈øo many of the Repre≈øentatives of the State had evacuated it, that the numbers ≈øet forth by the con≈øtitution as adequate to the choice of a Pre≈øident and Council could not be collected. Tho≈øe, however, who remained, alarmed by the enormities which for want of government were daily committed with impunity, thought them≈øelves warranted by nece≈ø≈øity to deviate from common rules, and therefore met and elected public officers. The per≈øons cho≈øen were men of real patrioti≈øm; and feeling a reluctance to a≈ø≈øume powers not con≈øtitutionally ve≈øted in them, they forebore proceeding to executive operations until mo≈øt, if not all, of the people of the State had ≈øanctified their nomination, by reque≈øting to be governed by them. Some time alter this, Mr. Walton returns from captivity, and though this government was progre≈ø≈øing fa≈øt to its periodical di≈ø≈øolution, even that ≈øhort time was too long for a man of his ≈øtrong a≈øpirations after power to wait. A few members of A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, much le≈øs than the number which ≈øet up the other Governor, were therefore by ≈øome means got together, and Mr. Walton is elected Governor, and other public officers nominated. Thus two admini≈øtrations actually exi≈øted at one moment in the ≈øame State, a phoenomenon in the world of civil policy almo≈øt as much to be wondered at, as if two Suns appeared at the ≈øame time in one firmament in the natural world.

They were labouring under the pre≈ø≈øure of di≈øtre≈øs, were made ≈øore by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of war. It was natural for them to enquire into the origin of their misfortunes. It would not have been popular or ≈øafe to let them recollect, that ≈øome of the very men they had inve≈øted with authority had been leading men in all the mea≈øures of the State precedent to its misfortunes; that they had been dead to every ≈øen≈øe of danger, or criminally negligent of every means of averting it, and this notwith≈øtanding the mo≈øt animated and pointed applications to them to fall upon mea≈øures to place their country in a ≈øtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and for want of which it at la≈øt fell a melancholy ≈øacrifice. To prevent this recollection, it became nece≈ø≈øary to divert their attention to another object, and who ≈øo convenient as him who had been the military commander of the department? He was a thou≈øand miles ab≈øent from the ≈øcene of accu≈øation, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently could not defend him≈øelf. He had no connexions of con≈øanguinity or affinity to take his part, was an alien to the State, and mo≈øt of the friends he had obtained in it in cour≈øe of acquaintance were ab≈øent as well as him≈øelf. He therefore was proper game to run at, and it was determined to hunt him down. Per≈øonal prejudices in one of the leaders ≈øtimulated al≈øo to this mea≈øure, ≈øo that ≈øelfi≈øh policy and inveteracy united in the chace. Hence has per≈øecution been let loo≈øe upon me, and every method tried to ruin my fame. The embers of time have been raked up, to ≈øee if no ≈øpark of error was to be found, that the breath of malevolence might puff it into flame. After three long years have pa≈ø≈øed by, I am called to trial for actions, when the motives of many of them might have been forgotten by my≈øelf. In ≈øhort, every mea≈øure has been pur≈øued to immolate my reputation upon the altar of malice; but I tru≈øt, I know it has been tried in vain. Had I, in ≈øo early a period of the war, committed any military error in judgment, my zeal in the common cau≈øe, and my unabating efforts to promote it, would have induced any man, to who≈øe bo≈øom the lea≈øt ray of candour could find its way, to ca≈øt a veil over the mi≈øtake. To the ≈øervice of my country, I glory in having devoted my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf. Six years have clap≈øed, and, a few weeks excepted, I have never a≈øked or accepted one moment's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs from ≈øervice; for to ≈øervice I have ≈øacrificed all other con≈øiderations, however intere≈øting, endearing or heart-felt they might have been. Should illiberal minds cen≈øure me for being too much of an egoti≈øt in ≈øaying this, let them be taught that there are occa≈øions which warrant a man's ≈øpeaking of him≈øelf, and that my enemies have involved me in this predicament. The length of time that has pa≈ø≈øed ≈øince the tran≈øactions happened for which I am under trial, though a great, is not the mo≈øt capital di≈øadvantage I ≈øu≈øtain. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident has deprived me of many of my official papers; and many, not thinking they would have been u≈øeful to me, have been de≈øtroyed by my≈øelf. I feel the want of them mo≈øt ≈øeverely on this day. They would have e≈ø≈øentially elucidated many parts of my conduct through the cour≈øe of a command, in various circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances intricate, critical, perplexing and vexatious. But above all, I lament the ab≈øence of a Secretary and an Aid de Camp, who, having lived with me long in uninterrupted intimacy and confidence, were acquainted with the minutiae and aggregate of my conduct; had been with me often in Georgia, and re≈øided there with me for months at a time; copied all my orders and official letters; knew with what earne≈øtne≈øs I ≈øtrove, and what ≈øacrifices I made to avoid any conte≈øt with the executive of that State; and that ≈øuch was my regard for civil rights, that I never did by military exertion, what with ≈øafety to ≈øervice could be done by the authority of a con≈øtable. This indeed may not be ≈øo immediately nece≈ø≈øary to my defence again≈øt the matter with which I am charged; but, trained as I have been in republican principles, the reverence I bear to civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to which it is my pride and plea≈øure to be ≈øubordinate, makes every appearance of conte≈øt with it a matter wounding to my happine≈øs, and I ≈øhould have been glad, ≈øince conte≈øt did happen, to have ≈øhewn that I could not avoid it. The evidence now, Mr. Pre≈øident, and my defence are gone through: the re≈øult is with you and the Court. I have to thank you, and through you the Court al≈øo, for your attention to me during a trial, made longer than it need to have been by a number of untoward accidents. I flatter my≈øelf, that very little of the delay that has happened can be imputed to me. A day or two excepted, when I was truly too indi≈øpo≈øed to attend you, I can accu≈øe my≈øelf of none. On the part of the Court. I am glad to bear te≈øtimony of the happy blend of candour and ≈øtrictne≈øs, with which through the whole of this trial evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences have been examined, and in which the dignity of a Court Military ≈øo much con≈øi≈øts.
