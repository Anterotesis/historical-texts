            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE worthy Author of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excellent Diſcourſe, putting it into the Hand of a young Man, who deſired Leave that it might be made publick, for the Benefit of all his Brethren, that would read it, the pious Author conſented unto the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of it, if I would uſher it into the World with a prefatory Line, to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004293_0003_10040E0BCC06EB20"/>
excite People to improve it, which I readily do; earneſtly deſiring, that all our ſea faring Friends, and all Others that ſee this Treatiſe, might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded immediately, to make ſure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout giving themſelves unto the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Redeemer, according to his holy Covenant of Grace, and ſtrive conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to live, as becomes them that are given to the Lord, by the Grace of Chriſt, praying without ceaſing, for Grace, to ſail apace forward unto the Haven of eternal Bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>And, my Friends, be thoroughly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, to conſider about the Affairs of your precious immortal Souls. Be not like them that ſleep as on the Top of a Maſt in the midſt of the Sea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to roll off and drop down into everlaſting Burnings, but keep in Mind the awful Demand of our Saviour, <hi>What is a Man profitted if he ſhall gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul.</hi> Frequently and ſolemnly renew the Dedication of your ſelves unto the Lord, and often examine how Things are between God and your own Souls, and pray always with all Prayer, both

in ſecret alone, and in private with your Company, Day and Night, and read in the holy Bible every Day. And omit no Duty until God ſend a Storm, to excite you to it. Keep al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Love and Fear of God; and realize to your ſelves, that the Lord ſees you every where. Be not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without being aſſured, that you are where God would have you to be. Remember all the Rules on all the Points of the renowned <hi>Fla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and ſtrive daily to be advancing in your Courſe towards the heavenly Haven. But be ſure to rely on the glorious Redeemer, for the Influences of his holy Spirit, for the carrying of you forward. And, that you may do ſo, ſeriouſly and frequently peruſe the ſavory Advice in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that has been compoſed and publiſhed with an earneſt Deſire of your eternal Benefit. Read it over and over, and ſtrive to practice it daily better and better; and be aſſured the glorious Lord knows how you improve it, and will reckon with you for it, as a choice Talent, that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted you with. O ſtrive to be able to give a good Account about your

benefiting by it. Our ſeafaring People are ſome of the moſt ſerviceable of our Neighbours; and we ſhould be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for their beſt Good. Who more than Sailors and Soldiers, do carry their Lives in their Hands? Therefore they need the Prayers, the Cares, the Helps, and the beſt Endeavours of all their Friends for their Good. They are deſtitute of many Advantages that Others do enjoy: They are ſometimes a long While without the publick Worſhip of God. And 0 that <hi>Private,</hi> and <hi>Secret,</hi> and <hi>Sabbath Religion</hi> were more minded than I can learn, they generally are, among our ſeafaring Friends; that they may have more Ground, than I fear they have, to hope to enjoy the gracious Preſence of God with them.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh that thoſe young Men that might live at Home comfortably would conſider ſeriouſly, whether the Enemy of their Souls may not be driving them, when they are mightily hurried, to run away to Sea. Does
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004293_0006_10040E180E15F118"/>
not their Enemy drive them to Sea, that he may more eaſily drive them to Hell? But as for them that muſt go to Sea, I wiſh they would all follow the Counſels in the following Treatiſe, and make ſure that they have the gracious and favourable Preſence of God with them. and let them always remember that awful Advice and Warning in 2 Chr. 15. 2. <hi>The Lord is with you, while you be with him;If ye ſeek him he will be found of you, if ye forſake him he will forſake you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, may the beſt of Bleſſings be on the Souls of all our ſeafaring Tribe, and on him, that firſt deſired the Publication of this beneficial Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and on all that aſſiſted the Publication and on all the ſerious Readers of it. And may the godly Author be bleſſed in his Perſon, his Family, and his Flock: And may he ſtill more and more be a rich Bleſſing, not only unto thoſe, over whom the Holy Ghoſt hath made him an Overſeer, but alſo unto many more of the Choſen of

God. And may he finiſh his Courſe with Joy, and help abundance of Souls into everlaſting Joy. So wiſhes the unworthieſt of Sinners.</p>

               </gap> exceeding weighty, and incomparably precious. And tho' it is but very meanly handled, yet if you read the following Eſſay, with ſuitable Diſpoſitions of Piety, you may meet with ſuch Hints, as(by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God) may be of greater and more laſting Service to you, than the Riches of both Indies. They will be really ſo, if hereby you are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perſwaded to comply with the goſpel Terms of Reconciliation: Upon which, you may be well aſſured of the divine Preſence and Favour in all your Ways. Yea, God himſelf will be your Portion, Shield, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Reward. And then nothing ſhall be wanting that is good for you, for God is all in all. Are you weak? He is Strength. Poor? He is Riches. In Trouble? He is Comfort. Sick? He is Health. Dying? He is Life. Have you nothing? He is all Things. Whatſoever is ſuitable to your Nature, or convenient for you in every Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, that God is. Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is great, or pleaſant, good, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to make Men happy, that God is. <hi>Summum ac univerſale Bonum.</hi> An im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and univerſal Good.</p>

               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004293_0010_10040E24485BBD70"/>But tho' the tender Mercies of God are over all his Works; and the vileſt of Men, in this World, are refreſhed with the common Fruits of the divine Benignity; yet the Good, which I would here recommend to you, is no common Thing. God, it's true, as to his Eſſence, is ubiquitary; and his Providence is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually extenſive with his Works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Matth. 5. 45. <hi>He maketh his sun to riſe on the Evil and on the Good, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Rain on the Juſt and on the Unjuſt.</hi> But it is only ſome Men, and ſome Angels that he is preſent with in a Way of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace and Favour. This is that great, that comprehenſive, and ineſtimable Good which I would plead with you to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, above all Things whatſoever. With it you can't be miſerable, and without it you can't be happy. It is certainly a Pearl of great Price: The wiſe Merchant will readily part with all for it, This, this will ſteer your Courſe, and fill your Sails, be to you an unerring Compaſs, and never ſailing Pilot. If therefore you love your ſelves, your Bodies, your Souls, your beſt Intereſts, either temporal, ſpiritual, or eternal. Venture not to weigh your Anchors, nor to holſt your Sails, till you have Ground to believe that God will go along with

you. Repent therefore of all your Sins without Delay, cloſe with the bleſſed Jeſus, upon the Terms of the everlaſting Goſpel, and yeild up your Souls to the forming Hand of the bleſſed Spirit: That the Kingdom of God may be ſet up within you, even that Kingdom which is not Meat and Drink, <hi>but Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Rom. 14. 17. And then you need not doubt of God's gracious and ſpiritual Preſence, for he never will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his own Palace. That you might be directed and aſſiſted in making ſure of this incomparable Good, and ſo your Father's God be your God, and the Guide of your Youth, is next to the Glory of my Maſter, the Deſign of the following Eſſay, its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put into your Hands. For this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore I recommend it to the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Father of Lights; and you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an Inheritance among all them which are ſanctified. And ſo wiſhing you a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Voyage, by the Will of God, and a ſafe Return. I remain.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004293_0015_10040E3390BB8DD8"/>As the Loyaliſt's in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of <hi>Abſoloms</hi> Conſpiracy. told King <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 3. <hi>Thou art worth Ten Thouſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>and of us</hi>: He being the Head, and in ſome ſort Heart, from which all Intellectual and Vital Inſfluences flow, ſo it might be ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſidered in his publick Capacity, he was worth an Hundred Thouſand of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and by Conſequence the Preſence of God with him was of very great Importance, inaſmuch as the Divine Preſence with the governing Head of a People or Sociery of Men engaged in any hazardous Enterprize, may be as extenſive and beneficial as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and Vital Influences of the Head and Heart are to the Body Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no doubt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But the main Thing aim'd at in this Eſſay, is not to conſider the bleſſed Fruits of the Divine Preſence in ſuch a limited Senſe, tho' the Words read would very naturaly lead me to it, but to diſcover, and improve upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and vaſt Conſequence of the Divine Preſence with a Perſon or People, any

Body or Society of Men, even in the moſt common Concerns of Life; but eſpecially in Enterprizes, attended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger. The Engagments of which will, no doubt, be the ſolicitous Concern and Study of every pious and devout Soul; thoſe eſpecially that have the Care ot Others, as well as themſelves; as <hi>Moſes</hi> had of the whole Congregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſince the Words under Conſideration, need no other Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but what may be very naturally and methodically attended, in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Parts of the enſuing Diſcourſe. I ſhall without any further Remarks, proceed to a Conſideration of the main and principal Thing aim'd at, which may be expreſſed in this</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>THat, ſince the Preſences of God in all the Concerns of Life, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially thoſe that are attended with peculiar Hazard and Danger, is of vaſt Conſequence to the Children of Men. It ſhould be the ſolicitous Concern of

all, as it is of every pious and devout' Soul, to eng ge the Preſence of God with them in all their Undertakings.</p>
            <p>Indeed the Caſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> in our Text and Contex was extraordinary; he had therefore the greater Reaſon to be ſolicitouſly concerned in engaging the Divine Preſence and Favour with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and People. Nevertheleſs, ſince the Preſence md Favour of God, and that only, can make every Circumſtance of Life pleaſant and profitable and fill our Sails with the refreſhing Gales of Proſperity, in thoſe various Enerpriſes wherein we embarque in this preſent World of mutability, therefore both Dury and Intereſt, if we are not forgetfull of our God and ſelves, will certainly fill us with an earneſt Concern for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's Preſence in all our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, hightened in proportion to the Hazard and Difficulty attending thoſe Enterprizes we are engaged in.</p>

Univerſal Nature feels the Effects of it in rhe Supports which the Almighty JEHOVAH affords to all Creatures, by which they are kept from relapſing into a State of Non-entity: And the Government which he exerciſes over them; by which they are led to their deſigned Ends: Some in one Way and ſome in Another. The moſt inconſiderable Orders of being, in the Creation, with all their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, are under the Influence of God's providential Preſence; none ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as to be paſs'd over with neglect: But Angels, Men and Devils,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004293_0026_10040C86E236E558"/>
are in a peculiar Manner ſo, God having made them reaſonable Creatures, capable of a moral Agency, and ſo placed them under the Government of a Rule, reſpect vely ſuited to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and therefore will be their Rule of Judgment in the great Day;</p>
            <p>Here, then it may be our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to obſerve.</p>
            <p>That whilſt God is providentially preſent with ſome in a way of Favour, he is ſo with others in a way of Wrath and Diſpleaſure. He is preſent with the Devils in Hell: How? In a way of Wrath and Diſpleaſure; they are in his Chain, at his Beck and Command, under the dreadful Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of his Anger, reſerved to the Judgment of the great Day. This is likewiſe the Caſe of thoſe damned Souls who are now in the Dark and gloomy Hades of Infernal Miſery. And thus God will he eternally preſent with the Damned in Hell; not only to keep them in Being, by his Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenency, but to execute on them the fierceneſs of his Anger, holding them up with one Hand, whilſt he ſmites

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, beyond Expreſſion: For in his Favour there Lite; but add to this, the dreadful Impreſſions of his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſence, and then conſider Is it not a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10 31. Both theſe I preſume may be implied in that awful Scripture. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. <hi>When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that knew not God and that obey not she Gospel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the</hi> PRESENCE <hi>of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return from this D'greſſion, to our Earth. God is not always providentially preſent here, with Men, in Ways of Favour: ſometims in a Way of Anger and Diſpleaſure, by viſiting them with conſuming Judgments. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>When mine Enemies are turned back, they ſhall fall and periſh at thy Preſence,</hi> ſays David. And accordingly by a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick

Spirit, prays for the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Gods Enemies <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 2. <hi>As Smoke is driven away, ſo drive them away; as Wax melteth before the Fire, ſo let the Wicked periſh at the Preſence of God.</hi> Thus the old World periſhed at the Preſence of an angry God. Thus, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and thoſe City which God overthrew in his Anger and in his Wrath, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 20. 16. Thus the <hi>Egyptians</hi> periſhed in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> through the angry Preſence of an Holy God, who in that Inſtance of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Enemy, pleaded the Cauſe of his People, being preſent with them in a Way of Favour. And thus God is many Times preſent in the midſt of Sinners to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them, even in this Lite. It would be eaſie to produce remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Inſtances hereof, over and above what have been mentioned, both by Sea and Land. Indeed there is a vaſt Difference between <hi>Chaſtiſements</hi> and <hi>Judgments,</hi> in the Principle from whence they flow, and Deſign upon which they are ſent, tho' materially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they may be very much alike: The Principle from whence Chaſtiſements flow,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004293_0029_10040E66410BCAB0"/>
is, <hi>Divine Love</hi>: And the End for which they are ſent, is the Good of the Afflicted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12 6, 10 Tho' the ſame ſort of Afflictions may be ſent upon ſome as Chaſtiſements, and upon others as Judgments and Fruits of God's Wrath; hence, that of <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 9. 1. <hi>No Man knowerh Love or Hatred, by all that is before them.</hi> So that God may be preſent in a Way of Grace and Mercy, with a Man, or Number of Men, when they are under afflicted Circumſtances. And on the other Hand, God may be preſent in a way of Wrath, when he gives Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners their Deſires, but in Judgment as as he did to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 15. <hi>He gave them their Requeſt, but ſent Leanneſs into their Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, God may be ſaid to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentially preſent with a Perſon or a People in a way of Favour when he compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them about with outward Bleſſings, ſmiles upon, and proſpers their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings in the World; ſo that the Bleſſings of Life flow in very plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them, as the Darlings, or peculiar Favourites of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

            <p>This brings me to ſpeak ſomething of God's gracious and ſpiritual Preſence. This is not common to all, but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to ſome only. Such are they who belong to God, and are redeemed and ſanctified by the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Having ſet up his Kingdom within, he preſides, rules and reigns in the Heart. And being Lord of Providence, orders all their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Temperal Affairs in a Way of Mercy. If infinite Wisdom ſees that Proſperity in this World ſhall be best for them; That, no doubt, ſhall be their Portion If Adverſity be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, God will be preſent with ſuch to ſupport them under, give them a ſanctified Uſe of Trials, and in the proper Seaſon to deliver them out of all their Diſteſſes.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It ſhould be the ſolicitous Concern of all, to engage the Preſence of God with them in all their Undertakings.

            <p>But, paſſing thoſe Remarks, I ſhall but a little more than mention Two Things under this Head, which may ſerve to diſcover how neceſſary it is, That every one ſhould be ſolicitouſly concerned to engage the divine Preſence, which is of ſo great Conſequence, to

the Children of Men, and as power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Motives put us upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If you don't endeavour with a proper Concern to engage the divine Preſence, you can't reaſonably expect any thing but to miſs of it. <hi>If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God be will caſt you for ever,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9.

No Safety, or real Proſperity, can reaſonably be expected in any Deſign, without the ſpecial Preſence of God.

            <p>Wherefore, let thoſe that are going from us, to do Buſineſs upon the great Deeps, be prevailed with, to make it their great Concern, to get God to go along with them, in a Way of Mercy, Grace and Favour.</p>

            <p>What I ſhall offer by way of Counſel and Direction, may be reduced to Two general Heads.</p>

Take head, and beware of Sin, all Sin, Sin of every Kind; thoſe Sins eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, to which you are moſt expoſed in your Calling and way of Life.

of Temptation; for if we run into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, we have little Reaſon to expect that God will preſerve us from the power of it.

            <p>Keep as much as you can out of the Way of Temptation. But inaſmuch as the World is full of Temptations, and your Buſineſs may ſometims neceſſarily, and unavoidably lead you in the Way of thoſe that are very ſtrong and powerful.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be always upon your Watch and Guard, and ſee to it that you are well fortified within, being forwarned, get your ſelves well Arm'd to withſtand all the Aſſaults that, ſhall be made againſt you from one Quarter or another: That ſo, nothing you meet with, may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a ſteady Walk with God, or turn you out the Way of Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get, and maintain, a tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: A ſeared, ſtupid Conſcience ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders a Man an eaſie Prey to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

When the Soul has no lively Seaſe of the Evil of Sin, one of the moſt powerful Reſtraints is broken: And little, if any Thing, beſides Shame remains to prevent a ready Compliance with forcable Temptation; for where there is no lively Senſe of the Evil of Sin, Fears of Divine Wrath will in ſome Proportion abate, or rather will not be lively and operative, and as to Shame, which has a very conſiderable Influence upon a modeſt and virtuous Diſpoſition; it preſently loſes its Force, when the Practice of Vice and Sin becomes ſaſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable. So that a ſtupid Conſcience is not only a Token of the Divine Withdrawings; but that which lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expoſes a Perſon to the power of Temptation and Sin. This diſcovers the Importance and Neceſſity, in this Cafe, of a lively and tender Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Every Day before you go into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, or engage in Buſineſs, renew your Covenant Obligations to God by ſolemn Acts of Devotion; not only recommend your Perſons and all your Concerns to the Conduct, Protection and Care of Almighty God, by ſolemn and ſervent Prayer; but therein renew your own

Covenant Bonds, to be the Lords, in all your Ways, ſaying as <hi>David Pſalm</hi> 116. 16. <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thy Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid.</hi> Therein ſincerly rſolving to have a due Reſpect to all God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Awe of ſuch freſh and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Dedications of your ſelves to God and his Service, if duely performed, will have a very powerful Reſtraint upon you to keep you from Sin, and be a mighty Incentive to Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At all Times, maintain a realizing Belief, of the all-ſeeing Eye of your great Judge, which is always upon you. A firm Belief of the Divine Omniſcience, in order to future Judgment, would certainly have a mighty Awe upon our Spirits, not only to make us ſerious and diligent in Duty, but watchful againſt Temptation. <hi>Beer-lahai roi,</hi> The Name which <hi>Hagar</hi> gave to the <hi>Well,</hi> where God appeared unto her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 14. was much to the Purpoſe: It ſignifying, <hi>The Well of him that lives and ſees me</hi>: For ſhe ſaid, Verſ. 13.—<hi>Thou God ſeeſt me.</hi> This certainly would be a very ſeaſonable and ſerviceabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by Temptation, to cenſider, That the Eye of that God, who lives for ever, and will one Day be our Judge, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and that he will call us to a ſtrict Account in the Day when the Secrets of all Hearts ſhall be made manifeſt. Will a Man venture to break the Law in open Court, or affront the Judge to his Face?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Exerciſe your Tho'ts much upon ſuch Subjects as may have a Tendency to take away the Force of thoſe Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, you do, or are moſt likely to meet with. Such you may meet with abroad in the World, as will endeavour not only to draw you into the Ways of Vice and Wickedneſs, by the pleaſant Baits of Pleaſure and Profit; but to fright or banter you out of all Virtue, Religion and Goodneſs, by their angry or reproachful Treatment: But let none of theſe Things which you may meet with, move you from the Line of Duty. Are you reproached and abuſed by vile Men because you refuſe to run into the ſame exceſs of Riot with others? And it maybe, branded with much more diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Names than <hi>Preciſian, Puritan,</hi> or <hi>New England Preſbyterian</hi>; if theſe can
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004293_0073_10040F0CB4E0BE40"/>
be called diſhonourable, as they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly eſteemed by ſome; yet, regard if not, but conſider that the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience with the Comforts flowing therefrom, and the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your great Judge in the laſt Day, will incomparably, more than make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for all ſuch Abuſes, and the Pains you may take in maintaining your Integrity.</p>
            <p>Whereas, on the other Hand, if you are banter'd out of your Innocency, and frighted into a mean and ſervile Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the vicious Humours, and wicked Practices of Others, you may expect to be filled with very uneaſie Reſlections upon your ſelves, at the beſt, to have your Hearts broken with the Sorrows of Repentance, otherwiſe, to be eternally reproached, affrighted and diſtreſſed with whole Armies of errors in the Place of the Damned, under the the dreadful Impreſſions of the Wrath of God. And as to the Pleaſures and Profits of the World, are they preſented to you, in the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Appearance, to corrupt your fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dility and tempt your from your Duty, conſider, that by a baſe Compliance
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:004293_0074_10040CEEAB882A40"/>
with the Temptation, you'll forfeit the Gains of Godlineſs, the unfullied Glory and durable Riches of God's heavenly Kingdom; And ſo be baniſhed eternally from the Preſence of God where there is fullneſs of Joy and Pleaſures for ever more. <hi>Wherefore my Son, if Sinners en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thee, conſent thou not, if they ſay Come with us, let us lay wait for Blood, let us lurk privily for the Innocent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe: Let us ſwallow them up alive as tbe Grave; and whole as th ſe that go down to tbe Pit: We ſhall find all precious Subſtances, we ſhall fill our Houſes with Spoil: Caſt in thy Lot among us, let us all have one Purſe: My Son, walk not thou in the Way with them, refrain thy Foot from their Path,</hi> Prov. 1. 10.—15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Have your Hearts ever lifted up to God for Grace and Srength to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, reſiſt and overcome Temptation. The Caſe may be ſo circumſtanced, that you may have a great deal of Reaſon to ſay as <hi>Jeboſaphat</hi> did in another Caſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>O our God, wilt thou not Judge them? For we have no Might againſt this greatCompany that cometh againſt us: Neither know we what to do, but our Eyes are upon thee.</hi> God only can

give you an happy Victory over the World, bruiſe <hi>Satan</hi> and all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments under your Feet for you; and ſave you from the Power of Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Truſt in him at all Times.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Second Particular, be always upon your Watch and Guard, and ſee to it, that you are well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified againſt Temptation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suffer no Luſt or vicious Paſſion to reign in or rule over you. If Sin reigns in your mortal Bodys and you obey it in the Luſts thereof, no Wonder if God withdraws his gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Preſence from you.

Wherefore get rid of every Luſt and vile Paſſion, elſe you'll forfeit and loſe God's favourable Preſence, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, be laid open and expoſed to all manner of Evils, both here and forever,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take beed and beware of a <hi>Laodicean Lakemurmneſt</hi> in Religion: A Spirit

            <p n="5">5. Let not your Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the World be raiſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſuitible Dependance upon God. God is to be acknowledged in all our Ways, and therefore our Dependance, for Direction, Safety, and Succeſs in all our Undertakings, ſhould be upon him: Otherwiſe we ſhall caſt Contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the God of all our Mercies; and provoke him to leave and forſake us.

            <p>This brings me to the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head of Counſel and Direction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Do what in you lies to engage the gracious and favourable Preſence of God with you, in all your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings. Certainly this is well worth your while, if what you have heard, concerning the Neceſſity and Benefit of the Divine Preſence be true, as undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly it is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Be ſure to make your Peace with God, before it is too late; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without any Delay. Sin has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly made a Breach between God and you. A fearful Breach! And you can never enjoy God's gracious Preſence,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004293_0078_10040CF5514B1020"/>
untill this Breach is made up, by an happy Reconciliation. <hi>For how can two walk together unleſs they be agreed?</hi> Amos 3. 3. Be perſwaded then to take the Advice of <hi>Eliphaz</hi> Job 22. 21. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint now thy ſelf with him, and be at Peace, thereby Good ſhall come unto thee.</hi> In order hereunto, comply with God's own Terms of Peace, as they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Goſpel of Peace. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of, mortiſy and forſake all Sin, which is the Cauſe of God's Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with you: And accept of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the great Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, upon his own Terms, as your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt and King. Make ſure of our Union to him, and then all is well. <hi>For he is the Son of God's Love, in whom the Father is well pleaſed.</hi> Matth. 3. 17. And therefore if united to him, he will be well pleaſed with you in him. And then you may be aſſured that he will never leave vou nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake you. But if you continue in your Enmity to, and Diſtance from God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being encompaſs'd about with the Bleſſings of his Preſence, as with a Shield; an angry God will purſue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004293_0079_10040F2A9E4E5CA0"/>
Don't then procraſtinate or delay any longer in this important Concern. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, 2 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Behold now is the accepted Time: Behold now is the Day of Salvation.</hi> It is gone into a Proverb, That To-morrow is a new Day: But To-morrow has no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and it may be never will with you. Prov. 27. 1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of To-Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> It may bring forth thy Death, and then where art thou, if thy Peace be not made with God? This Evening all Things may be ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well, a pleaſant Gale, a clear Sky, and no Sign or Token of Danger, but before Morning you are foundred in the Deeps; and then what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your poor Souls, if you are in ill Terms with God? O, they'll ſink, ſink, ſink eternally in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Abyſs of Divine Wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take God for your God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and with the utmoſt Sincerity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote your ſelves to his Grace and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, making it your great Concern to walk anſwerably. It may be you have been given up to God, in Baptiſm: And by a ſolemn Profeſſion of Religion,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004293_0080_10043E538AEB74B8"/>
have owned the true and living God for your God; this is all well if you have done it aright; but don't reſt in what you have done: Make frequent and freſh Surrenders of your ſelves to the Grace and Service of God, And having opened your Mouth unto the Lord take Care to pay your Vows, by an agreeable Conduct and Converſation, remembring what the wiſe Man ſays, Eccl. 5. 4. 5. <hi>When thou voweſt a Vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no Pleaſure in Fools; pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better is it that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, than that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vow and not pay.</hi> It has been the Practice of good Men, when they have taken in Hand any weighty Enterprize, to bind themſelves to God by a ſolemn Vow, in order to engage his Preſence and Bleſſing. Thus did <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28. 20. 21, <hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>vowed a Vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this Way that I go, and will give me Bread to eat, and Raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my Father's Houſe in Peace: Then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> And who can ſay that ſuch a Thing would be unlawful at this time o'<hi>Day.</hi> To be ſure it is
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004293_0081_10040CF8F8CA8748"/>
our Duty, in a moſt ſolemn Manner, to enter into Covenant with God, and then to walk anſwerable thereunto, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, there is good Ground to hope for the divine Preſence and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. God will be with his People and Children in Covenant, <hi>ſhewing Mercy to Thouſands of them that love him and keep his Commandments.</hi> Exod. 20. 6. For as <hi>David</hi> teſtifies, Pſal. 103. 17. <hi>The Mercy of the Lord is from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to Everlaſting upon them that fear him: And his Righteouſneſs unto Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Children,</hi> (Ver. 18.) <hi>To ſuch as keep his Covenant; and to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Commandments to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In all your Undertakings let the Honour and Glory of God be your laſt End. That certainly is a Precept of univerſal Influence and Obligation, which is written in 1 Cor. 10. 31. <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</hi> This ſhould be our Mark in all our Undertakings; and the Purpoſe to which we improve all our Time and Talents, endeavouring to advance the Honour and Glory of God in all our
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004293_0082_10043E5C13889C40"/>
Ways, and then we need not fear but that God will honour us with the Bleſſings of his Preſence, for he hath ſaid, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Reſign up your ſelves to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Care and Keeping; and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have your Perſons diſpoſed of and your Circumſtances ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God's Pleaſure, therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and adoring the Wiſdom and Sovereignty of God's Providence. A Soul thus reſigned and given up to God, has no Ground to queſtion the Fulfillment of thoſe Promiſes of God, wherein he has engaged his Preſence and Bleſſing to his People and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; through all the Viciſſitudes of changeable Time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Bear upon your Minds the moſt grateful Reſentments, of all the ſignal Diſcoveries of God's gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Preſence, you have been bleſs'd with; whether as to Temptations, by ſtrengthening you againſt them, and making way for your Eſcape; or, as to extraordinary Dangers, by appearing in

the Mount of Difficulty, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſeaſonable Salvations for you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In what Way ſoever, whether by Sea or Land, God has appeared for you, in a ſignal Manner, don't forget it, but give God all the Glory of it. Let the Remembrance thereof fill your Hearts with Gratitude, and furniſh you with Arguments of Praiſe and Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God. This will not only fit you for, but be a Pledge and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Aſſurance of God's gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Preſence with you for the Time to come.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Maintain and keep alive the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs, both in your Hearts, and Practices. Wherever you go, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Sea or Land, be ſure that you have the Power and Principle of the Spiritual and divine Life within; exemplified, in an agreeable Practice.

            <p>I have heard there is a Saying that paſſes among ſome of our Seamen, in theſe Parts of the World, that when they go off to Sea, they leave their

For it is vital Piety, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs, and that only, that will engage the gracious and favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſence of God to go along with you. Leave this behind and, in a Senſe, you leave God too. For though he is eſſentially preſent every where, yet not in a way of Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>

Prayer. See to it then, that you improve this precious Priviledge: by doing your Duty, in this particular Article of it. Are any of you engaging in any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous Enterprize? Going from us, to do Buſineſs upon the Seas, and in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countries, with an agonizing Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity plead for God's gracious and favourable Preſence. Saying as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Text, <hi>If thy Preſence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</hi> This certainly is a Matter of the laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence in all your Undertakings. For if God be not with us, our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are deplorable beyond Expreſſion. But if his Preſence go along with us we need not fear any Evil. Pſal. 121. 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>The Lord is thy Keeper: The Lord is thy Shade upon thy right Hand. The Sun ſhall not ſmite thee by Day; nor the Moon by Night. The Lord ſhall preſerve thee from all Evil: He ſhall preſerve thy Soul.

            </p>
            <p>Thus I had Thoughts of concluding, but I ſhall add one Word more by Way of Improvement.</p>

Is the gracious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Preſence of God of ſuch vaſt Conſequence to the Children of Men, as we have heard, Then certainly we ought to be concerned for Others, as well as our ſelves; that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Bleſſings of the divine Preſence. Tho' Charity begins at home, yet it is not to terminate there. We are bound to love our Neighbours as our ſelves, and accordingly to ſeek their Good; which we can in no way ſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually conſult, as by doing what in us lies, to engage the gracious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Preſence of God with them in their various Ways and Concerns. Hence in Proportion to the nearneſs of our Relation to them, and the Intereſt we have in them, our Concern for their Enjoyment of this comprehenſive Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, ſhould be increaſed: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they are engaging in any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize that is peculiarly hazardous and difficult. Since the gracious and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Preſence of God is the Summary of all Bleſſings, that can be wiſhed for here; what greater Good can Parents ſeek for in behalf of their Children? which are Parts of themſelves, than this, that God may go along with

them, wherever they go, either by Sea or Land; and compaſs them about with his Favour, as with a Shield.</p>
            <p>Give me leave then, to offer two or three Words of Counſel and Advice to thoſe Parents, whoſe Children are going from them to do Buſineſs in many Waters. You deſire, certainly you do, that the Preſence of the Lord JEHOVAH might go along with them in ſo hazardous an Enterprize; well then, Do what in you lies that it may be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſt not till you have good Ground to believe, that Chriſt is formed in their Souls. Travel in Birth again for them, that they may be born again of Water and the Spirit, and ſo become new Creatures, being created anew in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works; and then you need not queſtion but that God will go along with them. They are his Children as well as yours; and he will not leave them, nor forſake them, but watch over them Night and Day, in Storms as well as in Calms, in ſtrange Lands as well as in their own Country, when they paſs through

the Waters God will be with them, and through the Rivers, they shall not overflow them, when they walk thro' the Fire, they ſhall not be burnt; neither ſhall the Flame kindle upon them. If Chriſt be formed in them, <hi>neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor Powers, nor Things preſent, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, ſhall be able to ſeperate them from the Love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Rom. 8. 38. 39.</p>

            <p n="3">3. See to it, that your own Hearts be right in the Sight of God, and be faithful in his Covenant. This will not only afford you good Ground to hope for the Preſence of God with your own Perſons, but you'l have, upon this Account, a great deal of Reaſon to expect that God will be with your Children: You'l be better able to plead his covenant Promiſes on their Account: and with a comfortable Aſſurance of divine Care, to reſign them to the ſure Mercies of that Covenant, which (God hath commanded to a thouſand Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?, <hi>of them that love him and keep his Commandments.</hi> Deut. 7. 9.</p>
